00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.220
We're supposed to be the best goddamn country in the world. Is the best we can do? I call bullsh*t.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.820
Alaska leads the nation in sexual violence. It is the national epicenter.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.100
He kidnapped her. He tricked her. And he sexually assaulted her.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.980
Don’t be silent anymore.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.260
Because women – Alaska Native Women – our Native women have no status.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.220
He got a “get out of jail free” pass for what he did to this young lady.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.960
Activists in Alaska are trying to bring
down a judge who gave no jail time to a man who

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.220
assaulted a young Native woman. If they're successful, the judge could be voted out during midterm elections.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.340
We are going to hold all of them accountable,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.800
because that's how we end rape culture
in Alaska. We're going to call out

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.640
everybody who had a part in this, and
Judge Michael Cory is one of them.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.080
Back in August 2017, an air traffic
controller named Justin Schneider was on

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.200
his way to work in the middle of the day,
and stopped by a gas station in the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.830
middle of Anchorage, Alaska. And he
pretended to know this woman who was

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.800
hanging out at the gas station. We don't
know this woman by name, but we know

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.880
that she was a 25-year-old Alaska Native woman. He pretended to know her and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.670
offered to give her a ride to her
boyfriend's home on the other side of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.410
town, and she accepted and got in the car. Instead, he took her somewhere else,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.300
and he made her get out of the car. He
strangled her with both hands, telling

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.920
her that he was going to kill her. She
then passed out, and he ejaculated all

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.420
over her face and hair. Then, when she
woke up, he was standing over her with

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.950
his pants unzipped. She immediately
called 911. She reported his license

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.820
plate. She picked him out of a lineup.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.620
She did everything she was supposed to do.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.580
At some point during this process, the
prosecution dropped three of the felony

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.940
assault charges and the sexual charges.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.880
He walked free out of the court, with no jail time, did not have to register as a sex offender.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.780
What Schneider did is not considered a sex crime under Alaska law, but there is

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.780
a way his plea deal could have been denied.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.600
Judge Corey was at the end of this. He could have said,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.480
"You know. this is not what we stand for." He could have said something.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.500
The judge in question, Michael Corey, technically could have rejected

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.209
the plea deal and called for a harsher
sentence for Schneider. But he didn't, and

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.680
many activists say this happens all too often.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.100
I am a white woman, and I think that if I had been the victim in this case,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.760
Justin Schneider would have walked away
with several years of jail time. I do not

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.450
think that the state of Alaska takes
sexual assault seriously. I think our

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.640
statistics prove it. What we have is an epidemic of sexual assault and violence against women.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.920
Alaska's sexual assault rate
is three times higher than the national

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.560
average. 59% of women here say
they're victims of sexual or domestic violence.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.100
So I'm a social worker. I work
with children and families. And I see

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.299
lots and lots of domestic violence and sexual assault.

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.709
I myself am a survivor of sexual assault,
so I think I understand it and I I think

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.410
I know a little bit of what that victim
may have felt.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.490
We know that half of the sexual assaults
in Alaska are against Native women, even

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.500
though they only make up 20% of the
population.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.820
Your voice was not silenced like the many Alaska Native women in our community have been silenced. What

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.720
happened to my great-great-grandmother,
what happened to many women in my family,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.740
is not going to happen to my daughter.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.640
You know, this is really important to the Alaska Natives, because for a long time, they have been silenced.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.260
Not only for Alaska Natives, but for Indigenous people all across this continent.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.140
I think we have to look at the history of where
we're at in this country and realize

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:54.030
that our institutions were created by
white, womanizing, Indigenous-hating, slave-

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.190
owning white men. That is still
affecting us today. I may not be

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.620
Indigenous, and I may not be a woman, but
coming from being African-American, being

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.660
a vet and having an Indigenous son –
when I need help, when my community comes

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.490
under attack, this community is going to
extend its hand out to us too. And that's

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.860
the only way we're going to get through
what we're going through.

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.320
This isn't the first time a judge has come under
question for lenient sentencing.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.400
California judge Aaron Persky was
recalled after he sentenced Brock Turner

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.620
to only six months in jail after Turner
sexually assaulted an unconscious woman.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.400
Enough is enough. We need to send a
message to the bench and to the criminal

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.270
division that we are paying attention as
Alaskans. We are informed citizens, and we

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.830
are going to use the judicial process to
make ourselves heard in November.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.180
Activists say the judge campaign is just
the first stop. They're on a mission to

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.120
reform Alaskan law to better protect women.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.660
We want to send a message to the judges, to the Department of Law and to the legislature

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.620
that we're not going to tolerate that anymore.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.800
It does create this deep anger in you.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:11.860
Judge Cory really allowed a lot of open
wounds to come out. I see so much hope

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:19.120
for change right now. Right now is a time
where women are stepping up and speaking

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.380
truth, and I feel like that's a really monumental thing.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.160
Everyone here, everyone in Alaska right now, are the ones that are going to change these systems.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.140
We're not going to let our Indigenous women go missing. We're not going to let them be murdered,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.740
assaulted. And we're certainly not going to let
their perpetrators off with a pass.
