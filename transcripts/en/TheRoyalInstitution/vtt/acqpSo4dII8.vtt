00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.920
Thanks very much for the talk, its a fantastic subject.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.660
If everything were symmetrical or is symmetrical

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.800
You've got the particles and the forces  and you're saying they're part of the same thing.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.480
You would expect, or at least I think you would expect, that everything will come to equilibrium pretty soon.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.680
As it seems, we're 14 billion years down the line,

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:55.321
We've still got interactions and it doesn't seem to settle down.

00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:59.240
Is there a chance that there are more things?

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.240
Because I know that it's a human thing to want beauty.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:11.760
It's a very objective, sorry a subjective, wish.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.000
It might be beautiful but it won't seem that way.

00:09:07.949 --> 00:09:12.909
You started out with the question of does the world embody beautiful ideas

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:16.440
and you told us of the four yogas or the four forces.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.200
It popped into my mind the question -

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.880
Could there be a fifth yoga? The yoga of everything?

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:31.120
that says something like - the world tells ideas what to say and ideas tell the world how to be.

00:12:42.124 --> 00:12:45.484
I read an article in the New York Times recently...

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.440
Empirical evidence in modern physics is becoming less relevant.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.840
The example he gave was supersymmetry

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:06.040
where the LHC doesn't actually find the supersymmetry particle.

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:12.338
It is possible now because of the complexities of physics to say that there are heavier particles

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:18.200
So I guess the question is - is there a bias towards beauty?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.820
And at what stage does one decide to abandon the theory?

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.600
Because it's too hard to actually prove...

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:44.520
Is symmetry co-ordinate free?

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:51.800
You seem to start off with Galilean relativity which has Euclidean dimensions.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:57.040
And then there's non-Eucledian geometry, space time...

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:07.000
Can it operate in both systems or is it limited upon that perception of what coordinate geometry you operate?

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:04.120
So in a sense it's conceptually dependant on geometry.

00:20:04.525 --> 00:20:13.645
We couldn't understand it at all without a Euclidean or non-Euclidean perception.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.520
I have two questions. First of all - is beauty intrinsic?

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:40.720
You said earlier that at some point in the far far future there will be symmetry throughout the universe.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:13.480
Does that not contradict the law of thermodynamics that entropy will increase in time?

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:57.720
You talk about how force and substance can be co-moderated by each other.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.840
Does that have anything to do with particle duality?

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:18.926
When you come across a problem that you can't find a solution to

00:27:18.926 --> 00:27:21.946
what are your methods for moving forward with that problem?
