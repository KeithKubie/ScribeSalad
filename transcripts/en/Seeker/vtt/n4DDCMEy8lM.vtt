00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.160
Right now, we’re living in a super-political
environment.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.470
Even reading the news is considered political.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.170
Just mentioning a show can start a political
argument!

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.170
But is it the media that’s political or
are we politicizing it?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.199
We consume a lot of media from news to mindless
entertainment television.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.640
And studies show the media we consume can
affect our opinions.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.579
From body image to political leanings our
media consumption can affect a lot.

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.520
There are a lot of variables here, but that
doesn’t mean we can’t apply a little bit

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.520
of science.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.439
So, first, we have to think about television
not as scripted drama or stage play, but as

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.989
images and messages that are brought into
your home in highly-produced packages, creating

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.680
a shared national culture.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.920
And some research shows that people who consume
more “light” television are more likely

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.920
to be swayed.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.180
Light television is in contrast to heavy.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.160
So while heavy might be a documentary, or
hard-hitting news, light might be entertainment

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.720
or variety tv.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.820
But while we all see the politicization of
news, surely light tv is okay.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.820
RIGHT?

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.820
Not so much.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.789
One particular team of researchers looked
at Italy as a case study.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.909
They focused on areas where the TV network
Mediaset was most widely syndicated.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.280
Mediaset was owned by a guy who ran for (and
won) the office of prime minister of Italy.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.479
Beginning in the mid-1980s, the network showed
light entertainment content and then gradually

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.770
shifted to biased content in favor of the
owner’s own political party.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.200
The data science found, on average, Mediaset
turned more voters toward the populist PM

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.430
candidate, compared to regions where his network
was introduced later.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.740
This suggests a correlation between long-term
exposure to entertainment television (and

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.340
its possible political bias) and voting habits.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.119
Back in the US, this is connected to a thing
called the Fox News effect.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.450
This American news network has an extreme
right-leaning bias, that caters more to small-town

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.660
and suburban areas with populist bends.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.930
Its viewers, too, skew ideologically conservative
based on 2012 Pew studies.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.060
But other media outlets are also skewed.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.009
For example, while Fox was tough on the 2012
Democratic candidate, MSNBC was far tougher

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.690
on the Republican candidate that year.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.970
But back back to Italy, the researchers also
found a correlation between TV habits and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.020
education.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.780
On average, children exposed to entertainment
tv at a young age grew into “cognitively

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.340
disadvantaged” adults.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.420
And it’s not just kids.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.900
People exposed to entertainment TV over time,
regardless of age, are more likely to be taken

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.140
in by populist political rhetoric.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.500
Across the board, entertainment content was
shown to influence political attitudes, creating

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.950
what the researchers call a, quote, “fertile
ground for the spread of populist messages.”

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.989
Which we know has become more popular in 2017.

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:31.989
Plus, the 2012 Pew Study found, Fox News viewers
were on average less informed about current

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:32.989
events than people who don’t watch the news
at all.

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:33.989
That’s right, less-informed than people
who watched no news at all.

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:34.989
They conducted surveys covering both political
events and general knowledge and a correlation

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:35.989
between lower scores on the survey and Fox
News as the primary news outlet emerged.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:36.989
Though, again, let’s be clear: this is a
correlation, not a causation.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:37.989
But still, the correlation is there.

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.260
Another team of researchers from an apolitical
nonprofit, looked at data for over 9,200 towns

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.520
in 2006, and found that areas where Fox News
entered the cable market by the year 2000

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.379
had a significant rise in Republican support.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.610
That suggests a link between the station’s
bias and its audience.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.310
Fox News, they found, reinforced the views
of Republican voters and shifted support among

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.310
independents.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.170
Look, we’re not trying to pick on any specific
news outlet.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.819
We’re looking at the data, and the data
says, some media is more ideological than

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:07.819
others

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.950
And can possibly affect how people see the
world.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.430
Plus, this was in 2012, we are far more polarized
today than we were then.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.480
Fox News is currently leading cable news channels
for viewership.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.599
Though viewers overall are fewer with the
rise of alternatives to cable news online.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.950
Which we didn’t even talk about here.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.390
Some have gone so far as to say that stations
airing such slanted programming is, and I’ll

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.849
paraphrase here, like an all-meat diet when
really you need some variety.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.400
Watching multiple news sources is always recommended
as the best way to have a healthy news diet.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.490
Exactly, is there a perfect news source?

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.490
No.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.430
But there might be a better way to consume
the news.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.069
Instead of only watching Fox News or MSNBC,
watch both.

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.120
And see what’s happening on Twitter.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.900
And read the New York Times and the Wall Street
Journal and the BBC!

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.580
And if you don't have time to do all that, find a source that curates them for you.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.200
If you’re worried about bias, don’t put
all your eggs in one basket.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.379
Anytime we can consider more sources we gain
a broader opinion to have a better overall

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.220
sense of the world.

And it’s not just news outlets affecting
your voting habits, politicians also play

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.730
mind games to win.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.220
Julia’s got more on that right here.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.580
Here’s a fun fact to keep in mind, the definition
of propaganda is “information, especially

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.230
of a biased or misleading nature, used to
promote or publicize a particular political

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.240
cause or point of view.”

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.100
Hmm.
