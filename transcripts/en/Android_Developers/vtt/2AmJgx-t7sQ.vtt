00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:02.946
(upbeat music)

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.060
- We see a lot of growth
in emerging markets.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.160
A lot of those markets are mobile first,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.820
and some of those users
actually access the internet

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.210
for the first time with their phones.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.160
Most of the time the phones that they use

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.130
are based on Android.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.310
Optimizing our application for Android

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.380
is something that is very important for us

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.980
as we look forward to delivering

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.730
a great experience in those markets.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.940
App size is a very important
consideration for Netflix,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.630
as a direct impact on the install rate.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.690
When Google announced App
Bundle and Dynamic Delivery,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.600
we were very excited about it.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.890
It had a lot of potential
for us to leverage

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860
and optimize the size of our application.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.830
- To migrate to App Bundle
and dynamic features,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.050
we had to first decide what to modularize.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.030
We considered any sizeable
component that limited usage,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.930
for example language
and subtitle features.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.600
We made one of our features,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.660
contacting the customer support, dynamic,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.150
so if a user really needed this feature,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.780
then they would go to help section,

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.890
and then this feature will
be downloaded for that user.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.930
With the migration to App
Bundle and dynamic features

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.090
we were able to reduce the
app download size by 33%,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.210
size reduction from 23
megabyte to 15 megabyte.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.510
We have few more features
to make them dynamic,

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.367
and we're expecting further
savings in the coming months.
