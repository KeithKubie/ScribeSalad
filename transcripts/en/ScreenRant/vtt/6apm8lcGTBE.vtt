00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.680
Sometimes actors are so great at their jobs
that we forget they’re acting.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:16.330
Add a cape and some tights to the equation
and us mere mortals don’t stand a chance.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.200
Performers are presented as larger than life,
and combined with all the glitz and glamour

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.390
of Hollywood magic, it’s easy to forget
that underneath they’re skin and bone just

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.910
like us.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.120
So we wanted to take a second to remind everyone
that yes, celebs are people too.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120
Before we jump into the good stuff, we wanted
to thank you for watching our video.

That way you’ll be the first one to know
when we post new content.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.030
You’re just two clicks away from paradise.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.550
And hey, here’s something to keep you thinking:
can you guess the movie from these emojis?

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.629
Stay tuned for the answer, and some other
fun trivia questions along the way.

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.539
Here are 10 Marvel Superhero Actors Who Are
Weaker Than You Think.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:02.339
Ryan Reynolds
Deadpool is a lot of things, but sadly, “invincible”

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.629
is not one of them.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.670
And even though he’s injured himself playing
someone ‘super’ before, Ryan Reynolds

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.050
still gave one hundred and ten percent on
set.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.050
And that might actually be the problem.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.470
The actor was so into the character that his
enthusiasm took its toll on his body.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.480
Reynolds broke bones, separated his shoulders,
and came home with a headache on more than

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.480
one occasion.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.070
With all the spectacle that comes along with
a blockbuster production, it’s easy to forget

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.390
that at the end of the day, everyone is capable
of getting hurt.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.820
Even if they do have an insane set of abs.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.630
Chris Pratt
It’s no secret that Chris Pratt looks a

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.290
lot different than he used to.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.810
If you don’t know what we mean, just compare
early seasons of Parks and Rec to his turn

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.230
in Guardians of the Galaxy.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.950
While a lot of conversations these days center
around Hollywoods unrealistic expectations

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.420
for women, the leading men are not immune
— no matter how amazing they are.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.530
Landing the role of Starlord was a turning
point in the actors career.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.100
Pratt went from looking like a run of the
mill, average dude to ripped behemoth in a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.130
matter of months.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:18.190
And he’s been pumping that iron ever since.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.220
Chris Hemsworth
Here’s a name you wouldn’t normally associate

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.709
with weakness: Thor.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.909
Well, Thor isn’t real.

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:26.830
But the man playing him sure is.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.920
Chris Hemsworth comes from a long line of
civil servants, and is the son of two social

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.920
workers.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.370
When the god of thunder isn’t smashing his
hammer around, he works as an ambassador for

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.080
the Australian Childhood Foundation.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.989
Turns out, being a softie comes naturally
to the blonde bruiser.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.849
The had to learn the ass-kicking part.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.900
So if Chris Hemsworth has a weakness for anything,
it’s his fellow humans.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.481
Mark Ruffalo
Bruce Banner is an intimidating hothead, which

00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:56.099
is great if you’re a bouncer, not so great
if you’re a scientist.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.889
In addition to broken Erlenmeyer flasks and
smashed microscopes, it’s just not fun to

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.769
work alongside a temperamental jerk.

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.010
But in real life, Mark Ruffalo is on the opposite
end of the emotional spectrum.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.819
He’s a vocal activist for clean water and
renewable energy.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.620
And recently stood in solidarity with members
of the Standing Rock Sioux to protest construction

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.999
of an oil pipeline through their territory.

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:22.840
The actor understands the power of celebrity,
and chooses to throw his weight behind causes

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.319
near and dear to his heart.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.739
Jeremy Renner
A large part of what makes superheroes “super”

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.680
is their ability to run into the middle of
a brawl and shut it down before emerging unharmed.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.610
Yes, being super is a dangerous job, but that’s
not a reason to avoid it.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.900
Unless you’re a human.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.680
But it seems we mortals just can’t seem
to stay out of the way and let the heroes

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.060
sort it out.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.739
And we get hurt a lot as a result.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.519
This is exactly what happened to earthling
Jeremy Renner while filming The Avengers.

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.409
According to Joss Whedon, the actor hurt his
back and shoulder so badly that the movie’s

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.359
production had to shut down for days afterward.

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.189
Hopefully he has insurance.

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.559
Scarlett Johansson
We’ve already established that being cast

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:06.879
in a superhero movie is a blessing and a curse.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.120
On the upside: the pay is decent, millions
of people will see your work, learn your name,

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.249
and talk about you incessantly on the internet
for years to come.

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:15.249
The downside?

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:16.249
Permanent injury.

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:19.959
After five appearances as the Black Widow,
and a few more to come, Scarlett Johansson

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.400
knows this better than anyone.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.440
She’s had more than a few bumps and bruises
by this point.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:43.190
And has joked in interviews about how she’ll
be rehabbing them for the rest of her life.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.650
Tom Hiddleston
Tom Hiddleston may be equally known for his

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.090
roles as Loki in the MCU, and as Taylor Swift’s
ex-boyfriend, depending on who you are.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.530
Either way, it might be tempting to look at
him as a cool guy to end all cool guys — which

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.630
would be a mistake.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.980
The actor is big into music, and can play
a ton of different instruments.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.150
Piano, trumpet, violin and lute, just to name
a few.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.200
And according to his IMDb page, his “eyes
water involuntarily when spooked”, whatever

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200
that means.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.870
So the next time you get a little spooked
about Loki’s ability to read your mind or

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.250
beat you senseless, remember this: if the
MCU was high school, he’d be the one spending

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.670
his entire day stuffed in a locker.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.540
Samuel L. Jackson
If Samuel L. Jackson has a trademark, it’s

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.540
his voice.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.330
He’s almost always yelling, and nobody can
drop an f-bomb like he can.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.420
The actor’s tirades are the highlight of
any movie he’s in, and he’s so confident

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.310
that you’d have to be a straight up fool
to challenge him.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.240
But Jackson wasn’t always like that.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.500
Growing up, the actor had a speech impediment.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.680
But he handled it the way he handles everything
— by facing it head on.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.050
After performing in a few plays during his
youth, and working his butt off, Jackson’s

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.180
stutter went away.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:01.120
Immersion therapy at its finest.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:16.590
Chris 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.250
Evans
When it comes to Chris Evans, “weak” is

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.990
the wrong word to use.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.100
“Soft”, maybe, but not weak.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.100
Why?

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.510
Well it turns out that Captain America is
a HUGE fan of The Little Mermaid.

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.280
Apparently he knows every single song by heart,
and could act the whole thing out with his

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.390
eyes closed.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.680
That last part doesn’t really surprise us,
he is an actor after all.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.760
But even though he’s most known for playing
a character who could beat us all up, Evans

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.310
is a big softie.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.470
Dudes who pride themselves on machismo will
probably bristle at this revelation.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.200
And even though he looks the type, the actor
doesn’t fit the mould of a “manly man”.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.330
Which is just fine by us.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.650
Robert Downey Jr.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.380
If you’re one of those people who believes
that addiction is a choice, then you probably

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.880
don't look too kindly upon Robert Downey Jr’s
past.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.130
But as the Iron Man actor has stated time
and time again in interviews: he is not his

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.130
story.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.310
Growing up, RDJ was dealt a tough hand.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.120
And, like many people do, he coped with the
assistance of drugs and alcohol.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.220
But the actor has devoted the last few decades
to sobriety, and worked incredibly hard to

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.630
get where he is today.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.320
So rather than seeing his journey as a weakness,
maybe people should be marveling at his tenacity

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.980
and self-preservation instead.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:27.980
What do you think?

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.680
Do you know of any other actors in the MCU
who don’t quite match up to their on screen

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.680
personas?

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.210
We want to hear from you, so tell us about
them in the comments.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.090

You’ll probably like our friends over at
CBR too, so go show them some love.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.310
Thanks for watching.
