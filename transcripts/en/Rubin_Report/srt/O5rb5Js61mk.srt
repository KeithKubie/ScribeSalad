1
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,360
All right. I believe, if I'm not mistaken,

2
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:09,300
that I am wive on youtube right now.

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,390
This is my second live stream in a week.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,660
I think it's the first time
that I've ever done that. Uh,

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,640
two live streams one week.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,300
That sounds like a naughty video
somewhere else on the Internet. Uh,

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,740
but yeah, I'm doing it
because we did the, uh,

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:29,220
the preelection thing couple of days ago.
I was in Stockholm,

9
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:33,630
Sweden when we did that. Right
now I am in Birmingham, UK,

10
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:36,810
well Birmingham as they
call it here apparently. Uh,

11
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,630
and I've got the show with Jordan Peterson
and a couple of hours. As you can see,

12
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,720
I'm in my hotel room. They're doing a
lot of construction in the back. Uh,

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,030
hopefully the Internet
connection will be okay.

14
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:49,770
I just want to talk a little bit about
what happened in the election and you

15
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:52,920
don't have to tell you,
it's a little weird being a,

16
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:56,820
I was in Denmark yesterday
when the election was
happening and it's really weird

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,250
being in other countries
for the last couple of days.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,250
And I've been in different countries
almost every day from Ireland and Finland.

19
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:08,940
And Norway and Sweden and the UK,
and I'm sure I'm forgetting.

20
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:12,010
And Holland and some others I'm sure to a,

21
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,640
and we're going back to Sweden and
we're going back to Norway and they were

22
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:17,920
finishing up in Finland
and a couple of days, uh,

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:22,290
then we'll be in la and we've got a
couple more shows in Canada in December.

24
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,940
And then it looks like we just signed on,

25
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:26,640
I think for six or eight shows
in Australia in February.

26
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:27,780
So I'm psyched about that.

27
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,870
And then Jordan wants to continue
this into march and April,

28
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,350
so I got to see how much I can do and
maybe I'll do some more Rubin reports from

29
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:38,130
the road. And as I said, I kind of miss
doing the direct messages for you guys.

30
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,980
So I want to figure out how I can be
doing those a little bit more on the road.

31
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,870
But you've got to strike
while the irons hot.

32
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,300
And I'm feeling so good about everything
that's going on and there's just so

33
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:48,990
many great people that I'm meeting and
realizing that talking about all of these

34
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:53,310
things transcend borders and the concerns
of people in Norway or the same as the

35
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:56,280
concerns of the people in the United
States and Brazil and all over the place.

36
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:58,210
It's just, it's just crazy. Uh,

37
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:00,710
just a couple of other things before
I jump in on the election. Uh,

38
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:03,750
so I get back on November 12th,

39
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:08,580
fly back from Finland
and then on the 13th,

40
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,540
uh, I'm doing standup in Bray
California. And then on the 14th,

41
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:15,180
I'm doing standup in Oxnard,
California.

42
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:20,181
Both shows we'll have a surprise
guest from the intellectual dark web.

43
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,480
Uh, I'm hearing a rumor that for one of
the shows there might be two IDW members

44
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:26,220
showing up.
So I do about an hour stand up.

45
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,440
I bring on the guests
for about 45 minutes.

46
00:02:28,441 --> 00:02:31,350
I did this with Peterson and Salt Lake
City. I've done it with Eric Weinstein.

47
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,950
I've done it with Christina Hoff summers.
I've done it with Bret Weinstein. Uh,

48
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:37,950
and it stand up, I promise you,
like you haven't seen before.

49
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:42,780
I do more of like a town hall situation
and get you guys involved and it's not

50
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:45,660
politically correct and it's,
and it's messy and all over the place,

51
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:50,320
but I promise you you'll have fun. So if
you're in the La area, Brae or Oxnard, uh,

52
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,130
the links are down below. Hope you'll
join us. We do a meet and greet after too,

53
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,310
if you want to say hi. Shake my hand.
Touched the hair. Oh, speaking of the air,

54
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,700
I left my, uh, toiletry bag in Sweden.

55
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,090
So for the last couple of days I have
not had any of my stuff. I had to buy,

56
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:08,350
you know, hairspray and toothbrush and
deodorant and all that. Um, but you know,

57
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:12,850
I've got my fancy schmancy hairspray
that I'd normally use this Orbay Bay dry

58
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:16,270
texturizing stuff. People are always
asking me, how do I get the lift in there?

59
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:19,690
But now I'm using this other stuff and
it's crinkly and I'm just not happy about

60
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,670
it. But thank you. Good people for
bearing with me. Um, okay, cool. So,

61
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,770
uh, so let's talk about the
election a little bit. Look,

62
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,970
what did I say a couple of days ago
in Sweden? They, before the election,

63
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,360
I said that what I thought would be best
for the country going forward would be

64
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,710
if the Democrats really got hammered.

65
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,010
If the ideas that I'm always talking about
on this show that I really care about,

66
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,090
that you who watch this show,

67
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:48,091
I think obviously care about that I
sense that young people care about these

68
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,240
days and that I also see as sort of a,

69
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,240
a wide new coalition of people who care
more about freedom. Then authority.

70
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,120
Uh, if those ideas are the
ideas that matter to you.

71
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,330
My hope was that the Democrats who have
embraced a real authoritarian strain

72
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:06,160
and, and really identity
politics more than anything else,

73
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:10,330
judging each other on your immutable
characteristics instead of your thoughts.

74
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:13,690
And I literally just five or 10 minutes
ago before I started this livestream,

75
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,190
I just a screen captured something from
the women's March where they're tweeting

76
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:23,191
about white women because not enough
white women voted for Beto to 70% of white

77
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,600
women voted for Ted Cruz in there.
There's any,

78
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,890
we've got a lot of work to do with you.

79
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:31,240
White women like this is becoming
the new racism and it's becoming

80
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:34,810
institutionalized in our
political system and in our media.

81
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,750
This is what I would call systemic.
It's becoming systemic, uh,

82
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,290
because they're going to be
passing laws about these things.

83
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,190
This is there going to be judging people,
uh,

84
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,710
based on the color of their skin and
not their immutable characteristics.

85
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,420
And you should not, you should care about
what people think, not how they look.

86
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:57,430
So all the headlines today were women
when we had our first Muslim congressman,

87
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,170
first openly gay governor of Colorado,
couple of other things. And it's like,

88
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,550
okay, that, that's all fine. No one care,
you shouldn't care one way or another.

89
00:05:06,551 --> 00:05:10,900
It's nice I suppose. But it doesn't
matter what those conditions are.

90
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:13,810
What matters is what are they, what do
they think, what are their policies are?

91
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,490
So I e because I believe that identity
politics still is the biggest threat to

92
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:19,660
the west.
And by the way,

93
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,010
if you think I'm exaggerating this or
if you're on the fence about this or

94
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:24,640
whatever,

95
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,440
one of the common themes when I go to all
these different countries with Jordan,

96
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,280
uh, is that people are really
worried about it all over the place.

97
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:35,200
And they were worried about it
in the Scandinavian countries.

98
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,460
They're really worried about it.

99
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,880
And what's interesting about that is
the Scandinavian countries, you know,

100
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,980
they're predominantly white.

101
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,610
They now we're all dealing with
different immigration situations,

102
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,370
but even they are being affected by this.

103
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:50,710
So they're not even that
multicultural as a society.

104
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:52,990
They aren't the melting pot
that the United States is.

105
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:56,590
But even they are dealing with these
issues and it's all couched within the

106
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:57,830
political stuff.

107
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:00,680
And people being afraid to say what
they think and all of those things.

108
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,410
And then companies, you know, using this,

109
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:08,411
this diversity myth and all of
these things that actually are,

110
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:09,091
as I say,

111
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:14,091
to institutionalize and racism where
Harvard won't have Asian applicants and

112
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,230
where companies will say, we're going
to have half women and we're like,

113
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,190
is it that you're going to have the exact
proportion of gay people and women and

114
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:25,400
black people and Muslims and Jews and all
of these things and Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,

115
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,310
Dah. And then you think what?
That your product will be better.

116
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:33,230
Do you think your society will be
fairer or or more just or good.

117
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,590
It will be worse than ever.

118
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,550
Not only will your product
be worst because you won't
be hiring people based on

119
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,610
skill. You'll be hiring them based
on those immutable characteristics,

120
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,340
but you won't be providing more of a,

121
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,950
more of a tolerant society.

122
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,490
You'll be creating an intolerant society
where people will look at each other

123
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,031
neighbor,

124
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:55,031
we'll look at neighbor and be jealous
or angry or expect something of someone

125
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:56,870
else. So it's so it's
super dangerous. So anyway,

126
00:06:56,871 --> 00:07:01,100
what I said before the election was that
what I think the best thing is for the

127
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,310
things that I care about and
for a return to liberalism,

128
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,780
a left that was liberal,
that had a live and let live attitude,

129
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:12,650
but believed there was a right
way to use the government, uh,

130
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:17,750
to, to create a grand
society, let's say, uh,

131
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,430
that has nothing to do
with the left anymore.

132
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,050
So my feeling was these guys have to be
destroyed. I don't want to hurt people.

133
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,860
I want the ideas to be rejected
so that better ideas could come.

134
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:30,590
So as I laid it out the other
day, what I would say is if, if,

135
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,680
if this leftist monster had been
destroyed out of the ashes of that,

136
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:40,530
and this is a little bit of sort of
like a Jordan Peterson style, uh,

137
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,220
religious resurrection
out of the ashes of that,

138
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:45,140
perhaps a Phoenix could come forth.

139
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:48,230
Perhaps there would be a
rebirth of liberalism. Now,

140
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,200
unfortunately that's not what happened.
Now look,

141
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,040
it's interesting what happened here
because the Democrat there was definitely

142
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,170
not a blue wave. So let's
be clear on that. You know,

143
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:59,900
everybody was predicting the blue
wave, the blue wave, the blue wave.

144
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:01,130
And as I said the other day,

145
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,680
it's like anyone that's predicting
anything with certainty,

146
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,540
nobody had any clue what was going on.

147
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,640
And we can all play armchair
quarterback and we can all,

148
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:11,210
we can all pretend the day after
we knew exactly what was going on.

149
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:14,690
But that's pretty rare and far between.
And especially these days,

150
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:16,130
it's hard to garner what's
going on with the Poles.

151
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:21,380
My hope you take out the dangerous
elements of the Democratic Party,

152
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:25,460
they returned to liberalism and then
they're returned to a bit of a centrism

153
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,400
would then cause some of the right,
the bad elements of the right,

154
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,490
say the white nationalist parts of right,
which by the way,

155
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:36,080
I don't think our systemic or massive or
that influential, uh, but they do exist.

156
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,780
But then maybe if the, if the left
came a little closer to the center,

157
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:41,900
it would be a little bit easier for the
right to read itself if some of it's bad

158
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:45,710
elements. And what I also thought
was that maybe if that had happened,

159
00:08:45,711 --> 00:08:47,420
Trump then would be feeling really good.

160
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,870
Like he could do what he wanted for
the next two years and that may be,

161
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:54,620
he then would realize you don't have to
run on trolling on Twitter all the time

162
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,820
and fighting media all the
time and all of those things.

163
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:59,910
Cause I do think we're going to eventually
get to diminishing returns on that.

164
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,940
Cause I don't think the society
can run on that forever.

165
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:04,320
I just don't think it's possible.

166
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,070
And that may be then Trump would
actually moderate some of the language.

167
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,750
And I think most people,

168
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:13,440
although it's hard to get say the
Hashtag resistance people to admit this,

169
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:17,490
but I think most people realize the
policies of Trump, even if you're a lefty,

170
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,190
haven't been that bad.
Um,

171
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,340
the rhetoric and what you may think
of him as a person and all that,

172
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:27,120
that's a different story. So that was,
that was my hope. Now what happened? Okay.

173
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:30,690
So the Democrats got the house back
last I heard. I think it's around, uh,

174
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:33,900
they got at least 26 seats back, but
they're still waiting to find out more.

175
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,640
Republicans picked up a
couple of [inaudible] in the
Senate. So look, number one,

176
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,400
the real risk of this whole thing would
have been that there had been a blue

177
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:43,200
wave,
um,

178
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,160
to the point where the Republican or
the Democrats would have taken the house

179
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:49,980
and taking the Senate and then we
would've had impeachment of Trump.

180
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:53,700
There is just no doubt and what that
would have led to. I really believe this,

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,310
and I didn't want to say this over the
last couple of weeks cause I don't like

182
00:09:56,311 --> 00:10:01,020
teasing out ideas so that they gain
momentum. Scary ideas, let's say. Um,

183
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,200
is that we would have ended up in sort
of a low grade cold civil war in America

184
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:07,500
if that would've happened.
Now,

185
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,130
fortunately because the Republicans at
least kept the Senate and I say this as

186
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:14,970
someone that has never even
really voted Republican, um,

187
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,640
which I think is worth mentioning
over and over cause it seems like I'm

188
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:22,590
defending the Republican's were that, um,
that I am a Republican and I'm not, um,

189
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:28,320
otherwise generally think their
ideas are better at the moment. Um,

190
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,680
but had, had they lost both
the house and the Senate,

191
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,420
we'd be in a really dangerous place today.

192
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:38,100
I think we would actually have some
serious, serious problems on our hands.

193
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,300
That did not happen. The fact that
the Republicans kept the Senate, uh,

194
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,290
basically we won't have impeachment.
They, the Democrats may try to bring,

195
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,120
you know, some other investigations
on Trump and that sort of thing. Um,

196
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,190
look,
so the danger right now is this,

197
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,540
if you're with me on this identity
politics stuff, if you're with me,

198
00:10:57,541 --> 00:11:01,440
that the left is no longer liberal
and, and all of these ideas, um,

199
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,860
there's no reason to think they're not
going to double down again on those ideas.

200
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,300
They doubled down when they lost last
time to Trump and now they've gained some

201
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:13,080
seats. So I think there's no reason that
they wouldn't double down and say, see,

202
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:16,800
there's a winning, there's
a winning, um, path.

203
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,150
If we keep up with this. And that's
what I think the problem is right now.

204
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,100
And as I said the other day,

205
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:28,050
what I think that will lead to is
more and more decent liberals going,

206
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:30,900
okay, you know what? I can't have
a conversation with these people.

207
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:33,570
Because every time I open my mouth they
tell me I'm a bigot and a racist in the

208
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:33,931
rest of it.

209
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:36,990
Just look what the women's march just
tweeted before I started this livestream.

210
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,770
And what I will do is be willing to talk
to Libertarians and Conservatives and

211
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:46,410
Magda people and the never Trump people,

212
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,200
because at least they're a little
willing to talk about these things.

213
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,960
So I still think there will be
a wide tent developing there.

214
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,200
I also think it's possible if the house
goes so bananas on some of the Anti

215
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,800
Trump stuff,

216
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,950
that that then helps Trump get
reelected because it fires up the base.

217
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,770
I did see an interesting,
uh,

218
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,230
tweet where somebody laid out how many,

219
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,440
how seats the incumbent president's
party lost during midterms.

220
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,530
And for Obama, he was extremely
high. Clinton, Hi George.

221
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,430
H W and W hi Clinton high. Uh, but for,

222
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,360
for Trump it was actually the
lowest since something like 1946.

223
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,980
Um,
so that,

224
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:27,040
that's just an interesting piece of
information relative to all of this.

225
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:30,340
I suppose I saw some people saying that
that could potentially have something to

226
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:31,540
do with Jerry Jerry mandering.

227
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:35,230
I would need to do a little bit more
research on that. Uh, but in any event,

228
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,320
I think basically right now we're pretty
much in the same place we were a couple

229
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,210
of days ago where there was no evidence
really that the left was going to stop

230
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:47,350
going off the deep end.

231
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:51,700
Now they're emboldened a little bit
and we'll see what the responses on the

232
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:52,091
other side.

233
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:55,360
I think Trump may be even speaking right
now or he was going to speak in the

234
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,150
next hour or so to address,
uh, you know, his thoughts
after the election. Um, but I,

235
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:01,870
I just want to,
I'll take some questions by the way.

236
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,970
So it's patrion.com/reuben recording.

237
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:07,240
I'll take some questions that if you want
to jump in on super chat, I will, uh,

238
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:08,770
I'll take some on there as well.

239
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:12,830
I've got a trusty Google doc here and
my guy as her back in adolescence,

240
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,080
so I will jump in on that in
just a second. Um, but, you know,

241
00:13:17,081 --> 00:13:21,430
one of the other things that I was
thinking as I was looking at Twitter and

242
00:13:21,431 --> 00:13:23,620
trying to track some of the news,
and again,

243
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:26,830
it's weird being in other countries
when this is all happening, right?

244
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,020
Like I live and breathe
this thing and it was weird,

245
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:33,280
like laying in bed last night at like
two in the morning watching Danish

246
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:36,760
television, um, talk
about American elections.

247
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,340
So then finally I couldn't take
it anymore. So I switched to,

248
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:42,850
I watch Scarface and then I
watched, uh, the big Lebowski,

249
00:13:42,851 --> 00:13:46,600
both far more entertaining than Danish
coverage of the American elections. Um,

250
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:50,290
but, but every country that we've
been in, Finland, Sweden, Holland, uh,

251
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:51,190
here in the UK,

252
00:13:51,191 --> 00:13:56,191
obviously the obsession with American
politics doesn't strike me as good and

253
00:13:56,411 --> 00:14:00,760
healthy for, for these countries.
North America itself. I mean,

254
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:05,380
we really still are the engine and
I think we should be really, um,

255
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,130
we should be careful and we should
to be responsible about what that,

256
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,020
what that means for the world.

257
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:13,660
If we're the engine of how
ideas get put out there.

258
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,870
If our culture in our movies
and our music and our,

259
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,460
our political discourse and everything
is where it all starts and that is,

260
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,440
that is where it seems to be,

261
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,990
then I think we do have to be
careful and it's like, look,

262
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:29,470
we had an election yesterday and everyone
said they hate each other and today

263
00:14:29,471 --> 00:14:30,490
everyone's,
you know,

264
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:33,790
some people are dancing on other people's
graves and other people are upset and

265
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:38,680
this and that. We're not killing each
other on the streets. Do not forget that.

266
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,630
Do not forget that. That is the important
thing here. Democracy is still working.

267
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,900
It is imperfect. It is messy. You should
fight for the things you believe in,

268
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:51,710
but it's still working. Um,
so, so see what happens.

269
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,770
I also just want to say one other thing
quickly before I get to a couple of

270
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:56,840
questions, which is that, you know,

271
00:14:56,841 --> 00:15:01,160
it seems that politics just always brings
out the worst in us and it seems that

272
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:05,570
it usually brings out the worst in us
in Twitter. And I'm really, really,

273
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,860
really, really going to commit
to being better than it.

274
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:13,370
And it sometimes gets me, like sometimes
someone says something so stupid,

275
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,300
I got to own them,

276
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:19,301
or someone says saying so dishonest or
someone goes after me or whatever it is.

277
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,050
Um, and I usually ignore most
of it or I try not to add to it.

278
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,110
Or even when I do something, I try
to do it with a little bit, uh,

279
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,880
a little bit of sarcasm or snark instead
of just like straight up vitriol.

280
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:35,900
I mean, I really never do that. I don't
think, um, not to say I have never,

281
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,070
I'm sure I have, but, uh, I'm really
gonna try not to add to the, uh,

282
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,930
to the fire because I think we need some
more firefighters these days. And a,

283
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:48,170
I'm going to really try and
I hope you'll try and, uh,

284
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,010
and we'll see it because I do think
we can win more people by just being a

285
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:54,770
little bit better. I really do. So I'm
going to keep trying that. All right.

286
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:55,850
Let me get to a couple of questions.

287
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:57,740
So first we're going to
jump on patrion question.

288
00:15:57,741 --> 00:16:00,770
So it's patrion.com/ruben report and a,

289
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:03,680
and then we'll take some
super chat questions as well.
If you want to get hurt,

290
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:08,330
you can jump in on there. Um, so
feel free to do that. Reminder.

291
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:13,340
Just real quick. Uh, I am back in La on
a November 12th and then on the 13th,

292
00:16:13,341 --> 00:16:17,810
I am doing standup at, uh, the Bray Improv
and then I'm at liberty live in Oxnard,

293
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,540
California. Both are outside of La. Uh,

294
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:25,250
and I will have an IDW guest with
me on both days. Oh, by the way,

295
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:29,240
if you sign up on Patrion at Ruben select
level three or higher, you get a free,

296
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:31,970
you get free entrance into my meet and
greet and I hang out with people after

297
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:36,320
the show. Oh, real quick. Then I
promise I'll get to the questions. Uh,

298
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:39,050
so we do these meet and greets after
the show. And Jordan does these,

299
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:40,670
these really extended meet and greets.

300
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,600
It's usually about a hundred people
might have 20, 30, 40 or so, usually,

301
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:49,280
sometimes a little bit less. It
depends. Um, and uh, the Sweden one,

302
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:53,330
we had like 50 people and it was so
cool. We had this huge, huge table.

303
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,620
We standing room only and I kind of
held court and it was just great.

304
00:16:57,621 --> 00:17:02,030
It was just so much fun. Like I really
feel like being on this tour, it's, it's,

305
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,050
it's changed me in that like I really
am meeting and connecting with so many

306
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:09,200
great people all over the world and
people are coming up to us all over the

307
00:17:09,201 --> 00:17:13,820
place and sometimes Jordan
goes out, uh, into the, into
the audience, into the line,

308
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,730
outside the theater
before we start. And, uh,

309
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:19,070
and we're messing around with
the crowds and we're just,

310
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,000
we're just having a blast.

311
00:17:20,001 --> 00:17:22,640
So I hope you guys will come to the
shows if you haven't, if you haven't yet.

312
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:26,480
And it looks like we're going to be
doing Germany and Belgium and uh,

313
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:29,930
and Turkey and Israel and
all over the place. I mean,

314
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:33,590
it seems like we're just going to keep
going and going so we shall see what

315
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:37,370
happens. Okay. Um, I
live in rural America.

316
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:41,180
How can I balance my libertarian
philosophy with the fact
that the population in

317
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:45,170
my area can't support the kinds of school
and infrastructure investments that

318
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:49,230
will provide the equality of opportunity
that is so important to me and my

319
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:50,010
offering?

320
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:53,070
What a great question because what you're
saying basically is your libertarian,

321
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:57,570
so you want local, local, local,
but in a rural area like that,

322
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:01,980
there may not be enough money to actually
fund the types of things that you want.

323
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,030
So this is a, this is a really good one.
This is a place where I would say you,

324
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,510
you and your local representatives,
um,

325
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,660
should be fighting as much as possible
that depending on what state you live in

326
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,730
to get your,
uh,

327
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,890
your local area more resources or
you move. Right? So that's the,

328
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,520
that's the easy answer is you move.
If they're,

329
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:26,940
if the resources aren't right for
your area and your libertarian,

330
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,370
you move somewhere else, you use
your foot boat, you move. Okay.

331
00:18:29,371 --> 00:18:32,010
But putting that one aside, uh,
you know, I'm from New York.

332
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:35,490
So New York has an interesting thing
part of this because there's a constant

333
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:40,491
battle between the mayor of New York
City and where there are some odd,

334
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:42,720
you know,
I think it's around 8 million people.

335
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,720
And then the governor of New
York who's up in Albany, upstate,

336
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,370
who has to deal with the entire state,

337
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:51,300
where there's huge rural areas and
there's farms and huge distances between

338
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:55,920
people. There's the, uh, the southern
tier area. I went to Suny Binghamton, so,

339
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:59,220
uh, southern interior area, which is
part of upstate New York, is really,

340
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,230
really economically depressed right now.

341
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,310
So there's a constant battle between
the governor who has to take care of the

342
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:09,210
entire state and the mayor of New York
City who has the most people there.

343
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,530
So he argues that he needs the most
resources and how do you allocate all of

344
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,840
that? And it's like there's such
a concentration of people there.

345
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:20,790
You could see a governor going well
rested to stay in votes right down there.

346
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,920
Um,
so the best thing you can do is laugh.

347
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,970
Hopefully you have a decent local
representative of decent state senator,

348
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:33,090
let's say. And you can get them to
lobby for more resources in your area.

349
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,141
I would say there's,
you know,

350
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:38,670
there's probably other ways maybe through
homeschooling a little bit or online

351
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:41,250
learning, things like that.
But if it's really bad,

352
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:45,690
like if you live in an area that's really
being ignored and you've tried to fix

353
00:19:45,691 --> 00:19:50,190
it, you know, sometimes you
just got to go. And again,
this is, this is Shitty, right?

354
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,790
This is the argument that I make about
why I wouldn't force the baker to make

355
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,860
the, the cake for the
gay wedding. It's like,

356
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,020
I don't want the government coming in
and telling a private company what to do,

357
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:03,690
what service to offer.
Um,

358
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,250
and if you happen to live in a town where
the only Baker won't be you, the cake,

359
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,640
the specific cake for your
wedding, uh, well then you,

360
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,810
you can either get a cake
online and that works, right?

361
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:18,390
That does work and it
doesn't feel great probably,

362
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:21,170
but it does work or you
can move. So, you know,

363
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,020
it's a really great question because it
sort of puts your beliefs to the test

364
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,330
and that's kind of what it's all about.

365
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,360
And you should try to live in a place
where the ideas and the ideals that you

366
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:37,470
care about are rewarded and
are then feel like they matter.

367
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,770
Um, so that's a, it's a
really great question. Um,

368
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,680
and I don't know that there's really a,
like a perfectly right answer to that.

369
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,190
It's sort of also what do you need?
Like if you really value say, oh,

370
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,480
the land you live on and the freedom that
that affords you and things like that,

371
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:56,020
maybe then that overrides some of the
other issues that you're talking about.

372
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,890
It's interesting. Um,
let's see. Super Chat.

373
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,450
I asked him pool this yesterday.

374
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:06,130
Do you think it's smart for the Dems to
portray Trump as the worst international

375
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,270
as the worst to the international
community as Americans? Hello?

376
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,060
From Australia by the way? Oh,
well first off, as I just said,

377
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,430
I think I just said it. Uh,
we're going to Australia,

378
00:21:15,431 --> 00:21:18,040
I think six or eight stops in February,
so I'll let you know about that.

379
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,230
It's somewhere between
like February 6th and 18th.

380
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:24,100
We're trying to figure it all out. So I
hope you'll come to one of the shows. Um,

381
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,060
do I think it's a good move for them to
play it off that internationally Trump

382
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,620
is the worst? Not really, because
internationally right now,

383
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,480
look, Trump has done pretty good work
with Nikki Haley at the UN to really just

384
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,920
completely decimate a seriously corrupt
organization that makes the Legion of

385
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:45,640
doom looks, look like, um, you know,

386
00:21:45,641 --> 00:21:48,500
Barney's playhouse for your site
because Barney have a play house,

387
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,380
something like that.
Um,

388
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,830
so internationally I do sense that some
of our allies actually trust us a little

389
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:57,630
bit more right now. You know, I think the,

390
00:21:57,631 --> 00:22:02,320
the Obama red line in Syria thing was
one of the worst foreign policy mistakes

391
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:07,120
probably in 50 years because our allies
suddenly trusted us less cause he said,

392
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:09,940
if you, if you use chemical weapons,
that's our red line. And then they did.

393
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:13,150
And we didn't do anything. Not that I
wanted to do anything. You can go back,

394
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,830
you know, five years ago and watch when
the Syria war was really heating up.

395
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,070
You can watch videos of
me on the young Turks, uh,

396
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,250
talking about how I did not want the
United States to be involved at all,

397
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:28,360
that sometimes other countries surrounding
countries like Saudi Arabia and

398
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:30,080
Turkey should get involved and at,

399
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:33,820
and perhaps the United States could
offer a little bit of a humanitarian

400
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:38,170
corridor for people to go
to, but that would be it. Um,

401
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,180
so I don't know that painting
him, uh, more scarily,

402
00:22:43,181 --> 00:22:45,190
let's say to the international
community would work. Look,

403
00:22:45,191 --> 00:22:49,360
he's talking to North Korea
right now. Um, you know, we,

404
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,690
we've ridden some of these trade deals.
Yeah.

405
00:22:52,691 --> 00:22:57,070
There's still like the personality
element that's still a little bizarre. Uh,

406
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,600
maybe you can play that up.
I'm not,

407
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,240
I just don't know that it's a winnable
strategy though. Let's see. All right,

408
00:23:01,241 --> 00:23:05,530
I'll jump in one more. Um,
one more super chat, uh,

409
00:23:05,531 --> 00:23:08,340
opinion of Florida giving
felons the right to vote. Yes.

410
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:09,760
So I just heard about this one.

411
00:23:09,761 --> 00:23:13,330
So I guess there was a referendum on
this and felons who could not vote.

412
00:23:13,331 --> 00:23:16,390
Now we'll be able to vote.
Look if you've done your time,

413
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:19,060
you are still a citizen of
the United States of America.

414
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,190
So I don't really see a
counter argument to that. Um,

415
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:29,370
I suppose if you did something that
was directly related to election fraud

416
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:32,350
perhaps or something like that,
but let's say you're a felon,

417
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:36,970
you're an armed robber. You
are, you robbed a bank, you
know, you serve your time,

418
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:39,640
you serve 10 years,
you're now 38,

419
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:41,920
you get out of jail and you're
trying to rebuild your life.

420
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Should you never be allowed to take
part in the election process again,

421
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:47,450
I don't see how that is fair.

422
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,230
So basically I would need to know a little
bit more about the specifics of this,

423
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:56,180
but basically I think it's actually
totally fine. Um, let's see. Dave,

424
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,740
why don't you do an all tech
week like a youtube or weak, uh,

425
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,030
interview the guys behind bitch,
shoot gab minds, et cetera.

426
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,480
So I've been thinking about
doing something like this
because it's obviously so

427
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:08,630
much of what's going on here
now politically, culturally,

428
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,420
technologically is directly related to
the ways that we can communicate. Right?

429
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,400
I'm sitting on my laptop computer,

430
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:19,760
which is on top of a small
garbage can by the way, uh, in,

431
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:24,200
in Birmingham a UK and you guys are
watching this all over the world.

432
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:28,340
That's incredibly cool. Uh, but if
the company's in this case, Google,

433
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,380
uh,
that,

434
00:24:30,381 --> 00:24:34,040
that own the pipes and own the wires
and on the Wifi and own the airwaves and

435
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:34,790
all of that stuff,

436
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:37,520
if they want to slowly clamped
down on certain types of speech,

437
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:40,820
which I think there is evidence that they
would like to do some of that at least

438
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:45,680
a little bit. Um, then we
should be talking about
alternative technologies here.

439
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,460
As you guys know from my talks with Peter
Teal and I talked with Eric Weinstein

440
00:24:49,461 --> 00:24:52,850
and a couple others, uh, there's plenty
of discussion in this, in this arena.

441
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:57,200
I can't give you all the discussion about
that, that I'm privy to at the moment.

442
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,560
Um,
but I do think that's a good idea,

443
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,170
actually get some of the cool tech
people in here to discuss some of these

444
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:07,640
things. Maybe I can smoke a blunt
with Elon Musk. All right. Let's see.

445
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:11,090
Um, okay. Oh and a reminder,

446
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,250
I've already printed out twice,

447
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,280
but the links to the brayer show on the
13th and the oxygen art show on the 14th

448
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:20,330
are write down below.
Uh,

449
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:25,310
so I hope you guys will join me for some
stand up and meet some of the IDW crew.

450
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,173
All right.

451
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,830
Shouldn't we stick around and fight to
reform and push back on the left also

452
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:31,940
because of what you're seeing out there.

453
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,390
How do you feel about the possibility
of a third party that might just be able

454
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:38,720
to rise? Look, the, the
stay and push back thing?

455
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:42,830
I think there are great arguments
on both sides. So Eric Weinstein,

456
00:25:42,831 --> 00:25:44,690
who is become like a brother to me,

457
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,380
who is one of the greatest
minds I think on earth, uh,

458
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,760
he still considers himself part of the
left and he believes that it can be

459
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:56,210
reformed from the inside.
I see no evidence of it.

460
00:25:56,211 --> 00:26:01,160
And not only do I see no evidence of it,
I see a continued slow,

461
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,060
uh, slide to all of the
things that I don't like.

462
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:09,230
And I see more and more people get
purged for any sort of free thought.

463
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:13,760
I see them using the
ideas of collectivism, uh,

464
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,880
which is a type of racism actually,

465
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,970
and it is a type of sexism
and is a type of bigotry.

466
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,030
I see them using those ideas
more and more and more. Again,

467
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,990
go check the women's March tweet that I
just sent out right before this stream.

468
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,350
White women, you know, we're
coming for you, white women.

469
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:34,400
If you don't do what we want you to do,
we're for women or for women. Know that,

470
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,510
but you better do what we want you to do.
Otherwise we're not for you then.

471
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,150
Which is why saying you're for women or
you're for gay people or your for black

472
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:45,330
people is actually stupid. It's,
it's not a clear thought out,

473
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:48,840
logical argument. Because if
you're for it doesn't make sense.

474
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,060
Women think different things.
Black people think different things.

475
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:54,390
Gay people think different things.
So what can you be for? Oh my God,

476
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:58,020
the broken record of you can be for the
individual. That's what you can be four.

477
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:03,190
So as for staying look, let's say, let's
say Eric's right and I'm wrong, and,

478
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:08,191
and a couple bandits inside the left can
can blow up the machine and fix it and

479
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:11,430
everything else.

480
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,810
And suddenly JFK liberals are
all over the place and you know,

481
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:18,270
they believe in somewhat of
a slim or trim or government,

482
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:20,010
but they don't think governments
the answer to everything.

483
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:23,130
They don't believe in identity
politics, et Cetera, et cetera.

484
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,780
That would be freaking spectacular.
And I will gladly say, man, good.

485
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:31,430
You guys did it. Fantastic.
What I can see is it's, it's,

486
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:35,520
it wouldn't be honest of me to say
that I am part of that anymore.

487
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,610
I'm just not. And not only am I not, but,

488
00:27:38,611 --> 00:27:41,400
but me and all of my crew
that you guys all know,

489
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,270
none of us get invited to anything
on the left by college campuses or

490
00:27:45,271 --> 00:27:48,900
organizations or anything. We get
invited by conservatives and we look,

491
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,750
Eric Weinstein and I spoke
at the iron ran institute.

492
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:54,650
Iron rand is a basically a libertarian
organization. There's a little,

493
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,210
there's obviously more to objectivism
than just that, but they're,

494
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,320
they're pretty far on the right.
Especially on economics. Um, and,

495
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,710
and Eric went up there and said all
sorts of things against libertarianism,

496
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:08,010
against objectivism, against iron rand
and her writing and all sorts of stuff,

497
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,870
and got a huge ovation after.

498
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:13,200
And then we had a cocktail hour and
everybody was having a great time. I mean,

499
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:17,970
you've simply never see that on the
other side. So, and this is also aware,

500
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:21,480
you know, we all get invited on Fox News
and I go on because they don't edit me.

501
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:25,440
And I go on Tucker live and I go on Greg
Gutfeld live and we don't get invited

502
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:29,190
to CNN or MSNBC,
so that it just is what it is.

503
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,400
So I will find allies were allies are,

504
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,120
and if I keep putting my hand out to one
side and they keep biting me and I keep

505
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:38,640
putting up my hand out to another side,
and where I see that they are,

506
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,850
they are malleable. That there, that the
young conservatives look at Kyle cashew,

507
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:46,740
who I had on the show last week
of brilliant young kid. Uh,

508
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:50,270
and they don't care about
gay marriage anymore. They,

509
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,430
they don't really care about marijuana.
I think there,

510
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,910
even though most of them
I think are prolife,

511
00:28:56,911 --> 00:29:01,170
they're willing to have a discussion
about, uh, about abortion.

512
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:04,470
They're willing to have a discussion
about dignity with debt and things of that

513
00:29:04,471 --> 00:29:04,801
nature.

514
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:09,540
So I will go and talk to those people
because they're willing to talk to me.

515
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:13,860
And I'm also, I'm also confident in what
I believe in and what my knowledge is.

516
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,560
And I believe if I sit down with
people, you know, there's this idea,

517
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:20,440
I think people on the left are so afraid
that if you sit down with someone there,

518
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,030
they're going to trick you and you're
going to become one of them. But I'm,

519
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,480
I'm as confident in my ideas
as they probably are in theirs,

520
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,670
and I believe we can have that out.
And I'm not afraid of that.

521
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:32,490
So I think you can make a good argument
the way, as for the third party thing,

522
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,470
look, this is the, this is
the really, really tough part.

523
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:40,110
If you're a libertarian these days,
if you're a libertarian,

524
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,220
I could see why you'd say, you
know what? Forget the Republicans.

525
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:44,950
They keep putting everything else
aside for getting Trump all that.

526
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,800
They always spend more, right.
They talk about smaller government,

527
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:49,870
but they always spend more,
even when they cut taxes,

528
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,730
they're still spending
more including Trump.

529
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:55,300
So I can see why you'd
want to be a third party.

530
00:29:55,301 --> 00:29:58,630
And I thought Larry Sharp did a really
nice job in New York and he busted his

531
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,570
ass. And you know what, he didn't
even get 2%. It's very unfortunate.

532
00:30:01,571 --> 00:30:03,850
He was on my show.
He was on Rogan's show.

533
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:06,820
He didn't get any mainstream
coverage really. Uh, but he really,

534
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,680
really did try and he's a good guy and I,
I,

535
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,770
I hope he has a bright future in front
of them and I'm sure we'll cross paths

536
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:15,910
again. Um, now the inherent
problem with this is, okay,

537
00:30:15,911 --> 00:30:19,300
so if the Libertarian party really
imagine if they really pull it together,

538
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:20,830
they get some great,
you know,

539
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:24,640
dynamic young person and
people to run down ticket too.

540
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:27,550
Because part of their problem is they
do very little down ticket and then they

541
00:30:27,551 --> 00:30:32,050
throw someone for, uh, you know, for
presidency and then it just looks stupid.

542
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,760
Um, that the problem is that, all right,
so let's say they do the most amazing,

543
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,300
uh, returns ever for, for Libertarians.

544
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:45,040
Let's say they get 10% 12%. Well, what
do I mean? You've taken at least eight,

545
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:48,550
9% of that from Republicans and you
guarantee the Democrats win and then,

546
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,240
and then that's not good. Now, I
discussed this with Larry Sharpen.

547
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,890
What he would say is you've got to
do that because otherwise you're,

548
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,840
you'll just never change. And I think
that's an interesting argument, right?

549
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,120
Like you've got to go,
we're going to get 10% this time,

550
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:04,990
but lose knowing that hopefully next time
we'll have a little momentum and maybe

551
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:09,310
we can get it to 18% then maybe after
that we can get it to 28% and then maybe

552
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:13,600
get to a tipping point and we go from
24% to 41% or something like that.

553
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,730
I think that's a totally legit
argument. Um, can we survive, you know,

554
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,950
um, you know, 10, 12,

555
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:25,660
14 years of what that will do
with this new left in charge.

556
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,140
I Dunno. But I would also
say the same point I'm been,

557
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,760
the left is dealing with this themselves.

558
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,380
It's like the old school liberals
who are at this point, um,

559
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,910
and the, and the progressive's have very
little in common. So what is your party,

560
00:31:39,911 --> 00:31:43,060
which isn't going to be run by
and perhaps they need to split,

561
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,930
let the progressive have the far
left stuff, let them have it,

562
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,440
and maybe that is worth and lent
and it's for them, but all right,

563
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:54,460
let them have it and then, and have sort
of the more old school liberal party,

564
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:57,100
let Joe Biden run a party for his
last, you know, it'd be Grandpa,

565
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,680
the old liberals or
whatever. I Dunno. I Dunno.

566
00:31:59,681 --> 00:32:02,140
And then they'd have to deal with fame
reckoning, right. That I just mentioned,

567
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:05,080
because then they would ensure basically
that a Republican party comes back.

568
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,560
So I guess the best answer is that the
both parties would do it at the exact

569
00:32:08,561 --> 00:32:12,700
same time. Pretty rare. It's a tough
question. And it's one of those things,

570
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:16,210
it's like, it's, it's just a matter of
how much risk are you willing to take,

571
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:19,990
I think, uh, in your
decision making. Okay. Uh,

572
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:23,590
any plans on coming to the capital
of decentralized power Switzerland?

573
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,160
I don't know why Switzerland
wasn't on the list here. Uh,

574
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:31,630
I will ask Jordan tonight and I will
find out, hang tight on that one. Um,

575
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,430
let's see.
Uh,

576
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,810
have you considered interviewing
conservatives who are
more skeptical of a free

577
00:32:37,811 --> 00:32:40,100
market economics like Roger
Scruton or Peter Hitchens?

578
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,220
I'd love to interview scrutiny.
Uh, Jordan had lunch with,

579
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,470
or dinner with him a couple
of days ago and I was invited,

580
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,430
but I ended up going back to London
to do something. Um, but we're,

581
00:32:49,431 --> 00:32:51,890
we're connected now, so hang tight.
I hope I can work that one out.

582
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:54,410
And Peter Hitchens and I,
we've traded a couple emails.

583
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:57,530
I really wanted to do it in
studio. Like, you know what,

584
00:32:57,531 --> 00:33:00,410
maybe I can do it next time.
I'm, uh, I'm in London,

585
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:01,880
I think he lives in London
and I actually have,

586
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:05,120
I have a day off in London tomorrow. I'm
doing something really cool. Actually,

587
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:09,470
if you guys remember my, um, my
interview with Katherine Verbal Sing,

588
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:13,370
which was in August, uh, she is, uh,

589
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,800
she's an educator who created
her own charter school,

590
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,170
the Mckayla school here in London.

591
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,770
And they're doing just great work
helping kids get out of poverty,

592
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,630
helping families, uh, really showing what
personal responsibility is all about.

593
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:31,340
Their kids are getting great
grades. They're, they're
actually teaching and it's,

594
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:35,300
and it sounds like it's just a wonderful
school and I was totally inspired by

595
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:39,350
her, so I'm going to go take a tour of
the school tomorrow with her and then, uh,

596
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,830
I'm going to speak to some of the kids in
the afternoon, which is pretty cool. Um,

597
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,890
but maybe I can reach out to Peter and
see if I can at least maybe just meet

598
00:33:45,891 --> 00:33:50,570
them for coffee or tea as they have here
and in London. And then we will see. Um,

599
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:55,430
let's see. Uh, hey Dave, do you think the
Phoenix rising from the ashes scenario,

600
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:59,060
we'll actually need to happen through
a complete leftist takeover as ran

601
00:33:59,061 --> 00:34:03,890
projects. Uh, whereas ran projects in
atlas shrugged. Do you think leftists,

602
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:07,700
we'll have to see the toxicity of their
policies play out before they're willing

603
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:12,200
to abandon them. Yeah. You know,
it's like, and that's why I say it,

604
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:13,340
I started at the beginning of this thing,

605
00:34:13,341 --> 00:34:15,170
I think by the Democrats
getting the House here,

606
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:19,730
but we're going to get is sort of just
this slow descent into more of this

607
00:34:19,731 --> 00:34:23,370
nonsense where I would say at this point
the most healthy thing would have been

608
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:28,310
a destruction of a weird couple of years
where they would've had to reconstitute

609
00:34:28,311 --> 00:34:31,040
the party and have a read,
have the real fight.

610
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,450
Like we're not doing anything real right
now. We're not having the real fights.

611
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:38,750
We should be, we should be willing
to have real political fights,

612
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,920
not just sort of political bickering over,
over winning points.

613
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,310
Um, so I think yes, like, well again,

614
00:34:46,311 --> 00:34:49,580
this is why this tweet that the women's
march just sent down from White Women

615
00:34:49,581 --> 00:34:52,550
Watch out,
white women were looking at you.

616
00:34:52,551 --> 00:34:54,260
If you don't do what we want you to do,

617
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,500
it's why it's so dangerous
and so actually racist and,

618
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:03,830
and, and it's inherently anti freedom. Um,

619
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:07,130
so I think that enough of them
will have to start seeing that.

620
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:08,030
Like if the next move,

621
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:11,120
what the left does is it eats a group
and then eats a group and then eats a

622
00:35:11,121 --> 00:35:13,430
group and then eats a group
and then eats a group. Well,

623
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:16,700
if the next move now is
they've sort of white men,

624
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:19,040
they've been going after white men for
a long time. If the next move is right,

625
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:19,880
we're going to go after white women.

626
00:35:19,881 --> 00:35:22,880
Maybe some white women will start waking
up and go, wait a minute, wait a minute.

627
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,260
I don't, I don't have to vote.
If I'm prolife let's say,

628
00:35:27,261 --> 00:35:29,210
and I'm conservative on this or that or,

629
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:32,910
and I want lower taxes and
states' rights and, uh,

630
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,620
whatever it is, I don't have to
be part of the women's March.

631
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:42,180
I don't have to, and I won't be guilted
into it. And then when you corner them,

632
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:45,810
they start coming out stronger. So I think
that that's, that's possible. I mean,

633
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,360
think about it, the women's March.
So that means there are four women,

634
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,120
or are they for Nikki Haley,
who I think is, you know,

635
00:35:51,121 --> 00:35:54,000
I'd probably vote for president and
who I think is one of the strongest,

636
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:58,170
you're Republican governor
of South Carolina goes into
the UN and is the u s rep

637
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:01,210
there and just cracked skulls.
Um,

638
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:05,970
and who has just been a spectacular
fighter for American values and who comes

639
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:09,390
from an immigrant family and all of
these things that America is all about.

640
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:13,320
Are they for her? They're not. So
don't tell me you're for women,

641
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:18,060
you're for women who behave as
you wish them to behave. Um,

642
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:19,943
let's see.

643
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:24,930
How much do you think late night comedy
shows like Stephen Colbert, John Oliver,

644
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:28,710
Samantha Bee Affect election results?
I would say very little. Very little.

645
00:36:28,711 --> 00:36:32,880
I can't imagine, you know, I think
they're mostly preaching to the choir. Uh,

646
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:37,860
one of the things that I'm so proud of
is that I still to this day and always

647
00:36:37,861 --> 00:36:38,730
for the last couple of years,

648
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,760
I get emails from people of every
political persuasion in every country,

649
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,990
gay, straight, black, blah,
blah, blah, doesn't matter,

650
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,910
but that are all over the place.
Some that are,

651
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,730
that are now waking up to what
they see with, you know, I'm left.

652
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,980
I've been a lefty my whole life.
I'm now waking up to this.

653
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:59,880
And then I get emails from Christian
conservatives and I get emails from

654
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:03,480
Libertarians and all of these different
people who are all at different stages

655
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:04,170
of this.

656
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:09,170
And I think part of the reason for that
is that we're having honest conversation

657
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:13,620
here. I am not, I'm telling you what
I think for better or worse, you're,

658
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:16,530
you're sharing your questions
with me or your comments.

659
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,390
We're doing this in long form.

660
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,830
You can hear something that I'm doing and
then take an idea and then perhaps Sam

661
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,680
Harris is going to talk about it in a
different way or in a way that I disagree

662
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:30,570
with on his podcast. You're going to see
Eric Weinstein and I disagree on things.

663
00:37:30,571 --> 00:37:35,310
You're going to watch Joe Rogan and I
talk about different things and you're

664
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:37,110
going to be able to
formulate your thoughts.

665
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,200
Those shows are not really
places of formulating thought.

666
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,670
They're all sort of that, that, uh, that,
uh, Trump that, that a, that a Trump like,

667
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,420
it's not that interesting or funny or
amusing. So I don't think people really,

668
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:52,560
I think a certain amount of people may
be guilted into voting a little bit by

669
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,650
them, but I don't think people really pay
attention to it, which is, which is nice.

670
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,900
Uh, Dave, when will AI become an election
issue? Oh Man, what a great question. Um,

671
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,070
I would say that by 20,

672
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,600
let's say by 2024, it'll be the
big one. I don't think it'll,

673
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:15,000
I don't think by, in two years, in
2020 it'll be a big issue. It'll,

674
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,780
it'll have move forward a
little bit for sure. Um,

675
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:21,480
and with more automation comes more
issues about the economy and minimum wage

676
00:38:21,481 --> 00:38:24,000
and all sorts of things
and ubi and whatever else.

677
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,720
But I don't think it'll be huge in
two years. I would say the election,

678
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:32,280
the presidential election
after that. So say 20, 24, I
think that'll be bicycle. Uh,

679
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,710
how do I get you to come to my school?
So I'm going all over the place. Uh,

680
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:40,630
and when I'm, when I'm not with JP, I'm
traveling and doing schools by myself. Uh,

681
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:45,010
you can go to Dave rubin.com/contact
and, uh, putting the request,

682
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:47,980
I send it over to my agents and
then as long as we can work it out,

683
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:51,640
works with my schedule and everything
else, we're good to go. Um,

684
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:56,470
let's see. Dave, take a break
and place them pub g with me.

685
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:01,480
I don't know what that
is. I'm getting old. Um,

686
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,900
are you excited for super smash brothers
ultimate or is that not your thing?

687
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,140
I've played smash brothers a bunch and
you know, as I always tell you guys,

688
00:39:08,141 --> 00:39:11,590
I don't really have time for
video games anymore. Um, I,

689
00:39:11,591 --> 00:39:13,420
I completely like little
bites here and there.

690
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:18,220
I've been playing a little NBA live,
uh, with my brother and my nephew. Um,

691
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,310
but I don't have really time. But,
so a game like smash brothers,

692
00:39:21,311 --> 00:39:24,120
I can play a quick cause I can play it
with a couple of friends right there and

693
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,290
we can do it and it's totally fun.
Um,

694
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,770
people keep asking for my playstation
names so that we can connect on there.

695
00:39:29,771 --> 00:39:33,520
Maybe, maybe one day when I like
take a weird, you know, all this,

696
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:34,271
when I go off the grid,

697
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,390
maybe I would take like two days and
make them like video game days and I'll,

698
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,270
I'll play with you guys all over the
place. That actually could be kind of fun.

699
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:44,560
Um, oh, I do want to give you a
little, uh, a little career, uh,

700
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,820
tip or not tip.

701
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:48,760
I want to give you a little career hint
as to something good that's happened,

702
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:51,280
but I'll wait, uh, towards
the end to do that.

703
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,400
But a lot of good things are
happening. All right. Let's see. Uh,

704
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,550
I've been saying for a long time that if
Trump would dial back the rhetoric from

705
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:01,750
an 11 to an eight and reduce
the personal ad hominem attacks,

706
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,320
he would attract another 10 to 20% of
the electorate from the middle that

707
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:08,950
dismisses him because of the
behavior. Your thoughts. Yeah.

708
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:13,150
I basically agree with you now. I
think he sort of, at some level,

709
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,470
he sort of needed to do it.
When he was running the first time,

710
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,080
he had to break through
the political correctness.

711
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:23,950
He had to break through the main stream
media. He had to garner the attention.

712
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:26,110
All of those things.
Now that he's president,

713
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,930
especially because things
are going basically, okay,

714
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:31,600
the economy is chugging along.
We're not going into extra wars.

715
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,530
We're redoing some of the trade
deals, things of that nature. Okay.

716
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,680
Be Things we're basically
going, okay, you know,

717
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:41,890
net neutrality and no one's been killed.
The Paris accords were not dying,

718
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,980
et Cetera, et cetera.
It would be interesting,

719
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:47,890
and this is why I was saying if
the Republicans would have won,

720
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:52,630
that might've given him enough breathing
room to start doing that dial back.

721
00:40:52,631 --> 00:40:56,350
Some of the rhetoric, you don't
have to just be the troll in chief.

722
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,280
So hopefully I think there's still a
way for him to do that because if the

723
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:04,900
Democrats now go, you know, feel really
emboldened and they think, all right,

724
00:41:04,901 --> 00:41:08,830
well now we can, we can attack Trump.
We can still try for impeachment,

725
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:12,190
even though it would be an impossibility.
Whatever else it is. And then Trump,

726
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:14,590
imagine if he steps back.
Sorry about that light over there.

727
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:18,790
Imagine if he steps back and it's
like, you know what? I'm going to,

728
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,370
I'm going to be the more mature
party here. I can't believe it.

729
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,910
Nobody else could believe it, but
I'm going to try it. That would,

730
00:41:24,911 --> 00:41:28,810
I think help him that he's not
the people that want the trolling,

731
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:31,360
the people that want to own the
live towards and all that stuff.

732
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:35,060
He's got them pretty much not going to
lose them because those people aren't

733
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:37,640
gonna go to the left.
So you got those guys.

734
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:41,780
So there's a way to get the other people
that are concerned with digital subtly.

735
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:45,650
I think about sort of the trolling and
some of the rhetoric and that kind of

736
00:41:45,651 --> 00:41:48,470
stuff. I know plenty of those people
because I think there's actually,

737
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,200
I think you know, the 10 to 20%
you mentioned here, I think,

738
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:54,770
I think that's a pretty fair number
because I know plenty of people right now,

739
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,110
lefties, liberals, let's say,

740
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,490
who when I talk to privately they're like,
you know,

741
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,110
I don't think things
that are bad right now.

742
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,390
I think things were kind
of all right actually,

743
00:42:05,391 --> 00:42:08,070
and I have a little more money
in my paycheck and my Ira,

744
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:12,020
these are 401k is doing
right or blah, blah, blah,
investments are doing all right.

745
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:16,760
Um, but I don't like the rhetoric
and they can't get over that,

746
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,850
so why keep giving it
to them? I don't. And,

747
00:42:18,851 --> 00:42:23,851
and it would be nice if we had a little
more return to normalcy in terms of the

748
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:26,630
rhetoric because again,
I don't think we can last on this,

749
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,130
this sort of crazy tenor forever. I just
don't think it's possible. All right,

750
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:35,960
we've got
15 minutes reminder,

751
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:40,190
paypal. I'm doing stand up again.
I don't know why, but it's been,

752
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:43,730
it's been awesome. We've sold out
every single show that we've done. Uh,

753
00:42:43,731 --> 00:42:46,760
and they're great. I do about an hour
stand up. I get you guys involved.

754
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:49,910
We do giveaways and it's fine. It's
like no standups are you've ever seen.

755
00:42:49,911 --> 00:42:51,740
I promise you a,

756
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:56,170
so I will be in a Braya
California on November 13th.

757
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,640
The link is right down below
and then I'll be in Oxnard,

758
00:42:58,641 --> 00:43:01,400
California on the 14th
link right down below.

759
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,840
I've got an IDW character joining me for
both shows and I'm hearing a rumor that

760
00:43:05,841 --> 00:43:08,330
there might be a second one.
So I do hope you'll join me.

761
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,650
And if you join at patrion.com/rubin
report on a level three or higher,

762
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,080
you get a free meet and greet.
I will shake your hand.

763
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:18,500
I will take a picture with you. Sometimes
people hugged me, which is always,

764
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:20,120
as long as you don't hug for too long,

765
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,360
there's always that moment where the
hug goes from like, oh, that's nice.

766
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:26,440
You're a stranger.
You're showing me affection to like La.

767
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:30,560
We better ease up on that. Um, but
yeah, so we can do all that. Let's see.

768
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:32,151
Democrats,

769
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,430
bed power in California for decades and
things have gotten worse for the middle

770
00:43:35,431 --> 00:43:39,920
class. What hope do you see in California
now that Newson will be governor? Yeah,

771
00:43:39,921 --> 00:43:42,020
I mean, I'm not very hopeful actually. Uh,

772
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:46,130
which is ironic because I love
living in Los Angeles and, uh,

773
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,520
I can tell you that even
in ELA there has been an,

774
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,960
he's just becoming governor now,

775
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,710
but the amount of homeless people
has increased tremendously. Um, will,

776
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:59,450
last time I was in Berkeley, uh, our car
got broken into on a pretty nice street.

777
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:00,410
We were at a steak joint.

778
00:44:00,411 --> 00:44:03,370
The car got broken into basically in front
of the state, join Morton steakhouse,

779
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:07,970
so like a nice place and they
stole, stole my bag. Um, my,

780
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,540
my, uh, sisters, parents, uh,

781
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:15,770
my sisters parents in law, uh, were
visiting from out of the country.

782
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,340
They were in Berkeley just a couple of
weeks ago and they got mugged in broad

783
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:19,730
daylight.

784
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:24,590
They literally ripped the rings off
my brother-in-law's mother's fingers.

785
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:28,640
Um, pretty violent. I mean, she was
bruised the whole, the whole thing. Um,

786
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:32,730
so I think there's some bad trends
in California for sure. I mean in,

787
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:36,450
in San Francisco they've got an app
to tell you where human poop is on the

788
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:41,100
street. I am not making that up. Um, I
saw somebody shooting up in Berkeley,

789
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,770
like on a, on a side street. Um,

790
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,180
so there's a lot of trends that are bad
in California. Goo Newsome got good hair,

791
00:44:48,181 --> 00:44:52,110
he's got a nice smile as all the right
things, but he's for big government,

792
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:55,770
he thinks that government can resolve
all of these things and I don't think

793
00:44:55,771 --> 00:45:00,690
government can, I think
government basically makes
all of these things worse. Um,

794
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,360
so I'm not very hopeful unfortunately
for California cause it,

795
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:06,840
which sucks because I love living in
California and you can't beat the weather

796
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,280
and I really do like the people.

797
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,450
And in La there's a resurgence of some
interesting political conversation

798
00:45:12,451 --> 00:45:14,760
happening. I mean, you know,

799
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:18,410
Shapiro's here in La and Dennis Prager's
here in La and Peter teals here in La

800
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:20,290
and Sam Harris is here in La and,

801
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,590
and plenty of other people
out here in La Right now.

802
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:27,580
So there is an interesting
interview, cool. A set
happening in La and I, you know,

803
00:45:27,581 --> 00:45:30,700
it's just unfortunate, but, uh, if
somebody wants me to move to Texas,

804
00:45:30,701 --> 00:45:35,290
make me an offer. I can't
refuse a, okay, let's see. Um,

805
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:42,610
uh, oh, pub g is player unknown
battleground for ps four.

806
00:45:42,611 --> 00:45:44,020
I don't know what it is,
but I'll check it out.

807
00:45:44,021 --> 00:45:47,020
But if someone give me like a contrast
style game that I can just blow some

808
00:45:47,021 --> 00:45:50,920
stuff up and hopefully it's
a side scroller I would love
to or, or a more like a,

809
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:54,310
like a life force. Gravity is kind of
shooter, but I want to go that way.

810
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:57,310
I don't want to go that way. Can't go
that way. Don't want to go this way.

811
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:00,340
I want to go that way. Or I guess I'd go
that way, but can't do it the other way.

812
00:46:00,970 --> 00:46:05,320
Um, do, do, do. All right, let's see. Um,

813
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:09,700
are there any future endeavors with
Brett, Eric and or Heather? Well,

814
00:46:09,701 --> 00:46:12,430
I don't want to give away too much,
but I just told you that, uh, you know,

815
00:46:12,431 --> 00:46:16,780
potentially there are some IDW people
joining me for my standup Gigs November

816
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,480
13th in, uh, in Braya and November,

817
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,300
November 14 in Oxnard.
Uh,

818
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:26,290
so you might want to check out one of
those shows. You know what I'm saying?

819
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,550
Uh, and, uh, oh,

820
00:46:28,551 --> 00:46:31,460
and actually Brett's going to be on the
show in a couple of days when I get back

821
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,700
also. So, uh, so they,
so, uh, yeah, so we're,

822
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:37,670
I'm going to keep talking to
these guys who now, you know,

823
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:40,370
we definitely have some political diff
disagreements with and it's all good.

824
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:43,880
It's all good people. Um, okay, let's see.

825
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:46,880
Um,
there we go.

826
00:46:46,881 --> 00:46:49,610
We got about 12 minutes left and
then I gotta I gotta get dressed.

827
00:46:49,611 --> 00:46:53,420
I got to meet JP, ensure he's on his
like ate steak of the day. You know,

828
00:46:53,421 --> 00:46:55,940
the guy's only eating steak and a,

829
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:58,700
and basically in club soda
and salt these days. Uh,

830
00:46:58,701 --> 00:47:01,400
so he eats a tremendous amount of steak.
I'm Stilli,

831
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,340
I'm still doing this Paleo
thing as much as I can. Um,

832
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,280
but I've been eating a lot of state
cause I hang out with the guy that, uh,

833
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:11,870
let's see. Um, who do
you see running in 2020?

834
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,830
That has the power to actually unite the
country from where we're standing today?

835
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:24,803
Yeah.

836
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:25,823
I don't know.

837
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,130
I don't know if there is somebody
right now that can do it.

838
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:33,970
I don't think there's anyone in sort
of traditional politics that can do it.

839
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:38,890
Um, this isn't the right
answer, but I'll get,

840
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:42,250
I'll sort of throw this one
out is just like the idea, um,

841
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:46,390
if there was somebody that was like
a Schwartzenegger, now I don't,

842
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,880
it's not going to be him. And obviously
he wasn't even born in the United States,

843
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:52,180
so it's not a possibility.
But somebody that was basically a,

844
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:54,160
that had a certain amount of star power,

845
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:57,370
a little bit of political history.

846
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:00,460
He was the governor of
California obviously. Um,

847
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,370
and that was basically
a moderate Republican.

848
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:07,900
I think that would be the ticket to do
it, but it's not sure. It's an anger.

849
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:10,180
So I don't know. Is there
anyone else like that? Like,

850
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:13,840
I don't want it to be Clooney or just
like some actor that comes in and does it.

851
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:15,190
I don't think that's the right thing.

852
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:19,480
I don't know that there's anyone that's
a career politician at the moment.

853
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,030
It would have to be someone pretty,

854
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,900
pretty centrist that I think had a basic
belief in the constitution and wanted

855
00:48:28,421 --> 00:48:31,840
to rein in government a little bit and,

856
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,120
and wasn't really playing
identity politics but,

857
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:38,650
but was willing to give the dems
something on the other side.

858
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:42,550
I don't know. I don't know who that is.
You got any good ideas? Let me know. Uh,

859
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:44,740
okay. Let's jump back in. So
we've got about 10 more minutes.

860
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,000
I'll take some more on a,

861
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:50,800
on super chat as well if you want to
just jump in there. Um, let's see.

862
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:53,140
Perhaps it's not just big
government that's the problem.

863
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:58,030
Perhaps it's big organizations prob
problem of imbalance of scale between an

864
00:48:58,031 --> 00:49:01,570
organization, its power in the powers
of the individual. Well, look, this is,

865
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,990
this is why I love talking about the
youtube situation in the Google situation

866
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:09,100
so much because it's about, it's about
authoritative powers in the government.

867
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,410
Usually is the ultimate one of those,
right?

868
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,550
But when we have a company like Google
that controls the amount of information

869
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:20,551
and infrastructure and wires and
pipes and everything that they have,

870
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:24,310
of course they can become
a problem as well. I mean,

871
00:49:24,311 --> 00:49:26,290
I've addressed that many times.
The issue is,

872
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,440
well then do you want to give more power
to the government to then decapitate

873
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:35,740
some of that power? That's
a, that's a tough question.

874
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:37,420
And I've heard good
arguments on both sides.

875
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:42,370
I tend to think the answer is no because
once you give power over to something,

876
00:49:42,371 --> 00:49:44,890
be it the government or
a private organization,

877
00:49:44,891 --> 00:49:48,100
it's very rare that it gives the
power back and there's always a unique

878
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:53,050
situation. So it's like Google
strikes me as a truly, truly,

879
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:54,790
truly unique situation,

880
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,320
but that's probably the same thing that
people said about Microsoft in 1987 or,

881
00:49:59,321 --> 00:50:01,150
you know,
plenty of other things over the years.

882
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:05,110
So this is where I'm still more interested
in letting the market figure it out.

883
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,330
But does the,

884
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:10,990
could there be some touch
from the government that makes
some sense? Uh, you know,

885
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:13,120
I'm willing to have that conversation.
And you know,

886
00:50:13,121 --> 00:50:15,970
that's say where Eric Weinstein,
we've discussed it on air, uh,

887
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,180
the last livestream came a
month or two ago. Um, so yeah,

888
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:21,010
there's good people on both sides of that.
And I think it's,

889
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,780
I think it's a totally fair
question. Um, let's see here.

890
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:28,140
I'll jump back into the patrion a moment.
Uh,

891
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,880
any advice on how I should
introduce my friends to the IDW?

892
00:50:32,450 --> 00:50:35,270
Um, you know, I had found her,

893
00:50:35,271 --> 00:50:38,000
one of the things that people
say to me all the time, uh,

894
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,120
when I meet people at these shows or come
up to you at the airport or whatever,

895
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,950
is that the,
the Prager u video,

896
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:47,950
why I left the left is I think it's
their number one video ever actually. Um,

897
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:51,470
and they had some major people on there
and it's, it's pretty awesome that it is.

898
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:56,450
And I think it sort of encapsulates
what initially brought the IDW together,

899
00:50:56,451 --> 00:50:59,150
even though of course some of those folks
still consider themselves part of the

900
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:01,610
left, as I talked about earlier. Um,

901
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:06,190
I would say that that video, if you
can get that to somebody, look, it's,

902
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:09,950
it's pleasant. It's whatever it
is, three or four minutes. Um,

903
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,690
they don't have to agree with everything,

904
00:51:11,691 --> 00:51:15,080
but I think I talk about
the right issues in a con,

905
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:20,590
in a competent and clear way that I
think will open them up to some of these

906
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,480
ideas. And then from there, uh,

907
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:26,720
then I would say you should
have them watch, you know,

908
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:30,860
it's like you want to kind of ease them
into some of this stuff I suppose. Um,

909
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,710
you know, another good one that,
well the video that we did,

910
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:36,650
our only animated video that we've ever
done, what is the classical liberal,

911
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:40,430
you could show them that. And then I think
that also could frame a little bit of,

912
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:42,740
uh, these issues for them. And then,

913
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,840
and then just sort of get them in
on some of these conversations. Um,

914
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,870
maybe my first conversation
with Sam Harris,

915
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,540
cause that's kind of where
it all started with me. Um,

916
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:54,620
pick one of the conversations with
Jordan Peterson. Um, you know,

917
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:58,460
any of the ones with Eric. Um, and then
there's the ones that are straight up,

918
00:51:58,461 --> 00:51:59,630
less political.
Let's say.

919
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:02,900
You could have them listen
to the conversation with
Bret Weinstein as he was in

920
00:52:02,901 --> 00:52:06,770
the midst of the evergreen situation or
the conversation with James Damore as he

921
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:10,100
was in the midst of the Google situation
or the conversation with Lindsay

922
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,600
Shepherd as she was in the midst of
the Wilfred Laurier situation. Um,

923
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,310
my conversation a couple of weeks with
Coleman Hughes I think is a good fit. Um,

924
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,440
you know,
I think more than anything else,

925
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:26,950
show people that there are some other
folks out there who are willing to talk,

926
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:28,820
who are willing to listen,

927
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:34,030
who don't want to braid and harangue and
dismantle society who are just trying

928
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,020
to figure it out just like they are.

929
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:39,800
And it's getting harder and harder and I
suspect it's going to just keep getting

930
00:52:39,801 --> 00:52:42,200
harder and harder now.
You know, it's like,

931
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,820
there's no doubt right now that the
sides are just going to keep going.

932
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:52,160
So it's like those of us that want to
live with some people who are different

933
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:55,490
than us that don't think we have a right
to take from some and give to others

934
00:52:55,491 --> 00:52:58,190
and all of that.
And I do think that's most of us,

935
00:52:58,191 --> 00:52:59,780
those of us who want to live and let live,

936
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:04,460
those of us who don't care what your
neighbor smokes in his house or who your

937
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:09,080
other neighbors sleeping with or whatever
else, it's like that is most of us.

938
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:10,730
That is the beauty of America.

939
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:15,760
Everyone has come here from everywhere
for hundreds of years now and made a

940
00:53:15,771 --> 00:53:18,890
better life for themselves.
You person watching this right now,

941
00:53:18,891 --> 00:53:21,820
I guarantee you you have a better life.
If you live in America,

942
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:26,550
then your grandparents did. You can
say that with almost 99% certainty,

943
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:29,640
and if you don't, it's actually a
great argument against leftism too,

944
00:53:29,641 --> 00:53:32,910
because they hate accumulated wealth
going out down from generation to

945
00:53:32,911 --> 00:53:34,470
generation.
So if you screwed up,

946
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:37,070
if your grandparents were really
rich and you're really poor,

947
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:39,030
that's also a great argument for our evil,

948
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:42,690
capitalistic Patriarchy
because of accumulated wealth
doesn't always stay right.

949
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,600
So, uh, it's pretty damn good here.

950
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:49,530
And let's not forget that in the name
of trying to go for some Utopian society

951
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:51,720
that's never existed.
You can try to make it better,

952
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:54,060
but that doesn't mean you have
to destroy the whole damn thing.

953
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:58,500
It's a hell of lot easier to destroy
rather than create. So these people,

954
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,880
and that's one of the things,

955
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,040
it's like these people who
have never done anything,

956
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:06,000
all of these think piece writers and these
huff polarizers and buzzfeed writers,

957
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,570
they've never done anything.
They'd never hired anyone.

958
00:54:09,571 --> 00:54:13,190
They've never created
anything. And it's like, Oh,

959
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,830
if only they could run the
world, everything would be okay.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

960
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,664
no.

961
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:22,080
Let's scale back the power that we have
over each other so that we can all live

962
00:54:22,081 --> 00:54:23,490
as freely as possible,

963
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,180
and you can decide how much good
you want to do for your community,

964
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:31,440
for yourself or other people, et Cetera,
et cetera. Um, that you could argue,

965
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:32,820
I suppose it's a little utopian,

966
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:35,700
but it's Utopian within the
confines of us having to be free.

967
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,630
And then we can discuss on the margins
how much should we be taxed because I do

968
00:54:39,631 --> 00:54:40,680
believe we have to be taxed.

969
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:45,330
How much should we have for defense or
how much should we have her, this or that?

970
00:54:45,331 --> 00:54:47,160
How much would should we
have for infrastructure?

971
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:51,570
Can some of this be done by a
private enterprise, etc. Etc.

972
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,430
These are all the things we can discuss.

973
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,750
And I think you guys that are watching
or listening to this do want to discuss

974
00:54:57,751 --> 00:54:59,570
these things and you want
to get to mature answers.

975
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:03,870
So I'm going to keep doing the people
that I think, uh, have the right answers,

976
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:06,000
or at least our thinking about the
right answers are willing to have

977
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:10,160
conversations about the right
answers. All right, let's see. Uh,

978
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,780
someone that I think Dwayne, the Rock
Johnson would be great. You know,

979
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:14,430
a couple people have
tweeted that at me lately.

980
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,230
I don't know exactly
where his politics are,

981
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:19,860
but could he be the type of person that
comes from the and Schwartzenegger or

982
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:23,870
mold? Almost literally in this
case maybe, but like it, right.

983
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,820
Does it all have to be so celebrity-driven
and what does that really say about

984
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:30,780
society? I'm not sure. Oh,
and someone said, Bro, force,

985
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:35,100
awesome side scrolling multiplayer
shooter. I haven't, uh, it's totally fun.

986
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:37,170
I've been playing, you know, four
player, especially when you're,

987
00:55:37,171 --> 00:55:38,400
you're playing with a couple of friends.

988
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:41,010
It's just like complete
chaos and nuttiness uh,

989
00:55:41,011 --> 00:55:44,460
it's almost like a little too much for
me cause there's so many explosions

990
00:55:44,461 --> 00:55:47,670
happening at the exact
same time. Um, okay.

991
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,900
Let me tell you a little bit
about, uh, some career stuff
that's a, that's cooking.

992
00:55:51,901 --> 00:55:54,960
So there's a lot of good things cooking.
And as I said, being on this tour with,

993
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:58,020
uh, with Jordan has, it's been
light, it truly life changing.

994
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:02,080
I've enjoyed every second of it.
Um, I've connected with people ice.

995
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,150
Last night in Denmark,

996
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:08,151
I saw Flemming Rose Fleming Guaipe had
on the show who is the publisher of in

997
00:56:08,581 --> 00:56:13,290
the Danish magazine of the Mohammad
cartoons. I think that was 2003.

998
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:15,340
Um, he is, uh,

999
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:20,370
a spectacular advocate for free speech
and free expression and just the most

1000
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:23,950
decent warm guy you're ever going to meet.
Uh,

1001
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:28,150
so I had dinner with him last night. I
had dinner with Douglas Murray last week.

1002
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:32,560
I'm going to try to see Majid maybe
tomorrow. I've connected with old friends,

1003
00:56:32,561 --> 00:56:36,350
high school friends. I've, I've gone
out with fans after the show. Um,

1004
00:56:36,370 --> 00:56:39,310
I've met all sorts of people. I'm,
I'm really just having a blast. I,

1005
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:40,510
I feel good as long as,

1006
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:43,390
as long as I keep basically eating
right and trying to get to the gym.

1007
00:56:43,391 --> 00:56:45,970
Every now and again.
I've been walking around these cities.

1008
00:56:45,971 --> 00:56:48,280
It's giving me perspective on the world.
You know,

1009
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:50,590
I never thought I was going to go
to all of these countries like this.

1010
00:56:50,591 --> 00:56:52,120
And even though some of
them are only for a day,

1011
00:56:52,121 --> 00:56:56,750
it's like you get a little flavor
of how other people, you know,

1012
00:56:56,751 --> 00:57:00,670
you see just differently or look
differently or whatever it is.

1013
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:03,910
It's been totally inspiring and I
think it's, I think it's helping.

1014
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:08,080
It's helping me sharpen my,
my tools to do what I do.

1015
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,960
And hopefully I can do maybe
more international shows.

1016
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:15,070
And I think actually if Jordan and I
do end up extending this into march and

1017
00:57:15,071 --> 00:57:16,480
April,
which it sounds like we will,

1018
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:19,320
I'm thinking about doing more shows
on the road. Like really we'll,

1019
00:57:19,321 --> 00:57:23,920
we'll start renting, uh, you know,
[inaudible] that whole thing. Uh,

1020
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:26,320
but I do get some great news last week.
So you guys know,

1021
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:30,520
or most of you know that I've been
talking about this book forever. Um, so I,

1022
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:32,080
I haven't,
uh,

1023
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:34,720
I don't want to give you too much right
this moment cause there will be an

1024
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:39,190
announcement I think in about a week or
so. Um, but my book has been picked up.

1025
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,250
It is by a Primo, Primo
publisher. And the whole thing,

1026
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:47,140
the way the whole deal has worked out is,
is beyond a dream come true.

1027
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,210
Uh, I'm working on it. We're,

1028
00:57:49,211 --> 00:57:53,050
I don't want to give you publishing dates
and all that yet. Um, but I'm super,

1029
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:58,000
super site. Uh, it's a, uh, this thing's
going to be a frequent labor or love.

1030
00:57:58,350 --> 00:57:58,690
Um,

1031
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:03,690
a lot of it also for me was I wanted
to get through this current election,

1032
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:08,080
uh, because I wanted to publish it
sometime between the midterms and the

1033
00:58:08,081 --> 00:58:10,840
presidential election.
Not that it's purely about politics,

1034
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,190
but I thought there'll be an interesting
moment for the country in there. Uh,

1035
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,590
so now that we're past that, I can focus
in on, on it a little bit different,

1036
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:21,520
but we have a closed the
deal with publishers. So I'm
really psyched about that.

1037
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:25,300
And that's one of the ancillary benefits
I think of doing this show with, uh,

1038
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:30,310
this tour with Jordan because it's like
I'm willing to bust my ass to promote it

1039
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,360
and do the right thing and get back out
on the road and, and share these ideas.

1040
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,840
And I gotta tell you, there's one other
thing about Jordan. I mean, you know,

1041
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:40,120
he says it often because it
comes up in the Q and A's.

1042
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:44,860
We do about a 40 minute Q and a at the
end of the show. And people will ask, um,

1043
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:49,870
you know, like, do you ever get tired
or, or are you, how do you stay inspired?

1044
00:58:49,871 --> 00:58:51,310
And he's like,
he's like,

1045
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:55,780
I'm sharing my ideas all over the world
and millions of people are buying my

1046
00:58:55,781 --> 00:58:58,990
books and I come to speak to
thousands of great people like you.

1047
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:02,470
Like what could be better than this?
And you know,

1048
00:59:02,471 --> 00:59:05,650
I get a little of that extra glow from,
from his people,

1049
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:07,240
but I get it from you guys all the time.

1050
00:59:07,241 --> 00:59:11,080
And this thing is continually growing and
I'm doing the best I can and I'll make

1051
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:13,750
mistakes along the way.
But, uh, you know, I think,

1052
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:15,250
I think we're on to something
really great. And I,

1053
00:59:15,251 --> 00:59:16,840
since we're just at the beginning again,

1054
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:20,650
which is crazy because how could that be?

1055
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,490
But maybe that's sort of what life is.

1056
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:24,770
You keep working and working
and working in this somehow.

1057
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:27,220
Don't always know what you're
working for. And then there's, whoa,

1058
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:30,200
there's a new beginning and then you go
this way and then there's another new

1059
00:59:30,201 --> 00:59:31,880
beginning and you go this way.
But if you,

1060
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:34,760
if you do what you can do with a little,

1061
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:38,960
with some rigor and some passion and
some honesty, I think good things,

1062
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,040
good things come. I guess that Peterson
guy has worn off a warrant on maven that,

1063
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,350
um, all right guys, we did
about an hour. Uh, I got to a,

1064
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,730
I got to get myself ready for the
big show in Birmingham tonight. Uh,

1065
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,010
we will be in Oslo tomorrow.

1066
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:58,640
We are in Denmark the day after that
and then we are in Finland the day after

1067
00:59:58,641 --> 00:59:59,001
that.

1068
00:59:59,001 --> 01:00:04,001
And then I take a crazy stop
flight 12 hours some situation,

1069
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,730
uh, back to la on the 12th. Uh,

1070
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,020
Braya stand up on the 13th link is right
down below Oxnard on the 14th link is

1071
01:00:12,021 --> 01:00:12,950
right down below.

1072
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,010
And then there's some other standup
stuff that's listed in there and all that

1073
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:19,910
good stuff. Anyway, thanks
as always. And uh, okay.

1074
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:24,470
I'm going to enjoy my hotel room for
15 minutes before I go meet Jordan.

1075
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:25,740
All right, Ciao guys. See Ya.
