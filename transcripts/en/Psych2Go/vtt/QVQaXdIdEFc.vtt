00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.740
We all have a creative genius inside of us.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.320
Just like Howard Gardner's multiple intelligence
theory, creativity is also measured in many

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.910
unique ways.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.640
This means that the creative process works
differently for everyone.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.910
Are you wondering what yours looks like?

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.210
Here are the five types of creative thinkers;
one: The lateral thinker.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.099
This is probably the most common type people
think of when they first hear the word "Creativity".

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.930
Lateral thinkers think outside the box generating
new ideas instead of working with what's already

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.340
familiar.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.870
Lateral thinking is great for problem-solving,
innovations and inventions.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.350
People who identify with this type are usually
not afraid to leave traditions behind in order

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.390
to play with new patterns.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.960
Two: The inspirational thinker.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.960
Do random ideas ever just come to you suddenly?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.460
This is called inspirational thinking.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.000
Inspirational thinking is usually spontaneous,
quick and comes out of nowhere.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.850
Researchers call these breakthroughs higher
creativity.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.390
Often, people who come up with inspiring ideas
see them in dreams first but may also experience

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.060
this while being awake.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.750
Throughout this creative process, the individual
undergoes a life-changing revelation that

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.640
amplifies their skills and talents to a whole
'nother level.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.229
Three: The divergent thinker.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.750
American psychologist JP Guilford coined the
terms Divergent Thinking and Convergent Thinking.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.110
Guilford proposed that these two types of
thinking are the opposite of one another.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.899
Whereas convergent thinking entails concentrating
on only one idea or a single solution, divergent

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:44.450
thinking involves a more flexible approach
where many solutions and options are explored.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.600
People who identify as divergent thinkers
tend to brainstorm often and enjoy taking

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.740
risks in order to explore other alternatives.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.369
Four: The systemic thinker.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.039
Do you have a knack for connecting the dots?

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.170
People who identify as systemic thinkers are
good at understanding how things are related

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.310
to one another when they look at systems.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.649
Systemic thinking is often used in corporate
settings when a hierarchy is created.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.870
This type of thinker is often considered a
managerial genius because they're great at

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.650
organizing and setting rules and regulations
for operations to run smoothly.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.730
Five: The esthetical thinker.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.190
Esthetical thinking involves producing or
creating things that are pleasing to our senses.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.870
The individual may have strong visual and
spatial skills choosing to delve into careers

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.340
such as architecture, painting and drawing.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.230
Esthetical thinkers also thrive in the music
industry where they are skilled at creating

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.400
rhythms, tempos and melodies that all blend
harmoniously together.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.650
Writers, scientists and mathematicians all
belong under this creative branch as well.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.680
When they have a talent for creating unique
plot lines, formulas and equations.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.330
At Psych2Go we have many aesthetical thinkers

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.840
