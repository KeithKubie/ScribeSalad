00:00:04.936 --> 00:00:07.330
Why can we access array properties?

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.060
What's so special about arrays?

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.270
&gt;&gt; Arrays are actually special kinds of objects in JavaScript.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.540
In fact, this is a nice transition.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.747
Let's get into objects.

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:22.093
&gt;&gt; Dude, dude, oh, dude.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.860
My hands are like handy.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.860
&gt;&gt; Yes they are.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.670
And while you're staring at your hands, I'm going to be a professional.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.410
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.670
What I mean is hands are like objects because,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.240
they can hold information and do things.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.830
&gt;&gt; True.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.050
That is an analogy.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.860
&gt;&gt; Objects in JavaScript can be declared and defined in a few different ways.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.430
And all of them are different than the way Python defines classes and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.670
objects, because there are no classes in JavaScript.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.790
&gt;&gt; Let's repeat that.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.630
JavaScript doesn't include classes, just objects.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.350
There are ways to mimic classes in some respects, but

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.170
they're still just objects.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.180
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.910
And this has some pretty interesting implications.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.650
Check out the instructor notes for more information.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.045
Let's start defining objects with object literal notation.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:18.440
In object literal notation, we'll use the same var syntax as we had before.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.210
Then we'll give the object a name, then an equal sign.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.220
And then the object is going to be defined within these curly braces.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.700
These curly braces indicate that you're using object literal notation.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.730
&gt;&gt; Let's define an object for my biography.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.910
Then inside the curly braces,

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.930
we can define the object's properties using key value pairs.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.660
I'll create a property called name and save my name as the value.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.320
I'll do the same for age, this time using the number 32, my age.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.860
&gt;&gt; Notice that we surrounded the properties with quotation marks,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.120
because they're strings and there's a comma between the two key value pairs.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.820
&gt;&gt; thanks.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.410
But we can say whatever we want here.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.360
We could even save an array in our object.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.479
For instance, I want to add skills to my biography.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.030
So let's take Cameron's skills from up here and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.330
add it to my biography down here.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.340
&gt;&gt; Is that because you're jealous?

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.700
&gt;&gt; Eh, maybe.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.580
&gt;&gt; This is pretty straightforward.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.790
To access these properties later, just as we did with the array length,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.120
we simply add .property after the object name.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.440
So if I wanted to appended James' name to the page, all I'd need to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.120
do is access the bio.name property to pull James' name out of his bio object.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.380
Then, I'll go ahead and append it to the page, come over here, hit refresh.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.710
We can see that we've got James on our page now.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.920
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.090
Let's give our students a shot.
