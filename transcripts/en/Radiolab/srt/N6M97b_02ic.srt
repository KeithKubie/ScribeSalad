1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,340
Hey, this is jad.

2
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:05,210
We just wanted to throw in
an extra episode into our
feed and honor for a movie

3
00:00:05,211 --> 00:00:07,940
that we're really excited about. But first

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,420
couple weeks ago, I, I
stepped in here and I, uh,

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,190
sort of laid out a challenge grant that
we'd gotten from the Tau Foundation.

6
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:17,911
And the deal was,

7
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:22,911
if you remember that if 700 of you guys
listening step forward agreed to kick in

8
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:26,580
$7 a month to support
the making of radio lab,

9
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:30,870
then the Tau Foundation would give
us 70 grand to help make the show.

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,910
So again, 700 people decided
to donate $7 a month.

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:40,530
We get 70 grand. That was the deal. All
right, so how did we do? How did you do

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,520
you crushed it. Just crushed it. Okay.

13
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:49,770
We needed 700 people. As of right now,

14
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:53,430
I think we're at somewhere
over 3000 you did so well.

15
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,810
We did so well.

16
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,810
The Tao Foundation just came back to us
and upped the ante full on stretch goal.

17
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,170
Because here's the thing,
3000 people is amazing,

18
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,650
but that is just a tiny percentage of
the people who actually listened to this

19
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:11,310
podcast. So their thinking is
let's capitalize on this momentum.

20
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:14,070
Get the other 99.9% involved.

21
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,320
So their new stretch goal is that they
have agreed to match any donation that

22
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:22,980
comes to radio lab right
now up to 10 grand.

23
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:26,730
So if you decide to make the
seven bucks a month deal,

24
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,110
that becomes $14 a month.

25
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:32,230
If you decide to do a one
time donation at 60 bucks,

26
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:36,790
that's now 120 tau, we'll match
it. And this, just as a reminder,

27
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:38,770
this is how we're able to do, you know,

28
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:43,420
the year long investigations in the
police shooting or the nuclear chain of

29
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:46,120
command, just to name the last three that
we've done. This is how we pay for it.

30
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,480
And this challenge grant
will allow us to go farther.

31
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,330
So if you're down,

32
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:57,331
go to radio lab.org/match or you can text
the word match to the number four six

33
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:00,780
nine eight six six. Again,

34
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:05,330
text the word matched to the number six
nine eight six six a little formal pop

35
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,900
up and you can donate in a
matter of seconds. And thank you.

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,720
All right, so tonight is the premiere
of a movie we're really excited about.

37
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,420
It's called the mortal life of
Henrietta lacks it stars, um,

38
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,750
a um, a an up and coming
actress. Maybe you heard her,

39
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:33,310
Oprah Winfrey and it is
based on the book of a very,

40
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:36,060
very dear friend Rebecca
Skloot bestselling book.

41
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,070
You'll be able to watch the sh the movie
in a couple of days on HBO a but in the

42
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:45,071
meantime we were just so proud of Rebecca
thrilled that this movie is getting

43
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:47,840
out to a wider audience because
everyone should know the story.

44
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,400
So in honor of that,

45
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,700
we're going to play for you a
documentary produced with Rebecca.

46
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,090
We worked on it for a few years with her
while she was sort of formulating the

47
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:59,200
book and it includes tape.
You won't hear anywhere else.

48
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,080
We can

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,540
move me closer to hello. Hello,
hello. And the story. Okay.

50
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,140
It's about a tumor that
expands and never stops.

51
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,170
Begins in 1950 a black woman in Baltimore
is in her bathroom and she discovers

52
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:16,400
pretty much all on her own. Did
she has cancer? Um, it's all,

53
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,130
it's a little bit of a mystery
how she initially knew this,

54
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:20,690
but she knew it was there.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,420
[inaudible]

56
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,560
and not, she called it.

57
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,180
She had told to her cousins for a while
that she thought there was something

58
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,460
wrong with her, with her womb,

59
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,470
and she climbed into her bathroom and
she slid her fingers up inside of herself

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,000
and found this lump chapter one first.

61
00:03:42,001 --> 00:03:47,001
She went into her local doctor [inaudible]
I happened to be and attending at

62
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:47,904
that time.

63
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:51,720
The guy she eventually ended up seeing
at Johns Hopkins University was this

64
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:56,490
fellow, Dr. Howard Jones. I'm 98
next month. That'll be 99. Wow.

65
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,230
So when she came in to see you,

66
00:03:58,231 --> 00:04:02,580
can you tell me anything about what
she was like? Well, she was a a

67
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:07,620
uh, you didn't remember
anything? No, I really don't.

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,750
But you remember her tumor,
right? Well, absolutely.

69
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,680
I never saw anything
like it before or after

70
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:14,880
[inaudible]

71
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,690
and this didn't look like
a normal tumor. It was.

72
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,530
It was deep purple and
about as big as a quarter,

73
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,700
I'm sort of shiny or soft. That was
another thing about it on examination,

74
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:29,380
slightly raised and new touch that
you might think it was a red Jello.

75
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,180
There was something very
strange about the way it looks

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,530
[inaudible]

77
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,660
so doctors took a sample? Yeah.

78
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:39,020
So they would cut off these little
teeny tiny pieces and see Haley's small,

79
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,170
tiny bite or two, they would
take a piece, put it in a tube,

80
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,750
and one would go into the lab
for diagnosis. And in this case,

81
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:49,520
since it was Hopkins, they would take an
extra piece and give it to man name guy

82
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,720
too. So George Guy was a
researcher who worked at Hopkins.

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,140
He had a deal with the clinic that
anytime they got a patient with cervical

84
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:02,250
cancer, they'd give him a tiny piece of
the tumor. What he really wanted to do,

85
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:05,400
his main mission, actually, not
just his scientists everywhere,

86
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,540
we're trying to do this.

87
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,600
They wanted to find a way to grow human
cells outside of a human being in a

88
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:15,210
dish, in a dish. George Guy
had been trying to do this,

89
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,950
working on this for decades. And
why? Exactly. Um, it's sort of like,

90
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,560
it's sort of like having a
little tiny bit of a person in a,

91
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:26,400
in a lab that's detached from them so
that you can do whatever you want with

92
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:27,240
them. You know,

93
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:31,080
you can't bombard some person with a
bunch of drugs and just wait to see how

94
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,300
much they can tolerate before
their cells all explode.

95
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,480
But you can do that in cell
culture. So, oh, so this is like,

96
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,390
this is like the basic thing
you need to study human biology.

97
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,340
You need cells in a dish. Yes.

98
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,410
Problem was anytime they tried
to grow human cells in a dish,

99
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,460
my daughters, they would
die. Yeah, they died.

100
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,820
This is George Guy's former lab
assistant. Can you just tell me your name?

101
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:59,330
You know, my name is so
and so. My name is Mary.

102
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,810
I'll put my maiden name in there.
Oh sure. Toy Cooper cheque.

103
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,180
Mary lives just outside of Baltimore.

104
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:09,230
About an hour from where she used to
work with George guys. This is Dr. Guy.

105
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,650
Show me some pictures and he's sitting
at at a microscope. He looks, he's,

106
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,450
he seems like a really big guy, like
a really tall guy who was a big guy.

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,240
At least six, five judging
from the picture. Yeah, he was.

108
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,780
And in every slide that she showed me,
he had kind of a crazy smile on his face.

109
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,030
Like he's got a, like he's having
a good time. Bear of a man as well.

110
00:06:27,031 --> 00:06:29,030
I always thought, oh yeah. In any case,

111
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:33,210
Mary says they were completely stumped
at why the human cells always died to us,

112
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,120
but they just did. Yeah. So on
the day that George Guy Walked in,

113
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:41,570
handed Mary a two with a little chunk
of a name was women cervical cancer

114
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,750
inside. I knew nothing about her.
No one expected anything. Oh,

115
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:49,310
he was doing well, he probably, yeah,
when I said ever hopeful, but you know,

116
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,370
I was eating lunch and I thought,
oh, the heck with it. You know,

117
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:56,540
it's not going to grow. I'm
going to finish the sandwich.
And that's what I did.

118
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,920
Three. Then I went in and
she gave the cells some food,

119
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,290
did my usual turn on all
the machines and left,

120
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,380
came back the next day they hadn't died,

121
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:13,670
so she came back the next day and they
were growing and then the next day still

122
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:17,130
growing. They just kept plugging along

123
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,570
in the neck. They grew a lot. RECA says
they doubled in size every 24 hours.

124
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:25,090
Yeah, they just grew. All
of a sudden, you know,

125
00:07:25,091 --> 00:07:28,990
I kept transferring them and making
more tubes, transferring them,

126
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,850
making more tubes, transferring. They
weren't very reliable and stronger.

127
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,280
They just kept plugging
along and alone. Meanwhile,

128
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:39,570
the woman had spawned all
these cells die right?

129
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,530
Officially she died of uremia,

130
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:45,400
which is a like toxicity of the blood
because she wasn't able to get rid of the

131
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:49,270
toxic waste. That usually goes out in
your urine log in the log in the wall,

132
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,193
not herself,

133
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:55,090
and to tell us this story is a
privilege to introduce Dr. George Guy.

134
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,240
It wasn't long after the
George Guy appeared on TV
holding in his hand a little

135
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:03,500
bottle. Oh, let me show you a bottle,
like an alarm, which we have growling

136
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:06,440
quantity of catheter style.

137
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:10,190
So did you want to look at the photos
and you can't really get a sense of how

138
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:13,940
aggressive this tumor was until you go
to the Hopkins Archives and looked at

139
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,270
George guys pictures and
videos. Okay, this is it.

140
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,120
Come on Ken here to Healer
Cell Film than it hits you.

141
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,570
But you're there in a large
10,000 times. Oh my God.

142
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:28,240
Swirling hurricanes of cells,
just like thousands of people,

143
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,360
some nice small and some very large
together and kept transferring them and

144
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,630
making more to leave them
under the microscope.

145
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,070
Looks like something is just
exploded, like you're going to just

146
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,090
keeps getting bigger, bigger
and strong. It's indestructable,

147
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,940
it's indescribable. Nothing can stop it.

148
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,271
Why?

149
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:55,380
Hers just sort of took off and grew and
the other ones that they had tried it

150
00:08:55,381 --> 00:09:00,160
didn't is just a little bit of a mystery
nobody really knows for and the less

151
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:01,410
George Guy knew what he had,

152
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,900
this new cell line was what they'd
all been waiting for. So early on,

153
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,400
right after this woman died,

154
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,780
George Guy sent Mary back down to get
more cancer cells from the [inaudible].

155
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,410
Oh, he sent me down to the
morgue. Yeah. Really? Oh yeah.

156
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,240
So I went down there and, um, the
a coroner, I don't know who he was.

157
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,700
Dr God was there too. And they were
standing down at her feet, sort of. Yeah.

158
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,510
Meanwhile, she's like, she's flying
out there. She's already opened.

159
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,600
I got some samples. Coroner would
take them out and give them to me.

160
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,550
What'd she look like? I couldn't look
at her face. I couldn't look at her.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,960
The only thing I looked at were her toes
and they had chip nail Polish on them.

162
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:49,080
And that was really like,
oh, this is a real person.

163
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,380
What was it about the nail Polish that
hit you? Oh, cause it was chipped.

164
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,920
Cause you know that she hadn't been able
to take care of her nails for a long

165
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:00,630
time if they got chipped like that.

166
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,260
And it's showed that she
was proud of herself.

167
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,400
Not everyone wears nail Polish
on their toes. Yeah. Yeah.

168
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,470
Over the next several months
while this woman's body laid,

169
00:10:12,471 --> 00:10:17,390
decomposing and the ground George Guy and
Mary produced hundreds of thousands of

170
00:10:17,391 --> 00:10:21,530
herself or tumor cells and he
named them the heela strain.

171
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,740
Heela like Hella h e l a [inaudible].

172
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,040
No one would actually know why he had
named them that for about two decades.

173
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,330
Hmm. But what he did with these cells,
you know, we'd be unusual nowadays,

174
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,790
like if somebody now found
a cell that was special,

175
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:38,510
they'd run off to the patent office
and then sell it to Merck for 1 billion

176
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,720
bucks. But Georgia guy, hey,
just pass them out freely.

177
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,560
Didn't try and make any
money off. It was just

178
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,070
nice, nice new thing
that could help science.

179
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,880
Mary says that George Guy began to
send Hilo all over the world. Yeah.

180
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,940
And pretty soon she was in
hundreds of labs. And you know,

181
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,960
this was in the midst of
the polio epidemic season
when polio is at its worst,

182
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:02,370
we're talking early fifties right?
Yeah. So there's 1951 52 you know,

183
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,340
schools are being closed.
Kids are being kept inside

184
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,130
today's cruel disease. Medical
science still has no complete onset.

185
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,140
There was this enormous effort
to develop a polio vaccine.

186
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,640
Problem was in order to develop a vaccine,
you had to have enough polio virus,

187
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:19,040
you know enough quantity to be
able to study it in the lab.

188
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,660
And they had no way of making enough. So
whether they do, well, one of the guys,

189
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:27,200
that guy, one of the guys that
guy had sent the sales to,

190
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,560
this collaborator friend of guys
discovered something kind of amazing,

191
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,530
which was that polio loved the heela sell,

192
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:37,220
put polio inside a heela cell healer
would copy and in the process make more

193
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:40,580
polio. So which the Super Xerox
cell, no matter what you want to do,

194
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:42,950
they'll be like, make a copy,
make a copy, make a copy. Yeah.

195
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:48,010
So now they had a way of making polio
either could just be a polio factory and

196
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:51,860
so you government made a factory at
the Tuskegee Institute, a real one,

197
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,890
literally a factory. So they
had these big, you know,

198
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,850
stainless steel and have that sort of
culture medium that were sort of rotated

199
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,060
constantly autoclaves for
sterilizing all your equipment.

200
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,080
A row with four or five microscopes,
crazy frankensteinish gizmos.

201
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:13,460
They had this machine that was like an
automatic cell dispenser and it had this

202
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,000
orbit on mechanical arm in Squirt a
certain amount of this cultural medium

203
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:21,030
filled with Hilo cells into a two. Wow.

204
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,000
This is like the beauty of industry
right here. Yeah, it is. Absolutely.

205
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,860
The cells that were
produced at this factory,

206
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:28,800
she says were used to test
the polio vaccine back cleaned

207
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,670
the test that they were doing in Norris.

208
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:36,870
It was the largest field
trial ever done at its peak.

209
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,990
The tests [inaudible] he lived production
center was producing about 6 trillion

210
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:46,040
cells a week. Wow. Um, which
is kind of inconceivable,

211
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,200
but that was actually only
the beginning says Rebecca,

212
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:52,250
because this factory led to an even
bigger one. It was for profit. Right.

213
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:57,230
And that second factory was the first
time any human biological material was

214
00:12:57,231 --> 00:13:00,770
commercialized. So this was the first
biotech company? Yeah, basically. Okay.

215
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:03,480
When they first started
mass producing healer, uh,

216
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,300
what sorts of things
were done to these sales?

217
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:09,140
What sorts of problems were investigated?
Like anything, I can imagine.

218
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,440
So they infected the Hilo cells with
every kind of virus, hepatitis E,

219
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,090
Coyne and encephalitis, virus, yellow
fever, herpes, measles, mumps, rabies,

220
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,720
whatever. You just any, any
back. And this was just as,

221
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,170
there's a revolution for scientists
and research on chemotherapy drugs.

222
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,400
He cells went up in some of the
first space missions. Really? Yeah.

223
00:13:31,401 --> 00:13:35,100
So they were Vila went into space,
into space. And every time I hear it,

224
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:36,200
I think of it like Beulah.

225
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,173
Why? I mean,

226
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:45,230
just because the premise was to see what
happens to human cells in zero gravity.

227
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:45,480
You know,

228
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,690
if we're going to be sending people up
into space and what's going to happen to

229
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:51,460
them up there, they went up
before any humans did. Um,

230
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,700
and then she eventually went up his,

231
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:56,270
she the cells there was actually
interesting. A little slip up there. Yeah,

232
00:13:56,271 --> 00:13:59,870
I know. Okay.

233
00:13:59,871 --> 00:14:02,820
So let's actually skip forward in
the story to the point where that,

234
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,093
that slip up,

235
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:09,340
you just heard that pronoun
confusion gets personal,

236
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,900
you know. Well, what happened? Okay.

237
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:16,901
It's a late sixties and a heela has led
to a revolution in science and now there

238
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:19,790
are hundreds of cell lines,
not just he live at hundreds.

239
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,020
And somewhere along the way,

240
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,490
scientists discover that he lays so
aggressive that she's actually been

241
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:29,690
contaminating and taking over all of
these other cell lines where you just said

242
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,020
she, but I get your point and she,

243
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,590
she does it in the way it
does it in the strangest way.

244
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:41,540
Can you know they can float on
dust particles. They can write,

245
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,500
they can what? They can
float on dust particles.

246
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,770
Yeah. So they can, you mean
they can hop out of addition,

247
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:52,730
just get on a particle and
just float out the door.

248
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,960
Up the stairs. Down the hall one
he'll sell into lab rops into,

249
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,840
into dish or cell culture where there's
other cells growing and because he will

250
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,450
Selzer. So if powerful
cells they take over.

251
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,770
So on the heels of this catastrophe,
someone at Hopkins decides to make a test.

252
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,720
Let's make a test that will allow us
to genetically determine if a cell is

253
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,240
healer or if it is. And to
make a long story short,

254
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,840
this desire for a genetic test led
scientists and then journalists to ask a

255
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:28,511
question,

256
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,511
which amazingly for 25 years had not
been asked who was this woman and that's

257
00:15:35,141 --> 00:15:39,100
when we found out her
name Henrietta lacks.

258
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,583
Yeah.

259
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,100
This is the sound of Rebecca
Reading Henrietta's medical records

260
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,053
the first time.

261
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,040
This is a 30 year old colored woman.

262
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:55,310
She's sitting with Henry
and his youngest daughter,

263
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,650
this is second November, so this is again
when she was pregnant with you. Right.

264
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,470
Henrietta had five kids when she died
at the age of 31 most have no memory of

265
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:05,520
her because they were too young.

266
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,530
That's especially true of Deborah was
only 15 months old and I don't remember

267
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:13,470
anything about my mother.
Yeah. So she, you know, she,

268
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,270
she had spent her entire life just sort
of longing to know who her mother was

269
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:20,100
and did she like dancing? You know,

270
00:16:20,101 --> 00:16:25,101
I always wanted to know what she liked
to do when she went where she liked to

271
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:27,550
eat. Did she breastfeed? Debra? She,

272
00:16:27,551 --> 00:16:30,120
she was really sort of
almost fixated on that idea.

273
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:32,000
She wanted to know if she was breastfed.

274
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,800
Oh, I don't know. You know, I don't
know what I would give up just to,

275
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,250
just to have her hair, hey,

276
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,450
just to see her in a whole her.

277
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,500
So in 1973 when a scientists
calls the lacks family,

278
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:51,480
and Deborah hears that little bits of
the mother that she never knew are still

279
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:55,680
alive. And oh by the way, can we take
a blood test from you and your family?

280
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,590
Cause we're having some contamination
problem. We need these genetic markers,

281
00:16:58,591 --> 00:17:01,740
blah, blah, blah. Well, as you could
imagine, tell me about the prize.

282
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,010
It really did. It was really
confusing. I mean, how much is the,

283
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,640
how much of ourselves is out there?
You know, eventually she went online,

284
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,630
did some searches and found thousands
and thousands of hits. Like for instance,

285
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,650
on healer clones. And
Deborah had heard, you know,

286
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,690
various journalists in the past had
come to her and mentioned, you know,

287
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,930
dolly the clone sheep and
said, you know, your mom,

288
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,550
they did this with your mom too.

289
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,860
Meaning that's actually
where the technology started.

290
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:28,020
The first cells that ever
cloned were heela cells,

291
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,800
but that was just cloning a cell,
not cloning an entire being.

292
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,830
But that distinction is very complicated,

293
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,960
particularly for somebody who doesn't
know what a cell is. Yeah. Um, so Debra,

294
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,150
between what journalists had told her
and googling Henrietta lacks and clone

295
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,360
thought there were thousands of clones
of her mother around. And really,

296
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,820
you mean like a bunch of Henrietta's
walking street walking around.

297
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,550
And Rebecca says that one of Deborah's
biggest fears was bumping into one of

298
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:55,350
these clones. She said,
you know, she would say, I,

299
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:58,350
I would have to go talk to her and she
wouldn't know that I was her daughter

300
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:01,110
and, and, and I don't know
that I could handle that. Wow.

301
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,430
It sounds so fantastical.

302
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,160
Like how could someone believed that
there are copies of her mother walking

303
00:18:05,161 --> 00:18:08,580
around, but at one point 25
years after their mother died,

304
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:11,490
someone called and said, Hey, part
of her is still alive and you know,

305
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,820
we've grown enough of her so that it
could wrap around the earth several times.

306
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:17,290
At that point, all bets are
off. Yeah, right, exactly. Yeah.

307
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,983
So,

308
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,610
not to mention that it's actually not
that crazy because your DNA is in your

309
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:27,360
cells. So if your cells are taken
out of you and they still grow,

310
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:33,600
well, isn't that still you alive?
It's of you, but it's clearly not you.

311
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:35,330
And in the end it's going on and on.

312
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:40,020
It's a funny middle space,
that's for sure. Yeah.

313
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:45,510
So here's what happened is Rebecca
went off in search of Henrietta lacks.

314
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,130
Every so often Debra would come along
and sit with her as they interviewed,

315
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:54,150
you know, anyone they could find friends,
family, and eventually over many,

316
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:57,930
many years, the picture does emerge

317
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,620
of who this woman was. She
was born in, in Roanoke,

318
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,680
1920 Virginia and I think she
was the 10th of the 11 children.

319
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,120
But apparently she was
the one that stood out.

320
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,320
Everybody talked about her as just
being, you know, she was the cat.

321
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,190
Oh my goodness. I don't
think I could top her.

322
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,760
This is CD Sturdivan Henrietta's
cousin, and it was a beautiful girl.

323
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:26,380
I was dating for myself, but
hint, it was very pretty brand.

324
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,450
Okay. And this is Henrietta sister,
Gladys Knight, and complacent.

325
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,790
Everyone that they spoke with
zeroed in on the same few points.

326
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,860
Like first she was really meticulous
about her nails, always painted them red.

327
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,490
It's very deep red and second
Henrietta just had this,

328
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,630
she was very strength
forthright, very Sassy,

329
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,700
Mike herself. Now the unfortunate thing
is that when it comes to her life,

330
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,450
you know how she lived. There's
not a ton of detail. Right?

331
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,340
Totally. So this is when she
first went in with your cancer,

332
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,770
but in that hotel room,
when the two of them,

333
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,070
we're flipping through the
medical records, they did
start to get some detail.

334
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,900
Okay, here's her autopsy,
right about how she died.

335
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,160
These are the things I
want to take notes about.

336
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,460
Was she in a lot of pain when she
died? Yeah, this was the hardest thing.

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,730
She was eventually in an
unbelievable amount. Yeah.

338
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,670
Pain, complains of pain in
the right lower quadrant,

339
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:26,440
wailing and crying and you
know, moaning for the Lord,

340
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:30,160
the helper and according to the records,
doctors tried everything. Morphine,

341
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:33,180
they injected a hundred percent
alcohol straight into her spine.

342
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,990
Wow. I knew the pain spider,
the alcohol injection last week.

343
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,660
She would have these fits of pain

344
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,370
[inaudible]

345
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,410
to spasms where this waves of pain would
hit her and she would rise up out of

346
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:49,780
the bed and thrash around. So
they strapped it to the bed.

347
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:53,650
And for sister, um, we, along
with one of her friends,

348
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:54,971
you know,

349
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:57,700
one of them would tighten the straps and
the other one would put a pillow in her

350
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:59,470
mouth so that she wouldn't bite her tongue

351
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,210
if I only just had the
chair. So take care of her

352
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,630
now dealing with how her
mother died was one thing,

353
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,940
but the cells made it more
complicated. Whatever parent,

354
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:19,440
her mother was alive in these
cells somehow. So if that's true,

355
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:23,250
that left very big questions. And
the first of them for Deborah was,

356
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,310
how can Henrietta rest in peace if part
of her with part of her soul is being,

357
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:29,190
you know,

358
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,190
shot up to the moon and injected with
all these chemicals in a radiated and

359
00:21:32,191 --> 00:21:33,024
bombarded,

360
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,790
painful. No one, you know,

361
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:39,590
that had her shells on the back
of a donkey going to Turkey,

362
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,550
you know, and the airplanes
just going all over the world.

363
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,380
Uh, uh, I just don't know.

364
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:52,200
Is she worried about them? She
worried that it hurts her mother.

365
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,200
When you infect the cells with Ebola,

366
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,700
does somehow her mother feel the pain
that comes with Ebola and had a scientist

367
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:01,440
ever like sat down with her and yeah,

368
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,500
I mean just explained to
her like this is no, never,

369
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,910
nothing cause it's spy.

370
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,390
It just strikes me that it wouldn't
be that hard to explain it.

371
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:12,430
Like when you take cells out of a body,

372
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:15,790
it's Kinda like when you cut your
fingernail off it just doesn't,

373
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,610
but your fingernail doesn't keep
growing and living after you cut it off.

374
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,050
It's a, it's really hard.

375
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:23,920
There is no other example of some way
that you can take something from someone's

376
00:22:23,921 --> 00:22:26,980
body and have it keep living
and not have a person feel it

377
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,190
and all these worries says her Baga began
to build and Deborah's mind and build

378
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,530
and build

379
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:39,040
there came at this point. So
we were at her cousin's house.

380
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,450
This is her cousin Gary.

381
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,650
She was broken out in hives and she was
telling him all this stuff that she'd

382
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:47,430
recently learned. You can almost
hear it on the tape. She says to him,

383
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,350
when you get off the leaders there,

384
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,850
she can't carry the burden of
these cells anymore. She can't.

385
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,650
Okay. I don't want to [inaudible]

386
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,380
and I had been started trying to talk
her down and he was trying to talk her

387
00:22:59,381 --> 00:23:00,214
down

388
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,240
[inaudible]

389
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,970
and then just out of
nowhere he just started

390
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,023
singing

391
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,053
[inaudible] Yo

392
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:17,703
[inaudible]

393
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,680
Ooh. Gebo

394
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,200
[inaudible] I know those [inaudible]

395
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,070
and he started preaching
thing that doctors came,

396
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,860
that he held her head in his
hands and we come to you tonight,

397
00:23:35,861 --> 00:23:40,000
the offer then the finish of our faith.

398
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:45,770
And we thank you for being a wait mic.
You make a path in the the middle.

399
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,010
You called the mountains of
skip leg rams and healed.

400
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:56,380
We thank you today. Thank
you all. Thank you for it.

401
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,610
Thank you though. Thank you. Thank you.

402
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:05,840
[inaudible] hello? Hello? Hello? Yeah.

403
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,590
[inaudible] great,

404
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:15,990
great.

405
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,810
And she just relaxed
know like him man. Huh?

406
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,230
I feel like, Huh?

407
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,800
She didn't realize it then, but that
night Debra was on the verge of a stroke

408
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,440
one to walk up into the building
one wall. Okay. You mean?

409
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,810
He said it's just [inaudible].

410
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,760
One of the most striking moments of
this story is when the two of them

411
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:41,680
visit hospitality. Feel Fun. Yeah. Yeah.

412
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,410
Deborah meets her mother's
cells for the first time.

413
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,230
I shouldn't have, I'll show you that
room and I can show you that itself

414
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,630
because the scientists had finally
contacted her, Christophe Lynn Gower,

415
00:24:52,631 --> 00:24:55,390
the scientist who invited us
into his lab to see the cells.

416
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,950
He had projected them onto a screen.
Don't be confused. They look green here.

417
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,600
This is exactly what she always
dreamed of. But then just last year,

418
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,160
something interesting happens. Interesting
and troubling. So yeah. So March,

419
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,280
2013 this group of scientists from Germany
sequenced the genome and publish it

420
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:25,520
online where anyone can download it. You
just click a button. I downloaded it.

421
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:29,410
It was just there and they
did not ask the family. Um,

422
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,800
and my initial reaction when I saw
this press coverage was they did what?

423
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,690
Because within the Hilo genome there is
also Henrietta's genome and some of that

424
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,500
was pet.

425
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,250
50% of that was passed under her kids
and 25% potentially her grandkids.

426
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:46,460
But one of the things, so when
they put out a press release,

427
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:49,250
when this genome was sequenced and
on it, it had a little, you know,

428
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:53,180
frequently asked questions of the press
might wander about and one of them was

429
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,560
can you learn anything about Henrietta
or her or her children from this genome?

430
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,240
And the answer was no, you
can't learn anything about them.

431
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,630
And I do and I believe that
they, that they believe this,

432
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:06,410
but this is a misconception. You
can in fact learn about people.

433
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,890
And in fact you cannot even hide
people's private information if you try.

434
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:15,430
And so one researcher took the genome
and created essentially a report on Henry

435
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,100
at his genes,

436
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:23,150
you have x percent chance
of bipolar disorder,

437
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,320
alcoholism,

438
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:28,460
obesity just has this
huge range of things.

439
00:29:28,461 --> 00:29:29,780
And some of it is, yes,

440
00:29:29,781 --> 00:29:33,410
there's some real potential privacy
violation like with the Alzheimer's genes

441
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:35,540
and things like that. Bits of
information about your family.

442
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,790
But I will not tell you

443
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,470
what this report that
this dude May, right.

444
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,850
Did he list all of these things you're
describing? And he sent it to me.

445
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:50,140
So I called the waxes and said, do
you know, did you know that this,

446
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,190
anything about this? And Rebecca
had called, you know, they did not.

447
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,940
And it kind of bothered us
because we're saying, okay,

448
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:01,680
why wasn't a family involved with this
decision making? That was Jerry lax.

449
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,870
Jerry lacks why Henrietta lacks
his granddaughter back in the 50s,

450
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:11,871
you had him Riata lacks her cells were
removed without her family's knowledge.

451
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,860
Then you go in the 70s,
my dad and his siblings,

452
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,910
um, they took blood samples,
used it for research.

453
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,800
They didn't give consent.

454
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,980
Then you come 2013 and you have Henrietta
is that I felt as though it was her

455
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:31,920
medical records being published publicly.

456
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,470
You know, their first question was,
can you get them to take it down?

457
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:38,380
And so we can figure out
what it is, what it means.

458
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,100
So I reached out to the scientists
and said, the lacks family, you know,

459
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:45,460
has asked that you take this down.
And they replied immediately.

460
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:50,350
They took it offline immediately. And
then I contacted, um, Francis Collins,

461
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,790
who's the head of the NIH.

462
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,590
I also reached out to Kathy Hudson who
used to run the genetics and public

463
00:30:56,591 --> 00:31:00,460
policy center at Hopkins and is now over
at the NIH dealing with a lot of these

464
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:03,340
issues. So I reached out to them and said,

465
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,580
somebody needs to try to just
help the maximum and get consent.

466
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:08,170
Somebody needs to just go back,

467
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,010
pretend like this is starting now and
just do what probably should have happened

468
00:31:12,011 --> 00:31:12,844
in the first place.

469
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,890
NSA might've been like a
couple of weeks after that,

470
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:20,240
several weeks after that that we had
a meeting with NIH and it was my mom,

471
00:31:20,241 --> 00:31:25,100
myself, my sister, my dad, my uncle,
my brother David, my sister Kim,

472
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,360
my cousin Ron, Rebecca Skloot. She
was actually on a conference call.

473
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,350
All the NIH folks drove up to Baltimore.

474
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:36,320
We Google their names, Dr. Collins and
candy. I said, and it was like, oh,

475
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:38,870
we weren't cutting. He was
excited. Like, okay. Yeah.

476
00:31:38,871 --> 00:31:40,640
We sitting in a room with the director,

477
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:45,410
they all met just to listen to everybody,
you know, listen to our concerns,

478
00:31:45,411 --> 00:31:48,560
listen to our questions, what
can be done, what can't be done.

479
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,570
The lacks family asked about
everything you could possibly imagine

480
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:56,320
when over, you know the information
about Gino gene mapping, sequencing,

481
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,860
just the basic science of genome

482
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,340
to get a,

483
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,240
a clear understanding of
what the Geno met to science.

484
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,040
We don't want to stop science but yet
we don't want certain information to be

485
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:09,930
just broadly available publicly.

486
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:13,380
So the laid out three options. One was
we don't release any of them at all.

487
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:18,180
And then there was a second option which
was release it with no restrictions,

488
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,890
just put it out there
like the Germans did.

489
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,700
And then there was a third option
which was release it with restrictions.

490
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:28,790
So the NIH would house it on their own
servers and that in order to get access

491
00:32:28,921 --> 00:32:32,040
to it, you would have to send
in an application at said,

492
00:32:32,041 --> 00:32:33,390
this is the research we're going to do.

493
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,350
There would be a committee formed that
was a group of scientists and the some

494
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:38,340
members of the lacks family,

495
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,100
the Hilo Gino Committee,

496
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,140
one grands child and one great grandchild.

497
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:45,050
My brother David and my
cousin Veronica. And yeah,

498
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,750
this is the option they picked. So, yeah,
there's this committee and they just,

499
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,170
um,

500
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:53,910
a few weeks ago saw their first batch of
applications and then the news hit and

501
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,620
it was the first time that they
were part of the news. So they,

502
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,510
the third generation, the lacks family,

503
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,550
like Jerry lacks was on MSNBC live
doing an interview about this. And like,

504
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,220
she, you know, she'd never
done this before and you know,

505
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,210
they were in every newspaper.
I mean, it was everywhere.

506
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,760
Yeah. It's pretty exciting. Yeah.
We are stepping into the spotlight.

507
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:19,930
It's the grandchildren, the third
and fourth generation of waxes.

508
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,610
It's the great grandchildren. This is
their story now. And that's, you know,

509
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,500
the other thing that is an undercurrent
where all this is Deborah is gone.

510
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,650
She was the one who was just so forceful
and so dedicated with getting the

511
00:33:33,101 --> 00:33:35,230
information out there about her mom.

512
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,960
And you know, when I look at the four
years since the book came out, you know,

513
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:42,510
there are a few moments that stand out
as incredibly emotional ones for me

514
00:33:42,511 --> 00:33:44,460
having to do with Deborah. But this,

515
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,360
the first meeting sitting
on this speaker phone,

516
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:52,290
listening to this meeting,

517
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:57,390
these high officials sitting at the
table and in pay of sincere concern about

518
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,940
our questions. If she
could have said, what?

519
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,280
What do I dream might someday happen?

520
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,440
That would be what she
would have described.

521
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,860
[inaudible] I could just imagine her
just sitting there and then she had just

522
00:34:08,861 --> 00:34:12,040
laughing, rocking back and forth,
twiddling her talk on them,

523
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,890
her finger saying, Yay,

524
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:19,800
just I'm absorbing all
of this, this excitement.

525
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:33,890
[inaudible]

526
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:37,040
before we close, I want to thank Rebecca
Skloot for giving us her raw tapes.

527
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,060
Her book, the mortal life of
Henrietta lacks is truly spellbinding.
