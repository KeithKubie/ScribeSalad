00:00:02.067 --> 00:00:05.800
Identify all the rays shown in the image below.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.800
and this is a reminder what a ray is.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.000
A ray start at some point and then goes on forever in some direction.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.533
In order to find a ray you need that point that you're starting off on

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:19.800
so let's that point over there is called X

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.600
and then you need another point that sits on the ray

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.533
and the ray is just keep going beyond, we

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:35.533
will name that point as "Y" and we will call the ray "XY"

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:41.600
It starts in "X" and keeps going in the direction of "y"

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.533
for ever, it crosses "y" and keeps going further

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:50.667
we need the second point to specify the direction

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:56.200
in which the ray is going.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.867
So, lets identify all the rays shown in the image

00:01:00.867 --> 00:01:05.200
below, we can start anywhere, we will start at

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:13.800
point J, the only line segment we have starting from J

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:21.667
is JH going up, goes upto H and keeps on going

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:27.467
in that direction beyond H, ray JH, starting from J

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:31.267
going through H and going beyond it forever

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:37.800
now if we go to H, there is no ray HJ as the line ends

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.267
in J and does not keep going beyond J, there is no

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:47.333
ray H as it is just one point, just usiing one point,

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:51.600
we cannot say it as a ray. now looking at our diagram

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:08.067
the only ray is JH. Now let us look at the other points.

00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:15.067
If we look at point C, once again there is no point

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:21.533
after C to specify it as a ray, we can have a ray CE,

00:02:21.533 --> 00:02:27.600
starts at C goes through E and goes on for ever,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.600
you can also have a ray starting at C, going through F

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.933
and going on forever, CE &amp; CF are the same rays

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:49.133
as F sits on ray CE and E sits of ray CF,

00:02:49.133 --> 00:03:02.933
so CE &amp; CF are the same rays,

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:08.067
now lets think about what we can do from point E,

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:12.333
We can start at point E , go in the direction of C

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:17.600
and go beyond C, so it is a ray, ray EC

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.200
you could start in E and go in the direction of A and go

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.067
beyond A, so EA is a ray, and we can start at E and

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:30.200
go in the direction of F and go beyond F, that is ray EF

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:39.267
ray EF and ray CF are different as the

00:03:39.267 --> 00:03:46.200
starting points are different

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.667
Now lets go to point F. To the left of point F

00:03:53.667 --> 00:04:00.667
there is no other point. We can look at the right,

00:04:00.667 --> 00:04:02.533
we can have ray FE, start at F go through E and

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:07.800
beyond E, you can have ray FC, start at F

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:17.667
go through C and beyond C that is teh same thing as FE

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:21.933
ray FE and ray FC are the same as the point E

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:33.200
is on ray FC, then finally we have not focussed on point A

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.133
you may think there is ray AE, but the line does not

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:44.800
go beyond E, so it is not a ray, to the top of A

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.000
there is no other point, so there is no ray there either

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.933
that is all the rays based on the points specified.

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:59.067
If they had given us a point over there, we could have

00:04:59.067 --> 00:05:32.133
had other rays,

00:05:32.133 --> 99:59:59.999
There are 6 rays in this problem
