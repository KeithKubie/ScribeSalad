00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:01.692
- [Voiceover] Now we're
ready to start hooking up

00:00:01.692 --> 00:00:06.111
our components into circuits,
and one of the two things

00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:09.583
that are going to be very useful
to us are Kirchhoff's laws.

00:00:09.583 --> 00:00:11.279
In this video we're gonna talk

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.779
about Kirchhoff's voltage law.

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:17.073
If we look at this circuit here,

00:00:17.073 --> 00:00:21.240
this is a voltage source, let's
just say this is 10 volts.

00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:24.911
We'll put a resistor connected to it

00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:27.662
and let's say the resistor is 200 ohms.

00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:31.212
Just for something to talk about.

00:00:31.212 --> 00:00:34.497
One of the things I can do
here is I can label this

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:36.354
with voltages on the different nodes.

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:37.876
Here's one node down here.

00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:40.987
I'm going to arbitrarily
call this zero volts.

00:00:40.987 --> 00:00:43.416
Then if I go through this voltage source,

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:47.166
this node up here is
going to be at 10 volts.

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:50.413
10 volts.

00:00:50.413 --> 00:00:52.602
So here's a little bit of jargon.

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:54.739
We call this voltage here.

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.411
The voltage goes up as we go
through the voltage source,

00:00:58.411 --> 00:01:01.161
and that's called a voltage rise.

00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:06.621
Over on this side, if we are standing

00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:08.864
at this point in the circuit right here

00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:13.351
and we went from this
node down to this node,

00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.908
like that, the voltage
would go from 10 volts

00:01:16.908 --> 00:01:19.059
down to zero volts in this circuit,

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:21.809
and that's called a voltage drop.

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:28.031
That's just a little
bit of slang, or jargon

00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:31.410
that we use to talk
about changes in voltage.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.198
Now I can make an observation about this.

00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:36.884
If I look at this voltage
rise here, it's 10 volts,

00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:41.051
and if I look at that voltage
drop, the drop is 10 volts.

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.482
I can say the drop is 10 volts,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.687
or I could say the rise on
this side is minus 10 volts.

00:01:50.768 --> 00:01:52.770
A rise of minus 10.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.149
These two expressions mean
exactly the same thing.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.752
It meant that the voltage
went from 10 volts

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:03.078
to zero volts, sort of going
through this 200 ohm resistor.

00:02:03.078 --> 00:02:05.054
So I ran a little expression for this,

00:02:05.054 --> 00:02:08.554
which is, v-rise minus v-drop equals what?

00:02:14.774 --> 00:02:16.483
Equals zero.

00:02:16.483 --> 00:02:19.499
I went up 10 volts, back down 10 volts,

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.105
I end up back at zero volts,
and that's this right here.

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:26.375
This is a form of Kirchhoff's voltage law.

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:29.287
It says the voltage rises minus

00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:32.998
the voltage drops is equal to zero.

00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:35.279
So if we just plug our
actual numbers in here

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.529
what we get is 10 minus 10 equals zero.

00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:44.986
I'm gonna draw this circuit again.

00:02:44.986 --> 00:02:46.761
Let's draw another
version of this circuit.

00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:50.928
This time we'll have two
resistors instead of one.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.083
We'll make it...

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:05.266
We'll make it two 100 ohm resistors.

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:11.279
Let's go through and label these.

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:13.616
This is again 10 volts.

00:03:13.616 --> 00:03:16.659
So this node is at zero volts.

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.929
This node is at 10 volts.

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:19.762
What's this node?

00:03:19.762 --> 00:03:21.693
This node here is...

00:03:21.693 --> 00:03:23.416
These are equal resistors,

00:03:23.416 --> 00:03:26.249
so this is gonna be at five volts.

00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:32.000
That's this node voltage
here with respect to here.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.833
So that is five volts.

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.082
This is five volts.

00:03:43.523 --> 00:03:45.446
And this is 10 volts.

00:03:45.446 --> 00:03:47.595
So let's just do our visit again.

00:03:47.595 --> 00:03:50.786
Let's start here and
count the rises and drops.

00:03:50.786 --> 00:03:54.953
We go up 10 volts, then we
have a voltage drop of five,

00:03:56.727 --> 00:03:58.891
then we have another voltage drop of five,

00:03:58.891 --> 00:04:00.706
and then we get back to zero.

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:02.055
We can write the sum of the rises

00:04:02.055 --> 00:04:04.832
and the falls just like we did before.

00:04:04.832 --> 00:04:08.999
We can say 10 volts minus
five minus five equals zero.

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:13.302
Alright.

00:04:13.302 --> 00:04:14.472
So I can generalize this.

00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:18.880
We can say this is general
we can do the summation,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.576
that's the summation symbol,

00:04:20.576 --> 00:04:24.743
of the v-rise minus the sum
of the v-fall equals zero.

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:39.668
This is a form of Kirchhoff's voltage law.

00:04:39.668 --> 00:04:42.152
The sum of the voltage rises minus the sum

00:04:42.152 --> 00:04:45.837
of the voltage falls is
always equal to zero.

00:04:45.837 --> 00:04:47.692
There's a more compact way to write this

00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:51.885
that I like better, and that
is, we start at this corner...

00:04:51.885 --> 00:04:54.876
We start at any corner of the circuit.

00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:57.226
Let's say we start here.

00:04:57.226 --> 00:05:00.893
We're gonna go up 10
volts, down five volts,

00:05:02.098 --> 00:05:03.728
and down five volts.

00:05:03.728 --> 00:05:06.946
So what we're adding is the voltage rises.

00:05:06.946 --> 00:05:09.850
We're adding all the voltage rises.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:10.933
Rise plus 10.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.428
That's a rise of minus five
and a rise of minus five.

00:05:16.428 --> 00:05:20.595
So I can write this with
just one summation symbol.

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.116
The voltages around the
loop, where i takes us all

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:31.794
the way around the loop, equals zero.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.828
So this means I start
any place on the circuit,

00:05:36.828 --> 00:05:39.511
go around in some direction,
this way or this way,

00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:42.328
up, down, down, and I end up back

00:05:42.328 --> 00:05:45.613
at the same voltage I started at.

00:05:45.613 --> 00:05:48.530
So let's put a box around that too.

00:05:54.652 --> 00:05:57.735
This is Kvl, Kirchhoff's voltage law.

00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:01.875
Now I started over here in this corner,

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:02.864
but I could start anywhere.

00:06:02.864 --> 00:06:04.699
If I started at the top and went

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:08.032
around clockwise, if I started here say,

00:06:10.207 --> 00:06:13.790
I would go minus five,
minus five, plus 10,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.188
and I'd get the same answer.

00:06:16.188 --> 00:06:18.257
I'd still get back to zero.

00:06:18.257 --> 00:06:21.162
If I start here and I
go around the other way,

00:06:21.162 --> 00:06:22.684
the same thing happens.

00:06:22.684 --> 00:06:25.267
Plus five rise, plus five rise,

00:06:26.542 --> 00:06:28.985
and this is a 10 volt drop,

00:06:28.985 --> 00:06:31.348
so it works whichever way
you go around the loop,

00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:35.015
and it works for whatever
node you start at.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.126
That's the essence of
Kirchhoff's voltage law.

00:06:41.126 --> 00:06:43.460
We're gonna pair this
with the current law,

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.996
Kirchhoff's current
law, and with those two,

00:06:45.996 --> 00:06:49.666
that's our tools for
doing circuit analysis.
