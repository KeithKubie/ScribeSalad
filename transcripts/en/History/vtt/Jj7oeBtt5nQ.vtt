00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.460
- One of the more thought
provoking aspects

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.670
of Rudloe Manor is this claim
that it's sort of the British

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.040
equivalent of Area 51.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.790
NARRATOR: Interestingly,
this would not

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.290
be the last time
allegations surfaced

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.710
that a crashed UFO
had been retrieved

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.290
and taken to Rudloe Manor.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.420
Another much more notorious
incident occurred in the 1970s

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.500
and was witnessed by
an entire village.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:37.080
Llandrillo, Wales,
January 23rd, 1974,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.000
late in the evening,
this quiet rural village

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.170
in the Berwyn
Mountains is rocked

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.920
by an enormous explosion.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.830
14-year-old Huw Lloyd is in
his home watching television,

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.750
when he feels the impact
and then receives call

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.040
after call from his neighbors.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.830
Most claiming to have
seen an incredibly bright

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.500
light falling from
the sky and then

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.960
glowing on the mountainside.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.120
Today, Huw Lloyd still
works on his father's

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.960
ranch in Llandrillo.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.040
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Are you Huw?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.460
HUW LLOYD: Yeah.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.250
Ancient astronaut
theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.880
and Nick Pope, a former UFO
investigator for the British

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.380
Ministry of defense, met up
with Huw to get his take on what

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.290
really happened that night.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.620
Can you tell us
your experience?

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.620
Your neighbors called
you to ask if you're OK.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.580
So they pretty much had
similar experiences.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.250
So you're not the only one.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.330
And you were 14?

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.330
How did your parents react?

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.750
And what time of
evening was this?

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.750
So you know, some people
have suggested that, well, it

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.830
was nothing else
but an earthquake,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.500
which I don't
subscribe to this idea.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.290
But have you had any
earthquakes around here?

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.710
But you saw that light
and it was much, much

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.540
brighter than people lamping.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.290
I mean, it was something
almost blinding?

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.670
Wow.
