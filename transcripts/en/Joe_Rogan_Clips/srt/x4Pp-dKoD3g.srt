1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,460
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,610
but like Japan is one of the most
unhappy countries in the world.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,030
People at the suicide rate
is off the charts, but they
take themselves out. Yeah.

4
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:13,250
You know, in America it's like, let
me, who can I take with me? Yeah.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,810
I don't know what that,
what that is. Well,

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,770
Japan emphasizes humility and uh,

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,800
they rewarded like if in the
emphasize being polite and orderly,

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,270
it's really interesting.
Um,

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,330
there was a dis piece I was watching
on Youtube of these people that live in

10
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:34,290
cyber cafes,

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,880
that they have cyber cafes that are open
24 hours a day in Japan and they have

12
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:43,200
like this little cubicles that you taken
there and they're just online on their

13
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:45,870
computer and they have all their things
there and that's where they live.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,510
And they shower and then they
go back to the little cubicle.

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,620
But this woman was saying that it
made her feel like she wasn't alone,

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,350
but she wasn't with people either.
Like she likes that,

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,380
that like she wants to know
that there's people around her,

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,330
but she doesn't want anybody
in her life and also dark.

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,810
Yeah. Yeah. That's
super fucking dark, sad.

20
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,750
Just the loneliness like that.

21
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:13,350
That's a giant issue apparently
in Japan is how lonely people are,

22
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,810
which is incredibly ironic
when you consider that it's
probably one of the most

23
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:19,110
population dense places on earth
and Tokyo at least. Oh yeah.

24
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,850
I think it just working their asses off.

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,290
I mean they fucking loved at the jump
in front of the trends they live for it.

26
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,090
Like it really is like the of countries
that it's the least happy country in the

27
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:31,440
world.
Wow.

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,690
I think number like the happiest is like
someone's Scandinavian. Great. Yeah.

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,150
Sweden or some shit. Yeah. Yeah. Finland,

30
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:43,600
I think Finland like ranks very highly
on that. Yeah. Why is it got it.

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,800
The thing I was watching said it
was like a sense of community.

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,040
I think that checks them live together
and like they eat their meals together as

33
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,580
like a neighborhood almost and they just
like everyone contributes and they're

34
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,010
just happy and content.
That makes sense.

35
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,480
The numbers are smaller too
and think that that helps also.

36
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:04,470
It's gorgeous up there. That helps too.
It's a lot of factors there, right? Yeah.

37
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,530
Like, what's a big city
in Finland? Helsinki.

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,120
How many people's at 50 how many
people live in Helsinki Fizzy?

39
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,590
50 55 at 50 I pay you right?
Feel like I would,

40
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,300
I bet Helsinki as 1.2 million people.
How many people Helsinki have?

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,500
That's a wild guess. I don't know
why I had to put the 0.2 in there.

42
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:28,740
I'm hedging my bet. Like if I was
on the prices right thing instead.

43
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,311
It's the biggest,

44
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:33,690
but the thing I pull up doesn't say the
second largest says 279,000 so say what

45
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:36,150
he'll think he does. Well, it
doesn't, you can't. Doesn't.

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,910
If you Google population of Helsinki,
the very first thing I had,

47
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,900
which was the biggest cities in Finland,
I figured it would have had,

48
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:45,420
it just blew up. Five 58
558,000 yeah, that ain't shit.

49
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,980
Wow. That's it. That's why they're happy.
It's basically like four boulders. Yeah.

50
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,820
For Boulder. Colorado's and it's a
whole country. Yeah. You go to boulder,

51
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,330
some of the nicest people ever.
Why 100,000 of them? That's it.

52
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,320
Hard to build there. Beautiful,
bold, beautiful, beautiful,

53
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,900
gorgeous, grey people.
Little on the social side,

54
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,910
but I get it a little
too many Birkenstocks and
tables and girls could use a

55
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,940
little bit more makeup, pull makeup
on gals. It's not all it up a little.

56
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:16,890
It's not pronounced Tiva.
Tivos maybe it is divas.

57
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,320
I Dunno if I've even heard the word
weird leather sandals and shit,

58
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,200
but it's a cool place,
man. But I think, you know,

59
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,420
that's what you get if
you live around nature,

60
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:29,320
you get a bunch of fit people that like
hiking and shared a lot of north face

61
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:34,150
jackets. You know, they've got great
weather. Yeah, yeah, they'd really do.

62
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,940
They have blue blizzards
and snow storms and shit,

63
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:38,980
but they also have like you'll,

64
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:42,370
it'll be 30 degrees in Denver or boulder,

65
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,570
and then the next day it'll be 60
yeah. It doesn't make any sense. Okay.
