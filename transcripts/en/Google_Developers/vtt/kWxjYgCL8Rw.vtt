DYLAN THOMAS: Hello, welcome
to What In The World.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.019
This is a regular show where
enterprise Geo Googlers tell

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.560
you a little bit more about an
interesting part of enterprise

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.640
Maps products.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.780
My name is Dylan Thomas, I'm
a Community Maps Manager.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.560
And with me today
is Graeme Merrall,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.990
who's a Deployment Engineer.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.027
Hi Graeme.

00:00:24.027 --> 00:00:25.110
GRAEME MERRALL: Hi, Dylan.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.220
DYLAN THOMAS: And
today I think you're

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.840
going to tell us some really
interesting, handy tips

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.772
about data integration.

00:00:31.772 --> 00:00:32.980
GRAEME MERRALL: That's right.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.140
So a lot of people when they
go down the GIS road, generally

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.350
start using Google Earth to
manage their data because it's

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.470
simple and it has
a great interface.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.210
But one of the restrictions
with Google Earth it

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.540
that it uses a
format called KML,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.500
which is an XML format
used by Google Earth.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.490
It's a very rich
format, but it generally

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.590
allows users to insert
unstructured data along

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.610
with the content.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.330
And the problem when you move
to a system like Google Maps

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.525
Engine is that you require
structured data to get access

00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:07.370
to the attributes.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.030
DYLAN THOMAS: So you might
start with something simple

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.790
like an HTML table.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.690
And it looks fine
on the map, but then

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.350
when you're saying when you
move into an enterprise system

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.420
you need structured data.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.549
That becomes a
problem at that point.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.840
GRAEME MERRALL: That's correct.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.423
And you can actually see in the
example that I've got up here,

00:01:24.423 --> 00:01:26.290
I've got some mountains
from New Zealand,

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.830
which is my home country.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.320
And if we click on
this window, you

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.580
can see we get a nice piece
of some HTML that pops up.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.630
But it's actually
represented in the KML access

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.035
as actually HTML that's
completely unstructured.

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:41.910
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.590
So if we were going to
look at this-- I mean,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.100
you're saying it's HTML code.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.050
Which is fine if you
want to look at it,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.740
but it's pretty horrible if
you want to try and import that

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.622
into some other system.

00:01:52.622 --> 00:01:53.830
GRAEME MERRALL: That's right.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.765
You can actually see
in this screenshot

00:01:56.765 --> 00:02:00.452
I've got up, we actually
can see the underlying KML

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:01.410
and what it looks like.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.440
You can see it just
looks like HTML.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.512
And so if we import
that into Maps Engine,

00:02:06.512 --> 00:02:09.320
you can see all we get
is the description field.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.530
We're actually not able
to do anything with it.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.600
So we can't style it and filter
it, or anything like that.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.990
And that's obviously a problem,
because the whole point

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.427
of wanting to get structured
data into KML and into Maps

00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:23.962
Engine is that you
want to actually

00:02:23.962 --> 00:02:26.003
be able to do that sort
of filtering and styling.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.460
So one of the things you can do
is to change or alter the way

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.410
that you use to create
or manage your KML.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.550
And so there's two
methods for doing that.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.340
The first is to use something
called extended data.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.820
And extended data drops
out this description field

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.210
by creating essentially
a set of name value pairs

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.960
that you include
inside your KML.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.740
And then to replace
that description window,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.574
you create something
called a Balloon Style.

00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:00.073
Now the nice thing
about that is you

00:03:00.073 --> 00:03:02.140
just defined it once at
the top of the document,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.510
and then every other piece of
content gets to reuse that.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.530
So it makes it much simpler
to manage and change it.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.570
We can have a quick look at
some KML, just show you that.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.015
Here's one showing the Balloon
Style I just briefly mentioned.

00:03:17.015 --> 00:03:19.170
And you can see some
placeholders in there

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.280
with square brackets.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.870
And so that data is going
to get transplanted up

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.810
from a placeholder, a placemark.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.830
So you can see now we've
got an extended data field.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.450
We have a data name.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.990
And you can see we have the
display name, and the value.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.073
And also for the height,
we have the display name,

00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:36.982
and the value.

00:03:36.982 --> 00:03:38.060
DYLAN THOMAS: Ah,
so it's structured,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.610
but then the other part,
too, is that you're only

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.319
defining that display
style in one place.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.110
So you're not replicating
the display style

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.830
for every single
placemark, you're just

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.636
doing it once-- the
balloon, I should say.

00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:47.890
GRAEME MERRALL: That's
right, that's right.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.370
So well, I would say there's,
again, in the classic method,

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.370
if you wanted to change
the format of the table,

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.930
you would have to change
every single placemark.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.680
And this one, you
just change it once.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.950
And it ripples through
every single change.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.090
Now if we look at
Google Earth, we

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.380
can see that, actually, it
doesn't look any different.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.292
From a user point of view, it
looks as good as it ever did.

00:04:09.292 --> 00:04:10.750
DYLAN THOMAS: So
we're done, right?

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.090
We've got structured data.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.395
So what does it look like
in the Maps Engine, then?

00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:15.770
GRAEME MERRALL:
Well, the problem

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:17.910
with our fantastic
structured data

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.200
is it imports only as a string.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.450
See, here's now
the data that I've

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.780
converted using extended data,
and imported into Maps Engine.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.690
But now everything has
gone in as a string.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.900
So now the height field
is actually a number,

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.150
it's 2797 meters,
or what have you.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.100
So because it's a
string, you can't

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.840
perform basic comparisons,
like greater than or less than.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.800
So ideally you want to be able
to import numbers as numbers

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.190
and dates as dates and
strings as strings.

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.400
It just makes good sense.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.520
So you have to search
for an alternate style

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.950
to make that happen.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.950
And that's using something
called schema data.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.430
And schema data
inside KML allows

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.300
you to type your content.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.750
And it's actually
slightly simpler

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.890
than using extended data.

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.330
The way you do it is you still
define your balloon style,

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.510
but then you create
something at the top--

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.997
you can see
highlighted in red --we

00:05:13.997 --> 00:05:15.560
create something
called a schema.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.480
And you can see,
now we've defined

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.580
something called a mountain
name of type string,

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.270
and defined a
height of type int.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.150
And you can also see
I've altered the display

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.870
name slightly for
mountain height,

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.820
so it's actually--
you can actually

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.170
sort of pack in whatever sort
of data you like in there.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.510
You can even put [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.355
DYLAN THOMAS: Nice.

00:05:35.355 --> 00:05:38.950
Can you store-- can you do
dates as well, for example?

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.615
Are there other types there, or
is it just numbers and strings?

00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:43.740
GRAEME MERRALL: There's
about eight different types

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.690
you can store.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.570
So string, int, date,
floats, real numbers,

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.790
all sorts of things.

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.410
We'll include a URL to point
you to the documentation that

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.530
covers this, so you can read
about the different types

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.770
that it's imported.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.855
DYLAN THOMAS: Great

00:06:00.855 --> 00:06:02.980
GRAEME MERRALL: So we can
also now see a placemark,

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.440
and you can see we
have extended data.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.470
And now we have the schema data
takes and simple data takes.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.130
And you can see
it's very simple.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.265
It's just simple name,
value, name, value.

00:06:13.265 --> 00:06:14.640
DYLAN THOMAS: Much
cleaner, yeah.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.348
GRAEME MERRALL: All
right, so it actually

00:06:16.348 --> 00:06:18.848
makes that placemark very, very
simple and clean to look at.

00:06:18.848 --> 00:06:20.473
DYLAN THOMAS: And it
all looks the same

00:06:20.473 --> 00:06:21.500
in Google Earth, right?

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.760
There's no difference
to the consumer?

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.968
GRAEME MERRALL: That's right.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:28.560
So if you go back to Google
Earth and turn this one on,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.500
you can see again, it
looks exactly the same.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.210
I've changed the formatting,
so I apologize slightly.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.730
But you can see again, we've
got [INAUDIBLE] 2797 meters,

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.820
as it should do.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.520
If we look at the data types,
there it is again, same thing.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.510
So it's no different
to the end user.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.760
But if we go ahead and have
a look now in Maps Engine,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.100
I'll just go a bit
through my search results,

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.030
we now have our
content and our height

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:58.810
correctly in as a number.

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.690
So now we can start
to do that comparison.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.939
DYLAN THOMAS: Yeah, excellent.

00:07:01.939 --> 00:07:05.160
And so you're recommending
the use of a library

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.649
to do some of this work, right?

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:07.940
GRAEME MERRALL: That's correct.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.398
So one of the
things-- particularly

00:07:09.398 --> 00:07:14.679
if you've already got
a whole bunch of KML

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:16.720
where you've got content
in the description field

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.440
--you need to get
that out and turn it

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.732
into, say, an extended data
field where you can import.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:22.106
You need to
actually-- obviously,

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:24.030
it's far simpler to do
that programmatically.

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.790
So we have a great tool which
is written by a Googler,

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.000
but it's open
source, called pyKML.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.810
And it makes it very easy to
read and write and also enter

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.450
KML files.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.560
Now one of the things
that's nice about it,

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.280
is that you actually
just reference the names.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.360
So you can see
about halfway down,

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.710
you can see the slide
that begins with four.

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.790
And what it's doing is, I've
said for every placemark,

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:57.210
and then KML-- the XML to
find a point or a line that

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.520
says placemark.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.170
And so I just use
the word placemark

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.169
to say find every
placemark in my KML file.

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:04.710
DYLAN THOMAS: It's
almost like you're

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:06.220
reading KML at that point.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.880
If you insert some angle
brackets, it's the same thing.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.255
GRAEME MERRALL:
Yeah, it's almost

00:08:10.255 --> 00:08:12.880
like reading KML in Python.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.430
And then you can
just open up-- you

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:18.270
just have a look
at the description

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.375
field, which is in Python
called description.

00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:24.000
And it depends on
your situation so you

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.500
can read the contents
of that field.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:29.340
And then you just write it
back using extended data.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.320
So I've said here
in the line here,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.970
that says
Fragment.ExtendedData.append.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:36.900
So [INAUDIBLE] in
pyKML say create

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.650
a field called extended data
and append some KML to it.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.860
And if you flip
back in the video

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.861
and have a look at the
XML, or the KML for this,

00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:48.151
you'll actually see it actually
matches up very simply.

00:08:48.151 --> 00:08:49.459
DYLAN THOMAS: Oh, excellent.

00:08:49.459 --> 00:08:51.000
So in the description
field, you said

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.480
this is sort of a custom, or
case by case basis, right?

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.560
So when you actually
get the description,

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.220
then, obviously you
might need to use

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:00.544
another library or some special
logic to take your content

00:09:00.544 --> 00:09:02.460
and turn it into the
structured data you want.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:05.732
But at that point, you're just
writing it out using pyKML.

00:09:05.732 --> 00:09:07.190
GRAEME MERRALL:
Yeah, that's right.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:11.790
So how you actually crack
open the description field

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:14.010
and read your data out
is gonna pin entirely

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.350
on how you've got that in there.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.920
If it's much tabular
data, it's going

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.892
to be quite easy to use a simple
HTML library to read that.

00:09:22.892 --> 00:09:24.850
If it's just in this
bullet point, so something

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.350
a little bit more
free-form, you're

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:30.918
gonna have a bit more of
a struggle to do that.

00:09:30.918 --> 00:09:32.626
The alternative of
course, is if the data

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:34.330
is stored in a
database of some sort,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.390
you can actually
just write some pyKML

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.560
to actually create
KML from scratch.

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.540
You don't need to crack
open a KML file and edit it.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.860
You can just dump it
out from your database,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.670
using the pyKML
library to create

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.274
a brand new KML with
all [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:47.274 --> 00:09:49.190
DYLAN THOMAS: That's a
really good idea, yeah.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:51.481
Well, Graeme, I've got one
other question for you then.

00:09:51.481 --> 00:09:53.814
So you popped up the
URL for pyKML briefly,

00:09:53.814 --> 00:09:54.980
we'll put that in the video.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.770
But is there a good source
for getting some real world

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.750
examples of this in action, so
our customers can take a look

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:02.910
and get a head start?

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.770
GRAEME MERRALL: Yeah,
so the pyKML website

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.420
includes a lot of
different examples

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.520
for reading, writing,
and editing KML,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.930
both simple and complex.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:16.850
So you can manage very
large structured data of KML

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.640
if you wish.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.484
And also through
the pyKML website

00:10:20.484 --> 00:10:22.150
there's actually a
mailing list as well.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.608
So if you've got
any questions that

00:10:23.608 --> 00:10:27.750
aren't answered by the examples,
from reading the documentation,

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.830
by all means, jump short.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.455
If you jump on the
mailing list, you'll

00:10:30.455 --> 00:10:32.290
likely get your question
answered there as well.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:33.070
DYLAN THOMAS: Excellent, great.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.780
Well Graeme, thanks
very much indeed,

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.397
really useful information here.

00:10:36.397 --> 00:10:38.730
And we will make sure we
include the links in the video,

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.220
and we'll see you next
time on What In The World.
