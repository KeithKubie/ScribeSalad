00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.370
Here's what I see, the first thing I'm looking at is the file structure and

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.750
from that I call tell that we probably have two views.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.530
One thing is called app view and one thing is called to do view now I'm

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.840
choosing to explore my file and folder structure here in sublime text.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.950
But you could also do it here in the finder, it's just not necessarily as

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.250
easy to see everything at once here I can open up multiple folders at once and

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.090
see all of the files inside.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.600
Now, I can infer from the naming of these views, that this one is the view for

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.250
the entire application and this one is the view for each to-do item and

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.985
speaking of to-do items, we also have a model for our to-do.

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:41.280
To-do.js.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.920
Now you may also remember that we also have things called collections at least

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.590
that's what they're called here.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.110
In Knockout, we called them observable arrays and from the name,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.510
I can infer that this is probably just a collection of to do models.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.810
So we've got two views, we've got a model for each to-do,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.700
we've got a collection of to dos, and then we also have this router thing.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.530
And if you remember from before, although we haven't used them in this class,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.420
routers are just like views, but for the URL instead of the page itself.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.090
Now there's also this weird thing called Bower now what the heck is that?

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.930
Well one simple way to find out is to Google it if we search Bower,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.160
we get bower.io and we click.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.510
It says Bower, a package manager for the web.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.200
So if you've never heard of Bower before, you can just read this web page and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.840
it'll give a high level overview of what it is.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.280
It says web sites are made of lots of things, frameworks, libraries,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.570
assets, utilities, and rainbows Bower manages all of these things for you.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.040
Now I'm not going to get into any more depth of what Bower is but

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.220
feel free to explore it on your own suffice it to say,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.510
it keeps track of all of the various libraries that we're using.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.740
Now, what libraries are we using?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.530
Let's go back to our editor, and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.160
we'll look at all the things that Bower is holding on to for us.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.040
We've got Back Bone, we've got Back Bone dot local storage we've got jQuery,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.610
we have to-doMVC Common and we have Underscore.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.130
Now let's make a couple of guesses, of course you can Google these things and

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.200
make those guesses a definite, but I am going to guess that because to to-doMVC

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.564
is a project, where the same app is built in all of these different frameworks.

00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:21.670
To-doMVC comment is just going to be a bunch of

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.330
assets that are used in all of those various projects a CSS file,

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.010
a base JavaScript file, and it looks like a background dot PNG.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.230
Those are just resources that are common to all of our to-doMVC projects.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.700
We're only working with ones so we don't have to really worry about what that is

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.850
now, if you explore a little bit further, you will find that that base dot

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.990
CSS file is the only CSS file that we're going to be caring about.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.700
If you need to make any changes to the CSS, you can feel free to do that.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.990
And in fact if you open it up and you look through,

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.850
there have been some changes that have been made by me specifically so we

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.380
can get ready to do all of the various things we're going to add to the project.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.620
Let's take a moment to look at all these others jQuery.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.370
We've talked about jQuery before.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.150
jQuery is a DOM manipulation library it also let's you

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.785
make AJAX calls to servers and has some good utilities.

00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:17.590
If you need an overview of jQuery, go ahead and take a look at the website and

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.600
if you need more in-depth jQuery, feel free to take a look at our course on it.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.550
We've got BackBone and BackBone.localstorage.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.840
Now who knows what BackBone is maybe you do.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.730
But maybe you don't.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.680
So let's Google it BackBone.js aha!

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.400
BackBone js gives structure to web pages by providing models,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.640
collections and views.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.530
So it looks like this is our model view whatever.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.930
This is our organizational library BackBone.js if we

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.450
go back to our code there's one more: underscore.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.290
So what's Underscore?

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.462
Well once again we can hop over and Google it.

00:03:54.462 --> 00:03:55.801
Underscore.js.

00:03:55.801 --> 00:04:00.260
Underscore.js is a JavaScript library that provides a whole mess of useful,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.980
functional programming helpers without extending any built in objects.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.450
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.120
So it looks like Underscore just gives us a bunch of utility functions,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.560
which makes it easier to write JavaScript.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.400
Now, they talk about functional programming, that's beyond,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.380
way beyond the scope of this course.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.975
But even if you don't get into functional programming at all,

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:23.440
Underscore.js does have a whole mess of useful functions.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.450
And sometimes it's nice to include Underscore rather than

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.700
reinventing the wheel over and over again.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.860
Let's explore a little bit more.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.020
If we go to our index.html file.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.760
The page that gets loaded,

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.405
we'll notice a couple interesting things here were loading our CSS.

00:04:39.405 --> 00:04:42.960
Base.CSS exactly what we were looking at before.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.460
And if you go to the very bottom of the page, you'll see all of the script tags.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.881
Loading to do nbc common base.js jQuery Underscore BackBone,

00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:55.800
BackBone.localstorage, which I'm going to guess is a plug in for

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.470
BackBone to work with local storage.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.590
And then all of our JavaScript files to-do in the models.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.540
Collection, both views, the routers, and app.js and

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.970
if we look around a little bit more, we'll notice these peculiar script tags.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.140
Normally you have script, without a type, or

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.680
with a type of text slash JavaScript.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.720
In this case it says text/template so these represent snippets of

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.930
HTML that our JavaScript can use to display things in our app.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.850
For example, item template is going to be the template for

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.560
displaying a to-do item.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.800
If we ever wanted to make changes to the way our to-do items render.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.410
This would be a good place to do it,

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.240
because this is the template that they render based off of.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.680
So let's return to those questions really quickly.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.210
The library whose name starts with a u is Underscore.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.960
The organizational library that is used to separate our concerns is BackBone.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.105
How many views do we see?

00:05:54.105 --> 00:05:57.370
Two views, app view and to-do view and

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:00.640
hopefully this all makes enough sense, that we are comfortable moving on
