00:00:00.143 --> 00:00:02.256
- [Voiceover] The only
common oxide of zinc

00:00:02.256 --> 00:00:06.846
has a formula ZnO, zinc and
then you have your oxygen.

00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:10.491
Write the electron
configuration for a zinc atom

00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:13.092
in the ground state.

00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:15.437
So there's a couple of
ways that you could do this

00:00:15.437 --> 00:00:17.039
for the electron configuration.

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.871
Let's first identify zinc on
our periodic table of elements,

00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:22.937
and this is the actual one
that they will give you

00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:24.679
when you take the AP test.

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:27.906
And so we have zinc right over here,

00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:30.042
zinc right over there,
and there's a couple

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:30.994
of ways you could do it.

00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:33.325
The simplest way is starting with the

00:00:35.605 --> 00:00:39.205
noble gas that is before zinc,

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.527
so that would be argon right over here.

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:42.786
You could say it's going to have the same

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:47.786
electron configuration as argon, argon.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.218
Let me...

00:00:49.218 --> 00:00:51.447
So you're gonna have argon
but then you're going to go

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:53.027
and you're gonna add the four,

00:00:53.027 --> 00:00:55.580
you're gonna add electrons
to the 4s subshell.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.204
So you'll go 4s1, 4s2.

00:00:58.204 --> 00:01:02.174
So argon and then you have 4s2,

00:01:02.174 --> 00:01:03.893
and then you go and--

00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:06.400
it's an oversimplification
what I'm about to say,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.095
but when you're figuring
out electron configurations,

00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:10.766
it's helpful to think of
well, after you figure out

00:01:10.766 --> 00:01:14.318
fill in the s subshell,
then you go and backfill

00:01:14.318 --> 00:01:16.524
the 3d subshell.

00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:21.524
So 3d1, 3d2, 3d3, 3d4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:01:22.608 --> 00:01:27.608
So 4s2 3d10.

00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:32.198
And there's two exceptions
in this fourth row here.

00:01:32.198 --> 00:01:35.820
You have the exceptions
of chromium and copper

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.091
that don't exactly fill just like that.

00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:39.744
You can look those up on your own,

00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:42.159
but that right over here is
the electron configuration

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.340
for a zinc atom in the ground state.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.989
Now another way you could write this

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:49.467
is actually writing out
the electron configuration

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:52.811
for argon and then writing 4s2 3d10,

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:55.737
and we'll just for the
sake of it, let's do that.

00:01:55.737 --> 00:02:00.506
So you fill up your 1s2.

00:02:00.506 --> 00:02:04.147
So we go 1s2,

00:02:04.147 --> 00:02:06.453
and then we're in the second row,

00:02:06.453 --> 00:02:09.611
so you're gonna have 2s2 and then 2

00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:12.513
one, two, three, four, five, six, 2p6.

00:02:12.513 --> 00:02:15.625
2s2 2p6.

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:17.297
So let me write that down.

00:02:17.297 --> 00:02:22.297
2s2 2p6.

00:02:23.032 --> 00:02:25.867
And then you're going
to go to the third row,

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:26.910
so you're gonna have--

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.117
and if this looks
completely foreign to you,

00:02:28.117 --> 00:02:29.998
I encourage you to watch
the Khan Academy videos

00:02:29.998 --> 00:02:31.623
on electron configuration.

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:36.291
And then you're gonna have 3s2 3p6.

00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:38.589
You're gonna fill those
two subshells next.

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:43.589
3s2 3p6, and then what
we've just described

00:02:44.742 --> 00:02:47.293
is essentially the electron
configuration of argon,

00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:50.753
and so then you get to 4s2 and 3d10.

00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:55.753
4s2 and 3d10.

00:02:57.347 --> 00:03:02.347
So either of those would do,
and then the second part.

00:03:02.456 --> 00:03:06.171
From which sublevel are electrons
removed when a zinc atom

00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:09.004
in the ground state is oxidized?

00:03:09.004 --> 00:03:11.419
And this is what's interesting
about d block elements,

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.207
and that's why I said
it's a little more nuanced

00:03:13.207 --> 00:03:15.807
than saying you're kind of
constructing this electron

00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:18.013
by electron and you fill these in,

00:03:18.013 --> 00:03:21.008
the 4s2 and then you
go and backfill the 3d

00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:23.702
because it actually
turns out when you have

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:27.487
a neutral zinc atom, the
highest energy electrons,

00:03:27.487 --> 00:03:30.087
the ones that are the most
likely to be pulled away

00:03:30.087 --> 00:03:33.872
from the zinc atom are
not the d electrons.

00:03:33.872 --> 00:03:38.261
It's actually going to
be the 4s2 electrons.

00:03:38.261 --> 00:03:43.021
So from which sublevel
are electrons removed?

00:03:43.021 --> 00:03:45.877
Well, the most likely to
be removed not the first to

00:03:45.877 --> 00:03:47.827
is going to be the 4s electrons.

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:52.827
So the 4s sublevel.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.233
And once again, I encourage
you to kinda read more

00:03:56.233 --> 00:03:58.485
about that if you're
curious about why that is.

00:03:58.485 --> 00:04:00.227
You can kind of imagine in your head.

00:04:00.227 --> 00:04:02.085
Even when you look at energy levels,

00:04:02.085 --> 00:04:06.380
the 3d sublevel and 4s are
very, very, very close,

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.549
but it does turn out that most of the time

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:09.956
what's going to react are the ones

00:04:09.956 --> 00:04:12.603
that are furthest out, the 4s1.

00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:14.876
So you could argue that
those are at the highest

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:16.641
energy level, and so when you oxidize,

00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:18.963
you start pulling electrons off of zinc,

00:04:18.963 --> 00:04:21.168
you can pull off the 4s.

00:04:21.168 --> 00:04:24.084
You're more likely to
pull off the 4s electrons

00:04:24.084 --> 00:04:27.074
or you're going to pull
off the 4s electrons.
