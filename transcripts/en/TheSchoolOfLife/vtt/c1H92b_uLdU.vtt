00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.320
It begins with a sense of what it should
be like:

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.120
beautiful, accomplished,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.020
elegant, perfect.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.320
And it is so exciting

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.080
you wake up, bounce out of bed,
full of hope and energy...

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.700
... and you settle down to work.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.780
In your mind's eye, you have such a vivid idea of what you want your masterpiece to be like.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.580
You work, you toil, harder than even you could have envisioned...

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.600
... and you take a step back from what you've done and realize...

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.760
... things aren't the way you'd hoped.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.360
Let's put it more brutally: it's terrible
and you're disgusted by what you've achieved.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.580
The only thing you can think about is the terrible gap between what you wanted to do and we've actually done

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.280
... and it seems your taste is well ahead of your abilities.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.900
You run away in distress maybe into the
arms of someone who loves you...

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.180
... or perhaps you choose to sit alone where you contemplate your own profound mediocrity.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.960
Look at you...

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.300
You're no better than that
little guy... At least he works hard.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.060
You're so sad you've gone back to bed.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.720
The problem is...

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.680
... this is too easy.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.700
Despair is chief.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.960
The first rule of anything creative?
Forgive yourself for the horror of the first rounds.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.540
Don't hurry, do a little bit every day.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.900
Keep a timetable and stick to it.
Work without hope or despair.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.760
You work like this for days, months, years, even decades, and eventually one day...

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.500
... your talents will catch up with your taste and you'll have done something in line with your expectations.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.180
You might even be a little proud of
yourself, and who knows...

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.020
... maybe the rest of the world will be a little bit too.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.540
So just keep going.
