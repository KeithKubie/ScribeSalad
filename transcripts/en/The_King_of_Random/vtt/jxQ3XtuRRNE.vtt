00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
All these connections went together beautifully and this system is looking amazing. What's up guys welcome back to the shop today

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.250
We are jumping into some hardcore diy for today's video

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.429
We're gonna be building a flamethrower now in one of my more recent videos

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.779
I jumped out of the comments and found a suggestion from this anonymous user who asks Grant

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.479
I know this is crazy, but so are you could you make a flamethrower?

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.129
I think that sounds like a fantastic idea, so that's what we're doing for this video today this comment got

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.119
3385 Thumbs Ups that's Absolutely Ridiculous

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.289
So apparently a lot of you want to see this so let's jump right in so in preparing for this project today

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.020
I thought rather than

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.709
Reinvent the wheel why not find somebody who's already built a flamethrower and work with their design so after a bit of searching on Google?

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.680
I found this thing how to make a flamethrower to do-it-yourself manual perfect right so a little bit context of this situation

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.289
I went ahead and purchased these plans only cost about $30

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.959
And I'll leave a link in the description if you want to get them for yourself

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.180
There's about a hundred pages of detailed information

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.789
Which can be very overwhelming so the purpose of this video today is to show you my experience following these step-by-step

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.760
Instructions from Flamethrower plans calm by the way, this is not a sponsored video. I paid for everything you see here

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.769
I just wanted to give credit where Credit's due. I'm gonna break this tutorial into two different parts the first one is a familiarization

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.310
I'm gonna show you all the equipment all the parts that you're gonna need and the basic assembly

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.750
in the second part of this video

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.930
We're gonna do some of the more complicated tasks like modifying the tank and torch

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.729
One of the cool things this guy did in this pdf is he put Amazon affiliate links to all the materials you need so I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.030
literally

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.339
Just open up the PDf click all the links and just order immediately the total cost of all the materials ended up being right around

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.599
450 Dollars plus the $30 for the plan so all-in-all this is about a five hundred Dollar Bill

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.280
So Amazon delivered all the parts. I got everything together, so let's take a look at what we got so starting over here

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.169
We got a 24 ounce Co2 tank like they use for paintball. We got a paintball universal fill adapter

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.860
We got a four and a half inch length of eighth inch metal tubing this is male

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.549
NPT and 0.3 20 cGa female two eighth inch female

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.339
NpT and that whole assembly there is going to attach this tank here in just a few minutes next we've got the assemblies for the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.420
Pressure washer hose and handle so start off with a pressure washer gun and you can see there's no

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.159
Nozzle or attachment for the end here

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.089
And that's okay because we're gonna add an m 22 male by quarter inch female

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.339
NPt a quarter inch male NPT by eighth inch PML empty reducer a three-inch length of male tubing NPT to nPT and

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.150
1/8 inch female to female

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.080
NPC coupler the hoses three feet long it's 4,000 PSI rated and it came with the connectors which screws into the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.780
Pressure washer handle itself and the threaded end connects to the M22 male by quarter inch female adapter

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.449
This is a 3/8 inch male quick disconnect

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.050
This is a 3/8 inch female

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.199
Disconnect to Male NPT then a female

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.529
Mpt 2 female quick disconnect and a male quick disconnect to female nPT coupler other than that the only accessories

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.540
We really need are one and a half millimeter shrink wrap 2 large quick disconnect. Hose clamps and a propane torch

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.940
This is a 20-pound Co2 tank it can hold a lot of pressure and to mount it up on our backs

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.070
We're using a Scuba back harness. I should also mention. I picked up some of this plumber's tape for threading and connections

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.249
I usually use white for pipe threads, but in this case. We want to go yellow because yellow specifically designed for plumbing applications

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.640
We've got all our parts laid out in order of assembly you already know what they are now

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640
So let's go ahead and put them all together

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.479
We got the 24-ounce tank feeding into the 20 pound tank and next we assemble the hose

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.699
We're also Gonna have to get this harness

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.779
Check it out guys flamethrower is just about done all these connections went together beautifully, and this system is looking amazing

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.230
I cannot wait to test it out after going through this process myself

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.359
It seems like the hardest thing really is just getting the right materials

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.429
But if you use this guy's PdF download from the links he's already got on there everything seems to fit together pretty well there are

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.570
Just a couple more modifications

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.570
We need to make this is where things start getting a little bit more complicated

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.650
So I'm going to show you how to do this in the next video

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.540
But essentially we're gonna take this hose plug it into the tank and add a propane torch underneath the handle here

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.170
So we have a source of ignition

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.289
And of course a big shout-out to this anonymous user for suggesting we actually build a flamethrower and forgetting over

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.499
