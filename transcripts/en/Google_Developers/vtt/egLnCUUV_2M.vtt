LEON ZHAO: OK, so
Michael, we just

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.870
talked about the
material design.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.360
So what are some of the
[? best ?] [? directives ?]

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.250
that you have seen--
like, real cases--

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.950
implementing material design?

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.790
How do you work with developers
on implementing that,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.440
and what are some of the
difficulties and challenges

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.435
in the process?

[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:39.150
KOH KIM: There's a couple.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.720
I mean, all the
Google Apps are very

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.010
good examples of
material design-- like,

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.110
the simplification, really
focus on bright colors, a lot

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.670
of the scrolling mechanics.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.690
There's a couple of other
third-party applications

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.350
that are pretty
good examples too.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.410
AirBnB has very
good browsing when

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.610
you go check out a lot of the
photos, a lot of the listings

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.482
and the places.

00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:06.440
I think Uber recently
redesigned their app too.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.110
A lot of the bigger
apps have started

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.450
redesigning a lot of their
apps to kind of create

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.400
that more friendly
interface and also

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.550
the simplification of
being able to scroll,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.400
really focus on the elements,
and a lot of bright colors.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.900
And I think the
users are definitely

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.520
engaging a lot more
within those applications.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.770
KH MIN: So do you have
any specific [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.830
in Japan and Korea, as well?

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.880
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: In
Japan market, they are--

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.780
so recently the material
design is getting popular among

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.280
the application developers
and and the money for it,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.410
[? which ?] is managing the
individual people's money

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.900
in and out, that application
corresponded for the material

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.760
design last week, and they
doing the [? bill ?] roll.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.390
They're increasing the KPI stuff
with their material design.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.330
That's trending in Japan.

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.480
And that would be the
[? exist ?] [? the ?]

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.030
[? only ?] in Japan market.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.790
Then probably everyone
in Japan's market

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.140
will follow those
trends and momentum

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.260
of the material design.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.910
KH MIN: And in Korea,
most of the inquiries

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.700
on material design are coming
from newspaper and magazine

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.930
applications.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.220
So the one example is the
[? bingo, ?] for example.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.330
They are very popular
magazine applications.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.800
And now they adopted some
animations or the UX design

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.720
of material design.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.070
So that is one example, but
still they are working on it.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.280
So I cannot say there
are many examples yet.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.019
But I'm pretty sure that
it'll be very popular.

00:04:53.019 --> 00:04:54.310

So the question is if
you want to get featured

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.320
on Google Play for apps,
is it a prerequisite

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.970

design and also design

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.710

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.480

00:06:26.998 --> 00:06:29.400
Is material design
required [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.900
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
Material design

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:39.070
is not mandatory for
featuring in Japan.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.650
KH MIN: What about
design for apps--

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:44.530
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: The
guideline for a more like co-op

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.469
guideline is almost
mandatory and also

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:49.760
the [? back order ?] and stuff.

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.610
And they're using the
Android the UI/UX.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.920
That's the important things
for, as a minimum, [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:02.077
KH MIN: I think
material design is--

00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:02.910
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.980
The Google suggestion is to
the [? interact ?] [? with ?]

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.870
developers.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.760
I can give you one example.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.600
There's one camera
application, and then I

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.096
think their UX is really
good, really cool.

00:07:22.096 --> 00:07:25.630
But-- this is a
[? severe ?] case--

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.060
I gave a present to my father.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.580
And then he started to
use that application,

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:37.620
but somehow there's phone call
coming when he used the camera.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.280
But he knew that when he
pressed the volume button

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.240
that it actually muted the rings
before he got the phone call.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.610
But that camera
application is actually

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.370
using that volume
key for zooming.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:00.420
So there's a phone call, but
my father tried to mute it,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.390
but it's still zooming.

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:08.790
So my father's feedback is, oh,
this is very difficult for me.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.600
So that means that
even though you

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.880
are spending a lot of resources
to develop your applications

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.190
to users, they might
think that, oh, it's

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.530
kind of difficult
for me, unless you

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:28.300
are having design or consistent
way of using the Android

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.360
applications.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:35.169
So that's why I'm saying thing
that the material design is

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:39.000
kind of a suggestion, and then
also a correct guideline is

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.909
talking about navigations
or back buttons

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:47.060
to make a consistent user
experience to every application

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.160
featured by Google Play.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.660
KOH KIM: Yeah, it's
definitely not a requirement.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:58.570
I think what you want to think
about is your user experience.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.720
And so what you
want your users--

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.352
I mean, for them to be able to
understand how do you navigate

00:09:03.352 --> 00:09:04.810
within your
application, how do you

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.880
do specific actions, especially
within your applications,

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.380
and also if they have
sharing capabilities how

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.360
they share that, you want to
make sure that's very obvious.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.100
I think the two things that
you really want to take note

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:20.470
is that the UI and
UX navigations can

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.040
be very different between
a phone and a tablet,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.080
especially within application.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.230
Time and time again I see a
lot of menu navigation bars

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.980
not really fitting
to a tablet form

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.740
factor versus a mobile device,
or at least a smartphone.

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.110
In a smartphone you actually
have calling capabilities,

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.610
right?

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:45.800
Whereas a tablet doesn't
have calling capabilities.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.440
But then when you think about
portrait versus landscape mode

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.130
in a tablet,
everyone kind of uses

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.560
a tablet in landscape mode,
predominately-- sometimes

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.530
portrait-- whereas in
a phone, it's portrait.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.904
So you always want
to think about

00:09:57.904 --> 00:10:01.460
at what are the use cases
that your users will

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.980
be using your applications.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.610
And then how are
they going to differ

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:09.430
between a smartphone device
and also a tablet device.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.580

offered by Google Play.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.980
So what are some best
practices by a developer

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.780
that you observe in
your specific market

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.600
that you can share
with the audience here.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.620
KOH KIM: So a lot of our app
developers do use beta testing

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:17.330
and staged rollouts, given the
sheer number of Android devices

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:18.150
out there.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.170
And it's a good way
to kind of actually

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.420
test out which functions
and features and UX and UI

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.990
is actually going to work with
a lot of those specific users.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:31.009
Facebook actually
uses this a lot.

00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:32.550
They actually make
very extensive use

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:35.450
of staged rollouts
to test stability

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.860
within their application,
also testing out

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:39.860
new features, new layouts.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.950
And then they do this
very extensively.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.600
They even have this
another group of users

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.080
that they use that does--
I think it's closed alpha

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.140
testing-- for a very
different application.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.430
But what's great with
Google is that there's

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:00.520
no really certification
process or an official QA

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.360
you need to publish
your application.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.800
As long as you publish
an application that

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.450
is very safe for
all users and it

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:11.350
passes all the standard checks,
you're going to see the build,

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.020
and you're going to see
it live within hours.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.030
And you can update
as many times as you

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:20.500
want without having to
wait anyone to say, hey,

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.840
this is now approved.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.490
And so that's the power of
being able to rapidly iterate

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.350
your product according to
what your users' feedback is,

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.476
because devices are going
to be very different.

00:13:32.476 --> 00:13:34.350
People are going to have
a different network,

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.050
mobile broadband
infrastructures,

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:36.960
all around the world.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.150
And especially if you want
to create a product that

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.950
can hit global scale
distribution, making

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.850
very extensive use
of this feature

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.670
is going to be to
your advantage.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.010
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
For launching

00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:52.360
the next major version
up in this digital world

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.410
is pretty common in
Japan market too.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:59.460
It's pretty safe to roll
out the next version

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:02.190
of the application.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.260
Then they're checking-- like 10
persons and then 15 persons--

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.200
checking the bugs.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.410
And they fix the bugs,
and then go 100 persons

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:13.000
usually in like two weeks.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.980
And that's pretty common
in the Japan market.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.610
KH MIN: In Korea too.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:22.015
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: So you
should use the staged rolling.

00:14:22.015 --> 00:14:24.290
MICHAEL YEUNG: I think
one thing to note

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:27.177
is that beta testing does
not affect your ratings.

LEON ZHAO: OK.
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:29.322 --> 00:17:34.650
OK, yeah, OK, so I'm going
to also ask another question

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.860
from the audience.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:41.380
From Jenny Chan, so if your
app language is in English,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.305
should you still have
localized listing?

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:54.465
So if the app itself is
in English-- the interface

00:17:54.465 --> 00:17:58.500
is in English-- but for
example, they launch in Japan,

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:01.545
do they still need to localize
the title and introduction

00:18:01.545 --> 00:18:03.850
and all that?

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:08.020
KOH KIM: It depends on what
region you're launching it.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:15.250
So it's always best to localize.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.120
Even if you localize
your app description,

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.550
it's always best
to localize the app

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.590
within the application itself.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.700
I mean, it just
shows that you care

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.590
about your user in that
market despite what it is.

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.280
But obviously that will depend
on which market you're in.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.280
Some markets-- let's
say Japan, Korea, even

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.830
some European
markets, like Russia,

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.990
and in Brazil-- they
definitely prefer

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.820
seeing an application in their
own local language, because not

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.520
everyone speaks English
there very well.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.850
But it really just depends
on the market, right?

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.235
Like, you're perfectly fine
using English in Singapore

00:18:51.235 --> 00:18:55.910
or using English in even some
southeast Asian countries.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:58.720
But a lot of that depends on
A, the type of application

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.470
you have-- a photo taking
or video sharing app

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.150
is going to be much
easier to localize

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:09.960
than like a retail
commerce app that's

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.730
going to require a
lot of text, right?

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:14.330
So a lot of it depends on the
type of application you have,

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.780
which region or market that
you're launching in, and then

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.880
also take advantage of some of
the services that Google has.

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:26.360
We offer in-app translation
within the developer console.

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.420
You can actually take
your text strings

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:32.680
and request it actually go
to some of the translation

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.720
services we offer and be like,
hey, help me translate my app.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.861
We do offer those services.

00:19:36.861 --> 00:19:38.360
That kind of does
it right in house,

00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.870
and it's right from
the Developer Console.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.620
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU:
For the Japan market,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.050
if you provide and distribute
the [? know ?] [? damage ?]

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.540
required to [? reading ?]
the English,

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:54.510
then probably you can distribute
in English in the application,

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:58.640
but you should change the
titles and the descriptions

00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.950
in Japanese.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:02.560
So first off, at the
first look the user

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.850
decided whether they
will download or not.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:11.650
So the first view of the
titles and description

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.940
should be translated
into Japanese.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.280
If you think that
your application

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.480
is not that much of a
request to the ability

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.827
of their English skills.

00:20:23.827 --> 00:20:25.410
KH MIN: Pretty much
the same in Korea.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.540
So you need to localize.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.520
And then I have seen
two or three application

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.920
which are very interesting.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.980
They are asking
users to localize.

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:43.260
So this--

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.690
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: Volunteer?

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:48.830
KH MIN: Yeah, volunteer, so they
asked them to be volunteering

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:51.430
as localization people.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:54.080
And then it's very
interesting for us

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.910
to see that many
people didn't really

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.590
want to become a volunteer
for that applications.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.037
So I think you can
consider that option.

00:21:06.037 --> 00:21:06.870
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.460
KOH KIM: Well that's why--
that's why app design is

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.480
very important, right?

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.790
Really thinking about
your UX and making sure

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:14.850
that you have the
right call to actions.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:18.040
I mean the perfect scenario
is you don't need text

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:21.540
to explain what a user needs
to do within your application.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.510
That means you have designed
a very good app if there's

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.970
no need for even
language understanding

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.350
to understand what to do.

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:31.310
And so, if you can
achieve that then,

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.080
really language
shouldn't matter, right?

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.427
But we're not there yet.

00:21:34.427 --> 00:21:36.760
So there's obviously going
to be some applications where

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.940
you do need some localization.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.023
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: At
least in top applications,

00:21:40.023 --> 00:21:44.070
providing a game tutorial
in applications--

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.790
it's not actually the
game, but they are

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:49.270
given the tutorial like a game.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:56.160

to use their own functions

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.560
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:06.150
So this one is asking what are
some of the non-paid, promotion

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.440
services that can be
offered in Google Play,

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.380
like, instead of
buying advertising

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:18.440
to promote their apps, what
are some-- by Google Play?

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.612
So they can get--

00:25:21.612 --> 00:25:24.357
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:24.357 --> 00:25:25.690
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:27.890
Yeah.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:32.260
KOH KIM: So, I
think-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.700
LEON ZHAO: For non-games, yeah.

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:43.200
KH MIN: So Google Play started
to invest in TV commercials.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:47.480
So in the US,
Japan, and Korea, we

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.420
started to do TV
commercials, which

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.940
is out-of-store marketing.

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:57.610
So the application
can be included

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.640
in those TV commercials.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.280
I think that is one opportunity
that you can get from Google.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.510
KOH KIM: So ultimately,
it starts out

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:09.180
with you've really got to
build a good application--

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:10.700
good quality
application-- that's

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.380
following the core
quality guidelines,

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.170
also making sure you
follow our policy,

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:18.980
and then also we talk
a lot about featuring.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.250
And so the first
step is how do you

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.460
get an application
that's worthy of being

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:26.149
featured by Play Store in
any of our major markets?

00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:28.190
And that's of course
following all the guidelines

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.277
to make sure you do that.

00:26:29.277 --> 00:26:31.110
And then once you fulfill
that, then there's

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.490
all these other
opportunities to be placed.

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.200
There's Editor's Choice.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.730
There's also opportunities to
be in many of our curated pages

00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:42.420
and collections that
occur throughout the year.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.870
We do a number of
seasonal promotion,

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:49.760
raging from New Year's-- both
the Roman and also the Lunar

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.790
New Year promotions,
depending on which market

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:55.250
you're in-- also the holiday
promotions that are obviously

00:26:55.250 --> 00:27:00.390
upcoming, and then even on
top, of that, as KH mentioned,

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.370
we are now doing a
lot of TV commercials,

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.970
a lot of brand marketing
in a number of outlets,

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.470
and also we have social media
online marketing channels

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.360
in order to expand.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.940
Our platform is only successful
because of the content

00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.790
that you, as a developer,
are making for us.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:19.920
And we want to make sure
we highlight the best.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.810
And who knows?

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:22.250
I think we're going
to see there's

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.120
a lot of great developer talent
that's out here in this region.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:27.150
And we'd love to see
someone from here

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.848
break out into the market.

00:27:29.848 --> 00:27:32.208
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:32.208 --> 00:27:34.570
LEON ZHAO: OK.

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:35.610
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.830
So when the app's
newly released,

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.380
how do you get a better
performance, like anything

00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.570
that they should be aware of?

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:55.890
I think that may be
related to staged rollout.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.130
But any other
suggestions to them

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:01.970
if they want to publish a
game-- sorry, newly published

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:08.240
apps-- that they should be aware
of and suggestions to them?

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.430
KOH KIM: User feedback.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:10.519
User feedback.

00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:12.810
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: User
feedback and the [? plight ?]

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.210
of user feedback and also
if they got a good user

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:21.975
review-- that's a good
start to distribute

00:28:21.975 --> 00:28:24.115
their applications on Play.

00:28:24.115 --> 00:28:27.570
KOH KIM: And sometimes you don't
need to do beta testing too.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:30.510
there are some developers at
choose to actually soft launch

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:34.320
in certain markets to be able
to test whether that application

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.260
is a right fit.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:37.950
So for example, I
mean you wouldn't

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.800
want to launch your application
in the United States

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.260
if you've never done
any testing or have

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.980
no idea whether this specific
application is something that's

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.030
going to be very,
very attractive

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.970
or very engaging with a US user.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.350
So you may try to launch this
app in Canada, or New Zealand,

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.260
or Australia, or in an
English-speaking market just

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:00.560
to kind of test the
waters a little bit

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.390
and see what the
initial feedback is.

00:29:03.390 --> 00:29:05.560
And then that way you can
kind of test against bugs

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.750
and also test against
what a typical user

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:13.200
engagement or behavior is going
to be like, which will actually

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.060
get you ready to launch much
bigger, say, in the United

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:17.480
States.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:21.450
KH MIN: I think the user's
point about customer support

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.570
is really important.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:26.190
So you need to
manage user ratings.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.800
So when developers launch
their applications,

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:30.830
there are a lot of
comments after that.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:36.490
And then I suggest you review
those comments and then reply

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:38.680
for that [? coding need, ?]
so that user

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:43.150
can get some positive
feelings on your services.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.710
And you can get some sense
that the user needs this--

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.350
the user needs these
functions-- so you

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:50.160
can improve your applications.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:52.750
And then the user
rating is one factor

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.065
that we use to
identify that this is

00:29:56.065 --> 00:29:57.790
a good application for users.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:02.250
So maybe we can consider that
for our featuring process

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:03.228
too, so--

00:30:03.228 --> 00:30:03.728
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:07.379 --> 00:30:08.670
DANA YANG: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:12.089 --> 00:30:13.380
LEON ZHAO: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.790
OK, that's for a
new game release.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.420
So I got a question
of user engagement.

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:42.270
So how do you increase the user
engagement in particular apps?

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.270
Anyone?

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.120
Any suggestions?

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.142
So after they download
the apps how do they--

00:30:48.142 --> 00:30:49.600
MICHAEL YEUNG:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.130
--content is king.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:53.990
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.790
user--user engagement--

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:00.623
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.320
--content--

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.153
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.087
--back button--

00:31:20.087 --> 00:31:20.920
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:23.510
--Android--

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.343
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:30.440
--increase user engagement--
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:35.150
KH MIN: I know an application
which is used car trading.

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:41.120
So you know, I don't search
"new car" every day, right?

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.620
So the [? native ?]
of that service

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.170
is actually that we expect
that user engagement is

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:49.440
super low, right?

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.990
So the app
developers, their idea

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:58.460
is that after analyzing,
OK, so this user likes

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.980
some German cars.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:05.210
And after they
recognize that, they

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:09.030
started to send newsletters
for German cars.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:13.500
So I think you need
to spend some time

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.209
to know more about your users.

00:32:15.209 --> 00:32:17.750
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: I thought
Koreans only like Korean cars.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:29.810
And also keep continuing to
maintain and update the date.

00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:35.130
So if the user couldn't
get that much update

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.880
and no improving
the application,

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:38.230
then the user will leave.

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.860
So keep continuing to
maintain the updates,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.580
and fixing the bugs, and
adding the new functions

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.980
in the application.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:54.960
It's super basic, but that's
the way to get user retentions.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.370
KOH KIM: And take advantage
of the notifications

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:58.740
features, as well.

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.640
It's a great way to communicate
updates to your users.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.390
Or let's say you have upcoming
promotions or things that you

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.060
want to highlight,
notifications are

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.969
a great way to kind of
re-engage users as well.

00:33:11.969 --> 00:33:14.260
HIROTAKA YOSHITSUGU: And from
the developer perspective

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:19.140
is the upkeep, continuing
the updating is pretty--

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.990
given the cost,
have to pay the cost

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.920
to develop those applications.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.060
Then we are college
in Japan market--

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.890
and also the Korean
market-- we inclined

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:32.770
to chance the subscription
business model,

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:36.850
and that business
model makes it more

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:40.640
easy to invest in updating too.

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.010
So that would be more good
feedback from the users,

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:48.540
and then the developer can
give them more updates,

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.930
and the user can continue
to get the new functions.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:55.950
And then if the user keeps
subscribing the contents,

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:58.880
then we probably can
get the monetizations.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.160
So that's a good,
positive spiral.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:06.470
It's getting to trend in
Japan and Korea market.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:09.489
LEON ZHAO: OK, so since
we're on business model

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:13.030
and making money, what are some
of the commonly seen business

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:18.810
models for apps that you
have seen in the market

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.010
that you work with?

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:21.800
I think subscription
is a good one.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:26.020
KOH KIM: Yeah, subscription
is actually one big one.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:30.050
Pandora-- a lot of our music
services-- and media companies

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:33.340
like "New York Times"
employ subscription

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:38.090
as a way to monetize
a lot of their users.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.951
In some cases, you do see
some in-app purchases,

00:34:40.951 --> 00:34:42.409
but it's been
largely subscription.

00:34:47.239 --> 00:34:48.417
LEON ZHAO: OK, cool.

00:34:48.417 --> 00:34:49.250
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:07.140
AUDIENCE: OK, hello.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.960
I'm from Dolphin Browser,
and I'm the product manager

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.200
from Dolphin.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:15.570
So because our
product is browser,

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:19.480
we have to adapt our product
to many different sized Android

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.450
devices.

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:24.400
And this is one of
the biggest challenges

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:29.770
for Android APP is to
adapt to many devices.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:34.440
So for the new material design,
do we have any improvements,

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.130
in terms of when you
design the APP it

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:43.230
can help us better adapt to
different-sized sized devices?

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.950
For example, the menu
may be hidden them

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:50.330
for those screen size devices,
or something like that.

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:51.700
Yeah, that's my first question.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:56.670
And the second question
is, just out of curiosity,

00:35:56.670 --> 00:36:01.420
because I've seen Google has
Google+ and the Maps have many

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.270
good material design

wish [INAUDIBLE] [? Play ?]

[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:37.380
KH MIN: So actually, one
thing I'm going to comment

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:41.640
is actually many
developers, they really

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.780
want to be searched
when users search.

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:51.090
So sometimes they are putting
some irrelevant keywords

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:54.550
on their discussions,
which we prohibited.

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.770
So actually, we are
working on making

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:02.240
the descriptions as relevant as
possible for the applications.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.230
So that's one thing
we are working on.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:09.340
And also the algorithm of the
search is getting improved.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:15.670
So we cannot pin the search and
research for certain keywords.

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:19.430
But we are improving
the search algorithm

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:24.490
so that user can
find the content

00:43:24.490 --> 00:43:26.620
that he or she wants to find.
