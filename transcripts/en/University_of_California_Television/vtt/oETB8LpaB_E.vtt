Bipedal, naked large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:38.670
master of fire, tools and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:48.660
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.150
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

- [Bernard] This is a topic that I have
been thinking about for some time as you

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.370
can gauge by the difference in hair color
in that picture and now. But what I want

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.000
to do today is to try and use the
experience of those years to see whether

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.550
it's taught me anything and also to use
some data from some young people. And I'm

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.070
very grateful to Eve Boyle and to Andrew
Du and to David Patterson who are all

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.130
graduate students in the Home Power
Program at the university where I come

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:44.410
from. And I'm mentioning Mark Collard here
because he and I worked on this now a

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.860
little time ago and I'm going to say some
things that he might or might not agree

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.260
with and I'm just giving him a warning. So
what, what are we looking for? Homo is a

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:06.220
genus and when Mark and I started to think
about this, we could not find a definition

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.670
of a genus that was universally supported.
So we put together, for our own purposes,

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.330
a working definition of a genus and we
suggested that it was "a species or a

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.520
monophyletic group whose members occupy a
single adaptive zone." Now let me try and

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.390
unpack some of that. For a species to be
included in a genus, it should belong to

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:37.080
the same monophyletic group as the type
species of that genus. Now the type

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:47.430
species of a genus Homo is Homo sapiens so
what we argued was that the different

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.570
species deserve to belong to Homo then it
should be in the same monophyletic group.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:04:00.010
Now a slightly shorter term for
monophyletic group is the word clade and

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.520
how do you define a clade? The definition
that we use was "all of the taxa, no more

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:13.270
and no less, that are descended from a
recent common ancestor." Now I like

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:19.760
metaphors from the car industry and so as
not to let my colleagues down, I got some

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:31.190
new ones here. The common ancestor of all
Toyotas is a Toyoda, it's a model which

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:39.070
was developed in 1935 by a company, the
company originally made machinery to made

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.610
textiles. So it did not start as a car
company, but they decided that they wanted

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.960
to make cars and they went to America to
learn how to make cars then they went back

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.900
to Japan and they made a car, and it was
the A1. So that's the common ancestor of

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.510
all the models of Toyota that are and have
ever been. So that's what we're looking

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:13.710
for. The notion of the second criterion
was that for a species to be included in

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.480
Homo its adaptive strategy should be
closer to the one of the type species,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.750
i.e.modern humans, than to the type
species of any other genus. So the

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.530
candidate species that we are thinking
about including in the genus Homo, that

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:37.380
and the type species should be part of the
same grade. So, what is a grade? It's just

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.110
a series of questions that I keep... So a
grade is "a group of taxa that shares a

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:50.890
suite of what we call adaptive features."
So we would suggest that if you do share

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:57.570
those features you are in the same
adaptive zone. So back to the cars. So the

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.670
Toyota Motor Company decided that it
should make a jeep. It saw the success of

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:10.190
the Willys Jeep, it was a four wheel drive
car. So it decided to make its own four

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.760
wheel drive car. My suggestion is that as
soon as you make a four wheel drive car,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.550
you are in a new adaptive zone. You are in
a different adaptive zone and this is the

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:28.470
one that they made. And so my contention
is that in the Toyota clade, that the BJ

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.230
which is what this is, marked the
beginning of a new adaptive zone of four

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:39.220
wheel drive vehicles. Now you could argue
that hybrid cars might be a new adaptive

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.550
zone as well. You could argue that the
design of a minivan which was introduced

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:52.230
by the Toyota Motor Company and it was
called very imaginatively the first one,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:59.480
it was called a van. Okay. And then the
next model was called the Previa, and the

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.540
model that exceeded that was the one that
you see now called the Sienna. My

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:13.120
contention and my suggestion is that the
notion of a minivan is a new adaptive

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.690
zone. There are levels of sophistication.
Now the doors open electronically and you

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:23.800
can argue that, you know, does the
addition of electronic opening doors make

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:29.440
it a new adaptive zone? That's up to you.
My sense is that it's not much different

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.660
as to whether you open the door yourself
or whether they open electrically and so I

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:40.780
wouldn't call that a different adaptive
zone. So here, there are people who are

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:46.980
interested in the evolution of the four
wheel drive vehicles made by Toyota. And

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:52.610
here is an image that was very kindly
found for me by another graduate student

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:58.780
who is called Alexander Pruca [SP], and
you can see that there are people who are

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.100
interested in the evolutionary history of
the Land Cruiser. And so, they are

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:08.090
interested in what we are interested in.
But the problem is but if all the evidence

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:16.370
you had for the evolutionary history of
the Toyota was a few fragments, maybe part

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:22.330
of the windshield, a little bit of the
wheel, something from the grill, a little

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.820
bit of the fender, or something from the
hood. And the problem is you didn't even

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:31.930
have the same parts for the different
models that you're trying to link. That

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:39.720
gives you a sense of what we are trying to
do. We do not have the equivalent of the

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:45.940
luxury of all this information about the
models and the developments within the

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.040
evolutionary history of the Toyota Land
Cruiser. So the second question, what

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:57.680
about the who? The genus Homo was
established by Linnaeus way back in the

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:10.240
18th century. And as the years have gone
by, more and more taxa have been added and

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:15.430
they have been included in the genus. So
initially, the neanderthals were included

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.700
and then the taxon called Homo
heidelbergensis and then the taxon called

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:26.350
Homo rudolfensis and then a taxon called
Homo soloensis. And maybe the biggest

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:34.350
addition was made by Ernst Mayr during the
second World War when he suggested that

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:41.400
the taxa that had been in the genus of the
genera, tymantrabus and the genus

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:48.410
phyticantrobus, should be included in
Homo. So as the years went by, the genus

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:57.120
Homo became more and more inclusive. The
criteria for admission were relaxed. The

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.390
initial criterion was you had to have a
brain as large as ours. So admitting Homo

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:07.200
neanderthalensis, that wasn't a big, that
wasn't a huge deal because they had large

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:13.870
brains, too. But by the time you get to
including Homo erectus in Homo you are

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:19.130
admitting that this is a genus that can
have individuals that can have brains half

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:27.280
the size of the average modern human. Then
in 1964, Louis Leakey and the person of

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.340
the Leakeys had recruited to help them
interpret the anatomy of their fossils,

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:38.040
Phillip Tobias and John Napier, they
published a paper in Nature suggesting

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:43.910
that some fossil that had been found at
Olduvai should be included in a new

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:49.800
species and that species name was habilis.
But maybe more controversially, they

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:55.620
suggested that that species should be
included in Homo. Now that meant relaxing

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:03.660
the criteria even more and the question
is, was that process of relaxation, that

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:11.120
last process of relaxation, to what extent
did that stay within the definition of a

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:15.700
genus that Mark and I suggested? In other
words, is Homo habilis part of the same

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:22.320
clade and is Homo habilis part of the same
grade? What we argued in a paper in

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:28.810
Science way back was that we didn't think
the evidence was all that strong, but

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:33.440
let's get back to that. So how has this
process of progressive inclusivity

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.510
affected the grade definition of Homo?
This is an extremely speciose

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:45.030
interpretation of the Hominin fossil
record. Modern humans are in the top left.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:49.920
What I call a gray...which I call
pre-modern Homo which includes

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:55.480
neanderthals and the heidelbergensis and
Homo erectus is in the blue. And then the

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.040
hominids that Bill Kimble is going to be
talking about, the mustard colored ones

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.200
are down in the bottom right. And then
there are some rather brownish ones which

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.010
are rather like the mustard colored ones
except they have extremely large molars

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:14.350
and pre-molars. These are animals with
very large mandibles and very large post

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:21.660
canine teeth. So the inclusion of Homo
habilis in Homo meant that the genus Homo

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:29.050
would include what I've called pre-modern
Homo plus the taxa that have called

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:34.900
transitional homonins on the basis of the
findings that Mark and I published way

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:43.190
back in 1999. Now I think that paper was
superbly well argued and was extremely

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:50.740
clearly written, but it made hardly any
impression on my colleagues. And it's fair

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:56.550
to say that apart from a few discerning
and discriminating scientists, most people

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:02.640
still include the taxa Homo habilis and
Homo rudolfensis within the genus Homo. So

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:07.670
that's one way of interpreting the genus
Homo. So the origin of the genus Homo

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:12.470
would be how do you explain the appearance
of Homo habilis? That's another way of

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:18.120
asking the same question. In which case,
you would include Homo habilis and Homo

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:22.240
rudolfensis which is some people think
might be distinct from Homo habilis but

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.350
it's a similar sort of organism. You would
include them in the dark blue category, in

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:32.680
the dark blue grade. If Mark and I are
correct then you would extend the genus

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:38.000
Homo down that far. You would
stop at the beginning of Homo erectus. In

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.910
which case you would regard Homo habilis
and Homo rudolfensis as not the same

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:50.580
species as the other australopiths but
nonetheless, within the same adaptive zone

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.500
as the other australopiths. So what has
happened since the publication of the

00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:00.890
paper in Science that nobody took any
notice of in 1999? More fossil evidence

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:06.620
has been found and not only has more
fossil evidence...more fossils been found

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:11.930
that the existing fossils have been
reanalyzed and reconstructed and so on. So

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:16.340
that's one development. The other
development is that we have new data and

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.890
there people who are reassessing the
existing data which relate to what I call

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.510
the functional capacities of these
animals. What can we infer about how

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.270
dextrous they were? What can we infer
about how smart they were? What can we

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:36.420
infer about what they were eating? These
are just a few of the publications that

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:42.910
are relevant to this, but I want to talk
about the categories of the data that

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:47.650
speak to cognition and some new data that
speak to diet. Now in relation to

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:55.650
cognition, these are not new data. Most of
the data that were analyzed were the

00:14:55.650 --> 00:15:00.580
specimens which were used by Leslie Aiello
who's in the audience and she will be

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:05.590
speaking later. And this was a plot which
was published in a paper and this was a

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:10.830
paper which looked at the relationship
between brain size and other revolutionary

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:16.940
trends. And it was this plot which gave
rise to this notion that there was a

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:23.810
burst, there was a period of relatively
sudden increase in brain size of the

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:27.410
origin of the genus Homo and then there
was another burst of increase in brain

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:34.890
size at the origin of the species Homo
sapiens. But these data, the plot looks as

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:39.350
if it is consistent with that
interpretation, but the plot represents

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:46.340
each value as one point. And the problem
with the plot is that the data are subject

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:50.140
to error. In other words, there is error
in the estimation of the endocranial

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.800
volume and there is error in the
estimation of the age. So what a bunch of

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.790
graduate students did led by Andrew Du was
to look at these data again. And so these

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:05.100
are the data and it's the other way
around, in other words, the older data are

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.360
to the left and the younger data on to the
right. So those are also point data. But

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.920
then if you add the error, the error of
the age and the error of the estimation of

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.040
the endocranial volume, you see that the
data look rather different. Then when you

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:23.330
do some very fancy statistics, which I was
very tempted to pretend that I knew what

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:26.790
they were but I decided that I wasn't
going to pretend that I knew what they

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:33.080
were. And then they tested the data
against various modes of change, random

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.340
walk, or gradualism, or stasis, or
punctuated equilibrium which was the

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:44.110
hypothesis of the relatively sudden
increase in brain size, and so on and so

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:51.020
forth. They found that the mode
which had much the greatest amount of

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:56.550
support was gradualism. So in other words,
the data if you account for the error of

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:01.390
the age and the estimate of the
endocranial volume, there is no evidence

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:08.520
of a punctuated event. So how about diet?
Well, this is work of David Pattison. And

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:13.570
you can see here that there are three
color bands. The australopiths that Bill

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:17.760
is going to be talking about. So you can
see they are in the light green band and

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.200
then the first of the red columns
represents the early evidence for Homo in

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:28.770
the Turkana Basin which is either Homo
habilis or it's Homo rudolfensis. And then

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:33.060
the second of the red columns is the
evidence for Homo in the Turkana Basin

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:39.230
which is Homo erectus or Homo ergaster. So
if the major grade shift was between the

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:44.210
australopiths and the first red column,
you wouldn't expect the first red column

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:48.760
to be where it is because these are carbon
isotope values. So there is a shift

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.560
between the first red column, in other
words, Homo habilis and the second red

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.830
column which is Homo erectus. Here is
David and he's the one who's collected

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:03.990
these data. So if you look at this plot,
you can see the blue squares are

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:09.930
Paranthropus boisei who are living in
exactly the same lake basin as what is

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:15.800
alleged to be Homo habilis and widely
accepted to be Homo erectus. And there is

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:21.240
no change in isotopic signal or the
Paranthropus boisei individuals, but there

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:27.160
is a change in isotopic signal for Homo.
So there is a more C3 signal for Homo

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.990
habilis and then there is a significantly
different, more C4 signal for Homo

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:36.050
erectus. You might say, "Well, that's just
because the environment was changing and

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:40.040
everything was changing and Paranthropus
boisei was the only large mammal that

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.570
wasn't changing." Well, that's not true.
If you look at all the other large

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:48.570
mammals, they don't change and
Paranthropus boisei doesn't change, it's

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:54.780
just Homo that does. So there is a dietary
shift from Homo habilis to Homo erectus

00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:00.560
and the isotopic signal for the diet of
Homo habilis is no different from the

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:07.920
isotopic signals of the creatures that
proceeded it and we call australopiths. So

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:15.300
my suggestion is that we just should not
assume that the interesting things were

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:20.950
happening around the appearance of Homo
habilis. My suggestion is no different

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:27.850
from the suggestion we made in the paper
in 1999, that most of the action is around

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:32.710
the appearance of Homo erectus and it's
not around the appearance of Homo habilis.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.159
Thank you very much.
