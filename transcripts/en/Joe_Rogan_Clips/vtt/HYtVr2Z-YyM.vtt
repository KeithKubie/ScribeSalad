00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.920
What do you plan on doing this Mtma therapy on a regular basis?

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.650
And what,
what sort of an impact do you think?
I mean,

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.930
when you go over the results of the first therapy where you are almost

4
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:16.110
immediately alleviates you have a lot of your feelings,

5
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:20.210
but you still are thinking about planning your next adventure and your,

6
00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:21.420
your next project.

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.760
<v 1>Um,
I'm probably going to do a full session.</v>

8
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.370
The therapist recommended a full session,
which isn't what they normally do.

9
00:00:26.371 --> 00:00:29.910
But that said,
I mean,
I thought,
I thought being able to cry,

10
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.270
it would be a major breakthrough.
And as part of this therapy,
um,

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.310
and actually do you normally can't cry at all?

12
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.260
I haven't cried since I was 13 years old or something.
14.

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.440
Well that's different because that predates your war correspondents.
Yeah.
Yeah.

14
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.570
I mean,
English culture,
it's,
you know,

15
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.630
my grandparents fought in the war were tough as nails.
It's,
you know,

16
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.660
there is this pressure to be,
to be tough.
Uh,

17
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.640
and the first normal therapy session,

18
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.770
I told her what I thought was quite an everyday story about an experience in war

19
00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:00.150
to the therapist.
And he cried.
Oh,
Jesus.

20
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.170
And then the first MGMA session,
the therapist cried.

21
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.320
I didn't have two or three times in the camera,
man cried and I still,

22
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.430
I still couldn't get there.

23
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.450
And then the third session I nearly did and I liked my jaw was trembling and I

24
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:14.100
kinda thought,
oh,
there's,
there's going to be this,

25
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.740
what would have felt like a breakthrough and still hasn't happened.

26
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.870
What w what were they crying about?
Uh,

27
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.310
I can't even remember what stories you just had to share has been Obama.

28
00:01:26.311 --> 00:01:28.410
Like the stories,
I just tell him that,
you know,
well,
I mean,

29
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:32.580
I'm joking kind of joke.
It's this very happy you're talking about it.

30
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.780
This is one of the,
you know,

31
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.130
one of the lesser symptoms of doing this as you turn up to a party or a dinner

32
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.360
or something,
you know,
with people that are enjoying this out,
that sales,

33
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.950
the smiling,
it was like,
oh,
this is Ben.
Ben just come back from,
from Yemen.

34
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.880
I would say like in Yemen,
Ben,
you really,
really want to know.
Yeah,
tell us.

35
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.970
And then 10 minutes later there's this dark cloud of evening and everyone says,

36
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.090
oh Jesus.
So you just feel like you're,
you know,
you're just killing,
killing the,

37
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.510
they're cutting and their steak and you're talking to,
yeah,
your leg amputated.

38
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.130
And I've got bad habit of doing that,

39
00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.340
but I can't even remember what the is where that,
that,
that had that effect.

40
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.970
What does it like when you go to dinner with fellow war journalists?

41
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.870
Um,
what are you guys talking about?

42
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.380
I know there's a few that are already good friends and we can talk about all

43
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:19.080
that stuff.
There's a lot of that.
I'm not,
I'm not that close to,

44
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.970
and I don't like the,
you know,
the,
the mutual,
you know,

45
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.400
um,
backpacking that goes on with it.
And it was,
I what it is,
I kind of think,

46
00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:31.680
you know,
if you're doing this for a living,
like you,
you,

47
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.500
you shouldn't be sharing stories with other people who cover that country.

48
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.350
Other other people from,
you know,
from your background,
from your country,

49
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.160
you should be talking to the people from that country and a lot of journalists,

50
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:45.030
I mean,
it's possible in Afghanistan,
in Syria,
in Iraq,
to have a pretty good life.

51
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.480
You stay in the five star hotel,
you eat well,
drink wine every night,

52
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:51.870
and you know,
you get information from each other.
Right.

53
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.710
And I think that defeats the point of,
of foreign reporting.
Oh,
I see.

54
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.160
So consciously or unconsciously,
I,
I'm not,
I'm not,
you know,
I don't,

55
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.110
I don't spend a lot of time with,
with other watch unless there were,

56
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.180
there were those who were deeply admire who I see every now and again,

57
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:08.130
like Sebastian younger.
Um,
but I'm not,
I don't,
I don't hang out with them day in,

58
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.940
day out.
So there's levels to the involvement.
Yeah.
To,
whether,

59
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.370
how deeply you're immersed and it's,
it's,

60
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:18.340
it's completely upside down in the state because the TV,

61
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.390
new Gen TV news journalists aren't deeply involved and just want to get that

62
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:24.630
quick shot of them looking like that somewhere Middle East,

63
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.780
he closest to the front line with the flak jacket on the perfectly ironed shirt

64
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:30.910
and they're not,
they're not sweating or even worse,

65
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.400
the Brian Williams type situation.
Yeah,
yeah.

66
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.200
Or on the roof of the five star hotel.

67
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:38.590
Sometimes you might see people report about what's happening with Isis and

68
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:40.380
they're in Beirut.
Right.

69
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.150
And I think they're relying on the fact that a lot of people don't understand

70
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:46.570
that's a different country.
Um,
but you know,
those guys,

71
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:49.900
some of those guys are paid millions and treated very,
very well.

72
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.980
The photographers and print journalists who are immersed and aren't spending

73
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:57.670
weeks there as sometimes struggling to make a living and aren't well known and

74
00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:58.504
aren't well supported.

75
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.980
What is it about the talking head in front of the camera that we want so badly?

76
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.210
I mean,
I think it's,
it's a way for the news networks to,
to,
you know,

77
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.900
claim credibility and then when you see them get deployed,

78
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.010
they're not focused on getting material from the war in these countries.

79
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:16.450
They're focused on the,
on the two way.

80
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.920
Right now it's essentially a guy from wherever.
Right.

81
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.920
That's more important than actually spending days collecting footage of what's

82
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:24.754
actually going on.

83
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.910
It seems like you see that rarely if ever these days it's more and more rare.

84
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.200
And it seemed to me that during like Desert Storm,
um,
in the 90s,

85
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.550
there was always someone that was over there and it seemed like there was real

86
00:04:39.551 --> 00:04:41.590
threat and it was really going on.

87
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.070
But now everything seems to be done from the desk and you don't really see a lot

88
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:49.420
of,
I mean,
am I right about that?
Yeah.
I mean,

89
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:52.240
I think in most of a lot of the major news networks said to their crews,

90
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:54.760
you're not allowed to spend the night in Mosul.
You know,

91
00:04:54.761 --> 00:04:57.180
you can go there and film a street interviews,

92
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.110
some refugees who just escaped isis territory,

93
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:00.940
but you can't spend days on end there.

94
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.490
Whereas the freelance photographers and some of the writers,

95
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:06.640
they were spending days on end there and getting,
getting the real stuff.

96
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.290
Is it because the on camera people will be targeted?
Um,

97
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.230
I just think the risk is too high,
full stop for the entire crew.

98
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.550
And certainly if you know,

99
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:18.670
when a story is really big and you send one of the very well known of

100
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:21.520
correspondence there,
then yeah,
they can't be running around,
um,
you know,

101
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.990
filming house to house fighting.

102
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.680
So when you're over there and you see these guys show up and you know that

103
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:30.020
they're just going to be hanging out with the hotel and what is that feeling

104
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.650
like?
Uh,
yeah.
I mean,
I'm pretty disdainful of those guys.

105
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.820
You have to,
yeah.
Yeah.
You see these films like,
um,
whiskey,
tango,

106
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:43.910
Foxtrot about Afghanistan and I just,
yeah,
I just don't recognize that,

107
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.960
that world that,
you know,
partying every night at whatever bar or restaurant.

108
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.020
I just,
I just think if you're there and you're obviously in the wrong place,

109
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.740
right,
right.
And it's not,
it's not an adventure,
you know,

110
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.770
it's not a fun trip for you of,
of wild times.
And you know,
it shouldn't be that.

111
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:02.570
It should be,
um,
I mean from,
it feels like an endurance test every time you go.

112
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.890
It should be hard and you should be spending time with the people you're

113
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.850
covering.
And you know,
sometimes you can,

114
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.880
you can think you've finished with someone and just go for dinner or tea.

115
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.740
And just by having normal human conversations,

116
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:15.620
you find out so much other stuff that you didn't go there to report on.
You know,

117
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:18.440
that's,
that's,
that's what you have to be doing.
And that takes weeks,

118
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.850
weeks of getting closer to them and gain their trust.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
And just,

119
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:25.550
just,
just,
you know,
spending enough time there where you,

120
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.820
you then end up being in the right place at the right time to show something

121
00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.400
really happening.
I mean in Mosul,
we filmed a,

122
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:35.090
the Iraqi army attacking a house where Isis was shooting from the house and

123
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:37.980
there were three or four families in the house.
Um,

124
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.840
so the Iraqi army shot at Isis or the isis guys went down and encourage the

125
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:43.430
families to run towards us.

126
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.620
And just seeing that moment of civilians fleeing and escaping isis for the first

127
00:06:48.621 --> 00:06:51.230
time after three years.
And when they turned the corner and tore us,

128
00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.050
they knew that made it,
and they just collapsed to the ground.

129
00:06:54.051 --> 00:06:55.970
They were kissing the ground.
They were hugging each other.

130
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.470
Now those are the moments you,
you,
you're,
you're,
you're trying to capture.
Just,

131
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.350
I mean,
I've never seen relief like it.
