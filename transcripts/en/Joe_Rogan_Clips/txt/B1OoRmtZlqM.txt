Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. I did have, I did a good practical joke at that place one time. There's this comedian named James Sibley. Great Guy. Very funny southern dude. Uh, we were sharing a condo somewhere, I think in myrtle beach. And uh, as a joke, I thought it'd be funny when he's leaving to put a condom wrapper in his bag and I go, ha, tell him how you so fast. So I did that. Right. And they did this happen to you? Okay. No. Okay. So he goes away. I don't see him for a year or two, maybe three. And he's divorced now. Well, the first thing he did, this is Atlanta punchline he walked up to is like, you motherfucker, you know what you did to me. You want me got get divorced. Like it was as long thing. I was like two, I am so sorry. I was stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:50          It was just done. I already had, I wouldn't even planned out. It was sitting right there. I just do it in there. Huh? Maybe he'll find it when, as he's packing to go home. I didn't, I didn't think yourself, you know, so I felt really bad about it. He goes, I'm going to get you back. And I'm like, okay. And that stupid green room they have in that corner at the punchline, right where you're sitting in there, there's no access to a bathroom or if you just poke your head out, everybody can see you like who's in there? What's going on? Right. So I'm sitting in there, he goes, all right, here's what I'm going to do when you go on stage, because he was opening for me. I'm going to put mustard all over the door, knobs in here. Okay. And you're going to be in such a hurry to get out of there and go back to your stupid merge title that you're not even gonna.

Speaker 1:          01:30          Remember that I told you there's mustard all over this door knob and you're just going to grab mustard on your head. It wasn't as good as me getting him with a condom, obviously. But he was right. Like I go on stage. He told you he was going to do, he told me he was going to do it. I said, a cat's out the bag. Jen's not going to happen. And of course I grabbed it right away. I was like, okay. Are you still close with them? Do you know? Yeah. Well not, I mean, as close as I can be, but uh, we're good. We're fine. Did you have to talk to his wife? No. He's got a new life now. I'm not going to be one. If it was, it was the first step. Maybe. So first spend the first name. That's right. Yeah. You're welcome. You're welcome. New Eyes. Glass is half full. Okay. Settle the fuck down. Everybody welcome. New White. Yeah. Yeah. It was like God's plan. That's right. Yeah. And where are we? I was like, come on man. And a lot of ways, what if God was one of us? He is. It's me. It's not a song. He is. It is. Who Sang that song? Jane Osborne, I think. Yeah. You know what's really funny? Am I right? Yeah. I was born pretty close. Pretty close. You're not impressed with the speed of that. I was very quick. Thank you DJ.
