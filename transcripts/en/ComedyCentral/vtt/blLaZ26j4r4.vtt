00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:23.589 align:start position:0% line:91%
DO YOU THINK HE CAN APPEAL TO
THE BLACK VOTE?

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.158 align:start position:0% line:91%

(LAUGHTER)
HE'S GOT HIS OWN COLOGNE.

HE'S GOT TONS OF BABY MAMAS.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.781 align:start position:0% line:91%

HE'S HAD COURT APPEARANCES.

00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:50.450 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND HE'S DEALT WITH
BANKRUPTCIES.

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:56.188 align:start position:0% line:85%
HOLD ON.

00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:57.723 align:start position:0% line:91%

HIM BECAUSE HE SEEMS LIKE A

00:00:57.756 --> 00:00:59.292 align:start position:0% line:85%
'90s RAPPER?

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:00.493 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.507 align:start position:0% line:85%
OKAY.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.976 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I GUESS I CAN SEE WHY BLACK

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.445 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAIT,
BUT ISN'T HE PISSING EVERYBODY

REPUBLICAN PARTY.

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:32.091 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
I'M TELLING YOU, MAN.

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:35.394 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALL HE NEEDS IS TO GET SHOT NINE
TIMES, AND HE'S GOLDEN.

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:35.928 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HOLD ON.

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:36.462 align:start position:0% line:85%

&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, YEAH.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.878 line:85%

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:52.478 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; UH-HUH.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:55.615 align:start position:0% line:85%

AND REPUBLICANS LOVE IT EVEN
MORE COMING FROM A WHITE GUY.

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:44.764 align:start position:0% line:91%
