1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,880
And now to keep us in our oopsie
mood. Here's another Cupertino oops.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,620
From language expert Ben Zimmer.
So back in October, oh six Reuters,

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:13,900
the news wire had an article
about honeybees. And uh,

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,140
there was some very interesting sentences
in this article about honey bees,

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,071
for instance.

6
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:24,071
Did you know quote Queen Elizabeth has
10 times the lifespan of workers and lays

7
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:29,480
up to 2000 eggs a day. That's
why she's a very nice girl,

8
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:32,000
but doesn't have a lot to say because
there's all these eggs dropping on the

9
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:35,210
floor with its highly evolved social
structure of tens of thousands of worker

10
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:37,040
bees commanded by Queen Elizabeth.

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,920
The honeybee genome could also improve
the search for genes linked to social

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,610
behavior. So every time a
clean reference came in,

13
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:46,760
they were commanded to that
particular queen. Whenever the words,

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,730
the Queen appeared in this
article, it had to be the queen.

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,790
So the queen was being
replaced with Queen Elizabeth,

16
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,640
unfortunately in an
article about honeybees.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,433
Yeah.

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,950
[inaudible]

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,760
this next oop singular oop, wouldn't
it be, I mean, if you have one, oop.

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,680
Wouldn't be never heard that man sister
a new clinic. Oop. This next one.

21
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:19,850
It raises the question of, I
guess you'd say, of moral balance.

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,200
The question that I don't think any of
us would want to have to answer comes to

23
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:28,510
us from our producer, Lulu Miller.
Okay, so set up this story a,

24
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:33,511
this story happens where it's in a little
town in northern Michigan called Myo

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,900
7:00 AM just drove through
the Delaware water gap.

26
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,150
That's me on my way out
there from New York.

27
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,270
The Sun is rising and it's about an 800
mile drive and it's just gorgeous out

28
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:51,780
here. Listen to you. Lush and nausea.

29
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:57,060
I know, but I'm just one of those
people. When I get out into nature,

30
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:02,750
I feel my in the world
anyways. Crossed into Myo.

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,000
What was the reason you were
going again to see a bird? A very,

32
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,650
not just rare,

33
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,880
not just the kind of bird birders
get obsessed about this is a bird.

34
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:18,290
This is what they call a life bird
life. Birders wait their life to see it.

35
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,890
Really? Yeah. Only found right
here. What's the bird called?

36
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,670
The Kirtland warbler. And have you,
have you seen apparently before? No,

37
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:29,060
I've never seen one. This is my first
trip up here and this right here.

38
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:29,600
Where are you?

39
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,320
We're just outside of town on the edge
of the forest about to go in and I'm

40
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:37,040
standing with about 15 people
who come from everywhere.

41
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,510
Are you folks coming from to see this?
Bert, Toledo. I'm from South Carolina.

42
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,530
We're from Oregon, Wyoming.
We'll walk out to a spot,

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,120
try to stay single file park ranger leads
us down a path into a little clearing

44
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,490
and pretty immediately back
ground there. Way Back there.

45
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,110
The guy from Ohio,
spots of Kirtland there.

46
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:03,790
See good turn around the tiny
yellow bird back there, right there.

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,440
Up High in the Jack Pine Tree. Oh
Great. It's singing like crazy.

48
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,090
The lady from Dayton starts clapping.

49
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,900
Grab what you're saying. I see
a lovely bird with a gray bag.

50
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:17,120
This is a guy from Oregon, Jim Coleman,

51
00:03:17,121 --> 00:03:22,010
blue gray bag and his wife Frieda smaller
than a rob and brilliant yellow in the

52
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:26,090
sunlight is just an
absolutely radiant bird. Yeah.

53
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,780
Is this worth the trip tomorrow
again? Oh, you bet. I don't know.

54
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,340
It just makes me thankful
that I'm here. So,

55
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,800
and it makes me grateful
that my wife is here.

56
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,950
I know this is something she's
willing to see a lot for a long time.

57
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,650
I know Jim actually starts to tear up.

58
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,030
It's a very special bird.
Oh my hand. Yeah, that guy.

59
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,940
And that's what this story is really
about. How special is this bird?

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,910
Meaning well, how much
is a species? Right,

61
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,023
right.

62
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,850
Um, well, here's the backstory. Okay.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,150
In the early seventies the
warbler almost went extinct.

64
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,070
The reason why it was thought was
because of a little creature called the

65
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:17,100
Calbert. I want to go in. Okay.
That's just the sound of them.

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,360
It's a parasite, you know,
on someone who is this guy?

67
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,960
This is Chris Mensing fish and wildlife
biologist with the US fish and wildlife

68
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:25,530
service.

69
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,210
And we're standing in this cage full
of cowbirds or looks like we've got six

70
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:33,120
males and one female.
Let me grab a couple.

71
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,990
You just reached out and grabbed two of
them. You can put it that and the males.

72
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,023
Yeah, go ahead.

73
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,950
Imagine a tiny little gnarly crow
got really sharp little beaks,

74
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,640
but with this blunt dagger like beats,
very drab body. I'm very doll to,

75
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,590
here's what the Calbert does to the
warbler while the warbler is out of its

76
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:54,810
nest, like getting a
worm or something. Yeah.

77
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,860
The Calbert lay is one of its own
eggs in the nest to make room for it.

78
00:04:58,861 --> 00:05:00,480
So the warbler doesn't
know anything is up.

79
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
It pushes out one of the warblers
eggs. Oh yeah. To the nest.

80
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,790
And the timing is such that the cupboard
egg will hatch first and will double

81
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:12,990
its size in 24 hours. Wow. So by
the time that the host birds hatch,

82
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,920
that Coburg may be up to four times the
size and when they start begging for

83
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:18,690
food, but parents, the loudest,

84
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,260
most aggressive chick is going
to get fed the cupboard chick.

85
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,840
So the warbler mom ends up shoveling
food into this Calbert chip. Yep.

86
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,320
Oftentimes it gets so much food
that another warbird chick will die.

87
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,730
So when the cowbirds first showed up in
this area in late 18 hundreds early 19

88
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:36,070
hundreds the warbler population
just started plummeting.

89
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,660
This huge drop by 1971 are
only 200 males on earth.

90
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,320
Well, so what do you do? Are
you asking me [inaudible]

91
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:50,150
um, I guess you get to
kill the cat. Exactly. Um,

92
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,200
this is one of 54 traps and new
one that we just built this year,

93
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,840
which is why we're out in this cage. It's
actually a cowbird trap. Oh, she did?

94
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,040
Yeah, she, yeah, she bite me. They just
like anyone else, get someone larger,

95
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,720
grabbing you. They don't
appreciate it too much.

96
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
And so anyone know how to
kill him? I kind of do. Yeah.

97
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,570
Thoracic compression is the term we
use. We basically squeeze the bird,

98
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,650
suffocating and preventing it from
breathing in your hands. There's no, Yup.

99
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,810
Yup. Yeah. You have to do that. Yeah.
Like all the time. Yeah. Did you see this?

100
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,673
No,

101
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,960
but 1972 fish and wildlife service
sets up a bunch of traps a few years,

102
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:28,800
and about 12,000 dead cow birds later

103
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,113
[inaudible]

104
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,410
kind of the population stopped dying off,

105
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,010
but then it didn't start
bouncing back. What's going on?

106
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,750
Why aren't we seeing bigger numbers now
that we're catching the copperheads,

107
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,890
that's Rita Harbison.

108
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,610
She worked with the forest service back
in the 80s and we thought well if we

109
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:56,210
finally concluded it must be
just, there is not enough habitat.

110
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,980
Like they don't have enough trees.
Well No, there are plenty of trees.

111
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:04,490
But the thing about warblers is
they like a specific kind of tree.

112
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,320
They like them very young.

113
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,640
They're like I'm young, but they like
young trees is what you're saying. Yup.

114
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,360
And there aren't young trees in
this place? No. It's really weird.

115
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,910
When when they started looking
around this forest they noticed,

116
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,690
well the trees were really, really old.
Why wouldn't there be young trees? Well

117
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,440
[inaudible] hey smokey bear seat.

118
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:40,000
When humans began to settle in this
area of Michigan in about the 1880s they

119
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,780
brought with them that certain
human disdain for fire.

120
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,570
The fire is exactly what's needed
up there to make new trees.

121
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,470
This ecosystem is a fire
ecosystem says Chris, it burns.

122
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,790
Cause when these trees burn,

123
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:01,150
they release their seeds and
make room for new trees to grow.

124
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,770
It is a fire ecosystem. It is
made to burn. So I ask you again,

125
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:10,030
what do you do? Do you start
fires? Would that be the solution?

126
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,150
That would be the solution. While,
so the forestry started doing,

127
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,580
when we call a prescribed
burn, basically it says Rita,

128
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:17,170
they burned down a little patch of forest,

129
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,200
a few acres to regenerate it and one
windy spring day in 1980 at a place called

130
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,980
Mac Lake. The forestry service started a
fire that they probably shouldn't have.

131
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,900
Okay. My name is Dick Lord. At
the time of the Mac lake fire,

132
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,950
I was part of the ignition
crew for the prescribed burn.

133
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,580
What does an ignition crew,
uh, they liked the farm.

134
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,543
So at 10 in the morning,

135
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,980
Dick and his crew go out into the
woods when the plants start setting up

136
00:08:44,981 --> 00:08:49,450
perimeters and they begin lighting a few
stands of shrubs. I was driving home,

137
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,660
that's Bob Burner. Best
name ever for firefighter.

138
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,520
I could see for service
starting to do a burn.

139
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,990
And I thought this is not
a good time. It was windy.

140
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,330
They didn't have the man
power. And I says, well,

141
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,280
it probably would be getting
called out here shortly.

142
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Basically we did not realize that whether
it was going to change as rapidly as

143
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:13,560
it did, the wind came up suddenly,

144
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,060
something nobody could predict and it
took the fire across the road into a

145
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:19,650
standard mature Jack Pine.

146
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,770
[inaudible] flames, probably
a hundred 150 feet in here.

147
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,420
The sound is like a roaring train before
his guys jumped into their bulldozers,

148
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,320
trying to plow trenches alongside the
pinch at all and I mean you can feel the

149
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,320
heat. It was way out of our control
hitting the tops of the trees rolling.

150
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,780
I knew at the rate it was traveling
that no one was going to be a major

151
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,033
catastrophe

152
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,930
within six hours. It had
burned over 20,000 acres.

153
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,950
It's one of the fastest moving fires
ever documented. Yeah. Well through here,

154
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,850
far as you can see, it was all
black. These are two guys I,

155
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,530
Bob owned houses in the
area that got burnt.

156
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,470
I remember the guy down there in a corner.
Yeah, grabbed it off during the drop.

157
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,600
The Black Charlie, their houses were okay,

158
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:17,570
but 41 houses were destroyed all the
way up to the lake, so just completely,

159
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,550
yeah, nothing green. No like
something out of a moonscape fire.

160
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,341
As you could see,

161
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:28,320
everything gone and the worst part about
it for all of us that's read a hell of

162
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:32,160
a sin. Again, one set, it killed.
One of the forest service employees,

163
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:37,161
a very young wildlife technician who
was very well loved by his coworkers.

164
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,010
A guy named Jim Swiderski and
old Jim was a good friend.

165
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,873
Yeah.

166
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,440
As well as an employee
declared again, Jim's boss.

167
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,990
He told me that Jim had been
a postman for a few years,

168
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,820
but just loved birds so much that he
took a huge pay cut to come and help

169
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,930
protect the warbler. Basically
what happened was, oh,

170
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,270
the fire overran him. Oh,

171
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:08,410
the press was having a heyday just tearing
into the forest service for what had

172
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:11,950
happened. The towns, people were
very angry at the forest service.

173
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,360
How can you do this? Rita says,

174
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:16,770
they were told not to wear their
forest service uniforms in town. Gosh,

175
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,830
it was so terrible in the
forest itself. You know,

176
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,290
there was nothing there.
It was completely silent.

177
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,560
But a year later,

178
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:33,050
a little bit of green started to poke up
in the next year a little bit more and

179
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,470
eight to 10 years after that Mac like
Bern just seemed like everywhere you

180
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:38,890
turned around you'd stop for, listen,

181
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:43,980
there were five or six birds,
the tremendous number of person.

182
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,310
That was the, the answer to the
mystery, the fire. You know,

183
00:11:49,311 --> 00:11:52,220
if you look at a population graph,
that's Christmas sing again.

184
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,100
After that medical lake population

185
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,460
went like that, he points his hands
straight up. And so it's pretty dramatic.

186
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,290
Today the numbers are
up to almost 4,000 birds

187
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,240
and growing, seeing it like crazy

188
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,940
now that the birds are
back, but a man has gone.

189
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,580
When you walk around this town,
a question lingers in the air.

190
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,210
Weiss was a fireman
worth the life of a bird?

191
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,393
Pick a woman.

192
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,180
No. My opinion it isn't.

193
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,980
This is Ed Faucet.

194
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,970
I wouldn't trade your life for a bird
and sitting with him and his wife,

195
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:43,120
Mary Jane and then in a diner.

196
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,110
And no matter where you go in
this town, government doing,

197
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:50,970
people don't tend to be huge fans of
the warbler. It's just a small bird.

198
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,600
And I've been up here since 68 I'd never
seen one. Did you ever see one? No,

199
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:00,010
never have I seen it. And back
to Ed, I just got to say to you,

200
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:01,300
what would you think about it?

201
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:06,301
If your father or brother
were killed for a bird,

202
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,150
be pretty hard to accept, wouldn't it?

203
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,510
But if you zoom out one human
life versus the end of a species,

204
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,140
you know how many workers
there are in the United States?

205
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,390
Cause something like 37 species of
warblers and the real number is actually

206
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,810
closer to 60 that's kind of ridiculous.

207
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,830
And that's not all the asco. When are
you done? And we really say never.

208
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,370
Chris explained to me that they have to
keep killing the cowbirds and they have

209
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:35,680
to keep doing burns, smeller burns.

210
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:40,270
But every single year if we let things
be, the bird would be extinct. Wow.

211
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:44,470
That's the hard thing about this job
is knowing that we're never done.

212
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,330
How many people are working,

213
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:49,780
how much you're probably looking
at hundreds of people. Well,

214
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:54,100
over $1 million a year spent. All
of this began to really sink in.

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,050
I'm one of my last mornings
out there. All right.

216
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,030
It is five in the morning. It was
the annual Kirtland warbler. Census

217
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,450
were birders from all over the world
show up to help count how many warblers

218
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:14,130
there are out there. Is it like there
is a warbler step that steps up?

219
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,780
There's a warbler. Yeah. Yeah.
That's actually exactly how it works.

220
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,820
I was paired up with
this guy, Dave Mendez.

221
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:22,610
We're going to kind of walk through
the middle of these transects.

222
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:25,640
We're going to come up. He's kind
of a dude, dude. He's an older guy,

223
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,430
got a beard and work for
an electrical contractor.

224
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,090
Told me he's got a man room and man
room. You know, most guys got sports,

225
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,080
but I've got Kirtland's warbler
pictures up on the wall,

226
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,010
so I went into it thinking like, this'll
be really cool. We'll march along.

227
00:14:40,011 --> 00:14:43,910
We'll count it. I looked at the
map. It was a mile maybe of a walk.

228
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,730
We'll be done in 20 minutes.
Well, okay, maybe not.

229
00:14:46,731 --> 00:14:51,731
We're rocking through the forest on our
top and we set off dense brambly forest.

230
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:59,030
Still Dark, so that was a hermit.

231
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:02,270
Thrush. Okay. Let me just play
you a quick little time lapse.

232
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,590
20 to seven right now the sun's just
coming up and it's get a little muggy out

233
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,424
here.

234
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,860
Yeah, it was a curtain. Oh yeah.
Yeah. We can't count them though.

235
00:15:11,861 --> 00:15:16,660
He's not in our section seven oh
seven I heard one way back that way.

236
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:19,030
Yeah. Yeah. There it is again,

237
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,040
but I'm not going to mark
them then because I don't
know exactly where he's at.

238
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:29,620
Seven 33 there he go.
Yeah. Nope. Right there.

239
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,203
No, no, no,

240
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,880
no, nope. We want to be a lot more
accurate. We want to triangulate them.

241
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,490
Nine 56 in all's well
in the warbler woods.

242
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:42,840
A couple of anther biting me. Yeah, they
hurt down there. They do a little bit.

243
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,823
Yeah.

244
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:49,010
Get Out of there 10:45 AM I
know that there's a bird out

245
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:53,420
[inaudible] I can still hear
that burden lay back there.

246
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,640
So we ended up staying out there
for seven and a half hours.

247
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,810
Just marked one, right?
Yup. Only mark one.

248
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,570
And I don't mean to sound
like I'm making fun of Dave.

249
00:16:03,571 --> 00:16:05,340
I mean he's doing his job well,

250
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,730
but at some point in between the fire
ants and taking four hours to confirm this

251
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,590
one bird, he's going to be right off.

252
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:16,560
I just started thinking
about all the effort.

253
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:20,550
It takes Rosa trees over from us and I
can't see them. I just suddenly thought

254
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,210
it's this Fussy, fragile little bird
and it hasn't evolved. Who Cares?

255
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:31,010
Yeah. I mean this is not worth it.

256
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:33,660
And so I started asking
people who protect the bird,

257
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:37,290
why do that with so much
money? And it's all for a bird.

258
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,120
And I could see it maybe
if it was for some,

259
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,110
but it's just one warbler of 18 million
different kinds of warblers. Like,

260
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,420
why do it? Well, we do it
cause we should, you know,

261
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:51,750
we're stewards of the land. That's
Chris Mensing again. Cowbird killer.

262
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,550
It's for future generations and well,
here's the firestarter Dick Lord.

263
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,610
You know the Kirtland's warbler was listed
under the endangered species act and

264
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:08,391
we had a charge under the law to do
what we could to recover its existence.

265
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,490
And that's the only thing that
I can say that all we had to do,

266
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,170
what the law required us to do.

267
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,270
So we should do it and the
law tells us we have to do it.

268
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,680
Unconvincing and that question is a little
wife of a farm on worth the life of a

269
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,970
bird and that guy at at the diner,

270
00:17:29,971 --> 00:17:34,971
it just stuck in my mind and I realized
I couldn't leave this town until I

271
00:17:35,091 --> 00:17:38,590
talked to the people who lost the most.
I just skated and introduced yourselves.

272
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,120
Yeah, sure. Robert Sweaters,
ski age 54 Kathleen Sweater Ski,

273
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,680
Florence [inaudible] Ski, the mother,
mother and the mother. The guy died. Yeah,

274
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,650
I that's it.

275
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,850
What? Iced tea or water even. We're
all sitting around the kitchen table,

276
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,110
dogs and beer over there. Jim's
brother-in-law's there. Twos off. Kevin,

277
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:03,720
Kevin Debris and I asked them to tell
me about Jim. Quite a guy. Soft spoken.

278
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,170
Smart. Quite a character. Yeah.

279
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,680
They told me at first they were furious.

280
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,880
They should have never ever sent him
in there. Angry at the forest service.

281
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,910
Angry about this bird.
No. Very angry. Now,

282
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,920
three decades later, I say you keep that
a little bird calling. Exactly. Really?

283
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,630
Jim's younger brother Robert said that
the thing he wanted the most is for the

284
00:18:28,631 --> 00:18:33,040
Kirtland's warbler to become the state
bird by that. That would be the ultimate,

285
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,340
Huh?

286
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,260
That would be the biggest accomplishment
ever would be that be in a state bird.

287
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,110
Wow. I guess I'm, I'm,

288
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,580
I guess in some ways I'm surprised
like I didn't mean to come here with

289
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,271
expectations,

290
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:49,290
but in some ways I thought if it was
my family that I would hate that bird.

291
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,260
I would just hate that
bird. No, it's not the bird.

292
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,220
I mean that bird didn't do anything
to any of us. Right. You know,

293
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,870
if we can keep it going, I mean
that's what he set out to do.

294
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,020
Let's keep it going. They
think about Jim's death.

295
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,400
Any of the military guys
like the death of a soldier,

296
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,200
where would you be setting right now?

297
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,070
We would have lost all those soldiers
in world war a war, World War II.

298
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,850
He died protecting, you
know, it's only one species.

299
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,150
Well then this could be another species
and another species in another species.

300
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:22,540
Next thing you know, you walk out
in the morning and it'll be quiet.

301
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,520
Thank God for the Teddy Roosevelt and
the boys that made our national parks.

302
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,320
Imagine what if we didn't have those? It
costs money. It's painful, blah, blah,

303
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:41,520
blah. You gotta have the guts to do that.

304
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,600
And Jim was really that kind of
guy. Now that is convincing. Yeah,

305
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,000
but I mean, do you agree
for us? And I asked the mom,

306
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,410
what can I say? The
bird could come in back,

307
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,730
but the life was gone.

308
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,800
So why bring it up again? It's done. It's,

309
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,610
you can't bring it back. So
you have to live by that.

310
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:08,140
But there's always a hole in your heart,

311
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,350
something that none of us
will ever forget forever.

312
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't ask me any more questions, please.

313
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,153
Okay.

314
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,080
And then, Oh, good.
Oh, the power went out.

315
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,800
Give me a break. Oh. Oh,

316
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:41,330
cool. We go home and get the generator.

317
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,583
Where do you go

318
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:54,000
Lulu? Miller.
