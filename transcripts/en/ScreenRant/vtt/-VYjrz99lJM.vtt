00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.401
With so many actors trying to make it big,
the chance of becoming a known name with a

00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:13.280
generous filmography, are slight.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.160
Even after obtaining such fame, not all actors
are able to maintain an exceptional career.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.950
A single film can ruin it all.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.830
Here are 10 famous actors whose careers were
ruined by one movie.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.570
Mike Myers, The Love Guru
Mike Myers first cracked up audience on Saturday

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.160
Night Live, a show with a reputation of churning
out some of the most hilarious comedians from

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.230
the last four decades.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.340
He was able to adapt his SNL character Wayne
Campbell for the feature film, Wayne’s World,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.080
cementing himself as a film star.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.860
After Wayne’s World and its sequel, the
talented Canadian made Austin Powers: International

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.790
Man of Mystery, a sleeper hit that built a
massive audience once it was released on video.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.660
Two sequels followed with varying success
and Myers branched out to more family friendly

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.660
fair with Shrek.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.110
The funnyman’s good luck streak came to
a screeching halt with The Love Guru.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.320
The disastrous so-called comedy was worse
than just being offensive, it also wasn’t

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320
funny.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.150
Watching Myers desperately recycle old jokes
and voices made audiences a bit queasy.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.869
After a decade of being at the top of his
game, The Love Guru was a loser that he has

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.020
yet to come back from.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.189
Brenda Fraser, Monkey Bone
Where did it all go wrong with Brendan Fraser?

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.229
He was young, handsome, and talented.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.280
With memorable turns in comedies like Airheads
and Encino Man to dramas like School Ties

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.280
and With Honors.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.670
He even got into the action adventure game
with The Mummy franchise.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.210
While 1997’s George of the Jungle was a
slight embarrassment, it only opened up the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.999
possibility for family friendly films like
Dudley Do-right.

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:31.469
Though it seemed his varied genres were a
benefit to him, it was the one-two punch of

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:36.060
2000s Bedazzled and 2001’s Monkey Bone that
ruined his fantastic trajectory.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.009
Both films exposed Fraser’s goofy side far
more than necessary and the films themselves

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.329
were just not good enough.

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.960
Fraser continues to work regularly but has
not since made a film that compares to his

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.670
past winners.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.740
Kevin Costner, Waterworld
There was a time when Kevin Costner held an

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.600
impressively high spot on the A-List.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.310
With films like Field of Dreams and Bull Durham,
he was the likeable guy with the endearing

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.100
smile that made women swoon.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.679
In the early 90s, it seemed his hot career
was scorching with The Bodyguard.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.140
His directorial effort for 1991’s Dances
with Wolves earned him countless accolades.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.759
1995’s WaterWorld was the only thing that
could trip up Costner in his winning streak.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.640
The big budget film was costly and embarrassing
for the studio.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.360
In the two decades that followed, Costner
has made few decent flicks.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.280
Instead he is relegated to underwhelming films
that he manages to make a bit shinier than

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.740
they deserve.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.690
John Travolta Battlefield Earth
John Travolta has not always had a smooth

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.690
acting career.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.580
After the classic musical Grease, and playing
the slick moved Tony Manero in Saturday Night

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.860
Fever, Travolta became a household name.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.120
The 1980s were a quiet time but the beginning
of the 90s provided a decent role as Kirsty

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.350
Alley’s paramour in the Look Who’s Talking
films.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.630
However, it was Quentin Tarantino’s 1994
film Pulp Fiction that sparked an official

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:43.630
comeback.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.390
His role as a loquacious hit man reminded
audiences of his charming presence.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.900
He quickly began releasing film after film
of solid work in the 1990s playing a lunatic

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.980
in Broken Arrow to an angel in Michael.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.280
The scientology based film Battlefield Earth
caused Travolta’s career to veer off the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.280
rails.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.990
The film about an alien planet just ended
up alienating film fans.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.280
While Travolta still works occasionally, his
name and films have been tarnished by the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.730
big budget disaster.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.970
Halle Berry, CatWoman
Halle Berry was a popular working actor in

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.790
the 1990s not because of her stellar acting
ability but because of her stunning appearance

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.040
and ease on camera.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.750
It seemed her name was more recognizable than
many of the movies she was in.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.790
Either way, she still delivered solid performances
in even the most average films.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.010
There was no question about her skills after
2001’s Monsters Ball.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.390
Her critically lauded performance earned her
an Academy Award and industry cred.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.730
Then came Catwoman.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.930
Today, comic based films carry high expectations
for quality but in the 2004, along with Daredevil,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.180
filmmakers dropped the ball with beloved characters.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.230
The ridiculous film caused many to believe
that Berry’s trophy winning prior work was

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.020
just a fluke.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.482
Jake Lloyd, The Phantom Menace
Jake Lloyd’s name may be familiar to Star

00:03:47.482 --> 00:03:51.520
Wars fans but to everyone else, he was never
able to build a solid enough career to become

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.880
a big name in Hollywood.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.220
After scoring one of the most sought after
roles, Anakin Skywalker, it would seem that

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.720
the child actor was just beginning a promising
career.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.131
Rather than exploding on the scene with a
big budget box office hit, Lloyd’s performance

00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:05.850
was highly scrutinized giving him little opportunity
to prove himself in other films.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.810
For Jake Lloyd, it was a case of too much
too soon as The Phantom Menace ended a career

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.430
right at its beginning.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.590
Cuba Gooding Jr, Boat Trip
John Singleton’s 1991 drama Boyz N the Hood

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.320
introduced audiences to the perils of living
in the gang infested South Central.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.130
It also introduced Cuba Gooding Jr.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.810
He hit even bigger success a few years later
in 1996’s Jerry Maguire, a film that lent

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.979
him the unforgettable line “Show me the
money”.

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.629
His role as football player Rod Tidwell highlighted
Gooding Jr.’s unending likability and talent.

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:36.340
After winning an Academy Award for best supporting
actor, his choices expanded exponentially.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.729
With a few decent films like Medal of Honor
and Radio, he made a major misstep with Boat

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:41.729
Trip.

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.419
The regressive film about a guy who goes on
a gay cruise was not just a terrible film,

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.069
it was a sad moment in Gooding Jr’s career
that had grown sketchy leading up to it.

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.280
The movie ultimately left a lasting bad taste
in audience’s mouths.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.979
C Thomas Howell, Soul Man
There are some actors whose careers warm up

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.700
in the eighties and only get hotter.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.099
Then there are actors who disappear into obscurity.

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.930
C. Thomas Howell was one of the unlucky 80s
stars who made such a poor film choice that

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.629
he was given little room to grow.

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:09.229
After playing Pony Boy in the film adaptation
of The Outsiders, he went on to star in the

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.189
killer ensemble film Red Dawn.

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:15.550
It was 1986’s Soul Man that not only ruined
his potentially long lasting career, it left

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.370
audiences wondering how the film was green
lit in the first place.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.710
The premise of the film involves a white student
sporting black face to earn a scholarship

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.300
for African American students.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.340
It is hard to clearly state whether Soul Man
was the sole reason for C. Thomas Howell’s

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.030
ruined career but it certainly didn’t help.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.060
Alicia Silverstone, Excess Baggage
After appearing in three music videos for

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.080
Aerosmith, it was hard not to fall in love
with Alicia Silverstone.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.969
The bubbly blonde teen was beautiful yet had
devilish eyes that aided her villainous role

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:42.969
in The Crush.

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:47.930
Her performance as the filthy rich but incredibly
sweet Cher Horowitz in 1995’s Clueless catapulted

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.860
her to instant mainstream star.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.410
After the overwhelming success of Clueless,
all eyes were on Silverstone’s next career

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.410
move.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.819
After a short hiatus, Silverstone returned
with two films in 1997, Batman and Robin and

00:05:58.819 --> 00:05:59.880
Excess Baggage.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.800
While the superhero flick was ridiculed plenty,
it was Excess Baggage that took the largest

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.819
jab at her career.

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.159
The mediocre film was made worse with Silverstone’s
constant high pitched whine, something she

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:10.270
avoided in the past.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.210
Though she was able to obtain a lead role
in the underrated 1999 comedy Blast from the

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.180
Past, she has been unable to recapture her
same level of fame.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.460
Demi Moore, Striptease
Ever since 1985’s St. Elmo’s Fire, Demi

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.810
Moore was a notable star.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.419
Her full wattage power only grew brighter
in the following decade with roles in A Few

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.770
Good Men, Disclosure and the two-Hanky tearjerker,
Ghost.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:34.629
With her raspy voice, silky black hair, and
enviable acting skills, Demi Moore became

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:36.879
a bankable star who could do no wrong.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.150
Unfortunately, the film Striptease proved
she actually could do wrong.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.999
Her role as a single mother who takes a job
as a stripper seemed beneath such a famous

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:46.409
and serious actress but she was committed.

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:50.250
Possibly hoping that undressing may lead to
Oscar gold, Moore even went under the knife

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.340
for breast enhancements prior to filming.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.479
Ever since Striptease, Moore has not been
able to regain the momentum of her prior success.

00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:58.840
What do you think of our list?

00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.979
