00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.250
Whenever a website
shows user's input,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.070
you need to be
careful and vigilant.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.230
A user's input can be anything
and it is your responsibility

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.550
to make sure it won't
break your site.

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.790
A clueless user might
break it by accident,

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.769
an evil techer might
exploit this flaw

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.429
and make your website do things
that it did not intend at all.

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.370
Not validating user input is one
of the oldest vulnerabilities

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.250
on the web and is called
cross-site scripting or XSS

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.417
for short.

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:26.250
The name comes from the
fact that JavaScript

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.100
can be injected into
another site where

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.962
it gets executed and has access
to all of its site's data.

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:35.710
A typical example is a website
that asks for a user's name

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.630
when they want to
leave a comment.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.510
If this input is not
validated, a user's name

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:42.670
can be crafted in
such a way that it

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.870
contains JavaScript code.

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:47.049
That means that every
user reading that comment

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.809
will only see the
name, but the code

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.960
will be executed without
the user's knowledge.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.910
In the grand scheme of
things, this example

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.529
here is rather harmless.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.090
But the script has access
to all of the site's data,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.830
including the dom and cookies.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.439
It could even make
fetch requests

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.049
from the site's origin.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.239
A well-crafted XSS exploit
can be detrimental.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.159
The only way you
can secure yourself

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.899
against these
kinds of attacks is

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.240
to follow a golden rule
that always applies

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.269
in software engineering,
validate your user's input

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:18.009
