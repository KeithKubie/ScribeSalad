Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast from my one day Monday, May 29th, 2017 what's going on out? You [inaudible] how are you guys doing? Happy Memorial Day. Happy Memorial Day when you're supposed to be out there. Remember the troops you're going to be getting [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:00:26       the hammer [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:29       say bad shit to your wife that you laid up to apologize for what's going on. You fucking soon to be fat fucks. Huh? You got the, you got the grill going?

Speaker 1:          00:00:40       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:41       hey Matt, about up right? We got a little killed. Bosh. What are you guys making today? Huh? What fucking animal had to get the old right there, Fred? You know in an upper cut to another one. You fucking sewed them together. What God's name do you have on your grill right now that you know you fucking, what'd you put in there? A bunch of cheese. Who wants cheese on their burger on and he sees a good fucking burn, right? Um, oh. You know it's the best. So you put the buns on. That's, that's the, you know, you keep checking and keep checking me. Looking at the meat. Don't want to burn the bunt. Uh, Christ they burn this one with burns. Ah, I bet she swallows up. Sorry. Sorry. Why Bill? Why, why did you have to take the Nice family day that this is, you know, that the great men of this country fought. So you could go out there, you know, work slowly, work your way, take another step towards a fucking massive coronary. How many people are going to face plant into their grill today via too much alcohol?

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Well, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:01:57       just eating that last thing that fucking makes the ticker stop or you know, the classic old fucking middle-aged man, uh, injury, the fucking blown out Achilles, you know. Oh, did you say you want to pickles and you just turn a little too fast and pallet shit goes right up the back of your leg. Then you face plant right to your fucking grill. Full side of the face. Right. You'd be surprised. I bet if I could somehow get some sort of live, you know, folders in here. I bet my phone lines would be lighting up right now with paramedics, fire department people, people that drive ambulances. Hey is the driver the ambulance, do you actually have to know how to help people or you just like the guy, the getaway driver, you know, all you need to do is know how to turn on the siren, you know, be able to block it out. Do you think ambulance drivers hear that Siren at night as they lay there quiet bedroom, you know, probably to put fucking music on cause they don't, they just laying there and all ears.

Speaker 3:          00:02:58       Woo.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       Slowly going insane. Um, I dunno, I'm in a great fucking mood. You know, my lovely little lay is starting to sleep through the night. I'm starting to get some sleep again. Dude, she's hilarious. She just does this thing now she's trying out a voice. You just guys got

Speaker 3:          00:03:23       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:03:24       loudest shit laying in the bed in the morning between me and the [inaudible]. It's like fucking a little mini Jerry Lewis the entire time. It's so I just put my hand over her mouth and I just, I just make it go like a little out loud I think. And then she kind of like looks around like, what the fuck was that? And that stops her for about four seconds before she starts again. And then she gets used to the noise and then that's it. Um, she starting to crawl. She's fucking moving backwards. It's funny, like they, I guess they moved backwards first. So it's like the thing that they want, it just keeps getting further and further away like that. A Alfred Hitchcock shot. Um, but, uh, anyways, I had family for Banky. She out here this weekend, which means plenty of booze, plenty of fucking crazy foods. So I've been doing the elliptical every day doing what I can.

Speaker 2:          00:04:19       But uh, you know, this is like, at this point, everybody's going to come out here, has come out here. They've all seen her. They all love her. And what's awesome is now I don't have to, uh, I realize now when people visit me, they're not coming to see me, which is fucking awesome. That coming to see her. Oh, hey bill, how are you doing? Where is she? Where is she? She over. We all would you look at her, look at her. It's great. And you just peel off in the back, you know, all your family members come over and then they all get to hold her and stuff, you know? So then you get to sit there. Boozing in the corner.

Speaker 4:          00:04:55       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:04:56       the holidays now. It's been great. She's awesome. Um, she's so awesome. I'm not getting any fucking material out of it. Everyone was telling me, Oh my God, you haven't a kid. I can't wait for you to become a dad. Oh my God. I want to see how your rack changes. It hasn't. I'm still paranoid. I'm still filthy and I'm, my daughter's awesome. So you know, that's not funny. Hey Bro, it's like being a dad. It's Gregg phenomenal. I think most of my materials, just about other fucking lunatic parents. I'm telling you what I'm going to start saying to people when they go, oh, she's, Oh yeah, that's a great age. I'll wait. Wait til three days from now, then all well, you've gone, she's going talk. She'll fucking start stabbing you in the night. I'm, you want me to start saying those parents? I'm just going to be like, you know, you sound like a horrible father and I think you married the wrong person. Have a nice day. Oh, you could look at this experience in a negative way is fucking. Look, if you're broke,

Speaker 5:          00:06:04       if you're a kid, if you're a fucking high school student, right? And you know, you started bagging your God Damn English teacher [inaudible] you didn't know enough to pull out as much as they told you in sex education, how much you know how a baby's made. You couldn't fucking believe you are banging your English teacher and the next thing you know you're going to be a fun yet then. Then it's brutal. You know, you're married to this fucking old broad, it's always correcting your fucking sentences.

Speaker 2:          00:06:32       You know, you're calling around for dressing like a horror and she's fucking giving you shit for a, for a dangling participle, whatever the fuck. I never knew what that meant. The past part of supple bill was a past participle. This sentence, I don't know, just send me to summer school, just gimme gimme in that fucking distilled version of this class. That is nothing. That Dream Team of class clowns that is summer school, drug addicts and musicians. It was just fucking tremendous summer school. Underrated. I tell you, I went, I did it twice. I should've done it all four years of high school, but a, I blew off the last year cause what was the fucking point? My Sophomore Year my teacher hooked me up, gave me the d minus, um, d minus in geometry. Um, I fucking had a great time. I had a great time. I had to take one class. You don't get me out of bed in the morning. In summer school was combined like three towns where I lived and it was, uh, it was all the class clowns. Just like I said, creative people, everybody had add in the level of shit that they gave to the teacher. I was like, wow, I got to up my game. These people are on a whole nother level. It's like when you go to jail, you become like a better criminal. I became a better class clown just sitting there like, wow, these guys are fucking,

Speaker 5:          00:07:57       these guys have no intention of going to college. I'm at least still lying to myself. Yeah, I think I could, you know, I think I could go in the later rounds

Speaker 2:          00:08:07       if you were a fucking draft pick, be honest with yourself. You're a high school student, what round are you going in? You know, and if you really think about it, that's why Bill Belichick, he doesn't like the first round draft picks because the first round draft picks, they like booksmart. Right. They're the fucking nerds. You know, you give them some information, they'll memorize it and they'll spit it right back at Ya. Right. There's no passion. They, they, they, they don't walk into a room and light it up. This is a bad analogy cause first round draft picks do I guess, do they, I don't know about college basketball now with everybody one and done. You'd bring this fucking kid to a locker room full of men. You can put the team on his back, bony fucking legs. Um, we'll bill, are they supposed to do a lot of them? You know, it's like their, their mothers, uh, you know, they, they need a new kidney and, and uh, the, the shack they live in is falling up. Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. Yeah. But selfishly is a fan. You know, you miss the days when somebody had four years with fucking coach k or Dean Smith, rest his soul, Bobby Knight, flipping them in the chin. Stop looking down on the ground and fucking man,

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       that'd be, I've told them, but we've got to be tell you much. I fucking loved that Bobby Knight speech where he says, you know, I'm not going to, you're not gonna. I'm not gonna walk around with a 14 to 20.

Speaker 6:          00:09:33       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:09:35       I don't know what it is about. That guy listened to that speech and it makes me want to go fucking, I don't know. I'll go to the gym. I have to listen to that guy. Something happened, you know, when that guy got ran out of town, that was, that was it, you know. Then all of a sudden like,

Speaker 1:          00:09:51       okay

Speaker 2:          00:09:52       guys steered into just literally being pussies, like fucking wearing shirts with cats on them and stuff. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:59       You know,

Speaker 2:          00:10:01       my wife was showing me that like there's a men's onesy that's out there now. The guys aware and I was like, you gotta be fucking Kitty. Like what is it going to stop? When is it going to steer back to testosterone? When is the guy's guy going to make a comeback? I mean, everything makes a comeback, right? Classic Rock Disco Hair, metals. Make it a little bit of a comeback. I don't fucking, I, you know, I just don't get it. So then somebody show me what they've like pulled Sean Connery wall one in one of the James Bond movies and it's like, all right, but he wasn't wearing it like he thought it looked good. He wasn't wearing it cause it was fucking stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:10:43       You know, that's what I can't fucking stand. Everything's like mocking something else. It's like, all right, so what do you believe in? What are you going to fucking sign your name to? And these fucking millennial cons. The deal. I can't say all of them. That's not fair to whole generation, but so the ones that at least they're taking pictures of. Okay. Which granted most of these pictures of being taken care of, taken by older people from my generation who are jealous of younger people. That's what a lot of it is. I bet. I Bet I'm overreacting when I really think about it. I don't really see a lot of people with cats on their shirts. Although when they do, people take pictures of them, then they post them on social media and then old fucks like me start going, oh, look at these fucking millennials. Barely fucking, um, all right, so scratch all of that. I mean really built up. Have you seen anybody with the onesy? Somebody just showed you a picture and then you, you literally started freaking out. Like you watch CNN or Fox News for two hours. It's always a great thing to do. Watch those for a couple, two, three hours and they get y'all panicked. What you want to do is you want to switch between the two of them, right? And then you out the lies and you keep yourself levelheaded, you know, fake news. Tell fake news.

Speaker 1:          00:12:00       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       so anyways, I don't want to be like that. I want to be that guy. Okay. God bless you millennials. I'm sure this, there's plenty of guys guys on the way. You're out there fucking crushing ass and God bless you. Enjoy your youth joy, you fucking youth before it's memorial day and suddenly you're that guy with the dad bod standing in front of the grill, filling that tightness in your Achilles. You know, you got to reach for that last burger on the back of the fucking Griffith. You just start feeling that tightness in your ankle and you're like, God, if it's going to happen, please don't let it happen. Now, not in front of my family. Becky sched. Um, nobody is guests the movie by the way, that I am referring to. We had problems with the family baggy east a this, I was going to say, I'd give you a hint, but this isn't really a hint in my opinion, that movie, it's a car movie for me. I just feel like that movies, a car movie. Other people thought there was some philosophical question.

Speaker 1:          00:13:05       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:06       You know who's the fly? Who's the windshield? All I remember from that movie was I loved the car cause I love the fucking sleep.

Speaker 1:          00:13:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:13:20       I remember the car that was a sleeper and then I just remembered that there was this one guy was Evan Bravo, lived with the family Baggie East. And that explained his entire fucking backstory. That's now if you guys can't guess it now. I don't know what the fuck. I don't know. I don't know what to tell you. All right. They had a fucking pizza. Wow. Yeah. Can I get a, can I get a sausage in a rubella? Eh, we got no Rugola no, you don't have any Rugola. Yeah, we had family. We out with the family. Becky still will give us a rubella. Um, anyway, so what'd you guys do this weekend? Other ones sit around. You know what I did? I watched, um, somebody tweeted me on the old Twitter and told me, you're watching the time trials for Monaco and here's the thing. I, you know, I'm new to F1. She guys know I can barely remember the fucking names.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:14:21       so I'm like, I'm going to, I didn't, I had no idea like how they qualify for a race. I just thought you'd, you know, you get like five laps around the track. Whoever has the best time gets the pole position and then they just work their way back. But that, that, that is not how it works. It's like a whole other day of racing. Cause I always wonder why, why the fuck did people show up to watch these, these qualifying?

Speaker 1:          00:14:46       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14:47       I mean, just watch some guy by himself out to he, yeah. Eh, he's gotta be at Eighth Place Tomorrow. Um, that's not how it works. It is the race before the race and it's like this three race. So there's three levels of the qualifying. This is like, first of all, there's practice laps to get you used to the track and if you don't do the practice laps, you're not allowed to race. So obviously there's probably some safety thing. Like, dude, you're not just gonna fucking go out there and start driving 200 miles an hour. It's this next one, a right or a left turn share. Um, qualifying. Okay. So there's this like three rounds of it. So qualifying the first round one, it's like match madness, but with, cause, um, it lasts for 18 minutes. Everybody gets on the fucking track. I'm sure they, I don't know, they let six out and another six. I don't know how the fuck they do it. I missed that part of it. Okay. But it lasts for 18 minutes at the end of which time can you tell I'm reading this, the six slowest drivers are eliminated from qualifying and 16 advance to QT, the qualifying two. So those six are going to be, and I thought, oh my God, are they out of the fucking race? Is this like golf or you miss the cut? And I found out later. No, they just start way in the back. Okay. So,

Speaker 1:          00:16:12       um,

Speaker 2:          00:16:13       so there's 22 fucking drivers. I guess. So. Let's see. So six of them are fucking eliminated. They're not, they're usually 20 drivers to, to not kept to go home. I have no idea if anybody knows the information to that. I don't know if anybody, if you don't move to the next round of qualifying, if anybody actually doesn't get to race. Um, cause I thought there was 20 cars in the race and according to this mass there's 22 but whatever. So six are eliminated in the first one, then the next 16, you know, after a short break the times are reset and the 16 remaining cars run in a 15 minute session. It's an hour down to 15. Uh, and at the end of which the slowest six cars are eliminated from qualifying, leaving 10 to progress to qualifying three. Now the top 10 spots after the race, those, that's when you're in the points from first all the way to 10th. It's like something like 25 points for first 18 for second, then it's like 15, then 12, 10, eight, six, four, two one are the points. Huh? You're in the, you're in the fucking lightning round at that point.

Speaker 1:          00:17:21       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:17:24       and then the, and whoever, yeah. Obviously it has the best run after that gets the, uh, qualifying three after a further break, times a reset and the final 12 minutes session is held the decide pole position in the standing order of the top 10 grid places. That's when you're in the points. All right? That's when you're going home with least with a fucking year supply or Rice-a-roni if you're in the top 10. So I watched can somebody on Twitter is like, dude, you gotta watch this. This might be better than the race. So, uh, Lewis Hamilton from the ILM man, it's an island with men, nothing but men all walking around like right way or the fucking A's, the birds, whatever the fuck they call them over there. Slags um, anyways, he's out there, he's got Mercedes, he's got one of the fastest fucking cars out there, but for whatever fucking reason, he's not getting enough downward force or something on the front of his car.

Speaker 2:          00:18:25       And the front end is sliding all over everywhere. So he barely gets out of qualifying one. He gets into qualifying too and it's, there's a 15 minutes session and he's outside of to qualifying to get to the next level. His time is too slow, so he's got time to do one more run. Okay. Now he's in second place overall for the, um, for the uh, to become champ. Just stay in to stay on pace to be whatever the, the fucking best drive of the year. I'm sorry guys, I'm new to this fucking thing. Um, and his fucking front end starts sliding all over the place and then some con hits the wall so then the yellow flag comes out and I guess that doesn't matter if some asshole drives into the fucking wall, you're qualifying time is done. This fucking idiot. Right?

Speaker 4:          00:19:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       He's a professional driver. He hits the wall. How did he hit the wall? I get it. You caught enough. They said they actually put some special steering, they made custom steering just for that fucking track and Monaco cause it just driving through the streets and they have such a hairpin turn that they actually have to turn the wheel harder than they do any other race. You know, why would they just leave that in?

Speaker 2:          00:19:38       Did you want to have that option? Okay. She had a drive a little all the way around something at some point. And the other races, evidently not. Um, so anyways, long story short, this fucking guy I think from force India with the few Checar just basically, you know, he pulls the Greg Bay Brady, you know gotta beat Marsha getting a cold closer then a quarter of an inch. He fucking slams right into the wall and then that's it. And Louis Hamilton was so fucking dejected, he couldn't even get out of his car, you know. And a long story short, the fucking Ferrari's. What a fuck does my God damn computer keep doing this to me.

Speaker 4:          00:20:16       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:20:17       You want to get the screen to come up? Can you stay up? Do I got to sit there finger in the fucking thing the whole time? Um, yeah. So long story short, the Ferrari's one, the first and second position and I think, uh, that Butaro sky, the finish dude started in third and Lewis Hamilton was all the way back in 14th. So he's out of the points and a, you're driving through the fucking streets of Monaco, a sovereign state. In other words, they're in France, but they're not part of France. Like, yeah, fuck off. We're doing our own thing here. And I guess it's really hard to pass there. But despite that, the fucking race starts and immediately he went from 14th to 12th and I'm watching the race and I'm like, this motherfucker, he's probably going to finish fourth.

Speaker 5:          00:21:07       He's somehow gonna figure somebody is gonna fuck up in their pit stop. Something's going to happen. So I'm whining the whole time I'm watching the race and I'm watching and he's 12th and he's 11th, then he's 10th and the fucking announces of blowing it off because they're too busy looking at the, what the Ferrari's are going to do, what the red bold team's doing, what the fuck a Bhutanese is going to be doing in the Mercedes. It meanwhile, is Lewis Hamilton just moving it? This is the longest I've ever talked about race and I, they've got a film people like, dude, I don't give a fuck. Yo get driving around in a circle.

Speaker 2:          00:21:38       Um, no they're not. Then I try run those left and right turns. All right. Does a chicane

Speaker 5:          00:21:48       dude, you at least gotta Watch Monaco. You should've watched Monica with the fucking Illuminati. People fucking back their yachts up. Although I went online and I find like you can actually, there's a lot of them are just like packages.

Speaker 2:          00:21:58       Like those aren't just rich people with their yachts backed up. It's just a lot of like booze cruises and you can sit there on a fucking yacht getting hammered, acting like you didn't just light up your fucking credit card.

Speaker 5:          00:22:10       Whenever Stacy will deal with it. When we get back, we get baggy aged.

Speaker 2:          00:22:15       So long story shorts, uh, on a track that you could not fucking pass on somehow. Lewis past seven fucking people finish seventh. So let's see, that's a one, two, he got like six points or something like that. And a, the Ferrari's came in first and second. All right. Uh, Sebastian Vettel ended up winning after a great fucking pit stop. And what's his face? A Kimmy riken in his, at his fucking name raking in or whatever. Finish dude. Sebastian's the Kraut, the German dude, he fucking comes out of the pit before him. Then he hit Kimmy

Speaker 5:          00:22:49       going like, God, what the fuck? He sounded like Mick with somebody cut me off for traffic. But he's driving like 170 miles an hour. Uh, and what's his face? Daniel? Always a bridesmaid. Never a fucking winner. Ricardo came in fucking third. The guy's always on the podium. Never comes in first.

Speaker 2:          00:23:08       He's gotta be pissed. Like guys, what the fuck can you

Speaker 5:          00:23:12       do some, do the car here so I can get past these Ferrari's and Mercedes and man, what a whoa. And I gotta do here.

Speaker 2:          00:23:18       Um, so long story short, Ferrari as a team, as 196 points, Mercedes has 179 and the Americans, the Yanks, just to let you know, we're pulling up the rear, we've got our first points of the season. Uh, what do we got? We got Romaine like the lettuce, Grosse Gene, he got nine points and then Kevin Magnuson, like the condoms got five. So we got 14 points. So I'll just for those Ferrari's and Mercedes, better mind that fucking p's q's. Cause the yanks are

Speaker 5:          00:23:46       coming. All right. Thank you for fucking sitting through all of that shit. Um, let's talk about tiger woods. Jesus fucking Christ. Can you believe he got arrested for drinking and driving? It only happens to nine zillion people every fucking day. I'm so sick of people talking about tiger woods, like the way they disrespect this guy. You know, I love Stephen A. Smith, but I started watching him talking and he was saying that, you know, that, you know, this guy is just his fall from basically his fall from grace and um, and how his whole, you know, he became a billionaire and his whole fucking thing was based on the fact that he presented himself as a family man. And I'm thinking like, what the fuck did that guy, when the fuck did he ever present himself as a family man, I didn't get to where the fuck he was because he was the best golfer anybody had ever seen because he was making like PGA fucking links look like, like he was playing miniature golf. I know. Pay attention to that fucking blondie was why I don't even know her fucking name.

Speaker 4:          00:24:58       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:25:00       And then [inaudible] he begs a bunch of Hooters whores and then I'm spot. Then I'm supposed to sit on the couch going, you lie to me, tiger. I thought after your golf, you fucking went down to Applebee's with your family and fucking your family baggies and you shared a fucking bloomin' onion. I have to be honest with you, I never once thought about what the fuck that guy did when he got off the golf course and when I found out what he was doing off the golf course. I was like, yeah, I mean, that kind of makes sense.

Speaker 4:          00:25:36       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:25:36       I am just going to say the steam out of fucking men. Okay. When Steven A. Smith walks out of his studio, you know, he doesn't have a line of whores just waiting to fucking blow them, just so they could say, I blew Steven A. Smith. Tiger Woods had to deal with that. And like most men, he folded under the pressure and the fucking reason why he's not doing well right now, it's not because of his fucking wife. Who by the way took a bunch of his money, bought a house, fucking knocked it down and then rebuilt another one. Huh? What about her?

Speaker 7:          00:26:17       I thought she wasn't environmentalist. She liked to be

Speaker 5:          00:26:22       right. What about her? What about all blondie? Right there? I still a bit about this. Do you think she would even give tiger woods a second fucking glance if he wasn't making all that money? If he wasn't the greatest at what he did. What? All blonde, blue eyed. Even give that guy a fucking second. I don't think she would've. All right.

Speaker 2:          00:26:45       Even when you're a bum like me, when you fucking walked into the singles bar back in the 90s what did women or we say, what do you do? They're not making small talk. Okay. Women all fucking judge. Okay. Their status and then they get a number in their head. All right. And then they find out the jobs, okay, debt, earn this and earn that. And then they figured like who they can fuck. Okay. And then it becomes a thing of like, okay, you're underneath what I want for the lifestyle that I'm looking for in the future. But you're a good looking enough guy that I'll fucking bang it tonight. Maybe I'll have a little fling with you, but that's getting the end of the fucking day. You know when you slid that piece of paper across the table and you made your off for say, my Dick and balls bring home this each year, they're like, yeah, keep it moving. Keep it moving. That's, that's 10 grand less than I want. And you got that one snaggletooth fuck off. Move on. Who's next? Go ahead. Put your junk on the table. What's your number? Okay. And he has it. And here's the thing, I don't fault women for that.

Speaker 4:          00:28:01       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:28:03       Who would still live like a bumped if you're good and if you're good looking enough. Okay. And you can land somebody that's making a ton of fucking money, you can learn to love that. Right? I Dunno.

Speaker 5:          00:28:17       So anyway, so now he gets busted for drinking and driving in that this is the bottom line. This fucking guys fall from grace. Okay. All right. I'll give you the first fucking couple of years after his divorce, like maybe that got in his fucking head, but at the end of that, I mean either you got divorced 10 fucking years ago. What happened was was his marriage and his body broke down at the same fucking time, but guy just had major back surgeries. Knees are fucked up. And they always said, they said back when everybody thought he was a family band back east, that um, the way that the level of Torque and the pressure that he's putting on his back, they predicted his body was going to break down and it did. And then when it does, you know, now they're going to blame, you know,

Speaker 2:          00:29:03       it's okay.

Speaker 5:          00:29:03       Classic Lady's just taking credit. That's all it is. They always take it behind. Yabby Greg man is a good woman, you know, they, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:29:09       All right. Is it, I don't know, I mean, what's your definition of great? I mean,

Speaker 5:          00:29:20       but every great man is a great woman. It's like the guy was already a fucking champion when he met you.

Speaker 4:          00:29:24       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:29:25       So He's, if you're talking about his mother, I'll, I'll give you that. But this whole fucking thing. Well now, I mean, Jesus, I got to tell you his mugshot. Oh, that's a classic one. I'd like to have a couple of pops with tiger.

He's looking into the camera going, well, I know a billion people are going to see this. What the fuck are they going to say about this one? Um, I don't, I can't even to begin to tell you guys. I, I can't, I can't, I don't even, I can't even begin to tell you guys how bad I want to see this guy win a major again. Uh, look at this editor's pick the secret history of tiger woods. Now how, how much do you think they actually talked to tiger woods?

Speaker 2:          00:30:39       So the death of his father set a battle raging inside the world's greatest golfer dish. Dish. How the fuck do you know? Why could you talk to his gardener? Is that the closest you could get to them? And now you gonna write 400 pages of bullshit. Listen, do me a favor. Don't listen to any of this stuff. Okay? He's a man. He makes mistakes. He's in the public eye. I hope his back gets better. You know what? I hope he goes out like fucking who's that guy used to fucking just sit there and the big dude, the blonde hair, and he's fucking sit there. I think he played Oliver on the Brady Bunch way back in the date. And then when he grew up, he became this drunk. He was this alcoholic fucking, he could get hit the ball of fucking Mya. God dammit. This is going to kill me. I got to look this up here.

Speaker 2:          00:32:25       You know, guys, I don't know. I don't know if you noticed the last couple of weeks I've been a little, uh, I don't know. I've been a little down, you know, and uh, I know the podcast hasn't been as good as it has been in the past and it's just cause, uh, uh, you know, a tie feel like tiger woods let me down. You know, all those times I've never met him or even remotely spoken to him. Um, you know, I just really thought we had something there and for him to turn around and go back on his word that he never gave me because I've never spoken with the matches. I was devastated. And, uh, I'm not going to be able to come into work today.

Speaker 2:          00:33:07       Oh Man. I hope that guy wins another fucking major. I can't even tell you. I can't even, I can't even fucking, I just didn't tell you, didn't I, I think I just did tell you, um, hey, last week I was talking about helicopters and, uh, you know, I know some pilots listened to this fucking thing, you know, mass bumping, all that shit. You have to deal with low g pushover with the fucking semi, uh, articulated rotor system. Does anybody know about these? Fucking these, these new European helicopters that are starting to be available over here and it has a fully articulated rotor system so you don't have to deal with any of that shit and the fuel injected. So there's no, do I need to pull carb heat? Am I going to fucking die here? Um, it's called, I don't know how to say a g U.

Speaker 2:          00:33:47       I M B a l gamble Cabri g two. And I wrote next to it once the deal, um, I talked to two of my instructors, one of them said, hey, that's pretty cool that they do that. And the other one said, well, it's kind of like, remember when the first iPhone came out cause they're brand new. Then they had to work all the bugs out. He said, uh, they learned about aircraft through people crashing. So I was like, all right, fuck those things then. Um, anyway, so you know, you don't, I was thinking, I think one of these days when I'm going to do is I'm just going to buy a used Apache, you know, or whatever the fuck they have. Those Blackhawks is some shit. I'm just going to learn how to fly that and then I'm just going to join those blackwater dudes. That's my apocalypse thing.

Are there any plans for touring Europe specifically? The Netherlands would love to see him live

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       while I was there last year. Man, if you will for a fan for many years you should have checked my website. Um, I think I'm going to go to Europe next year and I'll probably build it around. Um, a couple of F1 racist possibly. I don't know when I'm going to go over there, but I'm definitely due to do a run. I've got a bunch of new shit, but you know, I have to make sure it's at a certain level before I go over there. Cause Europe, he loves to just have critic show up at shows without, you know, the artist saying, Hey, can you review this show? You know, and they review it any way and they take out their fucking goddamn steak knives and they carve you up every fucking time. So I always make sure I'm on my game here. All right girl who stabbed boyfriend isn't walking free.

Speaker 2:          00:45:16       Okay, here we go. This is the new, this is new part of the podcast. Everybody fucking correct and old bill, you know. [inaudible] that's why I made sure to fucking like look up all my, uh, my F1 shit. You know, cause you caught damn cots, um, girl who stabbed boyfriend. I have a prediction about the red sox too, by the way, which I will get to later on, hopefully if I remember. All right, that's a teaser and I might let you down. I might disappoint you. Like Michael Jordan, like fucking tiger woods, you know, all that entertainment that they gave you when they watch, when you get to watch them doing things that had never been done before. Um, all right girl who stabbed boyfriend isn't walking free. Okay. So this story was about a, some lady at Oxford to fucking, I don't know what the hell she did.

Speaker 2:          00:46:02       She stabbed her boyfriend in the leg with a bread knife and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And that, that guy was like, well, I don't you have, you know, yeah, I have all this fucking, you know, potential and all this type of shit. So this person, um, this person is writing back saying she isn't going free. What's up? I realize you like to make the excuse that we shouldn't expect you to do any actual research on stories you talk about and that's fine. Well then you should leave it at that, sir. But in this particular story, you ranted on Thursday's pod. I didn't rant. I'm joking around you fucking overreacting. Conc do you guys understand what a rant is? Rant to me. It's short for ranting and raving. So you've got borderline have froth coming out of your fucking mouth. Joking around about a subject for five minutes is not a fucking rant. You stupid. Fuck God dammit. All right. So even like right there, to me, that's just, I just fucking fucking wigged up for a second there, but he re rant it. Okay, I'm on Thursday. You didn't even, you didn't even need to do research to see how wrong you were. Again, I'm not wrong. I'm being funny. You fuck that Oxford girl isn't getting off free because she's white. Oh my God. As the lovely Nia proposed and not because she's a woman as the biliterate

Speaker 5:          00:47:30       birth suggested. She isn't getting off at all. In fact, it said right on the article you were reading that she was going to be sentenced in September and has been giving a restraining order. Yeah, I saw that and I also read the fucking judge's quote. I looked it up and I read along with your pocket. So sentencing was only postpone. She isn't getting out of jail time yet. Yeah, but don't you find it fucked up? What are you going to address? The fact that the judge said you're so talented, I don't want to derail your fucking what you could possibly achieve. You don't think that's weird for him to say that.

Speaker 4:          00:48:05       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:48:06       and you don't think race and gender affects your sentencing. You don't think that? You don't think that any day that there's all this racism, there's all this sexism and all that, but in the court of law there isn't. There isn't status. There isn't. You're at Oxford versus you did somebody on the street and you stabbed somebody with the fucking knife. You don't think that any of that comes into play, sir. So anyways, he says, if you asked me which you didn't, I think this is a good thing. If she's is as bright as the people at the school say she is, she can definitely do a lot of good in her career and sentencing her for a one off would ruin that. So you're agreeing with this guy. Oh my God, this is fucking hilarious. You're sitting there and saying that I'm not paying this. Basically what it is is not that I was misinformed. Okay? It's that you agreed with the judge. He said, that being said, she needs to be held responsible. So what is it seeing as if it was only a butter knife? I think mandatory anger management classes is in order at the very least. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Come back to Madison. You were great last time. Go fuck yourself again, sir. She stabbed somebody with a knife.

Speaker 4:          00:49:24       Okay,

Speaker 5:          00:49:26       let me let that sink in. She stabbed someone with a fucking knife, but because she goes to Oxford and she could be a doctor. Yeah, you're out of your fucking mind. You're, you're just like the judge. You're like, oh, look at her. She's a girl. She's doing so well in school. She looks like me. It was just a bread knife. You're doing what they're doing. In a perfect world, sir, stabbing somebody with the knife and the punishment is stabbing somebody with a knife and the punishment and that's fucking it. Go Watch that fucking trap car thing or whatever the fuck they call it, where they park it down in the fucking poor neighborhood and they arrest one black eye after fuck another.

Speaker 4:          00:50:12       Yeah.

Speaker 5:          00:50:14       I mean it's, it's, they're not trying to help anybody. You don't think anybody down there has potential. You just going to say it's going to fucking do that to them. Why do they just do, why they don't, don't they do that in a fucking white neighborhood?

Speaker 4:          00:50:31       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:50:32       Oh my God. I don't know. I don't, I just don't see the world the way you do, sir. And you see it the way that judge does. And I also think that you are like what you're taking into consideration.

Speaker 4:          00:50:43       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:50:43       Which is is the fact that she's at Oxford and she could be a doctor. You're completely in your, you're now downplaying that she stabbed someone and yes you are sir. Yes you are. Because you said she should take an anger management classes at the very least.

Speaker 4:          00:51:00       Okay,

Speaker 5:          00:51:01       look, you might call me fucking overly liberal, but if you stab someone, you should go to jail regardless of what your potential is. Do you realize it's this woman, if she becomes a surgeon will have a knife in her hand every fucking day of a goddamn career just about, and it won't be a fucking butter knife. Jesus fucking Christ. And when she's goes to cut somebody open and then finds out that they have state insurance rather than private, what the fuck is she going to do then?

Speaker 4:          00:51:27       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:51:28       Just because you go to Oxford doesn't mean you couldn't be a fucking lunatic.

Speaker 2:          00:51:33       You know what I mean?

Speaker 5:          00:51:35       And people in those schools commit murders and they do commit crimes, but they don't go to jail to wait. Poor people with more of a tan do. I don't know if you've noticed that. So for us to bring up the fact that she was a woman and that she was white. I was not, we were not uninformed. We were actually Morton. I actually, you know, I'm going to pat myself on the back. I'm more fucking enlightened than you are. Okay? Because I'm not saying that because of who she is, she should get punished more. She should get the punishment. I think once you stabbed somebody, what the fuck you doing in the rest of your life is out the goddamn window.

Speaker 4:          00:52:13       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:52:13       And I know what you guys are going to say. Well, they do that. They do that all the time. They fucking take into consideration if people have children and Blah, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, I know they do. But the consideration is, is a lot smaller by the level of Tan you have and whether you have a dick hanging between your legs and not, and that's the fucking truth. Going to a bar, a woman can slap a guy in the face, dump a drink over his fucking head. She's not getting kicked out. She's not. If she's, if she's hot, she's a fucking Willdabeast. Yeah. They'll throw her out in the fucking dumpster. Come on people. This isn't, this isn't new information. All right. Stop acting like good Lord. All right. Why Airlines lost their privilege

Speaker 2:          00:52:58       now. Hey Bill, big fan.

Speaker 5:          00:53:01       Love your podcast. You recently asked why airlines are not as prestigious as it was in the 70s as a pilot. I have an answer for you. Oh, I love when the pilots, right in sky pilot. Why is, and it's still great. In 1978 huh? I'm Jim McConnell. Jimmy Carter signed the airline declar deregulation act. Ah, leave it to a peanut farmer from Georgia to ruin the fucking prestige of airline travel. Prior to this law, the government allowed equal usage of federal airways among all the airlines. All right. You already lost me. Let me read this slower. The government allowed equal usage of federal airways among all airlines. So the only way for airlines to compete effectively was with good customer service. Okay. After the law went into effect, airlines were able to bid for exclusive usage of certain airways. The Airways are basically the streets in the sky. So different.

Speaker 5:          00:54:04       Okay. Oh, I see. So then, and everybody had their territory. So it was like, that's right. There was eastern airlines, they just flew there. Okay. All right. American and United flew cross country. So it was like wrestling back in the day where everybody had their territories and then rather than have one guy dominate the whole thing like Vince, it became a bidding war. Okay. After the law went into effect, airlines were able to bid exclusive usage of certain airways. So Airways essentially gained monopolies on most of their routes with customers having little or no say in which airline to take. The airlines were able to get us by the balls. So now airlines, business strategy has shifted from good customer service to monopolizing their airways and packing as many people as possible into their plane planes. Hope this helps. Ah, it started to, what should I look up?

Speaker 5:          00:55:02       I should look up the airline deregulation act now that all of a sudden in the era of fake news, I'm being suddenly being held accountable for what the fuck. I said, I can't believe this. I, you guys are so disappointing me. Can somebody please write in and mock these fucking assholes. All right? Not saying that the, the, um, the pilot here, alright. Airline deregulation act, airline D, Reg. You Lation Act Jimmy Carter and affects, let's see what we got here. Oh my God. All right. Wiki a law that changed the airline industry. That's the one that looks like, okay, this is the one I will read up on. Are you guys going to try to make me informed and then I'll join? You know what happens when you don't have to become you informed. You become an arrogant ass. You know, you start smoking a pipe. You fucking eyebrows are always trying to touch each other as your wrinkle up your forehead. No one wants to be around that. All right? A law that changed the airline industry beyond recognition. 1978.

Speaker 1:          00:56:10       All right?

Speaker 5:          00:56:13       Okay. Before deregulations airlines competed on service alone, as fairs were regulated by the government, I didn't know that. I mean, granted I was fucking 10 years old, 1978. Many remember this era fondly is the golden age of aviation. When stewardesses as flight attendants, uh, were then known. Carved, I can chateau Breon on rolling silver carts and airlines put piano lounges and upper decks of their Boeing seven 40 sevens passengers dressed up to board flights and flying was glamorous and exciting and mainly for the rich. Ah, that's why the liberals deregulations resulted in the rise of a new kind of airline. The low cost carrier LCC at the time of deregulation, southwest airline was a small regional airline prevented by cab rules. I don't know what that is from flying outside of Texas today, southwest is the largest domestic us carrier in terms of passenger traffic.

Speaker 5:          00:57:19       Something no one could have foreseen in 1978 yeah, and that's back when stewardesses were fucking hot. So now it's a bunch of animals. They pack us all in and then it's just like, yeah, all the hotties are like, well fuck this. I'm going to go a sell Jello shots at a goddamn one of those DJ shows. Wait, Bay Bay. Bay Bay. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. Wow. Right. Southwest is a success story, but deregulation aloud. Yeah. I hate flying southwest. I fucking hate it. You know why? I hate how the stewardess is sit there and making jokes and fucking around. It's like, dude, my life is in your hands here. You're not making me more relaxed doing your fucking Dean Martin impression. Uh, but deregulation allowed airlines to innovate new business models. People, people express, I remember that. Remember value jet, that one went down. People Express may have come and gone. It may someday be revived, but it and others like it shook up the white glove world of the U s airline industry. And

Speaker 4:          00:58:20       Yeah,

Speaker 5:          00:58:22       democracies travel. Hope I said that right. We may peer through our rose colored glasses and yearn for the days of Chateau. Bring all in piano lounges. But ultimately companies like southwest and newer ones like spirit allowed more people to fly more often. Yeah. And now look at the result. You've got people with no shoes on walking into the bathroom. Oh my God, it all fucking came full circle.

Speaker 4:          00:58:48       Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:58:49       Holy Shit. Do I like being informed? Deregulation left the international carriers like Pan Am and Braniff and to a lesser extent, Twa, Trans World Airlines without robust domestic feeder networks. I don't know what that means. And it allowed domestic carriers like Delta airlines to apply for international routes. Pan-Am and Braniff scrambled to create domestic networks, but ultimately were unsuccessful, although it took until 2000 for Twa to be absorbed into American Airlines.

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       And some argue with it,

Speaker 5:          00:59:22       massive consolidation of the u s airline industry in the last decade, which has resulted in three large carriers for when southwest is included is deregulations final act. Then network carriers that survive delta, United and American learn to be tough competitors and combined existing domestic networks with the international networks acquired in large part by carriers like Pan Am that didn't make it get the fuck out. So now they have to drag people off flights, barefooted, lunatics, and then you've got people fucking, you know, you haven't seen those people that just fly around the world all the time trying to get in miles and shit just created all these bottom feeders.

Speaker 2:          01:00:05       Wow. Do you think a VIP airline would, would make it? I wonder, you know, in this era of Donald Trump, if they just, if they didn't even try to be nice, just be, I wish, I wish I could do a Trump impression. She'd be a lot of animals if flying bear food, a lot of benefit and then, you know,

Speaker 5:          01:00:25       liberals would be like, do you, we use saying that beer footy people shouldn't be allowed to

Speaker 2:          01:00:30       let it be your feet. Let a pair of feet to, can you, what if want, if they had a fuck it, you couldn't do it nowadays if you had a fucking topline airline, okay. All first class seats, all hot stewardesses, you know, first of all, all the fucking, you know, all the fucking feminists would be up in arms, would all be up in arms saying that they, you're objectifying these women, blah blah, blah, blah, blah. And at the end of the F, I dunno, I agree with some of that feminist shit, but a lot of times I just feel like it's women who aren't good looking, hating on good looking women and just being mad that could look and women don't have to work as hard. You know, it's like

Speaker 5:          01:01:21       that whole thing that you're going to somehow get people to give, not as good looking women, not as good looking men, not as strong men, like a chance. That's not how it works. You gotta like you gotta look at it like sports and realize that you're not the Jordan. You're not Sidney Crosby. All right? You're on the fourth line, okay? So what you have to be is you have to be a fucking, you gotta be a Gamer. You know, this is coming from a bald, redheaded male. So go fuck yourself. If you think I'm being elitist here, okay? You gotta be scrappy. You got to go in the corners, all right? You've got to drop the gloves every once in a while you got to do that, okay? You're not gonna get the calls. You're going to have to work 10 times fucking harder than other people to get, you know, half as much or however the expression goes. But it's gonna make you stronger. You know what's great is your fall from grace, from your youth. Six as you slide into a four is not that bad. But at the end of everybody's life, everybody

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       looks like a four or a two. Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:24       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:02:24       but you have a nice soft landing. You do a little bit of a belly flop. You get the wind knocked out of you between 20 and 60 all right. These fucking tents. I mean, they're falling off the top of a goddamn building. Okay? They in a lot of them, they don't survive it. They don't. If you look at their botox faces, they look like they landed face first. They fucking lips are all swollen. I mean, Jesus Christ, look at these fucking Mike Watches this show and these women will not stop taking fat from the back of their arms and injected them in their ass and they got these stupid look and fucking acids now and their legs look like my legs with this weird, like they look like ostriches.

Speaker 2:          01:03:08       I don't know why they did that. I, I just, I just don't fucking understand why and what point. It's like they're literally like Michael Jackson where Michael Jackson couldn't see what he's doing to his face. These women cannot see what they're doing to their asses. I don't understand it. So anyways, do you know what that was actually fascinating and I make fun of the fact that I'm not a well read guy cause it gives me license to be lazy and that's what I like to do best. Okay. But if you fucking assholes, they're going to meet me. Keep reading. I did. I did enjoy that. I do enjoy, I like drum shit. I like aviation. I like that type of shit. All right, so if you're going to fucking really start, hold my feet to the fire here, could you please try to keep it a,

Speaker 1:          01:03:51       I don't know.

Speaker 2:          01:03:52       Well I guess I have the power, right? I have the power where I can actually decide,

Speaker 1:          01:03:59       um,

Speaker 2:          01:04:00       what the fuck it is that I want to read or what I don't want to read. Um, speaking of which, for some reason I woke up this morning thinking about Roy Haynes and the fact that he's still alive and still doing gigs and all the fucking people these played with, like I saw a bunch of great jazz dramas before they passed. I saw a Max Roach. I saw Tony Williams, I saw Louie Bellson and I saw Roy Haynes. I saw Roy Haynes like 20 something years ago when he was in his seventies. He's now 92 and I looked it up like, is this guy still on the road? He's got a road gig coming up

Speaker 1:          01:04:30       and uh,

Speaker 2:          01:04:32       September, like the blue note in New York City and he's from Roxbury, Massachusetts. A fellow Boston guy. I'm a suburb guy. He's actually in Boston. But um,

Speaker 1:          01:04:44       yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:04:44       I don't know. I think that's pretty fucking cool. That guy's still gigging out there. I mean, you talk about a guy he played with Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Sarah Vaughan, all the way, all the way up. Right up through like young people today. The guy's been playing drums professionally for 70 goddamn years, so I dunno if you're into drums, you got to go see that guy. All right, let me go, uh, let me read some more of the, uh, all right, let me read these last two. Cultural appropriation. Dear Billy rationale, a things are getting crazy these days because of technology. It's definitely

Speaker 5:          01:05:18       a lot easier to be critical of what everyone does. I'm sure you've experienced this before where people try and misrepresent what you say for whatever self-serving reason they may have. Yes, of course. That would be the Huffington Post. Uh, one of the things going on today that really bugs me is the accusation of cultural appropriation. I hate picking extreme sides to any arguments. So I will say, I do think that there are cases of cultural disrespect. Let's say someone wears a religious or cultural garb and is overly disrespectful for the purpose of trolling. That could be, that could be cultural appropriation. You put that in quotes. So do you not think it is a, but almost everything anyone does is derived from another culture in some respect. There is a youtube video where a young black college girl borates a hippie for his corn rolls and it seems a bit silly because a kid is just doing what every other wookies who listened to fish do. I don't know what a wookie is. Is that somebody in Indian Shabaka now fucked up. I got to look this up. What the fuck is a way

Speaker 2:          01:06:30       a white something. Wookie meaning slang,

Speaker 5:          01:06:36       uh, a walkie urban dictionary. A what?

Speaker 2:          01:06:41       G. Oh, walkie

Speaker 5:          01:06:43       is a Harry yet modernized human being. That commonly is seen in the western, in the western most regions of Washington, a gentle creature by nature but tends to get a little erratic when it overindulge itself with its favorite foods. Its diets consists mainly of a blend of barley and hops. If you see these creatures a bit cautious as to whether you should provide him with these items, they will commonly respond to the name of Richard Pulliam, but be very worry of these creatures. I have no idea there. Usually I'm remembering a certain brand of cookie that is very chewy.

Speaker 2:          01:07:24       Oh,

Speaker 5:          01:07:25       walkie is a lifeless idiot whose whole existence consists of falling around jam bands. Here we go and not showering or shaving when they're not panhandling or trying to rip people off. They're selling Veggie burritos or grilled cheese to fund their useless existence. They stand for nothing and care about nobody else. Not to be confused. What the hippie AP as someone who lives a certain lifestyle due to their belief. If these often shower and have jobs a used in a scented shows yo those wikis over there trying to sell beat roles. That's from fucking 2003 so I guess they'd been around for awhile. Okay. All right. Let me get back to the, okay, so now I know what a wookie is. I know what a Wiki is and I know about airline deregulation and now I'm going to be in suffer both. The next fucking social event is I try to work both of those into the, um,

Speaker 1:          01:08:18       where the fuck is it?

Speaker 5:          01:08:21       I was an anthropology major, which doesn't make me an expert, but it definitely informs my opinion of this. I went to culinary school after college and learned even more about cultures through their food. I came upon this article and wanting to get your take upon it to take on a couple of girls in Portland, Oregon started a food truck selling Mexican food. They traveled around and learn recipes. The way every chef I've ever known has has done, they are accused of cultural appropriation because they're not Mexican. I'm not going to go on a tirade of motherfucker motherfucks but my adrenaline really starts going. When I think about this. I haven't heard you speak about cultural appropriation yet and wanted to get your take. Here's the link. Oh, the Huffington Post. What a fucking surprise. Thanks for your podcast. Uh, you're a great dad and husband. How do you know that? You have no idea. Um, I hate the fucking Huffington Post.

Speaker 1:          01:09:17       Um,

Speaker 5:          01:09:17       they're always trying to stir up some shit. You know what? I, I hate all these organizations that try to act like they're their news organization and you read two articles and he know who everybody on the website voted for. Essentially. It's like back in the day, like it was supposed to be in and out. Fewer journalists. She was supposed to just sort of present what the fuck happened, not making a Om. If you say this, um, that's probably because you're doing that, that site, that whole fucking website. And I shouldn't just single them off. There's a bunch of them out there and, but they're held in like this as steam. I just don't understand it. Um, anyways, cultural appropriation is, uh, I don't fucking know why. You know, look, if you have an appreciation for Mexican food and you still learn how to cook it and then you sell it, I think at that point, if you become successful, that's when people get annoyed by it.

Speaker 5:          01:10:12       And a college kids are really extreme in their thoughts as I do. You know, you're fucking break and free your parents, you know, when you've got some anger issues probably towards your parents. So you're very, you're very open to a radical fucking sort of ideas, you know, going all the way over here, all the way over there. It's a very dangerous time in your life because you make very extreme judgment. Snap judgment calls with your young brain, um, as I did. And that can cause you to do stupid shit. Like join cults, uh, blow yourself up at a fucking concert, you know, for some stupid fucking cause all the way to like, I don't know what fucking without a condom. You know, you just let me pretty fucking wide thing. This is why you don't talk about shit like this. I don't know what a cultural appropriation is. I don't know what it is. All I know is that my culture is the matrix, so everybody's allowed, you know, I don't get upset when people get on airplanes. Ba that's a white shit, you know?

Speaker 1:          01:11:25       Yes.

Speaker 5:          01:11:29       Um, I would say that if the two white girls being white and they're making great fucking Mexican food, good for them, but if they're sitting there wearing a fucking sombrero and talking like speeding and zealous when they do it, yeah, then I would get upset. But you know, there's plenty of Asian in fuse days and French and fuse that and um,

Speaker 1:          01:11:50       okay.

Speaker 5:          01:11:50       Cultures to me and all of that shit. To me it's like, it's like the MMA. How was the, how was like, how good were the martial arts when it was, you were just one discipline, you know, every way I am a Kido, I am fucking taekwondo. I do karate, I fucking box or whatever. And then a guy, Bruce Lee comes around, he's like, I'll take a little this, I'll take a little of that. Wasn't he doing that? You know, and then he was teaching it to fucking the round dyed guys over here and everybody over in Asia was like, hey, that's our shit. Don't be showing it to their shit and now look at it. Now look how great the fucking fighters are.

Speaker 1:          01:12:29       Okay.

Speaker 5:          01:12:30       You know what I mean? I would love to see Bruce Lee today, if he him back then if he got into the fucking ring, you know what I mean? Did he ever have to deal with a double leg take down what would happen to him? Does he have a ground in pound defense ground and pound didn't exist. Could that man fight on his back? That's how much it's progressed. So I feel everything should get all fucking mixed up and then shit spins out of that. And he just like, uh, I think it's just when you start to act like you're the thing that you're doing, you know what I mean? Like, um, and people do, but the thing is, is that if you start getting into like, like whatever Japanese cuisine, okay, Oh, you get into anime, whatever. I'm watching this animated show. But like, I just watch it and I appreciate it. I don't start walking around with a rising sun fucking tee shirt and I get some swords, you know, Chris crossed on my walls. Do, you know, start sitting on the floor and a pillow with a little short table. You know what I mean? I mean, W W I dunno, I don't know where you, uh, I think it's all how you do it.

Speaker 5:          01:13:39       I mean, if I walk into an Asian person's house and they got a bunch of shit from my Kia, I don't go like, you know, you're appropriating my culture. What's what that l shaped couch. But they're also not oppressing me and I'm not oppressing anybody, but over all the fucking, you know, long tied concept, the top are. So that's what it really comes down to. It really, I think it really comes down to a white people get held to that standard of, of, of cultural appropriation because, uh, you know, we can, the, the damage we can do and we can be really ignorant with it. And then other times people are just being conti, like, I'm not gonna read this fucking article, but if it's just a couple of white chicks making Mexican food and they're crushing it, you know, and their dress like white checks guy like, oh my God, who wants the Berretta? I don't think there's a problem with that. If they're killing it.

Speaker 2:          01:14:30       Right. It's a fucking food truck. Fill your pie hole up and shit. I don't know. All right girlfriend.

Speaker 5:          01:14:38       I, Hey man. What's up? Um, I just had a few questions. Sorry for the lack of punctuation. We'll use parenthesis when he said that I flew this girl out all the way to Japan's, you know something. Fuck you. I'm not reading this shit.

Speaker 2:          01:14:54       You, I this, you know what? You rewrite this fucking thing.

Speaker 5:          01:14:58       You rewrite this fucking thing. Okay. And then I'll read it. Go Fuck Yourself. Sorry for the lack of punctuation. Yes. Sorry. And I fucking rignet. There you go. I draw the line at lack of punctuation.

Speaker 2:          01:15:10       I hate when people fucking go. Sorry if you, sorry. You would have taken the time to, to put some shit in there.

Speaker 5:          01:15:16       You didn't, you're not sorry. You fucking lazy. So fuck off. Now I'm going to be lazy right back to you. I'm not reading you Goddamn Shit. However, if you want to fix it,

Speaker 2:          01:15:25       put some punctuation in it and I will read it. God Damn it, Al read it. All right. The Red Sox,

Speaker 5:          01:15:32       we're in second place in the evil empire Yankees are in first place. Those evil motherfuckers with all their home grown talent. And here we are, the young upstarts with a $215 million team just doing anything we can

Speaker 2:          01:15:45       to try to keep up with them. Um, I want to know, I want to fucking know, cause I heard he lost a bunch of weight. I know he ended up getting fucking hurt again. I want to know when Pablo is coming back. I don't know why. I just feel like he's have gonna have a great second half of the season. Pablo Sandovall and he's going to earn his goddamn money. And I think the red sox I get, they're going to catch fire here right before the all star break and they, and it's going to be Yankees, red sox, Yankees, red sox, and it's going to be great again. It's going to be fucking hilarious. Cause now we're the fucking evil empire that could spend 200 fucking million dollars. Um, that's my prediction. It's going to go down to them and, um,

Speaker 5:          01:16:30       ESPN will blow the Yankees because they have homegrown talent and they will fucking trash the red sox for spending all this fucking money.
