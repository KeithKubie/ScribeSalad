00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.230
- A poetic form congenial
to Robert Browning.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.795
So it's kind of a form
that was good to him,

00:00:05.795 --> 00:00:06.953
that worked well for him.

00:00:06.953 --> 00:00:10.103
A poetic form congenial to Robert Browning

00:00:10.103 --> 00:00:12.547
was the dramatic monologue.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.641
It let him explore a character's mind

00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:17.855
without the simplifications demanded

00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:19.496
by stage productions.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.674
So just the way I read it,

00:00:21.674 --> 00:00:24.195
I had more pause here than just a comma.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.022
If I really read it
actually with the comma,

00:00:26.022 --> 00:00:27.933
it would have been "A
poetic form congenial

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.270
"to Robert Browning was
the dramatic monologue,

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.997
"it let him explore a character's mind

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.008
"without the simplifications demanded by

00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:35.222
"stage productions."

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.786
This is really kind of
a separate expression

00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:38.711
right over here.

00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:40.328
It really demands more pause.

00:00:40.328 --> 00:00:42.542
I would think about,
instead of a comma here,

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.127
you could put a period there,

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.566
kind of a full stop.

00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:47.582
Or maybe a semi-colon, which says,

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:48.902
well it's a little bit in between.

00:00:48.902 --> 00:00:51.381
It's a related thought,

00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:53.148
but we're gonna pause a little bit more.

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:54.814
So I would put at least
a semi-colon there,

00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:56.109
if not a period.

00:00:56.217 --> 00:00:59.441
So let's see what else they put over here.

00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:01.803
A poetic form congenial to Robert Browning

00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:03.655
was the dramatic monologue--

00:01:03.655 --> 00:01:05.137
Okay, well, obviously this was as is.

00:01:05.137 --> 00:01:07.136
We already said that we
don't really like that one.

00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:09.435
A poetic form congenial to Robert Browning

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.610
was the dramatic monologe,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.851
which let him explore a
character's mind without

00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:18.873
the simplifications demanded
by stage productions.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.890
Actually this one works pretty well,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.779
because now it's not a separate

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:24.200
statement right over here.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.061
Here, we have this
relative pronoun "which",

00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:29.727
and you have the dependent clause,

00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:31.719
so it's really telling us more about

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.655
why he, the dramatic
monologue was a poetic form

00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:38.580
congenial to Robert Browning.

00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:41.470
So because it's not an
independent statement,

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.320
it actually works well with a comma.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.371
Here, I don't feel the
need to put a period

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:46.626
or a semi-colon.

00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:48.378
So this is actually a pretty good,

00:01:48.378 --> 00:01:50.470
this is actually a pretty good solution.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.685
But let's look at the other ones.

00:01:51.914 --> 00:01:54.493
A poetic form congenial to Robert Browning

00:01:54.493 --> 00:01:59.493
was the dramatic monologue that lets him

00:01:59.573 --> 00:02:02.884
explore a character's mind without the

00:02:02.884 --> 00:02:07.045
simplifications demanded
by stage productions.

00:02:07.134 --> 00:02:10.213
So this feels, when
they're using "that" here,

00:02:10.213 --> 00:02:12.752
it feels much more like they're telling us

00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:16.755
a certain type of dramatic monologue.

00:02:16.755 --> 00:02:18.605
So not just all dramatic monologues,

00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.246
but it was in particular
the dramatic monologue

00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:24.613
that lets him explore a character's mind.

00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:26.865
But we're not saying that that's the only

00:02:26.865 --> 00:02:28.246
type of dramatic monologue.

00:02:28.246 --> 00:02:29.587
We're saying all dramatic monologues

00:02:29.587 --> 00:02:31.943
let him explore a character's mind

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:34.381
without the simplifications demanded by

00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:35.397
stage productions.

00:02:35.397 --> 00:02:36.251
That's what a dramatic monologue is,

00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:38.259
it's just someone talking
without other stuff

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.431
really going on and all
this other fancy stuff.

00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:43.358
So this, to me, see, kind of changes

00:02:43.358 --> 00:02:44.435
the meaning of it.

00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:49.435
It doesn't, it's not wrong grammatically.

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:53.983
A dramatic monologue that lets him explore

00:02:53.983 --> 00:02:55.101
a character's mind.

00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:56.016
But it's changing the meaning.

00:02:56.016 --> 00:02:58.027
It's saying, it feels like it's qualifying

00:02:58.027 --> 00:02:59.713
the type of dramatic monologue.

00:02:59.713 --> 00:03:01.846
But the intention of the sentence is

00:03:01.846 --> 00:03:04.671
that all, that the reason why it was,

00:03:04.671 --> 00:03:08.754
that dramatic monologues are
good for Robert Browning,

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.553
are that all dramatic monologues

00:03:10.553 --> 00:03:12.381
let him explore a character's mind without

00:03:12.381 --> 00:03:15.018
the simplifications demanded
by stage productions.

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:16.562
So I'll rule this one out.

00:03:16.588 --> 00:03:18.396
I'll kind of, a weak scratch out.

00:03:18.396 --> 00:03:19.127
It's not, you know,

00:03:19.127 --> 00:03:20.590
it's just kind of changing the meaning.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:21.613
So let's get these other ones.

00:03:22.288 --> 00:03:24.969
A poetic form congenial to Robert Browning

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:28.546
was the dramatic monologue, semi-colon,

00:03:28.546 --> 00:03:32.316
letting him explore a character's mind

00:03:32.316 --> 00:03:34.042
without the simplifications demanded

00:03:34.042 --> 00:03:35.460
by stage productions.

00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:37.841
So they're giving me the semi-colon that I

00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:39.914
kind of wanted in the beginning,

00:03:39.914 --> 00:03:43.448
but then they're making this into,

00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:45.175
it's not no longer, the second,

00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:47.025
what we have after that is no longer

00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:48.893
kind of an independent phrase like it was,

00:03:48.893 --> 00:03:51.779
or an independent almost clause,

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:53.019
like it was before.

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.883
Now we're saying letting him explore...

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.484
This actually would have felt
better with a comma here.

00:03:58.484 --> 00:04:01.120
So I'm gonna throw this one out.

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.563
A poetic form congenial to Robert Browning

00:04:03.563 --> 00:04:06.528
was the dramatic monologue
by letting him do--

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:10.998
So this one was dramatic monlogue,

00:04:10.998 --> 00:04:13.656
and then we immediately go into "by".

00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:17.210
By letting him do exploration.

00:04:17.369 --> 00:04:21.616
So this was, I guess, how
the dramatic monologue...

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:24.806
But once again, B is much clearer

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:27.244
in that they're saying
the dramatic monologue,

00:04:27.244 --> 00:04:29.986
which, which is referring
to the dramatic monologue,

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:32.261
lets him explore a character's mind.

00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.541
So I'd rule this one out.

00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:35.391
This one actually is quite awkward

00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:36.747
in the way it's phrased.
