00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
[Professor Masur]: But I thought I would mention one other

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.660
problem that arises that you can ask

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.330
about polygons. You could ask is there

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.820
what's called a periodic orbit? When I

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.950
say orbit, that might be "start off at

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.220
a point, you bounce off the walls and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.210
after some long number of times; can you

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.850
always find a path that repeats itself?"

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.990
So let me give one very, very classical

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.849
example of that and that goes back to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.489
the square – if you start, let's say on the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.190
bottom, and move off at a right angle,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.559
90 degrees, you move to the top. Now when you

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.270
get to the top, because these are

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.210
parallel, this angle is also 90 degrees,

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.640
and so the billiard path says you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.309
rebound where angle of reflection equals

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.170
angle of incidence, and that means that

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.210
when you come to the side you will

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.340
bounce off exactly the way that you came

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.739
in; you will come to the side and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.629
bounce right back. You come back along

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.760
this line and then you will bounce and…

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.949
repeat yourself – so that's what's called

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.559
periodic. There are other periodic lines.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.119
So, for example, you could start at a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.880
45-degree angle, everything would be

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.710
45 degrees, and you would come back right

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.479
where you started and then repeat

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.220
yourself. In fact, if you started any

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.100
point, at any angle that is a rational

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.240
number – a quotient of two integers –if you started with an angle of 27 degrees

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.220
starting here, you will come back after a certain number of bounces.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.180
That's true for a square; and, in fact, one can prove

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.500
for any rational polygon, were all the angles are fractions of 180 degrees,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.200
or P over Q times 180 degrees,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.420
again I like to write it like that,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.940
you can always find a periodic orbit.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.400
[Brady]: From any point?
[Professor Masur]: No not from any point.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.400
There's some periodic orbit, from somewhere.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.760
Some periodic orbit from somewhere.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.280
There might be; so there will be

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.090
some direct… Some point, in some

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.130
direction, where there will be a periodic orbit.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.000
[Brady:] For example on this side there are none, but there is one sitting over here somewhere.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.660
[Professor Masur:] Well usually what happens if… It, it…

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.660
In most cases, that… That's possible;

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.290
in fact you can always find periodic

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.989
orbits that will hit every side. In most

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.120
cases a periodic orbit will hit a side.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.549
There might be other points on that side,

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.620
where the orbit in that same direction, is not periodic.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.040
So in other words, you start at a point on a side and move in a direction

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.960
it might close up, meaning periodic,

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.640
but if you move the point a little bit and headed off in the same direction,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.100
what could happen is that it isn't periodic;

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.040
what might happen is it hits a corner

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.780
and then you don't know what to do.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.020
That's different from the square. In the square no matter where I

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.460
started, if I went at 45 degrees, it would be periodic,

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.700
but in a general,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.300
rational polygon that may not be the case.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.829
I want to talk about triangles now

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.300
that are not necessarily rational, but just triangles.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.340
If they are acute,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.180
which means all of the angles are 90 degrees or less,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.500
what you could do is: you could take the vertex of the triangle

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.540
and drop a perpendicular down to the opposite side to get a point,

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.860
and then drop this perpendicular down to the opposite side and get a point so these are right angles.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.220
This triangle joining those points gives a periodic

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.430
orbit; meaning if I start here I go to

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.159
the line towards here this angle will

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.860
equal that angle and I'll bounce like that.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.180
And then i'll get to this point and

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.440
this angle will equal this angle and

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.780
I'll bounce like that.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.160
And I come back, this angle equal this angle, and I'll repeat myself.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.500
This example was has been known for hundreds of years.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.060
I don't think it was ever thought of as billiards, but anybody in high school or

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.920
even junior high could do this in… In trigonometry.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.599
When you do obtuse triangles,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.620
you can't drop a perpendicular because if I started at this vertex and drop the perpendicular,

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.460
it wouldn't be on that side.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.579
That's because this angle is bigger than 90 degrees and, in fact,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.590
for something as very simple as in a

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.100
triangle, obtuse triangle, one does not

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.389
know whether there are periodic orbits.

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.120
So this is a famous unsolved problem in

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.960
the subject of, what this is called is, dynamical systems.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.740
Well so again if the obtuse triangle is rational,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.340
then there are periodic orbits.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.000
So I'm talking about obtuse triangles. I think I gave an example –

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.650
90 times square root of two – that particular one I would

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.600
not be able to tell you if it had a periodic orbit.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.420
There are some…

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.000
Some reason where people, by very, very hard

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.240
work, have shown where if this angle is less than a hundred degrees,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.100
then there are periodic orbits. But that was very,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.420
very hard work and if it was a hundred and ten degrees;

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.440
again I'm assuming not rational;

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.300
then we don't know the answer.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.360
If it's rational we always know, if all the

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.540
angles, if this is a hundred and eleven,

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.580
and this is 36.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.000
What's left? 33 degrees there will be.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.440
But if one of the angles is an irrational

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.480
number then we don't know.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.480
[Brady:] So what, does greatness await if someone can crack that?

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.140
[Professor Masur:] Well, it's… It's um…

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.440
There is a very prominent, one of the most prominent

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:22.880
mathematicians in the United States or

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.110
in the world in the subject of

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.569
dynamical systems whose name is

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.180
Professor Katok at Penn State has

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.250
listed this as one of the five

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.980
outstanding problems in dynamical systems.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.759
—But really there's nothing you

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.590
could do. You can try desperately to

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.080
solve it, but if it hasn't been solved

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.150
for a hundred years, you probably aren't going to.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.969
And you know it's only given to one

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.949
person, so to speak, to solve a particular

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.550
one of these problems. So we're used to

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:01.360
it and here's an atmosphere of resignation.
