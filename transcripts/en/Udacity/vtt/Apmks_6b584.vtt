00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.105
Many of you are probably already
familiar with the idea of MOOCs.

00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:06.235
MOOCs stand for
Massive Open Online Course.

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:09.364
MOOCs are courses that are delivered
to the masses without scaling up our

00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:12.250
teaching resources to match
the number of students who register.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.800
Doesn't matter if 100
students register or 100,000.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.810
We still have the same initial
resource allocation for that course.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.560
A lot of companies nowadays
are producing MOOCs.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.810
Coursera is producing MOOCs.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.050
edX is producing MOOCs.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.220
Udacity actually got
started producing MOOCs,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.990
although has since has pivoted away
on a more credentialed approach.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.520
There are a lot of interesting
constraints that we wrestle with when

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.380
producing MOOCs.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.810
For one thing,
many of them are available for free.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.362
And when it's available for free,

00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:38.750
we need to minimize our
initial resource investment.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.640
So that means we really need to be very
clever about how we design our MOOCs.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.695
We need to be clever about how we design
our video material, so that we're not

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:48.468
expending a whole lot of money to
produce really excellent lectures or

00:00:48.468 --> 00:00:49.740
anything like that.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.780
We need to be clever about how
we design our assessments.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.360
Assessments in MOOCs can
often be kind of trivial,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.270
if they're just based on some
little multiple choice questions.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.820
How do we design good assessments that
don't require us to hire an army of TAs,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.170
or an army of graders to
evaluate all those assessments?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.170
These are all very interesting issues
that we face when developing good,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.660
massive open online courses.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.310
And then really what we're
going to focus on in this lesson.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.880
How do we develop good video material,
good assessments, good grading,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.360
good things like that without
investing just a lot of money into

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.490
reaching all these students?
