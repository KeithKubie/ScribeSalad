00:00:00.653 --> 00:00:04.820
- Very brief welcome and
introduction to this event.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:09.292
The university lecture as we all know

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:13.665
is one of the most
important times of the year

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:18.053
and it's when we celebrate
our most creative minds

00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:20.664
but it's also a time in which we celebrate

00:00:20.664 --> 00:00:24.118
the academic way of life,
the people that we ask

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:27.951
to come and speak are
those who we admire most

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:33.277
because of what they've
contributed to the development

00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:37.596
of knowledge and I think
I'd have to say that

00:00:37.596 --> 00:00:39.994
right now it seems more
important to do this

00:00:39.994 --> 00:00:44.161
than at any time I can remember
and on behalf of all of us

00:00:45.472 --> 00:00:48.614
we're extremely grateful
to Professor Gelman

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:51.440
for giving us the chance both to honor him

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.857
and to affirm the world of the university

00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:59.923
and I now turn this over
to John Coatsworth, John?

00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:02.673
(audience claps)

00:01:12.378 --> 00:01:17.005
- Thank you, President
Bollinger and welcome to

00:01:17.005 --> 00:01:19.857
this evening's university lecture.

00:01:19.857 --> 00:01:23.743
This is a night we all look forward to,

00:01:23.743 --> 00:01:25.951
when disparate parts of
the Columbia community

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:28.800
have an opportunity to come together

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.541
and to learn about the academic
work of a distinguished

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:34.129
faculty member whose current scholarship

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:37.629
might otherwise remain outside our vision.

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:41.213
I certainly count it as a
privilege and a great pleasure

00:01:41.213 --> 00:01:44.593
to be surrounded by so many
colleagues and students

00:01:44.593 --> 00:01:46.426
for this good purpose.

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:51.290
Tonight, we will hear from Andrew Gelman.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.246
Higgins Professor of Statistics

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.041
and professor of political science.

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:58.513
Professor Gelman is known
to many of you for his

00:01:58.513 --> 00:02:01.680
public commentaries, making
use of statistical methods

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.347
to explain politics and polling.

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:07.786
Tonight his focus is different,

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:11.789
but the subject is no less
timely and compelling.

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:16.058
The title of his talk is The
Statistical Crisis in Science,

00:02:16.058 --> 00:02:17.725
How to Move Forward.

00:02:19.154 --> 00:02:22.209
Professor Gelman became a
faculty member in Columbia's

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.979
department of statistics 17 years ago

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:29.383
and then two years later
in 2002 he received a joint

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:33.366
appointment in the department
of political science.

00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:37.427
Before arriving here, he had
received undergraduate degrees

00:02:37.427 --> 00:02:40.698
in mathematics and physics
from MIT and had earned his

00:02:40.698 --> 00:02:44.865
master's and PhD degrees
in statistics from Harvard.

00:02:45.772 --> 00:02:47.997
He is the founding director
of Columbia's applied

00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:51.945
statistics center, and
the author of a number

00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:55.007
of highly regarded books
that have attracted readers

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:59.387
in both academic circles and
among the general public.

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:03.111
His book published in 2008,
Red State, Blue State,

00:03:03.111 --> 00:03:06.259
Rich State, Poor State,
Why Americans Vote the Way

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.588
They Do, succeeded in
upending political myths

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:12.232
about partisan voting
patterns and changed the way

00:03:12.232 --> 00:03:14.326
we think about elections
and about American politics

00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:15.159
forever.

00:03:16.502 --> 00:03:18.111
Professor Gelman is
something of an evangelist,

00:03:18.111 --> 00:03:21.482
actually an evangelist for
improving the way in which

00:03:21.482 --> 00:03:25.877
we communicate scientific
research findings to the public.

00:03:25.877 --> 00:03:27.511
He frequently speaks about the importance

00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:31.393
of making statistics visible
and communicating them

00:03:31.393 --> 00:03:33.494
more effectively to the
public, a subject that is also

00:03:33.494 --> 00:03:37.661
very much the focus of his
admired classroom teaching.

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:42.675
He has also maintained
his own widely read blog

00:03:42.675 --> 00:03:45.029
for some 10 years now and is a contributor

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:47.043
to the Washington Post
political science blog

00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:48.960
called The Monkey Cage.

00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:53.325
That name, I should note,
comes from a wonderfully

00:03:53.325 --> 00:03:57.242
resonant HL Mencken quote,
democracy is the art

00:03:59.436 --> 00:04:03.729
of running the circus
from the monkey cage.

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.486
Professor Gelman's
interest are wide ranging.

00:04:06.486 --> 00:04:08.554
He has at different times
focused his attention

00:04:08.554 --> 00:04:12.494
on police stops, social
networks, public health

00:04:12.494 --> 00:04:13.994
and redistricting.

00:04:15.307 --> 00:04:19.224
He has received some two
dozen academic awards,

00:04:20.968 --> 00:04:23.851
including the outstanding
statistical application award

00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:26.015
from the American Statistical Association,

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:27.862
the award for the best article published

00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:29.933
in the American Political Science Review

00:04:29.933 --> 00:04:33.275
and the council of presidents
of statistical society's

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:35.629
award for outstanding
contributions by a person

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:37.925
under the age of 40.

00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:42.242
As you know from listening
to President Bollinger

00:04:42.242 --> 00:04:44.969
and from observing many
of the most exciting new

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:47.461
developments at Columbia,
we are increasingly focused

00:04:47.461 --> 00:04:50.509
on bringing the university's
vast knowledge to bear

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.509
on the pressing problems of the day.

00:04:54.624 --> 00:04:57.599
Doing so has always been
and always will be part

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.555
of our mission.

00:04:59.555 --> 00:05:01.886
With that in mind, I want
to conclude with a quotation

00:05:01.886 --> 00:05:03.654
from the speaker we honor tonight.

00:05:03.654 --> 00:05:06.232
According to Professor Gelman, quote,

00:05:06.232 --> 00:05:10.399
every field worth studying
connects to one's everyday life.

00:05:11.401 --> 00:05:13.412
Statistics is not an isolated field.

00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:15.372
It connects to everything.

00:05:15.372 --> 00:05:17.152
I am sure that his talk
will leave little doubt

00:05:17.152 --> 00:05:19.283
as to the rightness of that claim.

00:05:19.283 --> 00:05:23.020
Please join me in welcoming
the 2017 university lecturer,

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.165
Professor Andrew Gelman.

00:05:25.165 --> 00:05:27.915
(audience claps)

00:05:38.957 --> 00:05:42.723
- Hi, so the other day,
somebody sent me an email.

00:05:42.723 --> 00:05:47.447
They said, did you see this
thing, it was in the newspaper,

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:50.380
about stents, so a stent
is some sort of balloon

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.434
that inflates your artery and it said that

00:05:54.434 --> 00:05:57.027
stents do no better with
placebo, but this guy said

00:05:57.027 --> 00:05:59.380
that wasn't true, he read
the paper and actually

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.625
stents did better than
placebo, so I was curious.

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:04.458
So I read the article.

00:06:05.324 --> 00:06:06.657
And it was a ...

00:06:07.812 --> 00:06:10.985
Randomized trial where 100
patients got the stents

00:06:10.985 --> 00:06:14.659
and 100 patients got the
sham surgery where they do

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.923
the surgery and they
don't put the stent in

00:06:16.923 --> 00:06:21.090
which don't give me that
look because they consented

00:06:22.277 --> 00:06:23.975
to, you know, be randomized.

00:06:23.975 --> 00:06:27.164
It's very safe, like, there
were no adverse events

00:06:27.164 --> 00:06:31.331
apparently and you get extra
goodies if you participate

00:06:33.673 --> 00:06:35.943
in a medical study, they
do nice things to you

00:06:35.943 --> 00:06:38.713
and they give extra care,
so it seems fair enough.

00:06:38.713 --> 00:06:42.546
And there was a difference,
so the stent group

00:06:43.446 --> 00:06:45.521
did better than the placebo group,

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:49.104
but not statistically
significantly better.

00:06:50.908 --> 00:06:53.316
So they said that stents didn't work.

00:06:53.316 --> 00:06:56.109
It's kind of funny, I'm
not really an expert

00:06:56.109 --> 00:06:58.396
on the placebo effect, I
think that's what, like,

00:06:58.396 --> 00:07:01.500
as a statiscian, I'm not an expert on X,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.981
you know, for any X
that I happen to study.

00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:08.815
And I, but I wonder
about the placebo effect

00:07:08.815 --> 00:07:10.682
because if you know there's a 50% chance

00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:12.317
you're actually getting the sham treatment

00:07:12.317 --> 00:07:14.897
then I don't know if you
get, like, a 50% placebo

00:07:14.897 --> 00:07:18.586
or what, they do, the
people who did the study

00:07:18.586 --> 00:07:21.155
was a very professional
job, they knew what

00:07:21.155 --> 00:07:24.116
they were doing and they
did standard good practice.

00:07:24.116 --> 00:07:26.074
So they asked people, which
treatment do you think

00:07:26.074 --> 00:07:29.518
you got and most people,
most people didn't know

00:07:29.518 --> 00:07:33.011
and the ones who guessed
guessed right about 50%,

00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:35.165
so, like, it seemed
that people didn't know

00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:37.046
what they were getting.

00:07:37.046 --> 00:07:40.369
Anyway, I looked at the
paper and so I realized

00:07:40.369 --> 00:07:43.513
the analysis wasn't quite, it wasn't wrong

00:07:43.513 --> 00:07:46.040
but they did this thing
called a Gaines Score

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.169
where they looked at improvement
from pre-test to post-test.

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:51.623
They didn't control for
differences in pre-test

00:07:51.623 --> 00:07:52.791
between the groups.

00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.783
If you do that, you'll get
more statistical efficiency.

00:07:55.783 --> 00:07:57.967
So I thought maybe I could
get the raw data and analyze,

00:07:57.967 --> 00:08:02.134
just kidding, so I, but I
was able to read the paper,

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.856
you could actually deduce
from the summary statistics

00:08:06.856 --> 00:08:09.813
in the paper what the analysis
would be if you controlled

00:08:09.813 --> 00:08:12.332
appropriately for the pre-test score.

00:08:12.332 --> 00:08:14.416
So I was able to reconstruct
the analysis that

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:15.895
they could have done, but before doing it,

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.206
I got really excited
because I could tell from

00:08:18.206 --> 00:08:20.127
the differences between pre and post

00:08:20.127 --> 00:08:23.376
that when I reanalyzed it, it
would make the effect bigger

00:08:23.376 --> 00:08:25.785
and the standard error smaller,

00:08:25.785 --> 00:08:29.083
and it was already at P
equals .2, which isn't, like,

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:31.350
good enough, it's supposed
to be .05, but I knew

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.190
it would get better, so I
had to go to work, like,

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.886
I don't know, like, teach
a class or something,

00:08:36.886 --> 00:08:39.524
I don't remember, and so ...

00:08:39.524 --> 00:08:42.102
I quickly dashed off an
email to my colleague

00:08:42.102 --> 00:08:44.800
at the New York Times saying,
hey, this is gonna be big,

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.064
this is great, like, so then I went back

00:08:48.064 --> 00:08:49.767
and I was figuring it out.

00:08:49.767 --> 00:08:54.632
And it did just what I said
except the P value went

00:08:54.632 --> 00:08:55.882
from .2 to .09.

00:08:58.001 --> 00:09:00.153
Which was, like, not what it's
supposed to do for the story

00:09:00.153 --> 00:09:02.845
because it should be, it went to .04

00:09:02.845 --> 00:09:04.085
and then I would be able to say, look,

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:05.452
once you do the right analysis,

00:09:05.452 --> 00:09:07.211
it becomes statistically significant

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:09.545
so that you can see by
doing the right analysis,

00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:11.345
it changes the story completely

00:09:11.345 --> 00:09:13.720
from stents don't work to stents work.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.124
The whole headline changes.

00:09:15.124 --> 00:09:18.476
Everything is changed, it's all ...

00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:20.309
We did it, statistics!

00:09:21.701 --> 00:09:23.544
But went to .09, but then I realized

00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:25.675
this is even a better story, really,

00:09:25.675 --> 00:09:29.741
because what's so magic
about .05 or whatever, right?

00:09:29.741 --> 00:09:33.460
So the real point is that yeah,
the stents did better maybe.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.906
The difference, I don't
care if it's statistically

00:09:37.906 --> 00:09:42.073
significant, the difference
was not clinically large.

00:09:43.242 --> 00:09:45.825
And I think, actually, like ...

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:49.795
There's some issues.

00:09:49.795 --> 00:09:52.246
I think the study was very
well done, but that's kind of

00:09:52.246 --> 00:09:53.853
the point, I think
there's some issues here,

00:09:53.853 --> 00:09:56.379
and I'll kind of get
back to that, but first

00:09:56.379 --> 00:09:59.022
I just want to say it's
a pleasure to speak here.

00:09:59.022 --> 00:10:00.992
I've taught here for 21 years

00:10:00.992 --> 00:10:03.485
and to have a room full of collaborators,

00:10:03.485 --> 00:10:05.494
students, family and friends,

00:10:05.494 --> 00:10:08.984
it's really wonderful,
it's a privilege to be

00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:12.567
at any university, but
especially this one.

00:10:14.057 --> 00:10:18.854
And it's said that, those of
you who have taught know this,

00:10:18.854 --> 00:10:22.118
that to truly, the only way
to truly learn a subject

00:10:22.118 --> 00:10:23.944
is to teach it.

00:10:23.944 --> 00:10:26.901
And I can assure you that
my students understand

00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:29.723
statistics very well, I know
that because they've taught me

00:10:29.723 --> 00:10:33.636
so much, and I've learned so
much from my collaborators

00:10:33.636 --> 00:10:36.636
as well, so let me tell you a story.

00:10:40.382 --> 00:10:42.892
This is something somebody
sent to me in the mail

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.361
a few years ago.

00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:48.145
I think they wanted to
me to make fun of it.

00:10:48.145 --> 00:10:51.829
Influence of Valentine's Day
and Halloween on birth timing,

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:54.384
but I actually liked it.

00:10:54.384 --> 00:10:58.551
I'll show you the data here
from the published article.

00:11:00.197 --> 00:11:04.364
They had the data, number
of babies born every day

00:11:05.377 --> 00:11:08.594
for a 20 year period and
do you see the heart there

00:11:08.594 --> 00:11:09.696
on the left?

00:11:09.696 --> 00:11:13.190
And then that's Valentine's
Day, there were more babies born

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:16.730
and fewer the week before
and the week after,

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.476
and then do you see, isn't
that cute, the witch there?

00:11:20.476 --> 00:11:22.653
Yeah, that's Halloween, yeah.

00:11:22.653 --> 00:11:25.926
So it's kind of funny because,
like, not only are there

00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:30.270
more Cesarean section
births on Valentine's Day

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.522
because what shows love more than,

00:11:33.522 --> 00:11:35.604
but more natural births too.

00:11:35.604 --> 00:11:39.904
Which seems kind of funny,
like, how could that be

00:11:39.904 --> 00:11:42.558
although those of you with
statistics training will know

00:11:42.558 --> 00:11:45.549
that selection occurs even on the things

00:11:45.549 --> 00:11:48.864
that aren't selected
because the natural births

00:11:48.864 --> 00:11:53.404
are all the births that weren't
induced or Cesarean sections

00:11:53.404 --> 00:11:55.925
so in fact, you get selection there too.

00:11:55.925 --> 00:11:57.230
Anyway, this is kind of interesting.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.123
It's statistically significant.

00:11:59.123 --> 00:12:01.956
You can see by those little stars.

00:12:03.428 --> 00:12:04.549
Someone sent me a paper the other day,

00:12:04.549 --> 00:12:06.605
it was some claim I didn't quite believe.

00:12:06.605 --> 00:12:08.088
I looked at it really
carefully and it said

00:12:08.088 --> 00:12:10.867
it was statistically
significant at the .1 level

00:12:10.867 --> 00:12:13.647
which, you're not really
supposed to say but I just

00:12:13.647 --> 00:12:17.315
threw that out for those
of you who are into jargon

00:12:17.315 --> 00:12:18.148
like that.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.910
If you look at this,
it's like, is this real?

00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:27.693
You know, I'm not sure,
what should you do?

00:12:27.693 --> 00:12:30.441
I think what we should do
is look at all 366 days

00:12:30.441 --> 00:12:34.734
of the year, so someone
made this graph for me.

00:12:34.734 --> 00:12:36.888
This is the benefits of collaboration.

00:12:36.888 --> 00:12:39.388
Somebody, oh, hey, someone ...

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.250
Is this hair trigger?

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:46.266
Someone made this graph for me.

00:12:46.266 --> 00:12:48.623
You can ignore the curves,
this is just the raw data.

00:12:48.623 --> 00:12:52.614
The total number of babies
born each day of the year.

00:12:52.614 --> 00:12:56.272
You can see fewer babies on
New Year's and July fourth

00:12:56.272 --> 00:12:57.344
and Christmas.

00:12:57.344 --> 00:13:02.087
There's Valentine's Day and
Halloween which, sort of like,

00:13:02.087 --> 00:13:04.809
it's not completely clear,
do they really stand out?

00:13:04.809 --> 00:13:06.392
You see a wiggling.

00:13:08.732 --> 00:13:12.899
There are about 52 of those
cycles during the year.

00:13:14.425 --> 00:13:16.533
Because it's not a 28 year period.

00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:19.322
So there's some confounding
of day of week and date

00:13:19.322 --> 00:13:24.079
during the year so we need to
do a little bit more analysis.

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:25.787
If we just look at this, it's hard to know

00:13:25.787 --> 00:13:29.954
what's going on with
Valentine's Day and Halloween.

00:13:31.127 --> 00:13:34.471
God this is so, okay, someone
made this graph for me

00:13:34.471 --> 00:13:37.279
which I kind of like because

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:39.148
I hate it so much.

00:13:39.148 --> 00:13:41.318
Because it's, you know, there's
a principle of statistical

00:13:41.318 --> 00:13:44.318
graphics that graphs are comparisons

00:13:45.294 --> 00:13:47.683
and this graph is sort of a
wonderful way of comparing

00:13:47.683 --> 00:13:52.298
what's happening on the 21st
of every month going across

00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:53.621
which is kind of goofy.

00:13:53.621 --> 00:13:55.854
It also tells you more
babies are born in the summer

00:13:55.854 --> 00:13:59.407
and early fall, but you
can see that much better

00:13:59.407 --> 00:14:02.363
from this graph, so this
graph is kind of horrible

00:14:02.363 --> 00:14:05.365
but I just wanted to convey that.

00:14:05.365 --> 00:14:07.648
I thought it would be interesting
to see that not everything

00:14:07.648 --> 00:14:10.315
we do is very helpful, actually.

00:14:11.452 --> 00:14:13.242
(audience laughs)

00:14:13.242 --> 00:14:14.810
Okay, so I'll tell you
the rest of that story

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:18.449
once we have the data for you to see.

00:14:18.449 --> 00:14:23.014
Let me move on to the
statistical crisis in science.

00:14:23.014 --> 00:14:25.347
I can start with an example.

00:14:26.368 --> 00:14:28.776
You might have heard
of, someone did a study,

00:14:28.776 --> 00:14:31.500
they looked at 50 common food ingredients

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:35.060
and they scoured the medical literature

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.026
and they found of those
50 food ingredients,

00:14:37.026 --> 00:14:40.998
something like 40 had either
been discovered to cause cancer

00:14:40.998 --> 00:14:44.915
or prevent cancer, some
of them both, actually.

00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:49.423
Now my point here is not
that onions both cause

00:14:49.423 --> 00:14:51.481
and prevent cancer.

00:14:51.481 --> 00:14:54.273
But rather that there's a
problem with how medical research

00:14:54.273 --> 00:14:56.687
is often conducted and communicated

00:14:56.687 --> 00:14:59.728
and a problem also of
course in other fields

00:14:59.728 --> 00:15:01.887
such as psychology,
medicine, and public health

00:15:01.887 --> 00:15:06.054
and for example, the stents
story that I led off with.

00:15:06.907 --> 00:15:10.902
Has this issue, like, so a study is done,

00:15:10.902 --> 00:15:13.093
some data are collected
and then the result

00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:15.147
is this very strong conclusion, like,

00:15:15.147 --> 00:15:17.561
something works or it doesn't work.

00:15:17.561 --> 00:15:19.594
It's actually kind of
funny if you think about it

00:15:19.594 --> 00:15:22.227
because it doesn't matter
how bad your data are.

00:15:22.227 --> 00:15:25.503
You can always say it
works or it doesn't work.

00:15:25.503 --> 00:15:26.633
It's like a free headline.

00:15:26.633 --> 00:15:29.049
I mean, you could just be,
like, you could have a spinner

00:15:29.049 --> 00:15:32.199
and just generate random
numbers and that would be enough

00:15:32.199 --> 00:15:35.782
to get that, not that
anyone would do that,

00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:38.813
just generate random numbers.

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:39.818
They might have people,

00:15:39.818 --> 00:15:43.434
but they might be measuring
something that is so noisy

00:15:43.434 --> 00:15:46.607
that it's as bad as being random numbers.

00:15:46.607 --> 00:15:48.676
In particular, if you
want to study things like

00:15:48.676 --> 00:15:51.344
what causes cancer in
epidemiological studies,

00:15:51.344 --> 00:15:53.903
that's kind of noisy because
people can get cancer

00:15:53.903 --> 00:15:55.830
from all sorts of reasons.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.431
So if you study a small effect,

00:15:57.431 --> 00:15:59.340
you'll be seeing the noise
rather than the signal.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.911
Now that's fine to see the
noise rather than the signal

00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:05.956
if that's what you see, but the issue is

00:16:05.956 --> 00:16:08.213
if you misinterpret it and
then go around telling people

00:16:08.213 --> 00:16:09.539
not to eat onions.

00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:11.456
That would be terrible.

00:16:13.427 --> 00:16:16.987
But I'll talk a little bit
about political science

00:16:16.987 --> 00:16:19.952
rather than psychology and medicine

00:16:19.952 --> 00:16:22.053
because political science,
American politics,

00:16:22.053 --> 00:16:23.056
is what I study.

00:16:23.056 --> 00:16:27.410
There have been some,
oh, we will hear about

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:31.611
political science in a
moment, but now it's time

00:16:31.611 --> 00:16:34.630
to return to the birthdays.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:37.880
So my colleague Aki Veturi from Finland

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.878
fit a statistical model
to the birthday data.

00:16:42.878 --> 00:16:44.961
And it's a decomposition.

00:16:46.459 --> 00:16:51.364
So we start with the number
of babies born every day

00:16:51.364 --> 00:16:53.197
between 1968 and 1988.

00:16:54.573 --> 00:16:58.486
I'd just like to interject
here that it's really, like,

00:16:58.486 --> 00:17:01.123
great, like, students love
if you can have an example

00:17:01.123 --> 00:17:03.919
where you can find yourself
in the data, like you gather

00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:06.369
data from the student,
then you plot them, like,

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:09.852
which data point am I, well,
a lot of you are in this data,

00:17:09.852 --> 00:17:12.669
right, so you can find yourself
if you were born between

00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:13.836
1968 and 1988.

00:17:16.006 --> 00:17:17.243
There are several components.

00:17:17.243 --> 00:17:20.746
There's a slow trend, a
fast nonperiodic component,

00:17:20.746 --> 00:17:22.041
you kind of need all of these.

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:24.187
You need the slow trend
because there was a time

00:17:24.187 --> 00:17:26.361
when having babies was less popular,

00:17:26.361 --> 00:17:28.428
then a time when having
babies was more popular.

00:17:28.428 --> 00:17:31.512
You need a fast non-periodic
component because there

00:17:31.512 --> 00:17:34.435
are just things that happen,
like, people are in a good mood

00:17:34.435 --> 00:17:37.255
and they have more babies, then
they're less in a good mood.

00:17:37.255 --> 00:17:38.925
There's fluctuation.

00:17:38.925 --> 00:17:40.278
We have day of week effect.

00:17:40.278 --> 00:17:44.108
Fewer babies on the weekend,
and the day of week effect

00:17:44.108 --> 00:17:46.150
changes over time, it
became more pronounced

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.650
as the number of scheduled births went up.

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:54.450
Then you see seasonal effect,
that there's more well known,

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.733
more people born at the
end of summer, early fall

00:17:57.733 --> 00:18:00.337
and then finally the day of year effect

00:18:00.337 --> 00:18:01.402
and this model was cool.

00:18:01.402 --> 00:18:05.940
We did not tell the data,
we did not tell the model

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:08.833
to look for New Year's Day,
Valentine's Day, leap day,

00:18:08.833 --> 00:18:12.977
so forth, our model had 366
parameters, one for each day.

00:18:12.977 --> 00:18:15.982
Well, plus extra things for
the three floating holidays,

00:18:15.982 --> 00:18:18.987
Labor Day, Thanksgiving and Memorial Day

00:18:18.987 --> 00:18:21.184
and it just sort of
discovered from the data

00:18:21.184 --> 00:18:25.093
what was going on and it
picks up, it picks up,

00:18:25.093 --> 00:18:26.782
you see Valentine's Day
is actually interesting

00:18:26.782 --> 00:18:30.113
because Valentine's Day is the only day

00:18:30.113 --> 00:18:31.669
that has too many babies.

00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:32.795
All the others have too few.

00:18:32.795 --> 00:18:35.444
Well, that's not quite
true because December 24th

00:18:35.444 --> 00:18:38.136
and December 26th have too many babies.

00:18:38.136 --> 00:18:40.361
But that's because there's
a sort of principle

00:18:40.361 --> 00:18:44.707
that the baby has to come
out at some point or another

00:18:44.707 --> 00:18:46.400
so if you have fewer babies
one day, you have to have more

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.844
nearby, but Valentine's
Day is kind of special

00:18:49.844 --> 00:18:54.837
so I actually really liked
that paper that found that.

00:18:54.837 --> 00:18:56.670
Then we got more data.

00:18:58.907 --> 00:19:02.574
This was from 2000 to
2015 and it's similar.

00:19:04.108 --> 00:19:06.215
I want you to go back and
look at this one for a second.

00:19:06.215 --> 00:19:10.215
Do you see the scale on
the Y axis here goes ...

00:19:11.322 --> 00:19:14.357
I don't have control
over this thing, okay,

00:19:14.357 --> 00:19:16.193
oh, I don't point at
that, I point over there?

00:19:16.193 --> 00:19:17.026
No, okay.

00:19:17.939 --> 00:19:18.772
Ugh.

00:19:21.724 --> 00:19:24.423
Okay, if you look at what happened before,

00:19:24.423 --> 00:19:26.909
there's just a lag between when I click,

00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:27.905
do I have to say it?

00:19:27.905 --> 00:19:29.503
Are you clicking for me here?

00:19:29.503 --> 00:19:31.413
What's going on with
this, because I click,

00:19:31.413 --> 00:19:32.747
it's like a delay.

00:19:32.747 --> 00:19:36.512
Okay, the effects are larger than ...

00:19:36.512 --> 00:19:39.528
Okay, this is what it was like before.

00:19:39.528 --> 00:19:41.936
And you see, like, I
want to point on there

00:19:41.936 --> 00:19:42.937
it's not so helpful.

00:19:42.937 --> 00:19:47.104
If you see that, like, New
Year's, they're about at 80 or so

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:49.855
Then if you look at the more recent data,

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:51.772
the effects are larger.

00:19:52.779 --> 00:19:55.675
Can you click to the next slide please?

00:19:55.675 --> 00:19:57.006
Thank you.

00:19:57.006 --> 00:19:59.126
Now they're around 60, so
there's also a lot more

00:19:59.126 --> 00:20:01.411
induced births than there used to be.

00:20:01.411 --> 00:20:02.761
But I actually want to
focus on something slightly

00:20:02.761 --> 00:20:04.011
different here.

00:20:04.862 --> 00:20:09.029
Look at what's going on around after 9/11.

00:20:11.713 --> 00:20:13.420
Which is a less popular birthday now.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.540
Do you see that there's a
two week period where there's

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.707
too many babies, and that
violates the baby has to come out

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.403
somewhere principle, you can't be, like,

00:20:26.154 --> 00:20:28.619
scheduling your babies
for two straight weeks,

00:20:28.619 --> 00:20:30.446
like, where do the babies come from?

00:20:30.446 --> 00:20:34.450
So what's really happening
is that the sort of lump,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.183
the positive thing that's
happening after 9/11

00:20:37.183 --> 00:20:40.025
is not, is really not
about scheduling birth.

00:20:40.025 --> 00:20:42.426
That's just a seasonal affect.

00:20:42.426 --> 00:20:43.769
Now look at that seasonal curve.

00:20:43.769 --> 00:20:46.013
Do you see how smooth it is?

00:20:46.013 --> 00:20:49.346
Now if we go back to the previous slide,

00:20:51.734 --> 00:20:52.901
if we go, yes.

00:20:54.095 --> 00:20:58.239
Now you see there's like a
bump at the end of September.

00:20:58.239 --> 00:21:01.626
So there was kind of a,
this model fit the data.

00:21:01.626 --> 00:21:03.865
The second model kind
of fit the data well.

00:21:03.865 --> 00:21:07.107
I'm gonna go back to the
next slide now please.

00:21:07.107 --> 00:21:11.017
Yes, this model sort
of fits the data wrong

00:21:11.017 --> 00:21:15.100
because it puts in this
slow change in September.

00:21:16.449 --> 00:21:18.053
It puts it on the bottom,
and it should be really

00:21:18.053 --> 00:21:19.840
on the third thing.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.384
So we realized there was
a problem with our model

00:21:22.384 --> 00:21:26.040
and we have prior information
that's not in the model.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.226
And the information is, the
baby has to come out somewhere,

00:21:30.226 --> 00:21:32.571
right, so our model said that every day,

00:21:32.571 --> 00:21:36.654
all 366 days of the year,
there could be a spike.

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:41.876
Extra births or not enough
births, and it tries to fit it.

00:21:41.876 --> 00:21:44.273
What we really need is
a model with ringing,

00:21:44.273 --> 00:21:47.077
so it says there's a day
with not enough births

00:21:47.077 --> 00:21:49.817
and the days before and after
have to have extra births

00:21:49.817 --> 00:21:52.730
to counterbalance that,
otherwise it doesn't add up.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:53.853
So we didn't put that in the model

00:21:53.853 --> 00:21:56.679
and our first data analysis we got lucky

00:21:56.679 --> 00:21:59.909
and it sort of worked out, but
in the second data analysis,

00:21:59.909 --> 00:22:01.948
it didn't like discover the right thing.

00:22:01.948 --> 00:22:06.115
And so I, there are a lot
of points of this example.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.946
But maybe the most important is the way

00:22:12.946 --> 00:22:15.610
that we go back and
forth between our model,

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.928
our data and our scientific questions.

00:22:18.928 --> 00:22:22.010
We're sort of circling
through, looping back,

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:23.829
and the stronger the model we make,

00:22:23.829 --> 00:22:28.695
the more we can learn when
the model doesn't fit.

00:22:28.695 --> 00:22:32.284
Now the other relevant point
about this is it demonstrates

00:22:32.284 --> 00:22:35.812
a principle from mathematics which is that

00:22:35.812 --> 00:22:40.358
if you can't solve a problem,
embed it in a harder problem.

00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:42.300
There's a well known
principle of mathematics.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.616
If you can't prove a
theorem about prime numbers,

00:22:45.616 --> 00:22:48.214
prove it on ideals, which
is a generalization of prime

00:22:48.214 --> 00:22:51.735
numbers, if you can't
sum an infinite series,

00:22:51.735 --> 00:22:53.874
then you solve the generating function.

00:22:53.874 --> 00:22:56.030
And instead of trying to
figure out what's happening

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:58.541
two days out of the year,
we're gonna estimate

00:22:58.541 --> 00:23:00.874
what's happening in all 366.

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.053
In statistics this is called
the blessing of dimensionality.

00:23:05.053 --> 00:23:08.362
Some journalists contacted
us and they said,

00:23:08.362 --> 00:23:10.169
what about Friday the 13th?

00:23:10.169 --> 00:23:13.424
It's, like, well, this is just the 13th,

00:23:13.424 --> 00:23:14.709
you can do more with Friday.

00:23:14.709 --> 00:23:17.292
Look at the 13th, look at that.

00:23:19.128 --> 00:23:20.302
You see?

00:23:20.302 --> 00:23:21.823
It's kind of funny,
gives you a new insight

00:23:21.823 --> 00:23:24.772
into Valentine's Day,
what's Valentine's Day?

00:23:24.772 --> 00:23:26.893
That's right, it's the 14th.

00:23:26.893 --> 00:23:29.152
So one reason Valentine's
Day is so popular

00:23:29.152 --> 00:23:32.728
is it's sitting next to the 13th.

00:23:32.728 --> 00:23:34.168
Now that's not the only
reason 'cause you don't see

00:23:34.168 --> 00:23:36.512
a peak the 14th of every
month, but it doesn't hurt

00:23:36.512 --> 00:23:38.937
to be next to the 14th if you want

00:23:38.937 --> 00:23:40.511
to be getting extra births.

00:23:40.511 --> 00:23:44.678
The funny thing is, this
pattern was in the data already.

00:23:47.067 --> 00:23:49.417
This was in, if I go back
to the earlier graph,

00:23:49.417 --> 00:23:52.316
it's there, we just didn't
notice it because we didn't know

00:23:52.316 --> 00:23:54.659
where to look and you want to
hear something really funny,

00:23:54.659 --> 00:23:58.609
go back, we're gonna go
back to the ugly graph.

00:23:58.609 --> 00:24:00.976
Can you go back to the ugly graph please?

00:24:00.976 --> 00:24:03.136
One more, one more.

00:24:03.136 --> 00:24:04.140
Yes, stop.

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.557
Look at the 13th.

00:24:08.212 --> 00:24:10.188
Isn't that funny?

00:24:10.188 --> 00:24:12.049
I was, like, ooh, this graph is so stupid.

00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:14.266
It allows you to compare
the same day of every month

00:24:14.266 --> 00:24:15.413
like I would really want to compare the,

00:24:15.413 --> 00:24:18.527
actually, if I had looked at this graph,

00:24:18.527 --> 00:24:20.329
spent a little bit less
time laughing at it

00:24:20.329 --> 00:24:21.618
and more time looking at
it, I would have seen,

00:24:21.618 --> 00:24:23.713
hey, what about the 13th?

00:24:23.713 --> 00:24:26.459
No kidding, it's right there, all along.

00:24:26.459 --> 00:24:29.199
But you know, of course you'll
only see it if you look at it

00:24:29.199 --> 00:24:30.032
right?

00:24:31.594 --> 00:24:35.708
Okay, the statistical crisis in science.

00:24:35.708 --> 00:24:38.136
So in political science,
we've had published papers

00:24:38.136 --> 00:24:40.719
on, well, ovulation and voting.

00:24:41.628 --> 00:24:46.185
Did you know that during a
certain time of the month ...

00:24:46.185 --> 00:24:47.018
Sorry.

00:24:48.113 --> 00:24:52.280
Sophie's making symbols at
me, I was distracted there.

00:24:53.489 --> 00:24:54.806
Do you know that during ...

00:24:54.806 --> 00:24:58.661
(laughs) Do you know that during
certain times of the month,

00:24:58.661 --> 00:25:01.276
women are 20 percentage
points less likely,

00:25:01.276 --> 00:25:03.815
more likely to vote for Barack Obama?

00:25:03.815 --> 00:25:07.403
Actually, the published
research said that married,

00:25:07.403 --> 00:25:09.674
single women were 20
percentage points more likely

00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:11.598
to vote for Barack
Obama, but married women

00:25:11.598 --> 00:25:14.975
were more likely to support Mitt Romney.

00:25:14.975 --> 00:25:17.927
Do you know that men with
fat arms, college students

00:25:17.927 --> 00:25:20.781
with fat arms were more likely to oppose

00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:23.448
economic redistribution?

00:25:23.448 --> 00:25:26.698
It was published in a research journal.

00:25:27.878 --> 00:25:29.836
Do you know that elections are determined

00:25:29.836 --> 00:25:34.180
by college football
games and shark attacks?

00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:36.649
Again, this was all published.

00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:40.816
Now these studies like
these are kind of notorious

00:25:41.978 --> 00:25:45.277
in science now because
they fail to replicate.

00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:48.156
Now I won't say all of those
studies fail to replicate.

00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:49.472
Some of them fail to replicate.

00:25:49.472 --> 00:25:53.911
Others, I'm pretty sure
they wouldn't replicate

00:25:53.911 --> 00:25:56.695
if you were gonna bother to redo them.

00:25:56.695 --> 00:25:59.330
Because the data are basically noise.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:03.639
The data in these studies are
consistent with null effects

00:26:03.639 --> 00:26:06.759
or more to the point, they're
consistent with effects

00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:09.474
that are highly variable, unpredictable

00:26:09.474 --> 00:26:11.525
and context dependent.

00:26:11.525 --> 00:26:14.953
So I want to emphasize that
I'm not going around saying

00:26:14.953 --> 00:26:18.361
that your hormones don't
affect how you vote.

00:26:18.361 --> 00:26:21.305
I have no idea, I'm sure my
hormones affect how I vote.

00:26:21.305 --> 00:26:26.064
I don't think they will
change 20% of people's votes.

00:26:26.064 --> 00:26:28.471
I don't think they're gonna
change 2% of people's votes.

00:26:28.471 --> 00:26:30.968
I have good reason for thinking that.

00:26:30.968 --> 00:26:34.032
I think that the occasional
person might be so pissed off

00:26:34.032 --> 00:26:36.575
that their college
football team loses a game

00:26:36.575 --> 00:26:38.924
that they may vote a different way.

00:26:38.924 --> 00:26:42.507
I don't expect to see a
systematic effect of that size.

00:26:42.507 --> 00:26:45.644
I'm not gonna go around
saying effects are zero,

00:26:45.644 --> 00:26:48.704
but I think effects are highly variable.

00:26:48.704 --> 00:26:52.311
Now I'm gonna get back to
the sort of political point

00:26:52.311 --> 00:26:54.346
of studies like that.

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:58.819
But I want to emphasize that
these problems aren't just,

00:26:58.819 --> 00:27:03.085
like, with joke studies,
like ovulation and voting

00:27:03.085 --> 00:27:05.646
or fat arms or whatever.

00:27:05.646 --> 00:27:08.237
They're also in serious research.

00:27:08.237 --> 00:27:11.305
So for example, there was a study done

00:27:11.305 --> 00:27:15.222
about 25 years ago that
was recently published.

00:27:17.411 --> 00:27:21.158
It was a study on an intervention
for four year old children

00:27:21.158 --> 00:27:24.797
in Jamaica, they had 130
kids and half of the kids

00:27:24.797 --> 00:27:28.835
got a certain educational
intervention with their mothers

00:27:28.835 --> 00:27:30.954
at the age of four and
half of them didn't.

00:27:30.954 --> 00:27:33.011
Now it only got published
recently because they followed

00:27:33.011 --> 00:27:36.818
them up for 20 years and
they recorded their earnings

00:27:36.818 --> 00:27:40.833
once they were grownups and
they found that the kids

00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:44.670
who had the intervention
had 42% higher earnings

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:47.426
than the kids without the intervention.

00:27:47.426 --> 00:27:49.169
Now 42%'s pretty good.

00:27:49.169 --> 00:27:51.184
In fact, not only was it a large number

00:27:51.184 --> 00:27:53.139
but it was statistically significant.

00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:54.917
To be statistically significant,

00:27:54.917 --> 00:27:57.891
you have to be at least two
standard errors away from zero.

00:27:57.891 --> 00:28:00.065
A standard error is a
measure of uncertainty.

00:28:00.065 --> 00:28:02.867
And so the standard error
of this study was about

00:28:02.867 --> 00:28:03.700
20 points.

00:28:05.887 --> 00:28:07.970
So what that means is ...

00:28:12.687 --> 00:28:13.690
What does that mean?

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:17.173
Well, that means that they
couldn't have seen an estimate

00:28:17.173 --> 00:28:20.521
of less than 40% or it wouldn't
have been statistically

00:28:20.521 --> 00:28:23.312
significant and it wouldn't
have been published.

00:28:23.312 --> 00:28:28.297
So here's, if this is zero,
and this is one standard error

00:28:28.297 --> 00:28:32.921
which is 20% effect, any
effect estimate had to be

00:28:32.921 --> 00:28:36.637
at least plus 40 or minus
40 or it wouldn't have been

00:28:36.637 --> 00:28:38.990
published, so when they
said it was not only

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.775
statistically significant,
it was also large,

00:28:41.775 --> 00:28:45.651
it was statistically
significant, it had to be large.

00:28:45.651 --> 00:28:47.568
Now let's just suppose.

00:28:50.572 --> 00:28:53.093
Well, I'll say this study
had some various data issues

00:28:53.093 --> 00:28:55.245
which I'm not going to go into here.

00:28:55.245 --> 00:28:58.437
Some of the kids left Jamaica.

00:28:58.437 --> 00:29:00.185
The kids who left Jamaica
actually had higher earnings

00:29:00.185 --> 00:29:01.810
than the ones who didn't leave Jamaica.

00:29:01.810 --> 00:29:03.925
More kids in the treatment
group left Jamaica

00:29:03.925 --> 00:29:05.414
than in the control group.

00:29:05.414 --> 00:29:07.839
There were different
missing data, that's okay.

00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:08.835
That always happens.

00:29:08.835 --> 00:29:09.838
Let me ask you this.

00:29:09.838 --> 00:29:13.369
What if the true effect was 5%?

00:29:13.369 --> 00:29:14.385
That would be pretty good.

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:16.106
If you could do an
intervention for four year olds

00:29:16.106 --> 00:29:18.705
and then 20 years later,
their incomes are 5% higher,

00:29:18.705 --> 00:29:19.720
that would be great.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.105
Well, if the estimate were 5%,
then the published estimate

00:29:23.105 --> 00:29:26.378
from this study has to be
at least eight times larger

00:29:26.378 --> 00:29:27.668
than the true effect.

00:29:27.668 --> 00:29:31.186
Well, then you might
say, well eight times,

00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:32.599
that's kind of too bad,
but at least they got

00:29:32.599 --> 00:29:34.673
the direction right, but
I don't know that they got

00:29:34.673 --> 00:29:36.053
the direction right.

00:29:36.053 --> 00:29:38.543
What if the true effect was minus 5%?

00:29:38.543 --> 00:29:39.799
Well, that's silly, how could it hurt

00:29:39.799 --> 00:29:41.189
to do an intervention?

00:29:41.189 --> 00:29:42.317
Well, you can imagine.

00:29:42.317 --> 00:29:45.736
They thought, you know,
well, we're all set.

00:29:45.736 --> 00:29:47.470
We don't need to do X, Y,
and Z 'cause we're getting

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:48.581
the intervention, I don't know.

00:29:48.581 --> 00:29:52.175
Maybe it hurts, because after
all, if they spent an hour

00:29:52.175 --> 00:29:54.193
a week or two hours a week doing this,

00:29:54.193 --> 00:29:56.184
maybe they were doing that
instead of doing something

00:29:56.184 --> 00:29:59.848
more useful, right, with their time.

00:29:59.848 --> 00:30:01.941
Opportunity cost, right,
we've heard about that.

00:30:01.941 --> 00:30:05.491
What if the true effect were minus 5%?

00:30:05.491 --> 00:30:07.153
Well, the estimated effect
will still have to be at least

00:30:07.153 --> 00:30:11.508
40%, so it could be too
high by a factor of eight

00:30:11.508 --> 00:30:13.833
in the wrong direction, even.

00:30:13.833 --> 00:30:17.770
Now we call this the
statistical significance filter.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:21.427
It leads to systematic
overestimates of effect sizes.

00:30:21.427 --> 00:30:24.115
It's one of these things
that everybody knows

00:30:24.115 --> 00:30:26.138
and people don't know,
so they call these things

00:30:26.138 --> 00:30:28.587
unbiased estimates, even
though they can be eight times

00:30:28.587 --> 00:30:32.799
higher than the true effect,
but it's a little bit

00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:37.470
worse than this because
there's a feedback loop.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:38.980
And the feedback loop goes as follows.

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:40.950
I'm designing a new study.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:43.617
So how large should my study be?

00:30:44.992 --> 00:30:47.231
So I have to have a sense of
how large could the effect be,

00:30:47.231 --> 00:30:49.794
so I look in the literature
and the literature says,

00:30:49.794 --> 00:30:52.545
oh, this treatment has an effect of 40%.

00:30:52.545 --> 00:30:54.407
Oh, this is a pretty big effect.

00:30:54.407 --> 00:30:55.412
I guess if my study is this big,

00:30:55.412 --> 00:30:57.877
I'm very likely, I have a high power,

00:30:57.877 --> 00:30:59.888
I'm very likely to discover
something in the future.

00:30:59.888 --> 00:31:02.393
So then someone designs their new study

00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:04.685
being completely sure that their new study

00:31:04.685 --> 00:31:06.434
is almost definitely gonna succeed.

00:31:06.434 --> 00:31:10.168
Because they think they're
looking for this big effect.

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:13.001
Then they do the new study and ...

00:31:14.233 --> 00:31:16.350
The data look kind of noisy
and they manage to find

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:18.108
something statistically significant,

00:31:18.108 --> 00:31:19.913
but of course they do,
because they knew ahead

00:31:19.913 --> 00:31:21.649
of time the study was gonna work, right,

00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:24.533
so you get into this loop.

00:31:24.533 --> 00:31:28.767
The winner's curse, they
say in economics, right?

00:31:28.767 --> 00:31:32.717
You win the auction and
by winning, you lose.

00:31:32.717 --> 00:31:35.668
Well, I want to write a paper sometime

00:31:35.668 --> 00:31:39.361
called death of a
paradigm and in this case

00:31:39.361 --> 00:31:42.035
the paradigm is a
statistical paradigm in which

00:31:42.035 --> 00:31:46.421
you come up with an idea, you
study it, you do an experiment

00:31:46.421 --> 00:31:49.322
you test it, you find out it's
statistically significant,

00:31:49.322 --> 00:31:52.096
and you publish the result
and that affects policy

00:31:52.096 --> 00:31:56.065
and the trouble is, there are
not so many low hanging fruit

00:31:56.065 --> 00:31:59.071
around anymore, they've
been plucked already.

00:31:59.071 --> 00:32:01.899
Indeed, in medical research,
it's considered unethical

00:32:01.899 --> 00:32:05.317
to estimate large effects,
usually, because in medical

00:32:05.317 --> 00:32:07.531
research you're supposed to
compare to the best available

00:32:07.531 --> 00:32:10.460
alternative, the only
reason they could compare

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:12.542
stents to placebo
because they were pretty,

00:32:12.542 --> 00:32:15.797
they had a sense that maybe stents weren't

00:32:15.797 --> 00:32:17.575
particularly effective.

00:32:17.575 --> 00:32:20.816
So we're actually always
studying small effects.

00:32:20.816 --> 00:32:23.308
We're studying small
effects but we're using

00:32:23.308 --> 00:32:26.915
statistical approach
that's designed to study

00:32:26.915 --> 00:32:29.832
large effects and it's not working.

00:32:31.205 --> 00:32:34.217
Now at this point, I
think the natural attitude

00:32:34.217 --> 00:32:36.353
of the statistician would be to say,

00:32:36.353 --> 00:32:40.440
well, obviously people should
take more statistics classes.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.716
Maybe statistics should be a requirement

00:32:42.716 --> 00:32:44.389
for more undergraduate majors.

00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:46.598
Maybe we need more faculty lines.

00:32:46.598 --> 00:32:48.497
Here I have the president
of the university here.

00:32:48.497 --> 00:32:50.915
I can really make the case for that.

00:32:50.915 --> 00:32:53.665
Actually, though I think that ...

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:58.890
Scientists have been
listening to us all too well.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.107
They've been listening to our message

00:33:01.107 --> 00:33:04.635
and our message is that
you can use statistics

00:33:04.635 --> 00:33:08.815
to extract signal from noise,
that you can win repeatedly.

00:33:08.815 --> 00:33:11.916
Even my own statistics
books have this flavor.

00:33:11.916 --> 00:33:14.937
Which is here are some
problems, here are some data,

00:33:14.937 --> 00:33:18.548
here's the result, I have
a 95% confidence interval.

00:33:18.548 --> 00:33:20.910
It excludes zero, I've learned something.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:22.908
Another win for statistics.

00:33:22.908 --> 00:33:25.115
Over and over again.

00:33:25.115 --> 00:33:26.199
That's the message that we sell.

00:33:26.199 --> 00:33:29.949
We are telling people
what they want to hear.

00:33:32.345 --> 00:33:35.371
I had this article with a
colleague, called the triple A

00:33:35.371 --> 00:33:38.926
trench of subprime science
and the idea was that

00:33:38.926 --> 00:33:41.745
just as in with the
triple A mortgage bonds,

00:33:41.745 --> 00:33:44.572
that there's all these data
and the researchers scoop out

00:33:44.572 --> 00:33:48.395
the statistically significant
results that flowed up

00:33:48.395 --> 00:33:50.475
and then they collect them
and they put them together

00:33:50.475 --> 00:33:53.285
into statistically
significant meta analyses

00:33:53.285 --> 00:33:56.053
and it's all just kind of froth

00:33:56.053 --> 00:34:00.300
but they get things that
are, like, the triple A bond

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:03.849
which is P equals .0005, and
then that's supposed to be

00:34:03.849 --> 00:34:08.016
really valuable, but it's really
not necessarily so valuable

00:34:09.631 --> 00:34:14.110
Now for decades, for nearly
a century, statisticians

00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.531
have been patiently
training the world, people,

00:34:17.531 --> 00:34:22.479
on how we can extract signal
from noise, like polling, right

00:34:22.479 --> 00:34:26.870
Hundreds of millions of
voters and yet a survey

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:29.557
of 1500 people can tell you about them.

00:34:29.557 --> 00:34:32.134
It's counterintuitive, right,

00:34:32.134 --> 00:34:34.969
that you can learn about the
effectiveness of a treatment

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:37.683
from a randomized experiment on 20 people.

00:34:37.683 --> 00:34:41.540
Yes, under controlled
conditions this works.

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:43.780
Casinos really do make money.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.137
The theorems are not false.

00:34:46.137 --> 00:34:46.970
But.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.500
The theorems are only as
good as their assumptions.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.061
How would it work if you ran a casino

00:34:53.061 --> 00:34:55.940
and the probabilities on the dice varied

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.265
based on whether the dice were hot or cold

00:34:57.265 --> 00:35:00.349
or who was throwing the
dice or whether the person,

00:35:00.349 --> 00:35:05.178
whether the person sitting
next to the dice thrower

00:35:05.178 --> 00:35:08.218
was making a face at the
person throwing the dice

00:35:08.218 --> 00:35:10.556
or whether people knew
that they were supposed

00:35:10.556 --> 00:35:12.269
to get high numbers or low numbers,

00:35:12.269 --> 00:35:15.991
if there were any other
information leakage?

00:35:15.991 --> 00:35:17.972
All of a sudden, your
casino might make money,

00:35:17.972 --> 00:35:20.346
it might lose money, but the
modeling would have to be

00:35:20.346 --> 00:35:24.513
a lot more difficult, so I
think we have to recognize

00:35:25.507 --> 00:35:30.208
that we, statisticians, have
been selling, we've been

00:35:30.208 --> 00:35:32.797
selling statistics as a form
of uncertainty laundering

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:35.478
and maybe we shouldn't be doing that.

00:35:35.478 --> 00:35:37.061
So what then to do?

00:35:38.654 --> 00:35:40.978
Well, remember the lesson
from the birthday problem

00:35:40.978 --> 00:35:43.387
which is when the problem gets too large,

00:35:43.387 --> 00:35:45.978
embed it in a larger problem,
when it becomes too difficult,

00:35:45.978 --> 00:35:47.748
embed it in a larger problem.

00:35:47.748 --> 00:35:49.936
So here's an example from
one of our collaborative

00:35:49.936 --> 00:35:51.317
research projects.

00:35:51.317 --> 00:35:53.961
This was a survey that I
did with some colleagues

00:35:53.961 --> 00:35:58.128
at Microsoft research using
the X-Box video game platform

00:35:59.429 --> 00:36:04.050
and this was done in September
and October and November

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:07.967
of 2012, you had the
ability to click and vote.

00:36:10.252 --> 00:36:12.835
And 300 thousand people did so.

00:36:14.863 --> 00:36:17.050
Here were the data.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.752
You can see, from the
graph that in September

00:36:19.752 --> 00:36:22.315
Obama and Romney were very close.

00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:25.890
The number of people with
no opinion went down,

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.441
Romney took an early lead and kept going

00:36:29.441 --> 00:36:32.562
and at the end we ended
up with President Romney

00:36:32.562 --> 00:36:35.882
and I'm sure that we can all
agree that that wouldn't be

00:36:35.882 --> 00:36:37.940
the worst possible outcome.

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:41.506
(audience laughs)

00:36:41.506 --> 00:36:43.576
Well, that's not what happened, though.

00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:44.581
Something went wrong.

00:36:44.581 --> 00:36:47.308
It's almost as if people
who play the X-Box aren't

00:36:47.308 --> 00:36:49.246
a representative sample of voters.

00:36:49.246 --> 00:36:51.747
(audience laughs)

00:36:51.747 --> 00:36:54.765
We can compare, they
actually fit with ethnicity

00:36:54.765 --> 00:36:58.848
pretty well, X-Box players
are more young people,

00:36:59.909 --> 00:37:04.882
play the X-Box, and there
are some other differences.

00:37:04.882 --> 00:37:09.049
X-Box players are slightly more
Republican, less Democratic

00:37:09.968 --> 00:37:13.846
which is why Mitt Romney was
winning among the X-Box players

00:37:13.846 --> 00:37:17.267
so well, it turns out, I don't
want to spend too much time

00:37:17.267 --> 00:37:19.102
on the example, but
I'll tell you one thing

00:37:19.102 --> 00:37:21.979
that although the data are not so great,

00:37:21.979 --> 00:37:24.699
not representative, we can
adjust them and learn a lot

00:37:24.699 --> 00:37:28.595
and one reason is because
whether you play the X-Box,

00:37:28.595 --> 00:37:32.500
you're not selecting on
people's political attitudes.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.046
I wouldn't use an X-Box
survey to answer questions

00:37:34.046 --> 00:37:37.381
like what video game platform
do you play, for example,

00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:41.435
and I wouldn't use a survey
on Fox News to estimate

00:37:41.435 --> 00:37:45.277
people's political attitudes,
but this kind of worked.

00:37:45.277 --> 00:37:49.444
I show this slide only
because like why are we doing

00:37:50.869 --> 00:37:53.365
polling on the X-Box,
well, let's be honest,

00:37:53.365 --> 00:37:55.247
it was a publicity stunt for Microsoft,

00:37:55.247 --> 00:37:59.905
but it's not like conventional
polling is so great.

00:37:59.905 --> 00:38:01.298
Conventional polling's falling apart.

00:38:01.298 --> 00:38:04.186
Non response rates are over 90%.

00:38:04.186 --> 00:38:06.682
As if current trends
continue, non response rates

00:38:06.682 --> 00:38:08.117
will soon be in the hundreds.

00:38:08.117 --> 00:38:09.923
(audience laughs)

00:38:09.923 --> 00:38:13.269
So it's, like, no, you
can't stand still, right?

00:38:13.269 --> 00:38:17.607
Okay, so we adjusted the
X-Box poll for demographics.

00:38:17.607 --> 00:38:20.827
We shifted based on their
ethnicity and their age

00:38:20.827 --> 00:38:24.223
and so forth and then you
get this estimate over time

00:38:24.223 --> 00:38:26.309
where Obama was ahead,
then Romney was ahead

00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:28.817
and then Obama won, this is
very close to what you would

00:38:28.817 --> 00:38:31.153
get from something like pollster.com

00:38:31.153 --> 00:38:33.896
although it's kind of
impressive because each dot

00:38:33.896 --> 00:38:36.805
is data from a separate day.

00:38:36.805 --> 00:38:38.458
This is not a running average.

00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:41.875
It's actually the data, it's pretty cool.

00:38:43.772 --> 00:38:45.935
We could do better, though,

00:38:45.935 --> 00:38:49.385
because in this poll we also asked people,

00:38:49.385 --> 00:38:52.908
are they a Democrat, a
Republican, or an Independent,

00:38:52.908 --> 00:38:54.951
and we asked how they voted
in the previous election

00:38:54.951 --> 00:38:57.772
and we can also adjust for
that because the poll had

00:38:57.772 --> 00:38:59.055
too many Republicans.

00:38:59.055 --> 00:39:01.969
And after you do that,
you get the dark line here

00:39:01.969 --> 00:39:05.652
so the light line is what
you got from just adjusting

00:39:05.652 --> 00:39:07.976
for demographics, so by
adjusting for partisanship,

00:39:07.976 --> 00:39:11.357
that actually gets rid of more
than half of the variation

00:39:11.357 --> 00:39:12.190
over time.

00:39:14.217 --> 00:39:17.051
What this tells us, I
mean, we went through a lot

00:39:17.051 --> 00:39:19.666
to try to interpret this, but
I think what this tells us

00:39:19.666 --> 00:39:23.180
is that most of the variation in the polls

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.521
is due to differential non response,

00:39:25.521 --> 00:39:28.938
so when your candidate is not doing well,

00:39:29.915 --> 00:39:33.232
you don't really want
to respond to the poll

00:39:33.232 --> 00:39:37.862
and so your candidate does
even less well in the poll,

00:39:37.862 --> 00:39:39.700
and when your candidate's doing well,

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.864
they're like yeah, I'll
play the polling game,

00:39:41.864 --> 00:39:44.356
this is fun, yeah, how's my guy doing?

00:39:44.356 --> 00:39:47.504
Let's check, let's check again, let's see,

00:39:47.504 --> 00:39:49.243
is my guy still ahead,
this is great, this is fun.

00:39:49.243 --> 00:39:53.410
And so this exaggerates
swings in true public opinion.

00:39:55.921 --> 00:39:59.821
Now what's going on here
is that 60% of people vote

00:39:59.821 --> 00:40:03.592
but less than 10% of people
participate in polls.

00:40:03.592 --> 00:40:05.592
So answering a survey is optional.

00:40:05.592 --> 00:40:09.759
And whether you answer a survey
depends a lot on your mood.

00:40:11.036 --> 00:40:13.460
So this is kind of an amazing example

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:17.004
because not only did we do
better than conventional polls

00:40:17.004 --> 00:40:18.532
but we learned something new

00:40:18.532 --> 00:40:20.297
and it all kind of fits together.

00:40:20.297 --> 00:40:22.587
And again, as with the birthday example,

00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:24.999
it fits together 'cause
we're looking at more things.

00:40:24.999 --> 00:40:27.565
If I had just studied one
day and tried to adjust it

00:40:27.565 --> 00:40:30.182
perfectly, I wouldn't have learned.

00:40:30.182 --> 00:40:33.099
We wouldn't have learned from that.

00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:38.934
This was just from 2016.

00:40:39.778 --> 00:40:41.854
This was a graph where
each dot was a poll.

00:40:41.854 --> 00:40:44.312
Alan Abramowitz, a political
scientist, sent this to me.

00:40:44.312 --> 00:40:48.304
Each dot is a poll, and he's
plotting the percent support,

00:40:48.304 --> 00:40:52.471
the margin in favor of
Hillary Clinton in the poll

00:40:53.659 --> 00:40:56.692
versus the percent of
people who said that they

00:40:56.692 --> 00:40:58.847
were Democrats in the
survey, and it's, like,

00:40:58.847 --> 00:41:00.525
look at this perfect correlation.

00:41:00.525 --> 00:41:04.692
On surveys with more
Democrats, Hillary did better,

00:41:05.765 --> 00:41:07.765
so it's still happening.

00:41:08.947 --> 00:41:11.022
Okay, now where does this lead us?

00:41:11.022 --> 00:41:13.939
We're in a world of big data, okay?

00:41:16.242 --> 00:41:18.141
Big data are typically
convenience samples,

00:41:18.141 --> 00:41:21.370
not random samples, they're
observational comparisons,

00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:23.236
not controlled experiments.

00:41:23.236 --> 00:41:24.780
They're available data,
they're not measurements

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:26.984
designed for a particular study.

00:41:26.984 --> 00:41:31.151
So as a result, when analyzing
big data like the X-box poll

00:41:32.801 --> 00:41:37.300
or modern public health
data, we need to adjust,

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.602
we need to extrapolate
from sample to population.

00:41:39.602 --> 00:41:42.546
We need to match the treatment
group to the control group

00:41:42.546 --> 00:41:44.589
'cause it's not a randomized experiment.

00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:46.422
We need to generalize from observations

00:41:46.422 --> 00:41:49.612
to underlying constructs of interest.

00:41:49.612 --> 00:41:52.166
The big data need big models.

00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:54.398
Nowadays I spend a lot of
time with my colleagues,

00:41:54.398 --> 00:41:57.407
some of whom are in this
room, working on Stan,

00:41:57.407 --> 00:42:01.233
which is our computer program
that fits Bayesian models.

00:42:01.233 --> 00:42:04.189
It's named after Stanislav
Ulom, who was a 20th century

00:42:04.189 --> 00:42:06.330
physicist who with his
colleagues developed

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:09.397
the so called Monte Carlo
method for solving math problems

00:42:09.397 --> 00:42:11.980
using random simulation and ...

00:42:13.589 --> 00:42:15.040
It's like we have this
big computer program

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.790
that fits big models.

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.627
The most important aspect
of a statistical method

00:42:20.627 --> 00:42:24.627
is not what it does with the
data but what data it uses

00:42:24.627 --> 00:42:26.983
and so the important part of a big model

00:42:26.983 --> 00:42:30.021
is that it's big enough to
allow you to put the data in.

00:42:30.021 --> 00:42:34.104
This afternoon, my department
chair Richard Davis

00:42:35.445 --> 00:42:37.918
came by, he said, you're giving this talk.

00:42:37.918 --> 00:42:42.036
He said, don't forget to plug statistics.

00:42:42.036 --> 00:42:43.994
And say how important.

00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:46.411
So I was thinking about that.

00:42:48.018 --> 00:42:50.135
So math, I'll talk about
math, but, like, mathematics

00:42:50.135 --> 00:42:52.802
plays three roles in this story.

00:42:54.821 --> 00:42:57.254
The first is it's a
substitute for replication.

00:42:57.254 --> 00:43:00.117
It's a substitute for data.

00:43:00.117 --> 00:43:02.834
Someone does a study and I
can say, looking at the math,

00:43:02.834 --> 00:43:06.431
don't bother replicating this
study, it's not gonna work,

00:43:06.431 --> 00:43:09.078
it's all noise, I can see.

00:43:09.078 --> 00:43:11.398
You know, your effect
is no more than this big

00:43:11.398 --> 00:43:13.041
and your standard error is this big,

00:43:13.041 --> 00:43:16.421
so math is a substitute for data.

00:43:16.421 --> 00:43:20.058
That's probably its most
important role in statistics.

00:43:20.058 --> 00:43:24.065
Second, we use mathematical
models for variation.

00:43:24.065 --> 00:43:26.456
How we did stuff like
that birthday example

00:43:26.456 --> 00:43:29.364
or the X-box, we have models.

00:43:29.364 --> 00:43:32.283
You can't just stare at
the data and do that.

00:43:32.283 --> 00:43:35.623
Finally, we need a lot of math
to make the computing work.

00:43:35.623 --> 00:43:38.045
So to actually fit the
models we want to fit

00:43:38.045 --> 00:43:40.295
requires a lot of research.

00:43:41.371 --> 00:43:45.538
There's two things I wanted
to mention before closing

00:43:46.608 --> 00:43:50.962
and one is the folk theorem
of statistical computing

00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:53.971
which is that when you have a
problem with your computation

00:43:53.971 --> 00:43:57.563
typically there's a
problem with your model.

00:43:57.563 --> 00:43:59.590
When your computer is
running slow, there's often

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.571
something that went
wrong, that you did wrong.

00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:04.738
And now again, like, it's,

00:44:05.971 --> 00:44:08.462
I'm sort of mentioning
that like a little bit of

00:44:08.462 --> 00:44:11.258
what it feels like to do what we do.

00:44:11.258 --> 00:44:15.091
The other thing that I
wanted to say was that,

00:44:15.949 --> 00:44:20.032
about these political
studies, claims that voters

00:44:21.431 --> 00:44:25.063
are affected by little
things, strange things like

00:44:25.063 --> 00:44:27.605
sporting events and shark attacks,

00:44:27.605 --> 00:44:30.799
a claim that voters are
shallow is very popular

00:44:30.799 --> 00:44:32.738
on the left and on the right.

00:44:32.738 --> 00:44:35.422
And on the left you can say,
well, voters are so shallow,

00:44:35.422 --> 00:44:37.825
the system is a sham.

00:44:37.825 --> 00:44:42.196
On the right, it can be
used to discredit democracy

00:44:42.196 --> 00:44:43.812
and say, well, gee, if
we don't trust voters,

00:44:43.812 --> 00:44:46.342
we should diminish the political sphere,

00:44:46.342 --> 00:44:50.046
get rid of taxes, 'cause
we don't trust democracy.

00:44:50.046 --> 00:44:51.568
And I don't think that's right.

00:44:51.568 --> 00:44:54.871
And I say that kind of as a statistician.

00:44:54.871 --> 00:44:56.858
I think a lot of these
claims that have been made

00:44:56.858 --> 00:45:00.191
have been made based on very noisy data.

00:45:01.917 --> 00:45:04.319
People have set themselves
up to find effects

00:45:04.319 --> 00:45:07.084
so they look to find
something and they find it

00:45:07.084 --> 00:45:11.095
and in that world, every
nudge has a large effect.

00:45:11.095 --> 00:45:14.269
And that does not actually
seem to describe the world

00:45:14.269 --> 00:45:16.217
as I see it, and that X-box example showed

00:45:16.217 --> 00:45:19.341
how all these swings
that you see in raw data,

00:45:19.341 --> 00:45:21.474
when you look at them
carefully, there's actually

00:45:21.474 --> 00:45:23.224
a lot more stability.

00:45:25.087 --> 00:45:28.337
So in summary, I want to close with ...

00:45:31.752 --> 00:45:34.919
I want to close with these words here.

00:45:36.679 --> 00:45:39.512
(audience laughs)

00:45:47.331 --> 00:45:48.345
That's all.

00:45:48.345 --> 00:45:51.095
(audience claps)

00:45:59.780 --> 00:46:01.689
- Thank you Andrew for a brilliant talk

00:46:01.689 --> 00:46:05.056
and an entertaining one as well.

00:46:05.056 --> 00:46:07.766
The floor is open to questions.

00:46:07.766 --> 00:46:08.768
There are microphones in the aisles.

00:46:08.768 --> 00:46:10.816
If you would step there
and just identify yourself

00:46:10.816 --> 00:46:13.692
and then shoot your question to Andrew

00:46:13.692 --> 00:46:14.995
and I should say before we begin

00:46:14.995 --> 00:46:18.168
that there is a reception
in Andrew Gelman's honor

00:46:18.168 --> 00:46:20.012
that will be taking
place in the faculty room

00:46:20.012 --> 00:46:21.830
which is just behind the stage here

00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:23.830
and you are all invited.

00:46:32.711 --> 00:46:34.007
- Hello, thank you.

00:46:34.007 --> 00:46:36.924
My name's Glen Chadler, I'm a
biomedical engineering student

00:46:36.924 --> 00:46:38.903
and I was very interested
in what you said about

00:46:38.903 --> 00:46:41.929
the stent and placebo study.

00:46:41.929 --> 00:46:44.138
And how you reconstructed
the data to obtain

00:46:44.138 --> 00:46:46.288
a different P value from the results

00:46:46.288 --> 00:46:48.987
and so my question is,
since so much of medical

00:46:48.987 --> 00:46:51.954
research is based on this
idea of drug versus placebo

00:46:51.954 --> 00:46:54.478
and before and after
effects, why is there is not

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:57.202
a standard for medical
research so that given

00:46:57.202 --> 00:46:59.522
a certain set of data, all researchers

00:46:59.522 --> 00:47:02.823
would obtain the same P value?

00:47:02.823 --> 00:47:04.853
- I don't think that P
value is so important,

00:47:04.853 --> 00:47:07.604
so I think that we should be moving toward

00:47:07.604 --> 00:47:10.177
a framework of continuous
quality improvement

00:47:10.177 --> 00:47:13.932
which is an idea that's
been around in industry

00:47:13.932 --> 00:47:17.147
since the 1920s, has been
very popular in the Japanese

00:47:17.147 --> 00:47:19.730
auto industry for many decades.

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:23.240
I think the model, medical research,

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.415
I think the model should
not be we have this isolated

00:47:26.415 --> 00:47:28.528
thing which works.

00:47:28.528 --> 00:47:29.941
I think we should be
talking about continuing

00:47:29.941 --> 00:47:32.608
process improvement in which ...

00:47:34.645 --> 00:47:38.562
I believe that the doctors
and patients who are

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:42.772
trying out these methods
should be more active

00:47:42.772 --> 00:47:45.855
participants and so the point is that

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:49.431
a stent is not an abstract thing.

00:47:49.431 --> 00:47:51.582
People are doing it for a reason

00:47:51.582 --> 00:47:54.917
and I think that there
should be in the ideal world

00:47:54.917 --> 00:47:57.449
more experimentation and data collection

00:47:57.449 --> 00:47:59.871
at the level of the individual patient,

00:47:59.871 --> 00:48:02.621
moving away from this sort of ...

00:48:03.517 --> 00:48:06.387
You know, Fordian idea of
there being a single thing

00:48:06.387 --> 00:48:09.252
that's done for everybody.

00:48:09.252 --> 00:48:12.364
In that case, the P value
is kind of irrelevant.

00:48:12.364 --> 00:48:13.947
- [Glen] Thank you.

00:48:15.081 --> 00:48:16.392
- Dr. Gelman, thank you so
much for your wonderful talk.

00:48:16.392 --> 00:48:18.942
I'm a medical student and
as someone transitioning

00:48:18.942 --> 00:48:21.945
to residency next year, stent
problem was well received.

00:48:21.945 --> 00:48:25.873
I wanted to ask you,
how do we fix polling?

00:48:25.873 --> 00:48:28.037
Obviously a tough question,
but I wanted to get

00:48:28.037 --> 00:48:29.253
your thoughts on it.

00:48:29.253 --> 00:48:31.039
There's a well known
event that happened about

00:48:31.039 --> 00:48:32.511
a year ago where we got things wrong

00:48:32.511 --> 00:48:35.981
and Virginia was I think
another interesting example

00:48:35.981 --> 00:48:38.064
where the polls were off.

00:48:39.096 --> 00:48:40.939
- How do we fix polling?

00:48:40.939 --> 00:48:44.059
Well, you wouldn't want
polling to be too good, right?

00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:46.276
I mean, in the sense that
voters do get to change

00:48:46.276 --> 00:48:49.342
their mind before the election.

00:48:49.342 --> 00:48:53.441
The 2016 national polls were pretty good.

00:48:53.441 --> 00:48:56.666
There were certain state
polls that didn't do so well

00:48:56.666 --> 00:48:59.030
because they didn't do enough adjustment.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:01.659
They weren't all adjusting
for people living,

00:49:01.659 --> 00:49:04.077
like, for education or urban/rural.

00:49:04.077 --> 00:49:05.511
It's a funny thing about state polls.

00:49:05.511 --> 00:49:07.511
That a state poll is ...

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:12.370
As expensive as a national
poll 'cause surveying

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:15.677
1500 people just costs the same amount.

00:49:15.677 --> 00:49:17.051
But the people who do state polls,

00:49:17.051 --> 00:49:20.389
there's a lot less money
to be made in a state poll

00:49:20.389 --> 00:49:22.351
'cause the market is
smaller, so what do I think

00:49:22.351 --> 00:49:23.385
is a solution?

00:49:23.385 --> 00:49:25.622
I think the solution is
to use the national polls

00:49:25.622 --> 00:49:29.200
and use partial pooling,
Mr. P, to estimate

00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:33.666
state level opinion
from the national polls.

00:49:33.666 --> 00:49:36.427
- Over here.
- Hi, my name is Amir,

00:49:36.427 --> 00:49:38.735
really enjoyed your talk.

00:49:38.735 --> 00:49:41.234
A very related question, but
near the end of your talk

00:49:41.234 --> 00:49:44.683
you mentioned about
voluntary response bias

00:49:44.683 --> 00:49:47.248
and especially things
with like an X-box poll

00:49:47.248 --> 00:49:50.399
and on campus, you know, there
are these polls all the time.

00:49:50.399 --> 00:49:53.841
When someone is designing
these types of polls

00:49:53.841 --> 00:49:56.414
or surveys, what should they have in mind

00:49:56.414 --> 00:49:59.324
from the outset to try
to eliminate that bias

00:49:59.324 --> 00:50:02.366
before they have to take into
account all those variables?

00:50:02.366 --> 00:50:04.315
- I think the number one
thing is you should think of

00:50:04.315 --> 00:50:06.677
the people who respond to your polls

00:50:06.677 --> 00:50:08.687
as your research partners.

00:50:08.687 --> 00:50:11.580
Don't think of them as, like, you know,

00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:14.324
like animals that you're measuring.

00:50:14.324 --> 00:50:17.274
Think of them as, like, participants,

00:50:17.274 --> 00:50:19.359
so figure out, like, what you want to know

00:50:19.359 --> 00:50:21.047
from them and how you can ask it

00:50:21.047 --> 00:50:23.042
and how they can help because conditions

00:50:23.042 --> 00:50:25.274
when someone's responding to
a poll in the first place,

00:50:25.274 --> 00:50:27.502
they probably want to help you.

00:50:27.502 --> 00:50:29.555
One reason why people, like, I mean,

00:50:29.555 --> 00:50:31.544
yeah, so I think you
want to take advantage of

00:50:31.544 --> 00:50:34.064
that resource and that's
tended to be wasted.

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:36.697
Traditionally what people
do is they do a poll

00:50:36.697 --> 00:50:38.369
and they're, like, hey,
we tricked somebody

00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:40.519
into answering our survey,
now let's bombard them

00:50:40.519 --> 00:50:42.550
with a bunch of questions.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:45.633
But I think especially
in a particular area,

00:50:45.633 --> 00:50:47.774
like, not in an election
poll but something

00:50:47.774 --> 00:50:49.959
you're personally working
on, you can get a lot

00:50:49.959 --> 00:50:54.126
out of showings some respect
for your survey participants.

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:56.737
- [Man] Thank you.

00:50:56.737 --> 00:51:00.404
- Hi, professor, so you
linked in your blog.

00:51:01.616 --> 00:51:04.199
A paper that questioned the ...

00:51:07.448 --> 00:51:09.673
Validity of confidence
intervals and standard errors

00:51:09.673 --> 00:51:14.173
and in that paper they
pointedly say that we shouldn't

00:51:14.173 --> 00:51:17.513
try to interpret standard
errors because that's, like,

00:51:17.513 --> 00:51:19.334
to draw inference from
statistics because that's

00:51:19.334 --> 00:51:22.361
essentially applying a Bayesian framework,

00:51:22.361 --> 00:51:23.685
so without getting too technical,

00:51:23.685 --> 00:51:28.013
when we read papers, should we be assuming

00:51:28.013 --> 00:51:30.132
that the standard errors are close enough

00:51:30.132 --> 00:51:33.427
to what the Bayesian alternative would be,

00:51:33.427 --> 00:51:38.255
or should we take these
with more grains of salt?

00:51:38.255 --> 00:51:40.258
- Well, I usually would
interpret the results

00:51:40.258 --> 00:51:44.878
as inferences based on certain
conventional assumptions.

00:51:44.878 --> 00:51:47.780
So the conventional
assumption, like, if we take

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:51.609
the Jamaica study, the early
childhood intervention,

00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:54.007
the conventional assumption
is the affect could be

00:51:54.007 --> 00:51:56.790
anywhere from, like, minus
infinity to plus infinity

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.629
and if it could be anywhere in that range,

00:51:59.629 --> 00:52:01.138
this is what you can learn.

00:52:01.138 --> 00:52:03.148
If you then say, well,
actually, realistically

00:52:03.148 --> 00:52:05.725
I think the effect is
probably less than 10%,

00:52:05.725 --> 00:52:08.737
then that will change the interpretation

00:52:08.737 --> 00:52:10.775
of these statements, so in some sense

00:52:10.775 --> 00:52:12.713
the problem is not with
the standard error,

00:52:12.713 --> 00:52:15.330
it's what people do
with the standard error.

00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:17.330
- [Man] Okay, thank you.

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:20.240
- Hi, my name is Charles,
I'm a PhD student

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.756
in the statistics department
and I want to pick up on

00:52:24.756 --> 00:52:27.017
something you said at the
beginning of your talk,

00:52:27.017 --> 00:52:31.818
which was my specialty is
X and there's no such X

00:52:31.818 --> 00:52:35.565
and it seems that in light
of the statistical crisis

00:52:35.565 --> 00:52:37.700
the reaction has been,
well, scientists need

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.450
to learn more statistics,
they need to be more familiar

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:43.310
with the method, and I'm
wondering, well, how much

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:45.420
does it go the other way,
how much do statisticians

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:49.577
need to learn more
science and has there been

00:52:49.577 --> 00:52:52.077
initiatives in that direction?

00:52:53.371 --> 00:52:55.656
- Well, I typically feel
that every statistician

00:52:55.656 --> 00:53:00.166
is an expert in at most
one subject so I really am

00:53:00.166 --> 00:53:03.113
an expert on American politics,
I know something about that,

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:04.977
but, like, everything
else, like toxicology

00:53:04.977 --> 00:53:07.421
or the other things I'm
working on, I'm kind of

00:53:07.421 --> 00:53:09.870
winging it, but, you know,
there aren't that many

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:12.398
statisticians, there's a
lot more of other people.

00:53:12.398 --> 00:53:14.448
So even if, I mean, if every statistician,

00:53:14.448 --> 00:53:17.268
I mean it is good for every
statistician to be an expert

00:53:17.268 --> 00:53:21.435
in some area, but that's
somehow kind of not enough.

00:53:22.269 --> 00:53:25.252
But again, I think the
original sin in statistics

00:53:25.252 --> 00:53:29.496
was this idea that we can
get strong conclusions

00:53:29.496 --> 00:53:32.829
from any data and we have to avoid that,

00:53:34.276 --> 00:53:36.676
so we have to, I mean,
as statisticians, I think

00:53:36.676 --> 00:53:38.906
we have to stop doing that to people

00:53:38.906 --> 00:53:42.073
before worrying about what to do next.

00:53:43.394 --> 00:53:45.522
- Hi, very much thank
you for this last quote

00:53:45.522 --> 00:53:48.674
'cause I think it's
very meditative somehow.

00:53:48.674 --> 00:53:52.885
So I wonder why do we need
to reduce the variation,

00:53:52.885 --> 00:53:54.742
but especially in
statistics, you want to have

00:53:54.742 --> 00:53:57.576
the variation data for
you to reveal relations,

00:53:57.576 --> 00:54:00.743
to show the result relations, but then

00:54:01.810 --> 00:54:05.105
why don't you want the variations, I mean,

00:54:05.105 --> 00:54:07.634
and use that, I think something
that you can apply that

00:54:07.634 --> 00:54:11.786
for your state of mind,
is that, you know ...

00:54:11.786 --> 00:54:14.061
- I think you have to
sort of separate yourself

00:54:14.061 --> 00:54:17.203
from the data, okay, so
data have variations.

00:54:17.203 --> 00:54:18.899
There's variation in the data.

00:54:18.899 --> 00:54:21.259
We do the study on the
stents and we measure

00:54:21.259 --> 00:54:24.275
how long people can exercise
and it's a noisy measure

00:54:24.275 --> 00:54:27.575
but I think that probably
what you really want

00:54:27.575 --> 00:54:29.609
to be doing is getting
better measurements.

00:54:29.609 --> 00:54:33.543
Doing comparisons within
people, like getting multiple

00:54:33.543 --> 00:54:35.921
measurements, like on the
X-box survey, people responded

00:54:35.921 --> 00:54:38.646
multiple times so we could
have information on people

00:54:38.646 --> 00:54:42.313
changing their opinion
and I think a lot of,

00:54:43.895 --> 00:54:46.244
we're often, researchers
are trapped in the data.

00:54:46.244 --> 00:54:48.574
And one thing, this
is, remember I told you

00:54:48.574 --> 00:54:50.201
about this feedback loop
where people overestimate

00:54:50.201 --> 00:54:52.660
the effect size, it gives
them overconfidence,

00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:55.659
then they do the next study,
well, another problem of that

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:59.535
is it's kind of, when it's
too easy to, like, win,

00:54:59.535 --> 00:55:02.698
like that, there's not much
of a motivation to work hard

00:55:02.698 --> 00:55:06.213
and get good data and so like anything,

00:55:06.213 --> 00:55:07.971
you're doing a study,
what's the ultimate effect,

00:55:07.971 --> 00:55:10.459
whether people live or die,
okay, well that's great,

00:55:10.459 --> 00:55:12.997
but a lot of things cause
people to live or die

00:55:12.997 --> 00:55:14.532
so your data are gonna be very noisy.

00:55:14.532 --> 00:55:17.511
You'll probably want to get
some intermediate measurements

00:55:17.511 --> 00:55:18.761
and I think ...

00:55:20.532 --> 00:55:23.407
There's kind of a negative
message and a positive message

00:55:23.407 --> 00:55:25.941
I have and the negative message is that

00:55:25.941 --> 00:55:29.897
it's too, it can be sort of
too easy to fool yourself

00:55:29.897 --> 00:55:34.309
and even worse to fool other
people with noisy data.

00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:38.033
So the idea of the negative
messages, either I don't want

00:55:38.033 --> 00:55:42.436
to do that 'cause I don't
want to do bad science,

00:55:42.436 --> 00:55:44.581
I want to, you know, I want
to discover real things,

00:55:44.581 --> 00:55:47.138
not fake things or,
like, well, I don't want

00:55:47.138 --> 00:55:48.526
to publish stuff like that,
I don't want to do stuff

00:55:48.526 --> 00:55:50.368
like that 'cause in the
future it's gonna get rejected

00:55:50.368 --> 00:55:52.305
by a journal 'cause
it's not pre-registered.

00:55:52.305 --> 00:55:53.350
Whatever it is.

00:55:53.350 --> 00:55:55.655
Then there's a motivation
to stop doing that,

00:55:55.655 --> 00:55:57.436
but then how do you do things right?

00:55:57.436 --> 00:56:00.532
Then you have these examples
where we fit big models

00:56:00.532 --> 00:56:03.659
to the big data but you
shouldn't think of the data

00:56:03.659 --> 00:56:05.496
as just sitting there being noisy.

00:56:05.496 --> 00:56:09.579
It's your job to get non
noisy data or to measure

00:56:10.454 --> 00:56:14.287
what you want to measure
or to try to do that.

00:56:16.053 --> 00:56:18.932
- [Woman] So one more
question do you meditate?

00:56:18.932 --> 00:56:19.933
Do you meditate?

00:56:19.933 --> 00:56:24.801
- Oh, no, this is the
serenity prayer, associated

00:56:24.801 --> 00:56:27.761
with Alcoholics Anonymous
and I just altered it

00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:30.144
slightly because ...
- Because it aligns with.

00:56:30.144 --> 00:56:32.751
- Because it struck me that this idea,

00:56:32.751 --> 00:56:36.074
the variation, I mean, we do ...

00:56:36.074 --> 00:56:38.790
I mean, I think that it just
seemed like it was perfect,

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:42.373
so that's why I did
that slight alteration.

00:56:43.648 --> 00:56:45.909
- Andrew, you are now my model for someone

00:56:45.909 --> 00:56:49.360
who can keep his cool in the
face of recalcitrant technology

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:53.367
Thank you for a brilliant
lecture, thank you for

00:56:53.367 --> 00:56:55.216
an entertaining lecture,
and thank you for dealing

00:56:55.216 --> 00:56:58.691
with the Powerpoint that didn't cooperate.

00:56:58.691 --> 00:56:59.944
- Can I just, before you say
goodbye, I want to tell you

00:56:59.944 --> 00:57:01.971
a story because probably
the best talk I ever gave

00:57:01.971 --> 00:57:05.088
was when I was speaking at MIT

00:57:05.088 --> 00:57:07.646
and I was giving a talk
on statistical graphics

00:57:07.646 --> 00:57:10.835
and the power went out
and it was on graphics

00:57:10.835 --> 00:57:13.032
and so we were just talking.

00:57:13.032 --> 00:57:14.676
We had a whole conversation about graphics

00:57:14.676 --> 00:57:17.666
without using any graphs,
and it was great, you know,

00:57:17.666 --> 00:57:21.558
so you don't need technology,
you can't rely on it.

00:57:21.558 --> 00:57:22.561
- Thank you very much.

00:57:22.561 --> 00:57:23.561
You're all invited to our reception.

00:57:23.561 --> 00:57:26.394
(audience claps)
