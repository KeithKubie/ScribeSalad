00:00:00.572 --> 00:00:03.377
- Let's say we have one ray
over here that starts at point A

00:00:03.377 --> 00:00:05.776
and then goes through point B,

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:08.612
and so we could call this ray--

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.403
let me draw that a little bit straighter,

00:00:11.403 --> 00:00:14.330
we could call this ray AB,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.865
ray AB starts at A or has a vertex at A

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:20.976
and let's say that there's also a ray AC,

00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:24.592
so let's say that C is
sitting right over there

00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:28.554
and then I can draw another
ray, goes through C,

00:00:28.554 --> 00:00:31.339
so this is ray AC.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.716
What's interesting about these two rays

00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:36.443
is that they have the exact same vertex,

00:00:36.443 --> 00:00:39.572
they have the exact same vertex at A.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.541
In general, what we have
when we have two rays

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:46.225
that have the exact same
vertex, you have an angle

00:00:46.225 --> 00:00:49.540
and you're probably already
reasonably familiar with

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.068
the concept of an angle,

00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:53.465
which I believe comes from
the Latin for "corner",

00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:56.005
which makes sense, this looks
like a little bit of a corner

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.666
right over here that we see at point A

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.409
and the geometric definition,

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.177
or the one that you're most likely to see,

00:01:03.177 --> 00:01:07.565
is when two rays share a common vertex

00:01:07.565 --> 00:01:09.292
and that common vertex is actually called

00:01:09.292 --> 00:01:11.141
the vertex of the angle,

00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:14.420
so A is vertex.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.701
Not only is it the vertex
of each of these rays,

00:01:16.701 --> 00:01:18.591
ray AB and ray AC,

00:01:18.591 --> 00:01:23.121
it is also the vertex of the angle.

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:25.582
The next thing I want to think
about is how do we label?

00:01:25.582 --> 00:01:27.635
How do we label an angle?

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:30.521
You might be tempted to
just label it angle A

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:33.959
but I'll show you in a second
why that's not going to be

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:37.232
so clear to someone based on where

00:01:37.232 --> 00:01:39.184
our angle is actually sitting.

00:01:39.184 --> 00:01:40.709
The way that you specify an angle,

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.107
and hopefully this will
make sense in a second,

00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:44.651
is that you say "angle",

00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:46.582
this is the symbol for angle

00:01:46.582 --> 00:01:48.414
and it actually looks
strangely similar to this angle

00:01:48.414 --> 00:01:51.075
right over here, but
this little pointy thing

00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:53.046
or it almost looks like a less-than sign

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.312
but it's not quite, it's flat
on the bottom right over here.

00:01:55.312 --> 00:01:57.100
This is the symbol for angle,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.289
you'd say angle BAC

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:05.682
or you could say angle CAB.

00:02:08.048 --> 00:02:09.979
In either case, they're kind of specifying

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.356
this corner, or sometimes
you could view it as

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:14.733
this opening right over here.

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:16.399
The important thing to
realize is that you have

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:19.487
the vertex in the middle of the letters.

00:02:19.487 --> 00:02:21.336
You might be saying, "Wait,
why go through the trouble

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:22.861
"of listing all three of these letters?

00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:25.686
"Why can't I just call this angle A?"

00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:29.790
To see that, let me show
you another diagram.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.615
Although the geometric
definition of an angle

00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:36.516
involves two rays that
have the same vertex,

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:39.035
in practice, you're
going to see many angles

00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:41.779
that are made up of
lines and line segments.

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:43.122
You could imagine that you could continue

00:02:43.122 --> 00:02:46.047
those line segments on
and on in one direction

00:02:46.047 --> 00:02:47.247
and then they would become rays

00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:50.011
so, in that way, they're
consistent this definition.

00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:52.571
Let's add one line segment
that looks like that,

00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:53.689
let me label some points here,

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.448
so we've already used ABC
so let me call this D and E,

00:02:57.448 --> 00:03:00.916
points D and E, so this
is line segment DE.

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:07.863
Let's say I also have line segment FG,

00:03:08.692 --> 00:03:10.867
FG,

00:03:11.312 --> 00:03:12.435
and let's say this point where

00:03:12.435 --> 00:03:15.483
these two line segments intersect,

00:03:15.483 --> 00:03:18.896
let's called that point, point H.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.209
How could we specify this
angle right over here?

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.708
Can we just that angle H?

00:03:26.708 --> 00:03:28.841
Well, no, because if we just said angle H,

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:31.096
the angle that has a vertex H,

00:03:31.096 --> 00:03:33.168
it could be this angle right over here

00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:35.728
or it could be this angle right over here,

00:03:35.728 --> 00:03:37.094
let me draw it this way,

00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:37.706
you could view it that way

00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:40.104
or it could be that angle over there,

00:03:40.104 --> 00:03:42.095
it could be this angle over here,

00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:43.964
it could be this angle over here

00:03:43.964 --> 00:03:46.849
or it could be that angle over there

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.941
and so the only way to really specify

00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:50.892
which angle you're talking about well

00:03:50.892 --> 00:03:52.496
is to give three letters.

00:03:56.631 --> 00:03:58.420
If you really did want
to talk about that angle

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.626
right over there, you
would call that angle EHG,

00:04:02.626 --> 00:04:06.283
so that is angle EHG

00:04:06.283 --> 00:04:08.294
or you could actually specify that

00:04:08.294 --> 00:04:12.657
or you could call that angle GHE.

00:04:12.657 --> 00:04:15.767
GHE

00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:19.253
If you wanted to specify
this angle right over here,

00:04:19.253 --> 00:04:21.204
if you wanted to specify
that angle right over here,

00:04:21.204 --> 00:04:24.496
the one made up of, if
you imagine that ray

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:26.944
and that ray, if you were to keep on going

00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:31.442
past those points, then you
could call that angle DHG

00:04:31.442 --> 00:04:34.084
angle DHG,

00:04:34.084 --> 00:04:37.155
or angle GHD,

00:04:37.587 --> 00:04:39.843
or angle GHD,

00:04:39.843 --> 00:04:40.859
I think you get the point.

00:04:40.859 --> 00:04:44.922
This angle up here could be FHE or EHF

00:04:44.922 --> 00:04:48.011
and this one could be FHD or DHF

00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:50.631
and when you do it this
way, it's very clear

00:04:50.631 --> 00:04:53.783
what angle you are referring to.

00:04:53.783 --> 00:04:55.957
Now that we have a general
idea of what an angle is

00:04:55.957 --> 00:04:59.472
and how do we denote it with symbols,

00:04:59.472 --> 00:05:01.199
the next thing you might
be curious about is,

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.148
it doesn't look like
all angles are the same,

00:05:04.148 --> 00:05:06.281
it seems like some angles open up

00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:08.313
or are more open than others

00:05:08.313 --> 00:05:10.487
and some are a little bit
more closed in than others

00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:12.417
and that actually is the case.

00:05:12.417 --> 00:05:16.989
For example, let's take two angles here,

00:05:17.537 --> 00:05:20.083
let's say I have one angle
that looks like that,

00:05:20.083 --> 00:05:22.379
so I'll start reusing letters,

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:27.379
so let's say that this is A, B and C,

00:05:27.986 --> 00:05:29.693
I can make these rays,
I could keep on going

00:05:29.693 --> 00:05:31.156
and make them rays if I like

00:05:31.156 --> 00:05:33.127
or I could just keep
them as line segments,

00:05:33.127 --> 00:05:37.373
so right over here I have angle BAC

00:05:37.373 --> 00:05:41.497
and let's say over here, I have angle--

00:05:41.497 --> 00:05:42.737
so let me draw another one,

00:05:42.737 --> 00:05:47.375
and let's say this is angle XYZ

00:05:48.844 --> 00:05:51.891
and, once again, I could
draw them as rays if I like,

00:05:51.891 --> 00:05:53.070
to go on and on and on,

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.540
so it's angle X, Y and Z.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.941
When you just look at these,

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.197
you just eyeball these two angles,

00:06:01.197 --> 00:06:03.818
it looks like this one is more open,

00:06:03.818 --> 00:06:05.747
so this one looks more open

00:06:08.027 --> 00:06:11.278
while this one over
here looks more closed,

00:06:11.278 --> 00:06:12.903
so it looks like it's more closed,

00:06:12.903 --> 00:06:16.825
at least relative to
this one, more closed.

00:06:16.825 --> 00:06:18.978
Maybe when we measure angles,

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:22.493
we should measure it based on
how open or closed they are

00:06:22.493 --> 00:06:24.484
and that actually is the case,

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:26.780
and so without even telling
you how we measure an angle,

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.779
you could say that the
measure of angle XYZ,

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:31.079
the measure of this angle

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:34.290
is greater than the measure
of this angle right over here

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.752
and any convention we
use for measuring angles

00:06:36.752 --> 00:06:38.684
is essentially going to be a measure

00:06:38.684 --> 00:06:42.706
of how open or how closed
an angle actually is

00:06:42.706 --> 00:06:44.272
and I'll take that up in the next video

00:06:44.272 --> 00:06:47.976
where we'll see how to
actually measure an angle.
