00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:06.060
Between 1947 and 1956 a collection of ancient Jewish texts was found in a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.290
series of caves along the Dead Sea. These 972 texts are known as the Dead Sea

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.420
Scrolls. And they had a huge impact on history, linguistics and religious

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.300
studies. Of course, reading the content of these texts was very important, but

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.170
estimating their age was also really vital. The way that that was done was

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.900
through carbon dating. So, what is carbon dating? Well, it's a technique used

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.000
to find the age of any organic material that's up to 58,000 years old. This is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.970
done by considering the ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12 in the material. Now if

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.069
you're not super comfortable with chemistry, that is not a big deal at all. I'm

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:50.490
going to give you all the information you need in this problem to figure

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.470
everything out. You don't have to be an expert on carbon dating. What happens

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.080
is that over time the amount of carbon 12 stays pretty constant. But the amount

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.730
of carbon 14 decreases. These atoms decay. So the older something is, the

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.440
smaller this ratio will be. One scrap of parchment from the Dead Sea Scrolls

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.610
was found to have a ratio of carbon 14 to carbon 12, 0.795 times that found in

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.612
plants alive today. Now, if this ratio for plants alive today, is 1 atom of

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:29.790
carbon 14 for every 10 to the 12 atoms of carbon 12, what is the same ratio for

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.530
the parchment?
