00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.879
well everybody has there 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.360
own choice

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.509
about what they believe in you know the freedom 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.839
to pursue different things and diversity of answers 
 people come up with 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.660
thats a great thing there is no single model

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.539
that you know should create this ranking of you know

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.010
you get this single score

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.600
you've got people who do

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.110
science an contribute 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.900
 you've got people who do social services

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.300
 people who do teaching 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.500
people who do entreunpreneur things

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.110
and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.520
you know the great thing about our socity is

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.220
if you're lucky enough to get a good education

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.780
then you can find 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.450
that fulfillment  in a variety of ways

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.330
so i dont have a metric

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.220
that would apply uh

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.630
and you know universally and and comeout with a score

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.050
I feel awful that many people dont

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.240
get the educational opportunity

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.610
that lets them pick

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.320
uh and so they can decide 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.070
and and pursue

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.239
what there definition of fulfillment is
