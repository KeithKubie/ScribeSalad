00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.920
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
In this video, we're going to
take a look at a cool trick

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.600
using dry ice and bubbles.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.160
Then we'll try and use the same principles,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.060
and see if we can make bubbles
that are full of colored smoke.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:16.100
[Music]

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.700
I've seen dry ice vapor being
used to fill bubbles before,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.075
and it makes a sort of milky-white,
not quite see through bubble,

00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:23.010
that when it pops,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.770
it just releases a bunch of carbon
dioxide gas, and it looks really cool.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.280
Steve Spangler had a video
where he showed how he did that.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.640
I wanted to try using the
same basic setup that he did,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.500
and see if we can recreate his results.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.320
Then I want to see if we can use
similar techniques to use the smoke

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.380
from a smoke ball to
make colored bubbles.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.900
Not just the white that
we'll get with the carbon dioxide,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.239
but I want to see if we can really get
some like rainbow bubbles going on.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.560
That should be pretty fun.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.780
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.160
Dry ice in a container with some water
will cause vapors to travel down the tube,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.989
through our nozzle into our bubble soap.

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.720
Hopefully, making bubbles
that are full of dry ice vapors.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.240
We'll then try a couple different
methods to get smoke from a smoke

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.100
bomb to fill bubbles the same way.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.580
We've got a little plastic
container with a lid on it.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.380
This lid, if you don't
put the handle down,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.700
does a very nice job of popping
on and off with no pressure at all,

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.250
and that's what we want for anything
that's going to have dry ice in it.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.320
We are going to have a hose running
out that will relieve some pressure.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.520
But it is dry ice.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.280
We don't want it sealed in a container
with a lid doesn't come off.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.300
Our hose is 7/16 inch hose,
and we're going to try drilling a hole

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.200
into the side of our container,
just very slightly smaller than that.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.820
So, when we put the hose in, it will
just kind of keep itself wedged in place.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.100
[Music]

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.800
This container doesn't drill super well.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.680
I'm just going to patch that up.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.680
Try again a little bit
slower on the other side.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.840
[Music]

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.520
Let's try this again.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.240
Hopefully-- hopefully, it doesn't
just keep cracking or we'll just end up with

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.720
an entire box made of electrical
tape, with a hole punched into it.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.260
[Music]

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.579
Okay, this style drillbit seems to
cut into the plastic much more easily.

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:04.950
Of course, that's not quite the right size.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.460
So now, we're going to try
and widen it just a little bit.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.960
[Music]

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.540
That is working great!

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.780
Hoses attached.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.820
I can pull it out if I really try, but it
does seem to stay in fairly nicely.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.200
Second time's the charm.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.380
I've got this little
plumbing extension piece.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.640
It's designed for switching from a type
of hose to something that threads on.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.060
We're just going to use
this as our bubble nozzle.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:35.640
So will fit this onto our hose,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.780
and now we can dip
this into our bubble fluid,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.360
and hopefully, bubbles should come out.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.600
We've got a couple kinds of bubble
fluid we're going to test out.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.900
This is just some water
with some soap mixed into it,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.000
and then I've got actual bubble fluid,
and I'm just going to try both of these.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.640
See what kinds of results I get.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.080
[Music]

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.680
That's-- that's some bubbles.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.960
Let's try the actual bubble soap.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.700
[Music]

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.540
I guess probably not.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.080
Too surprisingly, real bubble
soap gives us better bubbles

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.460
than trying to mix up our own version.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.420
There are some really good
recipes for DIY bubble soap,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.930
but I do think it's pretty easy
to use the premade stuff.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.100
It's not expensive, so we're
just going to be using that today.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.980
[Music]

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.320
We've got our container.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.180
Here's a pitcher full of warm water.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.160
Now, we're going to take a piece
of dry ice, drop it into our container,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.720
put the lid on but not seal it,
so, it's still comes off nice and easily.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.740
Not close down, which
makes it grip really hard.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.060
Vapor coming out of
the nozzle just like we like.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.760
[Music]

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.420
Take the lid off, and that stops,
and in the bubbles and...

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.820
Oh, that works really well.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.700
[Music]

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.040
It's great.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.920
Because the nozzle has threads on it,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.520
I think it does a good job
of holding bubble soap for a while,

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.140
so we get a good amount
of bubbles out of this.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:08.740
[Music]

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.540
My fingers covered with soap.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.160
So, I'm actually hitting the bubbles,
but it just kind of bounces off them.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:32.280
[Music]

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.900
Oh, that's-- that's good too. Get that.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.640
This little contraption is easy to
throw together, and it works quite well.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.620
The dry ice vapor is starting
to slow down now

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.980
because our water has
cooled down considerably.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.480
But while it was still nice and hot,

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.960
we were pumping out
bubbles really nice quick.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.380
It's really fun to watch them drop.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.880
They're like translucence, but you
can't actually see through them.

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.240
They're just light coming through,

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.600
and you know, if you've
got a nice cotton surface,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.009
these do a really good job
of letting the bubbles be preserve

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.840
for a second to not popping immediately.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.320
Or if you cover your hand in soap,
then usually, you can touch the bubbles

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.540
a little bit like that as well.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.320
Now, we want to see if we can create
a similar effect using colored smoke.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.550
So we'll try and light these off,
and see if we can get them to fill a bubble

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.660
the same way the dry ice vapor does.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.800
So my first thought is that we
could maybe just take one of these

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.880
little smoke balls,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.279
put it in a sealed
container with a small hole,

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:24.520
and the pressure that builds
from the smoke coming out

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.520
might be enough to just blow air powerful
enough to blow a bubble on its own.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.419
Let's build a little container that will
hold these, and then drill a hole

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.960
into it and see if that's true.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.536
To make our little impromptu
smoke pressure chamber,

00:05:35.536 --> 00:05:37.920
I've just got this little piece of PVC,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.700
the smoke ball fits right in the side,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.640
and then I've got a
couple of pieces of wood

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.419
that I can just tape one to the bottom,

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.159
and tape one is sort
of a hinge on the top.

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:48.129
That way, I can light the smoke
ball, drop it in, and hold this down.

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:50.120
And that should give us a decent seal.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.580
We can see if enough smoke
comes out to blow a bubble.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.780
[Music]

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.540
There we go.

00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:04.471
That won't be a 100% perfect seal
 but I think it's going to be good

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.500
enough that we can see
if this concept is going to work.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.880
If it builds up enough pressure that it
can blow the smoke out in one direction,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.620
hopefully, that will be enough to
blow some bubbles full of smoke.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.110
To help to direct the smoke flow,
I'm going to drill a small hole the same

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.360
way we did on the big one,
and attach a small piece of tubing to it.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.300
[Music]

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.420
Here's a little contraption.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.460
So the plan, we light the smoke ball,
drop it in, throw the lid down on,

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.460
and see how much
smoke we get out of here.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.020
[Music]

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.920
Quite a bit of smoke,
good amount of color coming out.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.260
The question is whether or not that has
enough pressure to blow any bubbles.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.620
This bubble one has
several different bubble holes.

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:50.259
I'm going to try for this one
right her,e because it seems

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.360
like a good size for the hose we've got.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:07:02.860
[Music]

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.320
Well, my timing wasn't great.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.680
But that still seemed like it just
popped the bubbles like immediately.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.160
Try this again,
and you can time this better.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.140
[Music]

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:17.120
It's not really blowing
the bubble soap at all.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.830
So I think, we're gonna have to come
up with a different method to do this.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.380
A lot of smoke does come out
the nozzle but for whatever reason,

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.349
it's not really blowing
anything at the bubbles.

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:29.409
I didn't even see the bubble soap
start to move, and most of the time,

00:07:29.409 --> 00:07:30.780
it just popped it immediately.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.240
So let's move on to design number two.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.639
Since this isn't putting out very much
pressure, I want to try something else

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:39.100
where I build a device,
fill it with smoke,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.440
and then use my own lungs to blow air in,
and have that travel through the container,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.080
and out the other side.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:51.220
Cut my piece of PVC pipe, and I've got
two round pieces of thin plywood,

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.440
and I think I'm going to make those
into the top and bottom.

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.565
So I'll tape one on so it's
completely sealed on in,

00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:57.540
and the other one,
I'll add sort of a hinge

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.640
so I can just open it,
drop the smoke ball in, close it again.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.500
This tape here is just to sort
of work as an improv gasket.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.920
It's not as good as a real gasket,
or even a Proto putty seal

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.760
but we don't need this to be 100% airtight.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.360
We just need to contain
most of the smoke.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.640
That's our goal.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.940
Okay, that's looking good.

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.000
Now, let's drill the hole back.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.020
[Music]

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.020
Perfect.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.780
Now, we need to drill the hole
for the front piece of PVC.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.620
This spade bit is going to make a hole.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.180
That's just a little bit too large.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.894
So after we put our piece of PVC in,

00:08:33.894 --> 00:08:36.120
we're going to have to
secure it with some tape.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:42.000
[Music]

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.560
When I blow into this tube,
It goes down into the chamber,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.540
up through the chamber,
and out through the nozzle.

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:47.860
So before we add any smoke,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.920
let's see if this is going
to work for blowing bubbles.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.600
Just take our bubble wand,
and see what we can do.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.120
[Music]

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.760
We are getting bubble
when we blow into the tube,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.430
and hold the bubble wand
in front of the nozzle.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.700
I think it's time to add some smoke.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:12.180
[Music]

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.820
That's a bubble full of smoke.

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:21.900
[Music]

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.040
Ah! Look at those bubbles.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:31.820
[Music]

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.900
Now,. I'm just gonna keep doing this
over and over till I run out of smoke balls.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:39.760
[Music]

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.200
I'm pretty sure that some of the smoke
powder that comes off actually

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.560
causes the bubbles to rupture.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.110
You have to get just the right amount.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.050
If you wait too long, then there's really
not going to be much color left.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:52.810
If you do it too soon, the chemicals
seem to just destroy the soap bubbles,

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:55.060
which is problem I've
had a couple of times now.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:01.560
[Music]

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.340
That's the look.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.380
[Music]

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.740
Oh man.

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:20.800
[Music]

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.740
&gt;&gt; Start.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.820
I don't feel so good.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.920
&gt;&gt; Dry ice bubbles work really well,

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.400
and smoke bomb
bubbles work pretty well.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.963
Not quite as uniformly
or smoothly as the dry ice,

00:10:35.963 --> 00:10:38.240
but we did get a lot of really good results.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.120
That's something that I really
want to take to another level.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.830
I want to see if we can soup that up.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.680
I'm thinking maybe a device
that will automatically blow six

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.710
different colors of smoke at once.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.430
So we can just sort of have
a rainbow cascade of different

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.380
smoke-filled bubbles falling down.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.360
That might be a video you
want to look for in the future.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.620
Guys, we've got more for you to see.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.880
That box up at the top will
take you directly to our last video,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.920
and you should go check that out.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.980
The box at the bottom will show
you what YouTube thinks

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.040
you should be watching next.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.160
If you hit this bomb in the middle,
you'll be subscribed to the channel

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.600
so you never miss out on the fun.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.380
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see in the next one.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.140
Talk to you then.
