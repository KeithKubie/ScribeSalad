00:00:00.776 --> 00:00:06.436
&gt;&gt; If you look at the higher
primates, bonobos, chimps,

00:00:06.576 --> 00:00:08.956
most notably, you do find --

00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:11.736
what I think is a very
impressive ability

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:12.406
to communicate.

00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:15.506
Now it's not typically
through vocalizations.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.356
One of the curious things
that distinguishes humans

00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:22.146
from non-human primates is that
we have a very fine control

00:00:22.596 --> 00:00:24.816
over our mouths, our
articulators, in fact,

00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.096
even our ability to breathe.

00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:30.256
I'm told by primatologists
that if you drop a chimpanzee

00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:33.676
in a swimming pool,
it'll sink like a stone.

00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:35.146
They can't be trained
to hold their breath.

00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:39.546
But they can communicate
manually through sign language.

00:00:39.546 --> 00:00:41.986
And they can understand
spoken language.

00:00:41.986 --> 00:00:44.986
So Kanzi, who is a bonobo,
is very well studied.

00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:49.506
I want to show you a bit of
what Kanzi does and then ask you

00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:51.246
to think about how
to understand that.

00:00:51.436 --> 00:00:54.416
This is Kanzi as a cute,
little bonobo baby.

00:00:54.816 --> 00:01:00.086
Cute, little bonobo
babies grow up to be not

00:01:00.136 --> 00:01:01.506
so cute bonobo adults.

00:01:01.876 --> 00:01:06.296
And this is Sue Savage-Rumbaugh
who has worked with Kanzi

00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:10.906
over many, many years to teach
Kanzi to sign and, in fact,

00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:13.046
to understand her language.

00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:18.606
So let's look at a clip of Sue
Savage-Rumbaugh in the kitchen

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:21.496
with Kanzi working together.

00:01:21.806 --> 00:01:23.036
&gt;&gt; I got the onions in a bowl.

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:24.106
Let's go put them
in our hot food

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:25.696
and we'll come back
and turn the TV on.

00:01:26.806 --> 00:01:31.586
Put your onions right here
and put them in your bowl.

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.326
Look. You spilled some of them.

00:01:35.576 --> 00:01:38.356
&gt;&gt; The chimps have responded
well to such a rich environment

00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:41.136
and show an unprecedented
grasp of spoken English.

00:01:42.026 --> 00:01:45.016
&gt;&gt; Let me get you a spoon
to stir it with Kanzi.

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:47.116
&gt;&gt; In addition to
spoken language,

00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:49.716
they receive a steady
stream of nonverbal cues,

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:53.566
attention directing maneuvers,
and repetition, the hallmarks

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.116
of the way we speak
to young children.

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:01.416
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Will you wash
this potato off for me?

00:02:01.466 --> 00:02:02.736
Could you wash the potato?

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:06.586
&gt;&gt; Sue Savage-Rumbaugh is
convinced that the combination

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:08.396
of all these every
day interactions

00:02:08.396 --> 00:02:11.796
at an early age is essential
for the acquisition of language.

00:02:12.356 --> 00:02:15.126
Scientists call this
process enculturation.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:16.666
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:02:16.806 --> 00:02:18.236
Your noodles are
going to go in here.

00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:23.716
And you can have a few
of them for your tummy.

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:25.696
Kanzi could you turn the
water off again please?

00:02:25.886 --> 00:02:27.226
Turn the water off please.

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:30.036
&gt;&gt; In the kitchen,
in Sue's company,

00:02:30.036 --> 00:02:31.606
Kanzi functions impressively.

00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:33.946
But does Kanzi, like a human,

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:36.326
really have the ability
to understand words?

00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:38.766
&gt;&gt; And that's the question.

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:41.196
What is it exactly
that Kanzi understands?

00:02:41.786 --> 00:02:45.036
Now I take it as very impressive
that Kanzi can function

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:49.666
in a kitchen and interact
with Sue in all of the things

00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:51.386
that are needed to do to cook.

00:02:51.966 --> 00:02:53.356
Kanzi spent a lot of
time in the kitchen,

00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:55.856
so this is not the first
time Kanzi has done this.

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:59.086
But put yourself in
Kanzi's place or better yet,

00:02:59.226 --> 00:03:06.926
put yourself in some unfamiliar
language context, pick Farsi

00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:09.576
or Hungarian, and
imagine you were working

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:10.846
with a Farsi speaker.

00:03:11.276 --> 00:03:15.876
And you knew a few words:
onions, water, things like that.

00:03:16.726 --> 00:03:20.356
You probably would get fairly
far and be able to do the kinds

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:24.986
of things that Kanzi did based
on the knowledge of a few words

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:27.246
and based on knowing
what's appropriate behavior.

00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:31.676
Okay. So without
meaning to belittle

00:03:31.676 --> 00:03:35.116
or diminish the impressiveness
of what Kanzi is doing,

00:03:35.456 --> 00:03:38.526
it's probably -- this, at least,

00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:41.856
is not a conclusive
demonstration that Kanzi is able

00:03:41.856 --> 00:03:44.536
to use language in any
of the complex ways

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:45.476
that we normally think about it.

00:03:45.476 --> 00:03:48.266
And we'll talk a bit about
what that might mean.
