00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt; Announcer: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:22.510
[ Pause ]

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:30.060
[ Applause ]

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; McLean: Thank you very, very much
for these luminous performances.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.880
It's been a tremendous
joy to have you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.800
and the Bach Collegium Japan
here again at the Library,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.140
and to have the time to share a
few of our treasures with you.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.550
This afternoon we had the
pleasure of looking with you

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.480
and your colleagues at
the original manuscript

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.390
of Bach's cantata number
ten, and your exhilaration

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.270
at encountering this manuscript
was tremendously infectious.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.590
Can you talk a little about what
that means for you-the experience

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.460
of encountering an
original score like this.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.470
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Well-well, still
my heart is already beating

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.730
so it's...I'll try to calm down.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.230
Well, all the time this-- -

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.310
we have seen a wonderful
original autograph this afternoon.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.940
Those original manuscripts,
especially autographs

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:31.220
of Johann Sebastian Bach
himself, inspires us very much,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.160
because he has written not only
the notes but sometimes slurs,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.460
indications of articulations,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.190
and so on-all the details are
very, very interesting to see.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.340
You can never sense
these kinds of things

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.160 position:56%
from the printed material of course.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.540
So, of course the Neue Bach
Ausgabe-that's a new Bach

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.140
edition-helps us a lot, but still
we should [at] all time trace

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.500
to-actually anything
procedural-from the original source

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.690
until the material,
the printed and so on.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.920
So this is a really
great pleasure, yea.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.250
&gt;&gt; McLean: You know, there was
a little phrase at the bottom

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.050
of the page that you noticed-at the
very bottom underneath the staves.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.350
Tell the audience about that.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.410
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Yea, that's
very interesting.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:30.730
Here is one of the most important
materials of the cantata number 10,

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.930
"Meine Seel erhebt den Herrn"-this
is the German magnificat,

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.230
and the [inaudible] score.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.330
And, on the edge of the
first page Bach has written

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.140
down a couple bars
right next to that page

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.930
that means...the one thing
probably he has made an attempt how

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.240
to the polyphonic line
works out and so on.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.100
But at the same time
when he has finished

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.390
with the first page probably he
could not turn [the page] over yet,

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.880
because the ink is still wet.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.710
So that's why before he
forgets the next couple

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.180
of bars he has written
down on the edge.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.980 position:56%
So that's really interesting things.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.220
[ Laughter ]

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.180
&gt;&gt; McLean: And you said that's
very rare...you hadn't seen that...

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.480
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Yes, very, very rare.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.780
&gt;&gt; McLean: This is the kind
of thing that you learn

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.510
when you're looking at these.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.610
And you mentioned that the
parts are actually more valuable

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.080
for a performer than the score.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.240
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Well actually,
at the time no big machine

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.480
so the parts must be
made from the score.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.320
So, probably at that time the set

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.480
of parts...performing parts is
more important than the score,

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:54.210
because if you get the parts
then you can immediately perform

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.510
the piece.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.970
So, that's why when
the...after his death

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:05.190
in 1750 all the original material,
Bach himself, divided in two.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.230
In one is the score and some duets,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.870
and the other group
is the set of parts.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.860
This set of parts [is]
thought probably more valuable

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.040
than the score.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.840
&gt;&gt; McLean: And you mentioned
that one half would go

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.140
to his family and others...

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.440
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Yes.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.000
One score and duet going
to one part/ person

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.570
and the other sets going
[to the] second person.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.130
Bach has written down in principal
all the detail articulations

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.570
and indications of slurs,
and so on-not in the score,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.640
instead they're only
in the parts directly.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.610
On the parts [are] all
the notes what could be

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.110
by [Bach's] copyist-his
assistant or sons and so on.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.980 position:56%
But, after that he has always looked
through and checked all the details.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.830
At the same time he has added
many indications of slurs

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.220
and also figuration[s]
of the basso continuo.

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.110
So, on the parts the notes are
usually copied by someone else,

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.830
but all the detail indications
are by [Bach] himself.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.360
&gt;&gt; McLean: It was a
wonderful, wonderful time.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.290
Critics talk about-- - of
course write about you-- -

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.680
your performances as
impeccable, revelatory,

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.990
and imbued with spiritual
rigor, and if we had time

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.060
for a mystical conversation
we could talk

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.040
about how you inculcate
these kinds of qualities

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.750
in teaching-in your students.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.250
So, we don't really have time
for that, but I was wondering

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.220
if you'd comment on some
of the remarks you've made

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.050
about the technique end of things.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.050
And you say that you suggested
that people think theatrically.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.990
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Yea, someone said
that life is the theater.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:59.260
Bach's music is so
dramatic and I think

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.870
that all the technical aspects
go together with the idea

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.790
of the music-not only
music, but the expression.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:11.910
So techniques are always developed
by this kind of idea, musical idea,

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.610
and then how...it's very important
to get a musical idea or what kind

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.340
of expression you want to make.

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.400
That makes the technique better.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.070
So, those two things
always go together.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.430
At that time, for example, he has
published a couple of collections

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.460 position:56%
of harpsichord pieces called...under
the title of "Clavier-Übung."

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:41.440
Clavier-Übung means
actually "for practice."

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.740
Clavier-Übung is the practice.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.310
So at that time the practice meant

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:51.860
for probably...to get an
idea to...to become able

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.780
to make a...this and
that expression.

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:59.080
So, it's not only the
moving fingers and so on.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.200
In the Baroque time
this kind of motion

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.680 position:56%
of the fingers [was] always
closely connected to the expression.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.150
So probably after the
Czerny or Beethoven time,

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.810
you see the piano technique[s]
are more developed,

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:21.020
and probably it was needed to be
trained a little more mechanically.

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.030
So that's why, for example,
etudes of Czerny and so on,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.900
is completely different
ideas-certain concepts

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.200
from the Baroque time.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.910
Baroque time is still...everything
was very well related together.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.210
&gt;&gt; McLean: Fascinating.

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:35.350
Well we...maybe a question
about your recordings

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:38.330
and then I know some people in the
audience will have some questions.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:44.020
Now that you have completed a
staggering fifty-five CD set

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.600
of the complete Bach cantatas,

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.520
and of course this month you've
just had a big Gramophone Award

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.630
for your organ works CD,
you have a lot going on.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.660
And you made a recording with your
son I believe-the harpsichord.

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.250
Maybe talk a little about
how you're at this pinnacle.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:06.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Yea, well we have indeed
completed the church cantatas sadly.

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:11.870
Well, there's no more
church cantatas

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:16.200
to record, that makes me very sad.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.910
But, we are still going on
with the secular cantatas

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.210
and the vocal works.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:30.660
We are doing also harpsichord works
and the...you mentioned the CD

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.170 position:56%
with my son is a two harpsichord CD.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.180
My son is now active
as a harpsichordist

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.650
and conductor, and so on.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.610
It was a great pleasure.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.050 position:56%
We have played all the time at home,

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:46.960
you see the two harpsichord
concerti and so on.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.550
And well one day, we [said]
"why don't we make one CD."

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.850
And then we found a CD company

00:08:53.850 --> 00:09:03.830
and they found it a very nice
idea so we did that one CD.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:10.990
And there comes probably
one more CD of concerti

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:19.110
with the three harpsichord,
and four harpsichord,

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:28.230 position:56%
and so on that needs to me recorded.

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.680
Well, many things.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.330
Actually, I have almost completed
the harpsichord solo works as well,

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.010
but there are still three
or [inaudible] missing.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.660
And in between I could not wait
for the organ complete series

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.070
because otherwise I'm getting
to old to play organ works.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.370
So, I started organ works as well.

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.260
&gt;&gt; McLean: You also are
doing Mahler and Mendelssohn-

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.180
I mean you have many projects.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.790
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Yea, well that's
not for recording yet,

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:52.010
but there are plenty
of wonderful music.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:57.770
Since a couple of years [ago]
I have been asked to work

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.920
with the symphony orchestra.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.130
At the beginning they
asked me to do Bach,

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.890
but actually I don't
think it works very well

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.390
with Bach's music-with
the symphony orchestra,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:10.670
because setting-wise
and instrument-wise.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.510
Of course, I don't think
it's impossible to do Bach

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:19.680
with modern instruments,
but still the organization

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:27.050
and the concert structure-the
concert activity-[is] not always

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:32.590
appropriate for the Bach thing.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:39.150
So that's why I have offered some
Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:45.040
And I love since a long
time Mahler and Stravinsky.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.590
[A] Stravinsky CD is coming out
probably in a couple of months.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.140
So, well I'm trying to make
my life as buy as possible.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:50.740
&gt;&gt; McLean: Well you've
said music is the food

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.040
that nourishes you every day,

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.340
so this is how you have
this extraordinary energy.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.570
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Yea, it is.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:57.830
&gt;&gt; McLean: Well perhaps there
are just a couple questions here

00:10:57.830 --> 00:11:01.280
from someone.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:11.990
&gt;&gt; Audience member: I did have one
question that is going to deal more

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:16.270 position:56%
with orchestras, because I saw you
earlier with the Baltimore Symphony.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.570
You sort of answered
that question already.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.870 position:56%
Who are you doing the Mahler [with]?

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:23.630
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Mahler I have
only done in Japan...yet.

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:28.440 position:56%
But I find [it] so nice to work with
wonderful orchestra like Baltimore

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.830
and we did also New York
Philharmonic and together

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:38.970
with my choir, and well
Boston Symphony, and so on.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:43.420
There's quite many
symphony orchestras

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.300
that I...love working with them.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.300
Because of the...this kind

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:53.090
of orchestra musicians
are a little bit different

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:54.390
from our members of course.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:58.430
The instruments are completely
different and the concept

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:02.360
of the music-making is
quite much different,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.080 position:56%
but still the good orchestra or good
musicians will have always this kind

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:10.590
of [inaudible] to come closer and
also we can talk about the music

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.490
and feeling, and so on, which
is really, really fascinating.

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.720
&gt;&gt; Audience member: Do you
have any plans...I don't know

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.500
that you've recorded
like the Mendelssohn

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.040
"Elijah"...do you have
any plans to record it?

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.340
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: No.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:26.320
Actually, I have planned already
here [points to head] Mendelssohn

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.180
"Paulus" and the "Elijah" is of
course one of the most important.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:38.510
We have done with my choir and
orchestra "Paulus" a couple

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.730
of times, but still we
cannot afford to make the CD.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:46.350
So, if you can help
us then we can...

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:51.150 position:56%
[laugher] what we need is this help.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:52.450
&gt;&gt; Audience member: You've
performed all over the world

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.150 position:56%
and I'm just curious, could you give
a sense of the different reactions

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.790
of audiences in different
parts of the world,

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.600
especially in Germany and Leipzig.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.280
I know they've honored you, but
is there a special reception

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.950
that you get when you
perform in Germany?

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.470
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: Well, that is a
very interesting question,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:22.400
because...Of course we expect all
of the time different reactions

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:32.680
from the different country, but
actually there are so many fans

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.540
of Bach's music everywhere

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:43.740
in the world and...if you have a
really good audience then there's

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:51.710
more of a similar excitement
that we share all of the time

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:53.840
with the audience and members.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:59.690
That's not so different
as you expect.

00:13:59.690 --> 00:14:04.700
But still, of course, in Japan
it's completely different.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:09.910
Japanese audiences
never standing up.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:14.270
The standing ovation
doesn't exist in Japan.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:18.100
But that doesn't mean to
[inaudible] something less.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.400
[inaudible].

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.500
Yea, for example in America,
or in Germany for example.

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:30.160
The German audience is the
closest being for the Bach's music.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:35.650
They have very personal experiences
with this and that Bach piece.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:41.730
For example, when we
performed a couple of cantatas,

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.290
quite many people came to me
after the concert and [said]

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:52.510
"this cantata was performed in
the funeral of my mother..."

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.650
or something like that.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.710
Those kind of personal
experiences...this is really nice

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:59.010
thing I think.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:01.860
They can appreciate the
word by word, of course.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.110
[inaudible] This kind
of detailed reaction is

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:08.030
of course very interesting.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.590
But in general, in
American or in everywhere,

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.160
[it's] a wonderful reception...so
we're having this all the time.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.460
&gt;&gt; McLean: As you were tonight.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.760
Maybe one more question?

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.310
&gt;&gt; Audience member: I
thought the pitch is lower.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:19.300
It's not 440, right?

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.300
&gt;&gt; Suzuki: No, this
is the 415 tonight.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:27.340
It's one half-tone lower than
the usual standard nowadays.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.680
This is the kind of
compromised modern version

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.880
of Baroque interpretation.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:40.020
In Baroque time there was no
standard pitch-so city-by-city

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:44.530
or venue-by-venue [there] was [a]
completely different pitch used.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.340
For example, in France
it is much lower.

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:55.600
Probably one whole tone lower,
so around 390 or 392, and so on.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.990
While in Northern Germany
[inaudible] much higher pitch.

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:06.470
Something like 465 or even
until 480 or -85, and so on.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:16.870
If you compare with the modern
piano the range is from F-sharp

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:23.500
until B-natural, or
something like that.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:29.450
So that's all each note can be
said of A-that is the problem.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:34.380
Bach himself has used the
two different pitch[es]

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.700
very intentionally.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.070
The one is a quarter [inaudible]

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:44.540
around organ pitch,
that means around 465.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.510
The other [inaudible]
pitch is around 415.

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:50.550
This gap is exactly one whole-tone.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:54.280
So that's why in all Bach's
original parts of cantatas,

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.870
the organ part is written down
a whole-tone all the time.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.790
So transposed down all the time.

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:00.410
Organ was sort of the transposing
instrument, while the oboe,

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:01.710
wind section, and stringed
instruments are tuned

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.010
on the same pitch.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.310
That is a really complicated thing.

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.610
Probably you are falling
asleep...from the explanation

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:07.410
of this kind of thing.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:10.150
[ Laughter ]

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:11.450
&gt;&gt; McLean: Wonderful.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.670 position:56%
Well you know we hate to stop, we
wish we could keep you several days.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:19.110
But we do need to stop
because of the police-the door.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.510
Thank you so much!

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:25.190
[ Applause ]

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.900
&gt;&gt; Announcer: This has
been a presentation

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.850
of the Library of Congress.
