00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.020
I want to make a
quick correction

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.720
to the video on quasars.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.230
In that video I said,
and I mistakenly

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.720
said that the creation
disk that's really

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.840
releasing the energy
of the quasar,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.760
that it's releasing
energy predominately

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.380
in the x-ray part of the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.690
And that was incorrect.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.200
Most quasars are
actually emitting

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.410
electromagnetic radiation
across the spectrum, all the way

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.430
from x-rays, as high frequency
as x-rays, all the way down

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.290
to infrared.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.740
And some quasars even release
super high frequency gamma

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.370
rays, and they'll release low
frequency electromagnetic waves

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.172
all the way down to radio waves.

00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:45.880
So I just wanted to
make that correction.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.640
It's not predominately in the
x-ray part of the spectrum.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.840
It's across the spectrum
right over here.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.830
It's this entire
range of the spectrum,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.647
and sometimes even
a wider range.

00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:56.230
Now, the other thing
I want to clarify

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.850
is this is the range of the
spectrum that's being emitted.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.670
But we have to
remember that most,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.030
or actually all of these
quasars are quite far away.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.970
The closest is 780
million light years away.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.410
Many of them are many, many
billions of light years away.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.370
And so they're moving away
from us at a very fast speed,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.870
or they're getting redshifted
because the universe is

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.360
expanding so fast relative
to us at that point,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.650
or that coordinate is moving so
fast away from our coordinate.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.300
And so even though this is the
spectrum that's being emitted,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.370
it's all going to be redshifted.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.650
It's all going to
be redshifted down,

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.600
and so we are going
to observe things

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.710
at a much lower frequency,
maybe around the radio

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.017
part of the frequency.

00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:38.600
So everything will
be redshifted down.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.100
And that's why these
were originally

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.650
called quasi stellar
radio sources.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.780
Anyway, hopefully that clears
things up a little bit.
