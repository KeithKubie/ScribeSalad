1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:00.690
Yeah.

2
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.190
<v 1>In this video we'll see an alternative for visualizing a undirected graphical</v>

3
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:09.120
models like the conditional random fields known as the factor graph.

4
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.050
<v 0>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.440
<v 1>We've seen in the previous video that one way of visualizing and conditional</v>

6
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:16.370
random fields is to uh,

7
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.420
draw a network where each node would curse spawn to one of the random variables

8
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.080
in the model.

9
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.470
And then we would draw an edge between each node that share at least one factor

10
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.520
in the product of factors,
a form of the conditional random fields.

11
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.560
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.530
<v 1>Now,
one problem with this visualization is that it's actually ambiguous.</v>

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.390
So we notice a,
for instance,
that we actually have a clique between,

14
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.880
there's a mistake here.
This would be x two.

15
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.010
We actually have a clique between y one y two x two.

16
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.780
So I have a quick like this here,
that is a subset of the graph where each note,

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200
uh,
each pair of node is connected to each other.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.390
Uh,

19
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.390
and this actually kind of suggests that perhaps there was a factor that had as

20
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:13.941
its three arguments y one y two x two because in this case that I have to draw

21
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.690
an edge between y one y two and the edge between y one and x two and another

22
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.330
edge between y two x two.
But in fact,
in my actual model,

23
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:26.640
all I had was three factors.

24
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.850
One between [inaudible] and [inaudible] and other one between y to annex two and

25
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:36.660
another one between y one x two.
And,
uh,
you know,

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.680
in some sense it's as if I had just a single factor,
uh,

27
00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:45.470
which was the product.
So a single factor between y one y two x two where,
uh,

28
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.510
which was the product of my simpler factor y one and y two times the factor of

29
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.120
between y to annex two times the factor between y one and x two.

30
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.670
But what if I had a model with actually had the factor between these three

31
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:06.940
random variables that was more complicated.
Uh,
it's actually their,

32
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.960
would they sort of correspond to different models?

33
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.760
A one which is a bit more complicated and can model more,
uh,

34
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:17.760
sophisticated and interactions between these three random variables.

35
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.430
And the other one would just assumes that,
you know,

36
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:23.760
the way I'm going to model preferences between the values of these three random

37
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:27.930
variables is as a product of preferences between pairs of variables.

38
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.150
And so what we'll see is that there's another type of graph dealers

39
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.820
digitalization,

40
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.140
which is going to allow us to distinguish between these two cases.

41
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.790
So this visualization is known as a factor graph.

42
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.280
And the idea is that we're actually going to add nodes in our graph that

43
00:02:47.281 --> 00:02:51.960
corresponds to the factors.
So in our conditional random fields,

44
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:55.290
which is a linear chain that has a context window of radius one,

45
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.490
this workers respond to that at this factor graph.
So,
uh,

46
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.480
usually factors,
we illustrate them as a little square like this.

47
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.750
And not each square corresponds to,
we factor in my,
uh,

48
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.140
product of factors form of my conditional random fields.

49
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.860
And now each factor note is going to be connected to its argument to the random

50
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:25.090
variables that are,
uh,
correspond to arguments of the factor.
So,

51
00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:26.050
for instance,

52
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.350
we have this factor here and it's connected to why three and x three.

53
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.150
Uh,
because in the factor,
which is this,
uh,

54
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.060
it depends on x three and it depends on why three.

55
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.551
Similarly,

56
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:47.551
I'm going to have this factor here and it's going to be connected to x two and

57
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:51.310
y,
y,
sorry,
x two and y three because again,

58
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.120
it's a factor that depends on next twin wire three and so on,

59
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:59.290
say for this factor.
And also had to have a pairwise factor here,

60
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.450
uh,
which is here,

61
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.660
which is connected to why three and why four because it expresses a preference

62
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.620
over the joint value of y three and why for now,

63
00:04:11.621 --> 00:04:15.790
the reason why this is less ambiguous is uh,

64
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.820
because now we explicitly have the factors illustrated in our visualization.

65
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.960
So consider this very simple example where I have this mark of network,

66
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.530
uh,
was corresponds to three variables,

67
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.280
each connected to each other like we've discussed before.
Well in this case,

68
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:35.770
we don't really know whether it's uh,

69
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.800
it's actually a model where we have three factors that are over pairs or just a

70
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:45.790
single factor over three variables.
Uh,

71
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.420
however,
given this factor graph,
well,

72
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:53.860
if I was to draw to infer what is the mark of network visualization based on

73
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.780
that factor graph?
Well,
I'd have to,
uh,

74
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.640
draw an edge between this node and this node because there is this factor that

75
00:05:00.641 --> 00:05:05.230
connects them.
So this,
there's one factor that involves the two of them.

76
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.480
Same thing because of diff that this factor,

77
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:11.230
I need to draw an edge in the MAC mark of network viz between these two

78
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:13.690
variables.
And similarly for that factor,

79
00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:18.691
I'd get an edge here and we see that also this factor graph with a single factor

80
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:23.620
was actually correspond to a the same mark of network.

81
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.160
So while going from factor graph to mark of network is well defined,

82
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.600
inferring from a mark of network,
what is the factor graph is actually ambiguous.

83
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.970
So that's not a well-defined operation.

84
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.980
So we've lost less than formation by drawing.
So,

85
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.010
or we're providing more information by drawing the factor graph as opposed to

86
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.350
drawing the mark of network.

87
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.080
There's still some advantages in that mock up network.

88
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.010
It's kind of more intuitive and easier to infer the conditional independence's

89
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.110
like we've done before.

90
00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.540
Though we could extend that logic to a fact factor graphs.

91
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.390
But in all cases,
uh,

92
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.260
when the information about the factories is not as much important and we're more

93
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.730
concerned about showing the independence's or dependencies between the variable

94
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.700
often will favor drawing and mark of network.

95
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.610
But if the actual information about the factors is important,

96
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.770
then we'll want to use a factor graph.
All right,
so this covers,
uh,
the,

97
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.550
the second type of visualization for undirected graphical model known as the

98
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:26.090
fact that graph.
