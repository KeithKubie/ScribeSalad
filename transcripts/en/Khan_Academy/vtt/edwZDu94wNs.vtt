00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.218
- [Voiceover] The temperature
of a glass of warm water

00:00:02.218 --> 00:00:03.625
after it's put in a freezer

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:06.250
is represented by the following table.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.139
So we have time in minutes

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.731
and then we have the
corresponding temperature

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:11.864
at different times in minutes.

00:00:11.864 --> 00:00:13.826
Which model for C of t,

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:15.785
the temperature of the glass of water

00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:17.478
t minutes after it's served,

00:00:17.478 --> 00:00:19.405
best fits the data?

00:00:19.405 --> 00:00:20.754
So pause the video

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:25.700
and see which of these
models best fit the data.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.908
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:29.908 --> 00:00:31.284
So in order for it,

00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:32.322
we see these choices.

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:33.844
Some of these choices
are exponential models.

00:00:33.844 --> 00:00:35.636
Some of these are linear models.

00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:39.679
In order for a linear model
to be a good description,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.527
when you have a fixed change in time,

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:44.476
you should have a fixed
change in temperature.

00:00:44.476 --> 00:00:46.769
If you're dealing with
an exponential model,

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.368
then as you have a fixed change in time,

00:00:48.368 --> 00:00:51.715
you should be changing by the same factor

00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:53.395
so the amount you change

00:00:53.395 --> 00:00:55.480
from say minute one to minute two

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.024
or from minute two to minute three,

00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.694
it's not going to be the exact same amount

00:00:59.694 --> 00:01:02.199
but it should be the same
factor of where you started.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.507
So let's think about this.

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:05.063
So here,

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:09.821
our change in time is two minutes.

00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:13.004
What is the absolute
change in temperature?

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:14.795
So our absolute change in temperature

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.733
is negative what, 15.7.

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.661
Negative 15.7

00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:25.889
and what if we viewed
it as a multiplication?

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:27.853
So what do multiply 80 by

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:30.430
to get 64.3?

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.675
Well, I can get a calculator out for that.

00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:38.675
So 64.3 divided by 80

00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:41.739
is equal to 0.8

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:44.642
I'll just say approximately .8

00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:47.246
So we could multiply by

00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:49.728
.0.8

00:01:49.728 --> 00:01:51.443
This is going to be approximate.

00:01:51.443 --> 00:01:53.110
So to get from 80 to 64.3

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.087
I could either subtract by 15.7

00:01:55.087 --> 00:01:57.093
if I'm dealing with a linear model

00:01:57.093 --> 00:02:00.949
or I can multiply by 0.8

00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:04.302
Now if I increase my time again by two,

00:02:04.302 --> 00:02:06.391
I'm going from minute two to minute four,

00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:08.974
so Delta t is equal to two,

00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:12.248
the absolute change here is what?

00:02:12.248 --> 00:02:15.851
This is going to be not 12.

00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:17.568
This is going to be,

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:20.143
my brain isn't functioning optimally.

00:02:20.143 --> 00:02:23.908
This was 64.7 then this would be 12

00:02:23.908 --> 00:02:25.124
but it's four less than that

00:02:25.124 --> 00:02:26.563
so it's 11.6.

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:29.018
Negative 11.6

00:02:29.018 --> 00:02:31.303
but if you look at it as
multiplying it by a factor,

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:34.402
what would you have to
multiply by approximately?

00:02:34.402 --> 00:02:36.338
Let's get the calculator back out.

00:02:36.338 --> 00:02:40.761
So if I said 52.7

00:02:40.873 --> 00:02:42.884
divided by 64.3.

00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:45.627
Divided by 64.3

00:02:45.627 --> 00:02:46.560
is equal to,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.899
that's about .82.

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:52.377
So times 0.82.

00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:53.579
So just by looking at this,

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:54.658
I can keep going

00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:57.549
but it looks like for our
give and change in time,

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.174
my absolute change in the number

00:03:00.174 --> 00:03:03.167
is not even close to being the same.

00:03:03.167 --> 00:03:04.690
If this was 15.6,

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.817
I'd be like okay maybe there's
a little bit of error here.

00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:08.248
Data that you collect in the real world

00:03:08.248 --> 00:03:09.391
is never going to be perfect.

00:03:09.391 --> 00:03:11.397
These are models that try to get us close

00:03:11.397 --> 00:03:12.986
to describing the data.

00:03:12.986 --> 00:03:15.159
But over here we keep multiplying it

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.271
by a factor of roughly .8,

00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:19.543
roughly .8.

00:03:19.543 --> 00:03:21.063
Now you might be tempted
to immediately say,

00:03:21.063 --> 00:03:23.336
okay, well that means that C of t

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:26.011
is going to be equal to
our initial temperature,

00:03:26.011 --> 00:03:30.636
80 times a common ratio of 0.8

00:03:30.636 --> 00:03:33.655
to the number of minutes that passed by.

00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:34.646
Now this is very tempting

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:37.457
and it would be the case
if this was one minute

00:03:37.457 --> 00:03:39.226
and if this was two minutes

00:03:39.226 --> 00:03:42.087
but our change in temperature each time

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:45.698
is our change in temperature
each time is two minutes

00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:48.643
so what we really should say is this is

00:03:48.643 --> 00:03:50.987
one way to think about it is that it takes

00:03:50.987 --> 00:03:55.068
two minutes to have a 0.8 change

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.077
or to be multiplied by 0.8.

00:03:57.077 --> 00:03:58.345
So the real way to describe this

00:03:58.345 --> 00:04:00.835
would be t over two.

00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:03.670
Every two minutes when t is zero,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.733
we'd be at 80.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:06.033
After two minutes,

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:08.375
we would take 80 times 0.8,

00:04:08.375 --> 00:04:09.882
which is what we got over here.

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.196
After four minutes,

00:04:11.196 --> 00:04:13.244
it would be 80 times 0.8 squared.

00:04:13.244 --> 00:04:14.830
In fact, let's just verify

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.544
that we feel pretty good about this.

00:04:17.544 --> 00:04:21.509
So if we had something like this.

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.047
So t

00:04:24.047 --> 00:04:27.235
and C of t.

00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:29.796
So when t is zero, C of t is 80.

00:04:29.796 --> 00:04:31.574
When t is,

00:04:31.574 --> 00:04:33.747
well let me just do the
same data that we have here.

00:04:33.747 --> 00:04:35.454
When t is two,

00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:38.133
we have 80 times,

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:39.016
two over two is one

00:04:39.016 --> 00:04:40.910
so it's 80 times 0.8,

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.380
which is pretty close to
what we have over here.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.729
When t is four,

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.186
it would be 80 .0.8 squared

00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:52.506
which is pretty close to
what we have right over here.

00:04:52.506 --> 00:04:54.376
I can just calculate it for you.

00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:58.960
If I have .8 squared

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.655
times 80,

00:05:01.965 --> 00:05:03.212
51.2

00:05:03.212 --> 00:05:04.156
Getting pretty close.

00:05:04.156 --> 00:05:06.037
This is a pretty good approximation.

00:05:06.037 --> 00:05:07.763
Pretty good model.

00:05:07.763 --> 00:05:10.872
So I'm liking this model.

00:05:10.872 --> 00:05:13.574
This isn't exactly one of the choices

00:05:13.574 --> 00:05:16.110
so how do we manipulate this a little bit?

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.591
Well, we can remind ourselves

00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:19.792
that this is the same thing as 80

00:05:19.792 --> 00:05:23.889
times 0.8 to the one half

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.933
and then that to the t power.

00:05:26.933 --> 00:05:29.924
And what's .8 to the one half?

00:05:29.924 --> 00:05:33.341
So .8.

00:05:33.341 --> 00:05:35.262
That's the same thing as
taking the square root of .8

00:05:35.262 --> 00:05:37.973
It's roughly .89

00:05:37.973 --> 00:05:41.379
So this is approximately 80

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.545
times 0.89

00:05:44.545 --> 00:05:46.075
to the t power.

00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:47.548
And if you look at all of these choices,

00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:49.837
this one is pretty close to this.

00:05:49.837 --> 00:05:52.542
This model best fits the data,

00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:53.648
especially of the choices going,

00:05:53.648 --> 00:05:55.548
this is pretty close to the model

00:05:55.548 --> 00:05:57.289
that I just thought about.

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:58.312
Now another way of doing it

00:05:58.312 --> 00:05:59.412
that might have been a little bit simpler.

00:05:59.412 --> 00:06:00.075
I like to do it this way

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:01.381
because even if I didn't have choices,

00:06:01.381 --> 00:06:03.381
we would have gotten to
something reasonable.

00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:05.093
Another way to do it is to say okay,

00:06:05.093 --> 00:06:06.288
80 is our initial state.

00:06:06.288 --> 00:06:07.435
All of these whether you're talking about

00:06:07.435 --> 00:06:08.776
exponential or linear models,

00:06:08.776 --> 00:06:11.338
start with 80 when t is equal to zero

00:06:11.338 --> 00:06:12.654
but it's clearly not a linear model

00:06:12.654 --> 00:06:13.672
because we're not changing by

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:16.412
even roughly the same amount every time

00:06:16.412 --> 00:06:17.524
but it looks like every two minutes

00:06:17.524 --> 00:06:19.107
we're changing by a factor of .8

00:06:19.107 --> 00:06:20.540
so we're going to have
an exponential model

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.869
so you say okay, it will be
one of these two choices.

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:26.464
Now this one down here you could rule out

00:06:26.464 --> 00:06:29.152
because we're not changing
by a factor of 0.8

00:06:29.152 --> 00:06:31.008
or 0.81 every minute.

00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:32.851
We're changing by a factor of 0.81

00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.779
every two minutes

00:06:34.779 --> 00:06:36.130
so you could have ruled that one out

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:37.077
and then you could have deduced

00:06:37.077 --> 00:06:38.217
to this right over here

00:06:38.217 --> 00:06:38.672
and you could have said,

00:06:38.672 --> 00:06:41.575
look, if I'm changing by a
factor of .9 every minute

00:06:41.575 --> 00:06:44.892
then that would have been
.81 every two minutes

00:06:44.892 --> 00:06:46.695
which is pretty close to
what we're seeing here

00:06:46.695 --> 00:06:49.437
changing by a factor of about .8 or .81

00:06:49.437 --> 00:06:50.871
every two minutes.

00:06:50.871 --> 00:06:54.424
So once again that's why
we like that first choice.
