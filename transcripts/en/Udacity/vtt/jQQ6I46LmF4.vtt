00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.694
Here, the answer is plus or minus 5 times root 2. Great thinking if you found

00:00:04.694 --> 00:00:10.103
these answers. We start by dividing both sides of our equation by 4. This gives

00:00:10.103 --> 00:00:13.882
us x squared on the left, and 50 on the right. Whenever we use the square root

00:00:13.882 --> 00:00:18.104
method, we want to isolate x squared. Or there might just be some sort of

00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:22.770
quantity squared. This allows us to take the square root in this step. Doing

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.390
that we get x is equal to positive or negative square root of 50. Then we just

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.930
use our knowledge of simplifying roots to get x is equal to plus or minus 5

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.744
times the square root of 2.
