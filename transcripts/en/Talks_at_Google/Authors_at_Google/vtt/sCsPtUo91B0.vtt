00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:08.310
INTERVIEWER: I was in
Albuquerque New Mexico.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.500
And as far as I remember, if
you go east, you get to Roswell.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.250
If you go west,
you get to the VLA.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.290
There's a desert, White Sands.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.380
There's lava rocks--
the lava canyons.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.280
I mean, the whole areas like out
of the science fiction story.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.420
So-- and there's a
rocket museum, right.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.260
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yup.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.172
INTERVIEWER: There's stuff
from V-2s to Apollo programs.

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:36.130
DANIEL ABRAHAM: We also
have the atomic museum,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.440
because we're pretty
close Trinity.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.900
Trinity site's in
the neighborhood too.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.941
INTERVIEWER: Trinity site
is in the neighborhood.

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:45.007
So I mean, is this where science
fiction writers should live?

00:00:45.007 --> 00:00:46.840
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Well,
we have a tremendous--

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.822
INTERVIEWER: The real
estate in Albuquerque--

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:51.780
DANIEL ABRAHAM: It's also
not really expensive.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.095
So that helps.

00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:54.970
TY FRANCK: Yeah, most
science fiction writers

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.580
are pretty broke.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.472
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yeah.

00:00:56.472 --> 00:00:59.400
INTERVIEWER: There will
be a spaceport that

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.926
is getting built out
there, the Virgin.

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:03.550
TY FRANCK: The Virgin
spaceport, right?

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.800
INTERVIEWER: Virgin spaceport.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.760
I mean, with Branson coming
in, like real estate--

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.000
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And
there are rumors,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.370
I don't think it's
been nailed down,

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.720
that the Tesla plant may
come play with us, too.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.300
TY FRANCK: Yeah,
the battery plant.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.030
DANIEL ABRAHAM:
So yeah, when you

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.350
have that much cheap
land good things happen.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.445
INTERVIEWER: Did you ever
use anything from that area?

00:01:30.445 --> 00:01:33.700
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yeah, actually
we did, with the third book.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.870
One of the things we've
been doing with the books

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.220
is kind of cycling in
and out new characters

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.614
to make the world that
we're writing in larger.

00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:45.530
And one of the things
we did in the third book

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.071
was we were looking
to say, you know.

00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:51.300
We haven't actually had
anybody from a really

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.000
unfamiliar culture, that
we'd like to put somebody

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.540
in that has a very
specific cultural identity

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.340
and a very, very
idiosyncratic way of moving

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.390
through the world.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.407
And we realized that the
thing that we actually

00:02:05.407 --> 00:02:06.990
knew that we could
draw from was being

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.660
a New Mexican, because
nobody's like us.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.535
TY FRANCK: Actually,
what we said

00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:17.040
was we need a culture that
is identifiably third world.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.862
And New Mexico was it.

00:02:18.862 --> 00:02:20.320
DANIEL ABRAHAM:
New Mexico's great.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.890
I mean, it's a
very strange place.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.480
My mother is an architect
and worked in New Mexico

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.740
her whole career.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.590
And she had a quote
above her desk

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.670
from Governor Lew Wallace, which
was, plans based on experience

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.702
elsewhere fail in New Mexico.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:41.819
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:42.860
INTERVIEWER: I love that.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.060
TY FRANCK: It's
also, I think, one

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.476
of the few places
in America where

00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:47.689
you can catch a
hemorrhagic fever.

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:48.980
So we've got that going for us.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.630
DANIEL ABRAHAM:
And bubonic plague.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.460
TY FRANCK: And bubonic plague.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.960
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And
we're number two

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.510
in the world for
necrotizing fasciitis.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.318
TY FRANCK: Yeah.

00:02:55.318 --> 00:02:57.230
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Woo hoo!

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.380
INTERVIEWER: So that's--

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.280
DANIEL ABRAHAM: You
know, it's what you have.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.360
You talk it up.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.730
INTERVIEWER: That's,
we're setting.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.270
We're setting here.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.340
Anyway, we came here because
probably most of the room

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.950
is interested in you work
on the Expanse series, which

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.240
as has been announced, has
been optioned, not optioned,

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.200
but will be produced
by the Syfy Channel.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.033
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yup.

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:27.790
INTERVIEWER: So we'll talk about
that later in our conversation.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.280
But I mean, can you
tell us briefly,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.840
because this has been probably
told over and over again,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.640
why the Expanse series?

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.860
How did that start?

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.954
TY FRANCK: Well, before
Daniel or after Daniel?

00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:43.370
DANIEL ABRAHAM:
Start with before.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.940
INTERVIEWER: Before.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.570
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Well,
there's so much before me.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.986
TY FRANCK: Yeah,
the before Daniel

00:03:46.986 --> 00:03:49.690
is a friend of mine
asked me to help

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.110
her develop a
pitch for an MMORP.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.800
And The Expanse is
what I came up with.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.900
And you can still see
the bones of it in there.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.630
At the time, "World of
Warcraft" still ruled the world.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.160
And we knew we couldn't
compete with them in fantasy.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.720
So we thought about
trying sci-fi.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.930
And "EVE Online" existed,
but the limitation of EVE

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.900
is you can't get out
of your spaceship.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.519
You pretty much, your
character is a spaceship.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.040
And we wanted to see if
it was possible to do one

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.100
where you fly around.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.474
But you can also
get out and have

00:04:21.474 --> 00:04:25.040
adventures in a human avatar.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.219
And so I came up with the idea.

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:28.760
And you could see
the bones in there,

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.555
because "World of
Warcraft" has two factions.

00:04:31.555 --> 00:04:32.930
We thought, hey,
we'll be better.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.870
We'll have three.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.592
So we have Earth,
Mars, and the OPA

00:04:36.592 --> 00:04:39.050
would be the three factions
where you would start the game.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.710
And all the various
moons and bases

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.210
were instances where you
would go to have adventures.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.847
And I put a bunch
of time into it

00:04:46.847 --> 00:04:49.430
and then turned out one of the
people working on it was crazy.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.730
And we all sort of just
backed away slowly.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.510
And then I just had this
huge binder full of stuff

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.010
and decided to play around with
it, running like a tabletop

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.470
game in that setting, just
to see if the setting worked,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.420
if there was anything
fun to do there.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.700
And that's when
Daniel showed up.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.449
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And Ty had
moved to Albuquerque and--

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.240
INTERVIEWER: Why'd you
move to Albuquerque?

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.740
TY FRANCK: My wife did
her undergraduate at UNM.

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:16.870
Yeah.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.286
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Because they
have really good architecture

00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:22.732
program and it's not
really expensive.

00:05:22.732 --> 00:05:23.690
INTERVIEWER: Good plug.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:24.710
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yeah.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.880
And I met Ty because
he came into my writers

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.400
group and my critique group.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.435
And I was solemnly
enjoined, as was everybody,

00:05:33.435 --> 00:05:36.670
that this couple was
moving to Albuquerque.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.430
And we should all
be nice to them.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.711
And so you know, sure.

00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:43.710
And it turned out we liked
them, so that helped.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.790
And we would like the
geographically nearest to them

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.520
of everybody in the group.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.540
And I got to do his
role playing game.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.310
And we played a few nights.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.430
And I saw his three ring binder.

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.710
He had a three binder
that thick full

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.380
of all of the world
building stuff

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.300
and all of the information
about the settings.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.980
And any time I asked
him a question,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.160
he just knew the answer.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.150
So I could say, well, we're
in this space station.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.680
What do the quarters look like?

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.070
And he could just tell me.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.220
And I kind of got into
the game, to the point

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.590
that I was like writing email at
3:00 in the morning saying, OK.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.290
I can understand
now how we can, I

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.872
know how we can redo
the monetary system

00:06:28.872 --> 00:06:29.580
so that it works.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.450
And as this political break
down goes, we can take the debt.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.536
And he was like you know,
it's 3:00 in the morning.

00:06:35.536 --> 00:06:39.525
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:39.525 --> 00:06:41.150
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And
what I was thinking

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.920
was he's done all
the world building.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.150
And the world building
is not my favorite part.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.680
So maybe we could just
take that and use it.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.510
And so I went to him and said,
we should make this a book.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:03.230
And the plan at the
time was to do a book,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:09.366
and sell it for pizza money,
and have had a fun adventure.

00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:12.470
And then we kind of overshot.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.886
INTERVIEWER: Which
is always good.

00:07:13.886 --> 00:07:15.284
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yeah.

00:07:15.284 --> 00:07:17.900
INTERVIEWER: Ty, how did you
feel about like the whole book

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:18.400
thing.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.750
I mean, was that ever
in your plans, or--

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.110
TY FRANCK: I-- as you can
see from my job history,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.360
I'm sort of a creature
of the moment.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.225
I just wander from
thing to thing.

00:07:29.225 --> 00:07:31.100
And so when he said,
hey, we should try this.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.974
I was like, yeah, OK.

00:07:31.974 --> 00:07:33.010
I haven't done that yet.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.970
Let's try that.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:38.494
And based on my experience,
100% of the time when

00:07:38.494 --> 00:07:40.910
you write a book, it will be
an international best seller.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.340
And you'll get a TV show.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.800
So that seems like
a good thing to do.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:47.710
INTERVIEWER: So will this
stop you from wandering now?

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.430
TY FRANCK: No.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.930
No.

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:51.675
No, I'm a person who gets
bored very quickly, so--

00:07:51.675 --> 00:07:53.550
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yeah,
it's kind of astounding

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.852
that he's still doing this.

00:07:55.852 --> 00:07:57.810
TY FRANCK: Well, they
keep buying more of them.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.912
DANIEL ABRAHAM: I know.

00:07:58.912 --> 00:08:00.620
TY FRANCK: I was like
three, and I'm out.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.871
And then they're like now, no.

00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:03.203
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Six and I'm out.

00:08:03.203 --> 00:08:04.620
TY FRANCK: Six and then nine.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.078
DANIEL ABRAHAM:
Nine I'm out there.

00:08:06.078 --> 00:08:06.782
TY FRANCK: Yeah.

00:08:06.782 --> 00:08:10.000
DANIEL ABRAHAM:
Yeah, you're stuck.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.712
INTERVIEWER: Space operas could
last for a long time, right.

00:08:12.712 --> 00:08:14.420
DANIEL ABRAHAM: You
know, it was really--

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.437
INTERVIEWER: Epics.

00:08:16.437 --> 00:08:18.770
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yes, and yet
when we started writing it,

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.350
all of our friends
were telling us not to.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.892
Because science
fiction has been kind

00:08:23.892 --> 00:08:25.933
of going through this
phase where it like totally

00:08:25.933 --> 00:08:26.550
didn't sell.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:27.596
And they were
saying oh, you know

00:08:27.596 --> 00:08:29.000
what's really
selling is fantasy.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.315
You should write an epic
swords and sorcery fantasy.

00:08:31.315 --> 00:08:33.440
And I was like, but he
didn't do the world building

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.202
for that, so no.

00:08:35.202 --> 00:08:37.159
INTERVIEWER: That was easy.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.049
TY FRANCK: Fantasy is for hacks.

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:39.919
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.460
DANIEL ABRAHAM: You
guys know he used

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.959
to work for George
RR Martin, right.

00:08:42.959 --> 00:08:46.550
He can say those things.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.700
And so, yeah, the
expectation going

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.460
in by a bunch of our
peers was that it

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.910
would fail because
it was space opera,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.460
and because that was not a genre
that had an audience anymore.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:06.350
And there has been some
reconsideration since then.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:09.510
INTERVIEWER: And it obviously
didn't, but on the contrary,

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:10.719
it has a massive following.

00:09:10.719 --> 00:09:13.010
I've been reading a little
bit about "Leviathan Wakes."

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:16.640
You know, I found some
people really enjoyed it.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.070
So "Leviathan Wakes"
manages to star

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.350
both a world-weary detective
and an idealistic space captain

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.130
with a smart mouthed
love interest

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:29.430
and a wise-cracking ship's
crew in the background.

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.580
It's also just impossible
to stop reading.

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.980
It's also funny without
trying too hard and thoughtful

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:37.800
without being overly
constructed or preachy.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.960
It's the book I
have been looking

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.740
for every time I
picked up a space epic.

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.721
I just didn't know
until I found it.

00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:46.560
I like that one.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.205
DANIEL ABRAHAM: That was sweet.

00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:48.070
TY FRANCK: That was nice.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.695
Who wrote that?

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:55.550
INTERVIEWER: So
writing space epics

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.440
may seen as not the
real science fiction,

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.970
not the high brow like--

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.260
TY FRANCK: No.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:05.780
And it's deliberately not.

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.280
INTERVIEWER: It is
deliberately not.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.950
But that being said,
I mean, I think

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:17.200
we can agree the three of us
easily that's what goes on

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.940
with the characters and
what goes on in the plots,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.930
I mean, borrows from the
world and let us actually

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.890
see today's world
through a different lens

00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:28.960
in some respects.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:33.317
So it's not completely isolated
from the human experience.

00:10:33.317 --> 00:10:35.150
Can you perhaps expand
a little bit on that?

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.490
TY FRANCK: There's, I mean,
I don't remember who said it,

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:39.270
but somebody talking
about science fiction

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.050
said every science fiction
novel is written about the time

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.670
that it's written in.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:46.170
So that's why all the science
fiction in the '40s and '50s

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:50.410
is about invasion of the
other, with the Red Scare,

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.380
and all of that.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.580
The science fiction
of the '70s and '80s

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.120
tended to be sort
of post apocalyptic.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.290
And so I mean, you don't intend
to do those things, I think.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.550
I mean, maybe some people
do, but we're not that smart.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.670
But it's going to
sneak in there.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.690
We found out after we wrote
it that we were writing

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.254
about WikiLeaks before
WikiLeaks happened.

00:11:13.254 --> 00:11:15.420
Because we actually wrote
the book before WikiLeaks.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.700
And then everybody's
like, oh this book

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:21.120
was clearly written about
freedom of information.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.290
We didn't mean to be about that.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:26.198
But it turned out
we kind of were.

00:11:26.198 --> 00:11:27.570
INTERVIEWER: Interesting.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.890
We should probably open
it to the audience.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.210
Let's mix in some questions.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.670
AUDIENCE: So what
science fiction writers

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.830
do you guys read?

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.980
And maybe you could divide
it up into like classic

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.935
versus like the
newer generation.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.090
TY FRANCK: So classics,
my favorite classic book

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.600
of all time is "Stars My
Destination" by Alfred Bester.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.375
And you can see
"Stars My Destination"

00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:55.700
all over in the stuff I write.

00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:57.570
I read it when I
was about 11, which

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:00.240
was way too young to
be reading that book.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.210
But it was the perfect time
to have it reset my brain,

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.470
so that my brain now is the
version that has been reset

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:08.810
by "Stars My Destination."

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.710
In the new stuff, I'm
a big John Scalzi fan

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.190
and have been since
the beginning.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:17.010
I do I like the
project he's doing,

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:19.840
which is to write old
school sci-fi without racism

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.030
and sexism, which is kind of the
same thing I want to be doing.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:29.630
But yet probably those
two-- and it's more horror,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:32.680
but I love Joe Hill's stuff.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.150
I guess that's more
horror than sci-fi.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.350
DANIEL ABRAHAM: I grew up-- my
first kind of science fiction

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:42.250
experience was "Nine
Billion Names of God"

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.560
by Arthur Clarke, which
kind of broke my head.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.210
And I've never
entirely recovered.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.849
But I read a lot of Larry Niven.

00:12:49.849 --> 00:12:51.140
I read a lot of Harry Harrison.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:55.570
I read a lot of Arthur Clarke.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.840
I read some Heinlein, but I kind
of came to Heinlein too late.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.930
By the ti-- you kind
of need to hit Heinlein

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:10.240
when you're too young
to see how it's dated.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.710
Because the first Heinlein
I read, I was in my '20s

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:16.030
and it was "Stranger
in a Strange Land."

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.140
And that was oddly
anticlimactic,

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:21.600
having read-- heard about
how important Heinlein was.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.570
To come that, I was
thinking really?

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.680
OK.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:30.260
More recently, I will
follow Kim Stanley Robinson

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.060
pretty much any
place he wants to go.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:37.580
And I will hold up Ted Chiang
as the best science fiction

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.460
author.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:44.860
If anybody here has not read
the short stories of Ted Chiang,

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.881
I got something for you.

00:13:46.881 --> 00:13:49.960
You can thank me later.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.654
He has a collection
out there, I think

00:13:52.654 --> 00:13:54.070
"A Story of Your
Life and Others?"

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:54.330
Is that--

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.190
TY FRANCK: "Stories
of Your Life."

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.731
DANIEL ABRAHAM:
"Stories of Your Life

00:13:56.731 --> 00:13:59.930
and Others," that is literally
the best science fiction

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:01.626
that has been written.

00:14:01.626 --> 00:14:02.602
TY FRANCK: Yeah.

00:14:02.602 --> 00:14:05.140
And sort of a bridging
between the Heinlein

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.035
and the modern stuff, Joe
Haldeman, one of my favorites.

00:14:08.035 --> 00:14:09.910
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yeah,
Joe Haldeman's amazing.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:13.855
TY FRANCK: All of
his stuff is great.

00:14:13.855 --> 00:14:15.500
INTERVIEWER: Go ahead.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.500
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the world building part.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.810
Could you talk a little bit more
about how you do collaboration?

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:22.860
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Sure.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.150
Collaboration is
a game and needs

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:26.720
to be designed like a game.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.180
And because I-- when
we started this,

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.230
I had actually written
several novels.

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:36.360
I had like six or
seven, I don't know.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.910
But Ty hadn't
written any novels.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.950
And so I got to kind
of claim authority

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.370
that I probably didn't
actually have and tell them

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.350
how it all works.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.820
And so I could make up rules and
he would know they were crap.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:53.870
So I could say things like
chapters are 3,000 words long.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.640
Which I think is
true, but other people

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.230
think maybe that's a little OCD.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.324
That's OK.

00:15:00.324 --> 00:15:01.240
Ty didn't know better.

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.700
So he went along with it.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.370
And so what we do, at least for
"Leviathan Wakes," the first

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.360
one, we did that on Wednesdays.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.832
Because it was Ty's day off.

00:15:09.832 --> 00:15:11.290
And he would come
over to my place.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:12.010
Or I would go over to his place.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.700
And we'd go through the outline.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.430
We had a whole outline of what
the book was supposed to be,

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.480
broken into chapters.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.060
AUDIENCE: Was that also
done collaboratively, or--

00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:21.310
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yes.

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.990
We did that collaboratively.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.880
And the thing about the master
outline is that it's wrong.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.790
And you should just expect that.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:32.390
So we did this outline that
was how it was all going to be.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.767
And then every Wednesday,
we'd take one chapter for Ty

00:15:36.767 --> 00:15:39.440
and one chapter for me
and outlined exactly what

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.680
was going to happen
in those 3,000 words.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.860
And I'd write mine.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.860
Then Ty'd write his.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:44.740
And then we'd swap.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:45.820
And I'd edit his.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.660
And he'd edit mine.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:49.355
And we'd put it on the back
of the master document.

00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:52.120
And after about
10 of those, we'd

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.770
see how the master outline was
completely wrong for the rest

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:55.090
them.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.440
The first 10 chapters,
those were fine.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.398
But then that's totally
not what happens later.

00:15:58.398 --> 00:15:59.611
And so we'd redo the outline.

00:15:59.611 --> 00:16:01.360
And then we'd do about
another 10 chapters

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.250
and see the last 2/3 we
have are completely wrong.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.720
And then we'd redo the outline.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.490
INTERVIEWER: In what
ways does it change?

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:11.400
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Well,
lots of different ways.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.890
The actions that
you think are going

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:18.360
to take five chapters to really
unfold, you do in 2,000 words.

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.450
And then you think, oh shit.

00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:25.320
And sometimes the characters who
you've put in who you thought

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.730
were really minor
characters turn out

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:28.860
to be really interesting.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.500
And you want to spend
more time with them.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:30.710
INTERVIEWER: Exploring them.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:33.251
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And they have
something to say about the plot

00:16:33.251 --> 00:16:35.627
that you weren't expecting to
have a graceful way to say.

00:16:35.627 --> 00:16:37.417
And then you have a
graceful way to say it,

00:16:37.417 --> 00:16:38.510
so you kind of do that.

00:16:38.510 --> 00:16:42.550
I mean, we have
friends who are very

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.760
into just exploring
the text as you go

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:48.480
and not really having
that hard plant

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.660
because they feel
like it takes away

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.800
the spontaneity of writing.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.144
That is not our experience.

00:16:58.144 --> 00:17:00.310
AUDIENCE: And should I take
anything out of the fact

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.340
that that was the most
non-collaborative answer

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.825
that I've ever seen?

00:17:03.825 --> 00:17:05.450
DANIEL ABRAHAM: No,
we just, you know--

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.940
AUDIENCE: He didn't say a word.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.849
DANIEL ABRAHAM: You
want to say something?

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:11.341
TY FRANCK: Yeah, what
Daniel said mostly.

00:17:11.341 --> 00:17:14.197
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:14.197 --> 00:17:15.280
INTERVIEWER: There you go.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.710
Let me-- actually
so Ty, what did you

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:23.995
teach Daniel in
this whole process?

00:17:23.995 --> 00:17:25.869
TY FRANCK: I mean, I
started out teaching him

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.970
what the world looks like.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:29.660
And--

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.880
INTERVIEWER: The constructed
world or this world?

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.770
TY FRANCK: Well, both probably.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:37.721
He was shockingly
naive when [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:37.721 --> 00:17:43.980
But the constructed
world, but also

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.850
helping him find the voice that
Jimmy needed to have, I think.

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.160
One of the stories he didn't
tell about when we first

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.260
started is he actually wrote the
prologue and the first chapter.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:58.760
And the voice was all wrong.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.610
And I don't know how I knew
that, but I knew in my head

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:03.030
it was the wrong voice.

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:05.090
So I rewrote them.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.600
And then he wrote
the second chapter.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.200
And we alternated
from there on out.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.340
But sort of a jointly
targeting in on what

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.700
that voice was
supposed to be like.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.410
Because Daniel had
done almost entirely

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.250
epic fantasy up to that point.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:25.290
And there's a voice that works
in epic fantasy that is not,

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.825
we call him Jimmy, the pen name.

00:18:26.825 --> 00:18:27.950
But it's not Jimmy's voice.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.658
Jimmy has as a different
voice than that.

00:18:29.658 --> 00:18:33.720
Jimmy is much more sort
of that '70s sci-fi

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.544
kind of just to the point.

00:18:35.544 --> 00:18:36.460
Here is what happened.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.760
Here is just simple
declarative sentences.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:39.852
Not a lot of purple prose.

00:18:39.852 --> 00:18:42.060
DANIEL ABRAHAM: I was going
to say pacing and action.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.690
TY FRANCK: And pacing
and action, yeah.

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.260
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Were not
my strong suits going in.

00:18:46.260 --> 00:18:48.452
TY FRANCK: Well, so Daniel
has this thing where--

00:18:48.452 --> 00:18:49.910
and he'll be the
first to admit it,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.560
so I'm not telling
tales about him,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.210
where when he's
working on his own,

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.470
he tends to write
his way into books.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.880
So the first, I don't
know, what would you

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:01.052
say, like 20% of a book,
somewhere in that--

00:19:01.052 --> 00:19:02.510
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Is
all set up and--

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:03.030
TY FRANCK: Yeah.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.590
And he's figuring
out what the book's

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.440
going to be about by writing it.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.060
I replace all of
that with explosions.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.920
So even in the
project, his fantasy

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.690
project he's working
on now, I helped him

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.240
sort of with some of the
early world building in.

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.130
And I read some of the early
stuff and I would say, OK.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:25.662
So you have this part here.

00:19:25.662 --> 00:19:26.870
And it's beautifully written.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.920
And it's people thinking
about their place in the world

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.310
and thinking about their lives.

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:34.240
And maybe you should replace
it with a sword fight.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.810
So yeah, definitely in
pacing it's different.

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.580
And what's interesting is
that his new epic fantasy

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:45.880
series, which is great, reads
more like our joint project

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.280
than like his first
solo project, I think.

00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.356
If he taught me that
chapters are 3,000 words

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.730
and how to write
a novel, I think

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.860
maybe I taught him how to write
more sword fights or something.

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:55.901
INTERVIEWER: Interesting.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.410
AUDIENCE: So maybe
this is a question

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.890
for Ty about the world building.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:09.990
Given that this is more like
hard science fiction, where

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.240
things are-- I mean,
the science is real.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.672
How did that affect the
world that-- I mean,

00:20:15.672 --> 00:20:17.380
where there things
that you wanted to do,

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.660
where you did research
and you were like oh, no.

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.460
Not possible.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:21.207
Not plausible.

00:20:21.207 --> 00:20:21.790
TY FRANCK: No.

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:26.090
I never let facts get
in the way of awesome.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:29.144
But people claim that
it's hard science fiction.

00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:30.060
But it's actually not.

00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:33.270
You know, you buy
plausibility so cheaply.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.850
We just, we have
gravity work the way

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.390
that gravity actually works.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.765
And just by doing that, you're
like oh, it's hard sci-fi.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:43.540
I mean, it really
is cheap stuff.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.020
I mean, w I did
some research on how

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.970
what I think fusion
reactors will work.

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:52.200
And just said, yeah, OK.

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.300
They work that way.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.270
I did some research on one
theoretical engine design,

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:02.860
super theoretical, that
would get rid of the heat--

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.020
so the problem with constant
thrust in spaceships

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.870
is you burn through all
your fuel really quickly.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:10.679
And you heat the
ship up too much.

00:21:10.679 --> 00:21:12.220
So there was this
one design somebody

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.803
was theorizing that
you would actually

00:21:13.803 --> 00:21:15.350
use the heat to conserve fuel.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.520
And so I just pretended
that that works.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.400
And we called the
up steam drive.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.410
But we're never going
to explain what that is.

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.314
Because any minute
now, somebody will

00:21:25.314 --> 00:21:26.980
realize that that
doesn't actually work.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.560
And then we'll look stupid.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:34.350
So what we mostly do is just
take the really easy stuff

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.900
like gravity and
put it in there.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.860
And then people think
it's harder than it is.

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.084
But to answer your
question, the cool thing

00:21:42.084 --> 00:21:44.500
that comes out of that is the
few things that you do keep,

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.880
like we keep a
light delay, those

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.320
don't actually
become hindrances.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.966
They become plot points.

00:21:50.966 --> 00:21:53.340
Because it's really interesting
when somebody desperately

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.710
needs to talk to
somebody else and they

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:56.626
have to wait an hour and
a half for an answer,

00:21:56.626 --> 00:21:58.540
because that's not
our experience now.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.930
I'll call you on the phone
and then at most, the delay

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:02.596
is going to be like
a tenth of a second,

00:22:02.596 --> 00:22:05.200
even when I'm talking
to across the world.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.945
When we have characters who
desperately need information,

00:22:07.945 --> 00:22:10.070
and they're sending a
request for that information.

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:11.359
And then you'll wait.

00:22:11.359 --> 00:22:13.900
And you know, I just picture it
like the little spinning ball

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:14.920
on your screen.

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.570
Like, OK it's three hours
until I can get an answer back

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.340
from this.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.040
And its cool when ships take
awhile to get somewhere.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.290
I desperately need to get
here and solve this problem.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:28.400
And three weeks from
now, I'll be there.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.910
those become cool plot
points that actually come out

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:35.520
of trying to keep at least
a little plotably realistic.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.865
Daniel calls it Wikipedia
level plausibility,

00:22:37.865 --> 00:22:40.205
which is pretty much
what it should be called.

00:22:40.205 --> 00:22:41.705
DANIEL ABRAHAM: You
need a standard.

00:22:44.579 --> 00:22:45.120
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.580
So my turn, I guess.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.980
One of the things that I
really loved about the books

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.840
was that every time I
picked up a new one,

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.190
it was like the story
was completely fresh.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:57.410
You started with a
brand new people.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.450
And it was like it
was a whole new book.

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:01.740
And yet you got
pulled in to wherever

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.350
you left off the last book.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:08.760
So what I was wondering
was about the series that's

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.830
going to come out
on Syfy is it going

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:12.980
to be sort of like "Game
of Thrones," where you're

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.521
going to do--
seriously, where you're

00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:17.080
going to do the first
series as the first book.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.380
And then the second
series will start fresh,

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.040
just like the second book did?

00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.847
That was really a lovely
thing about the series.

00:23:24.847 --> 00:23:26.430
DANIEL ABRAHAM: This
is the part where

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.920
if we say the
wrong thing, ninjas

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.650
come down from the
ceiling and kill us.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:31.240
AUDIENCE: Sorry about that.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:32.323
DANIEL ABRAHAM: That's OK.

00:23:32.323 --> 00:23:34.990
No, that's a fair question.

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.820
I cannot-- I know the
answer to that question.

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:40.894
And I cannot tell you the
answer to that question.

00:23:40.894 --> 00:23:42.810
But I can say that the
answer to that question

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:44.240
makes me very happy.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.124
AUDIENCE: Excellent.

00:23:45.124 --> 00:23:45.624
OK.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.580
INTERVIEWER: So actually,
let me interject here.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:54.510
So the reason-- the technical
reason we're here today,

00:23:54.510 --> 00:24:00.490
let's not forget that OK, is
the latest book in the series.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.850
Help me with the pronunciation
is it "seebola"--?

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:03.850
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Cilbola.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:04.800
INTERVIEWER: Cibola.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:07.960
So you have books in the back.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:13.340
So they are at the
subsidized price as well.

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.910
What can you tell us about
the latest installment

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:17.362
without divulging--

00:24:17.362 --> 00:24:19.070
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Without
all the spoilers?

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.740
Well--

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.470
INTERVIEWER: With all
the spoilers, yeah.

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:22.190
DANIEL ABRAHAM: It
turns out they're all--

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.960
INTERVIEWER: Let
me actually read

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.440
what I found about the book.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.650
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Go for it.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.460
INTERVIEWER: I'm sure you
will be interested as well.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:32.860
So there are many points,
POWs, not POWs-- there

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.530
are many points of
view in "Cibola Burn."

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:38.460
But it does my
favorite thing when

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.970
it comes to stories like this.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.160
It connects them all and
tells an interwoven story,

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:48.570
sort of like a massive
four-sided Venn diagram.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.710
"Cibola Burn" also
brings back one

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:54.760
of the best parts about this
series, the delicate politics

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.390
between the inner
and outer planets.

00:24:57.390 --> 00:25:00.750
The politics and the alien,
horror, mystery elements

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.400
are blended well, giving us
a very interesting storyline

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.390
to follow.

00:25:05.390 --> 00:25:08.040
Another huge thing that
I like about this series

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:11.340
is that they get
the biology right.

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:14.700
More science fiction focuses
on physics or mathematics

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.990
and then butcher
the biology parts.

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:18.710
This doesn't.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.180
This is the science
fiction series

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.910
you need to be
currently reading.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:24.550
How about that?

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:25.210
DANIEL ABRAHAM: That's nice.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.240
I'm glad they thought so.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.531
TY FRANCK: Nice of them to say.

00:25:27.531 --> 00:25:30.640
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Nice-- I'm glad
we didn't butcher the biology.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.980
TY FRANCK: So the one
degree we have between us

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.280
is Daniel has a
degree in biology.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.880
So we like to put
biology into the books,

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.360
because it's the one thing
we kind of know about.

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.570
Yeah, so that's why-- and again,
Wikipedia level plausibility.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:48.960
The thing we got right
is that not everything

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.520
uses DNA as its stable
replicator strands.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.324
So just--

00:25:53.324 --> 00:25:54.740
DANIEL ABRAHAM:
Well, we did that.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.698
And we have some of the
chirality works the way

00:25:56.698 --> 00:25:58.940
that chirality
works, in the idea

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:03.330
of things evolving over
several different iterations,

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:04.154
like flight.

00:26:04.154 --> 00:26:05.820
There's more than one
time that evolved.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.550
Because it's just a good idea.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.200
And sight, you know,
that kind of sensory--

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.920
TY FRANCK: It's the
one Dawkins calls

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.780
good moves in designs space.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:15.000
DANIEL ABRAHAM: It's not
Dawkins, it's Dennett.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:15.530
TY FRANCK: Dennett, thank you.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:16.946
INTERVIEWER:
Interestingly enough,

00:26:16.946 --> 00:26:22.300
yesterday on [? KKD ?] there was
a talk about the electric fish.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.540
And they evolved five or six
times through the evolution.

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.950
I mean it's a good idea.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.474
And keeps re-evolving,
even if the species gets--

00:26:29.474 --> 00:26:30.890
TY FRANCK: Eyes
are really useful.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.930
So eyes have shown up a
bunch of different times.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:36.290
Wings are really useful.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.248
Wings have shown up a
bunch of different times.

00:26:38.248 --> 00:26:40.820
It's amazing the
number of times poison

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.220
has evolved in totally
separate species

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.340
as a defense or an attack.

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:48.300
Some things just work.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.190
And then the other
one that we used

00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:54.670
is the fact that, depending on
your evolutionary tree, what

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.530
might be somebody's
vital protein

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:58.780
is deadly poison for you.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.630
And the odds of those
things perfectly

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:02.969
overlapping in any two
separately evolving biology

00:27:02.969 --> 00:27:03.760
is pretty much nil.

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.950
So things like the
stinging insects

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.275
that sting you in "Cibola
Burn" just fall over dead

00:27:09.275 --> 00:27:10.650
immediately after
they sting you.

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:11.150
Because--

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:13.108
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Ah ha,
I have taken your blood.

00:27:13.108 --> 00:27:13.610
Oh, crap.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.820
TY FRANCK: Yeah, your
blood is full of poison.

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:20.550
Just little things like that
can make it seem like we said,

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:21.820
Wikipedia level plausibility.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:24.390
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And as
I said, world building

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.950
is not my favorite thing to do.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.860
So the fact that I'd spent
four years learning this stuff

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.240
means I can just mime that.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.290
I don't have to do any
additional research.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:33.970
So that's nice.

00:27:36.897 --> 00:27:38.980
AUDIENCE: So I don't know
if you faced this issue,

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.300
but a lot of books which
have multiple authors

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.490
have trouble reconciling
the different writing

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:44.890
styles of the different authors.

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.140
So what steps did you take
to ensure that your writing

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.720
style was uniform and
consistent across chapters

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.520
and across books?

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.210
TY FRANCK: Uh, none.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:54.840
DANIEL ABRAHAM: We
got really lucky.

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.971
But it's not true.

00:27:55.971 --> 00:27:56.970
We did get really lucky.

00:27:56.970 --> 00:28:00.430
But we also spent a lot
of time at the front

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:03.440
of the project talking
about what exactly

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.132
we were trying to
achieve with it.

00:28:05.132 --> 00:28:07.340
And one of the things that's
been really interesting.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.160
We've been in LA for
the last few weeks

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.119
working on the TV show.

00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:11.576
And one of the
things that's really

00:28:11.576 --> 00:28:13.240
interesting about
the horror stories

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.620
we hear about other projects
that have gone off the rails

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:20.150
is the degree to
which the problem

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:24.990
is people don't agree
what they're doing.

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.830
So we have one
example, which I will

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.780
take all the serial numbers off.

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.890
There was a project
where they went

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:38.550
in thinking it was
a gritty police

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.820
procedural until
somebody with power

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.890
came in and thought it
was a buddy cop comedy.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:50.600
And when you have people
working at different projects

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:54.400
on the same project,
you're kind of boned.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.950
We spent a lot of time agreeing
what it was we were writing.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:02.760
And that actually informs a
lot of the aesthetic decisions

00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:04.150
within the page.

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:08.720
TY FRANCK: And at a tactical
level, a part of what it is

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:11.430
is that we edit each
other's chapters.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.160
So we both write a chapter.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.050
We swap them.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:14.810
I edit his.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.220
He edits mine.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.010
And I think that's where
Jimmy's voice comes from

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:22.897
is I sand off all
the edges that don't

00:29:22.897 --> 00:29:24.230
sound like Jimmy in his chapter.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.300
And he sands off
all the ones that

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.020
don't sound like
Jimmy in my chapter.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:31.110
And we actually re-edit
the book two or three times

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.260
before it actually goes
out to the publisher.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.880
And by the time
that's done, we've

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.400
both tinkered with it
enough that it becomes

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.530
hard to tell who
wrote which sentence.

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.280
DANIEL ABRAHAM: We
were having an argument

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.760
last night, because
we were looking

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.218
at the-- one of the things you
can find when book comes out

00:29:47.218 --> 00:29:49.470
is what people are highlighting.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:50.440
And we were saying, OK.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.830
Oh, they really like this quote.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:53.990
Who wrote that?

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:56.340
Well, it's in my chapter.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.860
But it doesn't sound like me.

00:29:57.860 --> 00:29:59.880
So I think that may
be one you added.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.160
We know don't know.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.466
We don't know who wrote what.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.810
AUDIENCE: So my
question is did writing

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:12.530
any part of "The Expanse" series
send you to emotional extremes,

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.720
make you gleeful
or make you cry?

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:18.690
And if so, which parts?

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:21.730
DANIEL ABRAHAM: There were
some parts I struggled with.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:28.064
Specifically, the
hard part was Ty

00:30:28.064 --> 00:30:29.480
really had to talk
me into killing

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.980
some people one time or another.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:34.450
There were some people I
really didn't want to kill.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.400
And I was, look.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.191
You know, but we
don't-- we could do it,

00:30:37.191 --> 00:30:38.190
we could do it this way.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.110
And he was like, no.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.650
No.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:40.149
No.

00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:41.020
You're wimping out.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.060
I was like, yes.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.300
Yes, I am wimping out.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.240
All right.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:52.400
And we had to just
suck it up and do that.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.960
As far as gleeful, pretty
much any time we're

00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.340
writing [? Avasorada ?]
or Amos, psssh.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:04.160
Those are just too
much fun to do.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.710
And there's some really lovely
little touching moments.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:09.430
The one with the-- one of the
quotes that we were talking

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:15.960
about from this one was a kind
of aspirational moral statement

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:25.460
that one of the characters
makes that I can really

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:32.890
wish we made as a
larger audience.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:37.670
And those are-- those
get me sometimes.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.080
Do you have emotions?

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:41.109
TY FRANCK: No, I mostly don't.

00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:42.900
I am the one who argues
for killing people.

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:45.280
I really like
writing whenever Amos

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.540
beats somebody up
or shoots them.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:49.460
I have to say Amos is my id.

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:55.970
Amos does all the things I would
like to be doing but don't.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.421
It's-- I joke about this.

00:31:57.421 --> 00:31:59.170
But in role playing
games, I almost always

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.510
play like the barbarian
with the strength of 20

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.760
and the intelligence of three.

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.180
Because I love simple
characters who have one

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.790
solve for every problem.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:11.960
If the problem is not solved
by hitting it with an axe,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:14.260
I'll just wait while
you guys do whatever.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.190
As soon as you need something
hit with an axe, I'm there.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:18.740
And Amos is sort of that guy.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:19.650
He's a hammer.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:21.000
Everything looks like a nail.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.120
And it's really kind of freeing
and fun to write those guys.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:32.130
AUDIENCE: So there was a
time, like '70s, '80s--

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.171
like, I grew up reading
a lot of science fiction,

00:32:34.171 --> 00:32:36.460
like Asimov and all those guys.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:38.854
And in the last
decade, the media

00:32:38.854 --> 00:32:40.020
has shifted over to fantasy.

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.710
Like everyone talks about
George Martin and like,

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:45.480
even your old "The Long Price
Quartet" and all the fantasy

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.860
books that you wrote.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.520
And any theories on why that's
happening, like the science

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:52.800
fiction has dramatically
reduced, at least in terms of--

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.696
TY FRANCK: Yeah, I have
a theory about that.

00:32:54.696 --> 00:32:56.070
But it's not a
popular-- it's not

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:59.800
one that makes me popular with
other science fiction writers.

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.470
I think Daniel
agrees with me, which

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:02.928
is why we're able
to work together.

00:33:02.928 --> 00:33:04.530
But I think there
was a stretch there

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:08.330
where science fiction got
really punishing to read.

00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:11.200
It became deeply
unpleasant to read.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.960
And in fact, there was a sort of
movement within science fiction

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.870
that if you were writing
science fiction that

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:24.300
was fun or pleasant to read,
that you were selling out.

00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:27.330
And so during that
period, science fiction

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.980
sort of collapsed in on
itself and became increasingly

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:34.110
about a bunch of guys
writing for each other.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.680
Daniel compares
it to fusion jazz.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.750
You know, I'm a fusion
jazz man He is not.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.240
But there's like--

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:40.700
DANIEL ABRAHAM: He's a musician.

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:41.250
I'm not.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.250
TY FRANCK: There like 12
people in the world who

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.400
care about fusion jazz.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.670
And they all write
songs for each other.

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.640
And unless you're
into that scene,

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.370
you just don't have the
vocabulary to understand it.

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:56.320
When you're doing a lot of
weird time and key changes,

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:58.860
it's not pleasant to listen to.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.310
It's challenging to listen to.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:02.680
And so you wind up with a
bunch of science fiction

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:07.440
that was like that, where it
became more important to have

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.429
like this incredibly
well thought out

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:12.573
what would happen if
this one thing changed

00:34:12.573 --> 00:34:13.739
in all the societal changes.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:15.800
But we don't care
about the characters.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.250
We just care about really
tearing apart this one idea.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:21.190
And to understand
if you have to have

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:23.469
read all the same
books I've read.

00:34:23.469 --> 00:34:26.417
And if you haven't, then
you're not going to get it.

00:34:26.417 --> 00:34:28.500
And it's no wonder they
chased their audience off.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.916
DANIEL ABRAHAM:
There was actually

00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:35.060
one fairly influential
voice in science fiction

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.570
who argued
un-ironically that plot

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:41.230
got in the way of
good science fiction,

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.860
that what you needed
for real science fiction

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:51.610
was almost speculative
essay, rather than story.

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:54.270
And that was a very
influential view

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:57.080
and is a very influential view.

00:34:57.080 --> 00:35:03.940
And accessibility isn't
seen as often as a virtue.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:08.540
It's not something--
the idea of reaching out

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.730
to folks who aren't
already really

00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:15.300
sophisticated with
this particular group

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:21.897
of expectations and customs
is somehow dishonorable.

00:35:21.897 --> 00:35:22.980
TY FRANCK: And meanwhile--

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.110
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And
fantasy didn't do that.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:24.960
TY FRANCK: Yeah, no,
I was going to say,

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.910
meanwhile the fantasy
writers went out and wrote

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.160
interesting stories about
interesting characters doing

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:29.940
interesting stuff.

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.564
And yeah, everybody
went and read that.

00:35:31.564 --> 00:35:33.300
Of course they did.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:37.120
We're kind of hoping to
jump on the bandwagon that

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.420
drives it back the
other direction.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:41.780
And to be fair, we weren't
the first ones to do it.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.770
I mean, I think "Old Man's
War," John Scalzi's book,

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.072
was really the first one that
said, hey, you know what.

00:35:47.072 --> 00:35:49.530
Maybe we could write about
stuff that's fun and interesting

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:52.690
and doesn't have to
be like six pages

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:54.800
where we discuss the
math of how this works.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.480
Which is cool for
people who like math.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.370
But for the rest of us,
it's not that exciting.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.647
AUDIENCE: So actually feeding a
little bit off the answer that

00:36:06.647 --> 00:36:08.980
you guys just gave, but-- and
segueway into my question,

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.300
but I don't know to the extent
to which you were talking about

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.840
the cyberpunk sort of
movement in that answer, but--

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.730
DANIEL ABRAHAM: A lot.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.570
AUDIENCE: I figured.

00:36:21.570 --> 00:36:24.250
But one interesting
thing that I think runs

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.500
through cyberpunk and then
into your guys' book, which

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.208
you may have actually
picked up from them

00:36:28.208 --> 00:36:30.500
is sort of a noir feeling
to a certain extent.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.510
And I think Miller
sort of captures

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.280
that as sort of
like the tough cop,

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:40.809
the guy, the hard boiled, if
you will, sort of aspect to it.

00:36:40.809 --> 00:36:42.850
And do you guys agree with
that characterization?

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.220
I've read it in certain places.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.060
But do you agree with that?

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.101
And if so, kind of, was
that a conscious pick up,

00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:49.425
or is that you just
decided that's how he was?

00:36:49.425 --> 00:36:51.300
DANIEL ABRAHAM: I got
a long one on this one.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:51.966
Do you want do--

00:36:51.966 --> 00:36:54.840
TY FRANCK: Well, the noir
didn't come from cyberpunk.

00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:57.190
It came because Daniel's
a big fan of noir.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:37:00.320
And he was writing
the Miller chapters.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:04.610
Each of the books kind of
steals from one genre or another

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:06.090
and marries it to
science fiction.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.673
And that was sort
of the noir version.

00:37:07.673 --> 00:37:13.510
But the thing with cyberpunk,
and I still read "Neuromancer"

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:17.850
periodically, I mean it's
ridiculously dated now,

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:19.270
but it's still a great read.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:22.110
I mean, it's funny to me
now looking back on it

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:26.250
and thinking like, we
have replaced the whole,

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.360
the 3D virtual space where you
travel through this 3D space

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:31.330
and you interface
with data as objects.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.610
We've replaced that by typing
what we want into Google.

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.730
That is-- you know,
who knew that that's

00:37:36.730 --> 00:37:37.730
what it was going to be.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.930
It was going to be a blank
white page with a text bar

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:42.810
and you just say,
tell me about this.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:46.570
And then every possible
answer with that comes up.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:50.621
That sort of destroyed
the cyberpunk stuff.

00:37:50.621 --> 00:37:52.620
And of course, they missed
all the other things.

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.600
They missed cell phones.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.790
DANIEL ABRAHAM: They
missed wireless.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.123
TY FRANCK: They missed wireless.

00:37:56.123 --> 00:37:58.375
One of our good friends
who wrote some cyberpunk

00:37:58.375 --> 00:38:02.070
in the '80s one of his novels
the big plot point at the end

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.230
is the hackers racing
around in a car

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:10.095
to find a payphone so they
can hack into the internet.

00:38:10.095 --> 00:38:10.970
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yeah.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:12.928
TY FRANCK: You know, and
you know looking back,

00:38:12.928 --> 00:38:14.570
that's pretty silly now.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:17.405
But that was the cool
thing at the time.

00:38:17.405 --> 00:38:19.030
DANIEL ABRAHAM: But
the beautiful thing

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.747
about science
fiction, what makes

00:38:20.747 --> 00:38:22.580
science fiction different
from other genres,

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:25.120
is it doesn't have
a basic story.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.450
When you write-- when
you read a mystery,

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.050
you know kind of what
you're going to get.

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:32.050
Somebody's going to die.

00:38:32.050 --> 00:38:33.350
And somebody's going to
figure out what happened.

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:35.670
When you read a romance,
you kind of know

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:37.280
what you're going to get.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.660
There's going to be two people.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.000
And through the
course of the book,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.300
they're going to fall in love.

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:44.410
Or they're going
to start in love

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.826
and die, kind of
depending if it's

00:38:45.826 --> 00:38:48.890
"Romeo and Juliet" or
"Pride and Prejudice."

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:54.450
If you get a Western, you kind
of know what you're in for.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:56.740
If you pick up a
science fiction book,

00:38:56.740 --> 00:39:03.110
you can be getting anything
from "The Stars My Destination"

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:11.300
to Philip K. Dick to kind
of this post singularity

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.310
to this blue collar
science fiction.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:19.020
There isn't a single that
science fiction requires.

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:21.350
And so it let's just do this
thing where you can say,

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.357
I'm going to tell my
science fiction noir.

00:39:23.357 --> 00:39:25.690
I'm going to tell my science
fiction political thriller.

00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:27.940
I'm going to tell my
science fiction ghost story.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:30.000
I'm going to tell my
science fiction Western.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:30.800
They all fit.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:38.470
They're all welcomed within
that genre, which is cool.

00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:40.410
AUDIENCE: So I have
two questions kind

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:43.200
of about your answer
to the previous one.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.960
The first is you give the
impression each of the books

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.950
sort of is science fiction
married to some other genre.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:53.780
Can you talk about
specifically which one

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.280
you feel is what kind of genre?

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.920
And then also about
things being dated.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.390
Do you worry about the stuff,
sort of the assumptions you're

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:06.030
making about technology,
something new arising and not

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.631
being there, right,
like-- just hopefully you

00:40:09.631 --> 00:40:11.880
write them all fast enough
that it won't be a problem.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.310
TY FRANCK: You can't
worry about that.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.320
You can't spend any time
worrying about that.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.840
Because we're always wrong.

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.130
Science fiction writers
are never right.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.730
I mean, Jules Verne I guess was
right about a couple of things.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:27.850
And Clarke guessed about
communication satellites

00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:28.580
and was right.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:32.620
But you know, you
read cyberpunk now.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.337
And they were really trying to
extrapolate future technology.

00:40:35.337 --> 00:40:36.920
They were working
really hard on that.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.220
And they were wrong
about everything.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.230
Not one thing in
those books is right.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.030
But it doesn't change the
fact that they're good books,

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:44.571
that they're enjoyable
books to read.

00:40:44.571 --> 00:40:47.990
I don't think you can spend
any time worrying about that.

00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:50.790
Because just accept that
you're going to be wrong.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:51.970
And be OK with it.

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:53.925
You know, it is fiction.

00:40:53.925 --> 00:40:54.800
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And--

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.940
INTERVIEWER: What are you
going to be wrong, you know,

00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:57.740
like in the solar
system, you know--

00:40:57.740 --> 00:40:58.130
TY FRANCK: Everything.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.963
INTERVIEWER: All political
allies, and all--

00:40:59.963 --> 00:41:02.410
TY FRANCK: So there
is no economic reason

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:04.330
to colonize the solar system.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.500
We just skate past that.

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.392
We did it anyway.

00:41:09.392 --> 00:41:11.350
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And as
far as mapping the books

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:15.910
to particular genres,
"Leviathan Wakes" is our noir.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.290
"Caliban's War" is our
political thriller.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.300
Abaddon's Gate is our
haunted house story,

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.810
and "Cibola Burn"
is our Western.

00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:27.900
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.780
I'm going to pose my question
as a follow up to that.

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:31.863
DANIEL ABRAHAM: All right.

00:41:31.863 --> 00:41:33.612
AUDIENCE: Are you going
to have a romance?

00:41:33.612 --> 00:41:35.220
DANIEL ABRAHAM: We might.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.660
We've got nine more-- we've
got nine books total that we're

00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.120
under contract for.

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:47.300
And that leaves us a certain
amount of leeway for that.

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:51.980
We have had romances
in the books.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:55.740
We are, however,
bitter and cynical men.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:05.270
And our views of how
love and sex interrelate

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:09.030
may not fit gracefully with that
particular set of expectations.

00:42:11.247 --> 00:42:13.330
TY FRANCK: We're also
happily married, both of us,

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:16.470
for like a really long time.

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:19.005
And so our version of romance
is two people get together.

00:42:19.005 --> 00:42:20.130
they're nice to each other.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:22.090
And then they stay nice.

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:25.025
Which is not really
compelling drama.

00:42:25.025 --> 00:42:27.400
DANIEL ABRAHAM: I have found
you, the woman of my dreams.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.450
Let's on the couch
and watch a movie.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:30.270
Ooh!

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:31.384
TY FRANCK: Yeah, so--

00:42:31.384 --> 00:42:32.800
DANIEL ABRAHAM:
Not high conflict.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.891
TY FRANCK: Not a
lot of conflict.

00:42:34.891 --> 00:42:36.390
AUDIENCE: And yet
another question--

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:37.770
will we ever see [INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.170
TY FRANCK: That is a question
for Alcon Entertainment.

00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:44.795
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yeah,
one of the things

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:47.080
that happens when
you get a TV show

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.590
is you sell all the rights.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:50.900
They're just gone.

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.150
We get to write books, and then
other people who are very smart

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:57.010
get to decide what
to do with them.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:01.390
So hopefully they will find
ways to make that popular

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:04.320
and make all of
us lots of money.

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:07.050
INTERVIEWER: So let's talk
about the show a little bit.

00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:09.540
SyFy has given a
direct, serious order

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.020
to an exciting
sounding new project

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.740
based on acclaimed a
sci-fi book series.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.730
You can guess which
book series is that.

00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:21.290
The cable network has ordered
10 episodes of "The Expanse"

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:25.640
from Academy Award
nominated screenwriting duo.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.360
And the project
has been described

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.227
by industry insider as
"Game of Thrones" in space.

00:43:30.227 --> 00:43:31.810
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yeah,
that's terrible.

00:43:31.810 --> 00:43:34.430
INTERVIEWER: Not so much because
of the specifics of the plot,

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:37.980
but because it tells a dramatic,
sprawling, grown up story

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.000
within that popular
fantasy genre that's

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:42.870
based on a respected
series of novels.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:45.120
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Yeah, in
order to be "Game of Thrones"

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.070
in space, we would
have to have a lot more

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.920
nudity and beheadings.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:53.715
We're actually
really slim on those.

00:43:53.715 --> 00:43:55.140
Yeah, we have explosions.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.590
Well, not as many explosions
in "Game of Thrones."

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.631
We've got more than that.

00:43:58.631 --> 00:44:01.296
And we have more spaceships.

00:44:01.296 --> 00:44:01.795
I hope.

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:12.890
Yeah, so there are these guys
named Mark Fergus and Hawk

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:13.430
Ostby.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:18.730
And they wrote things
you may have heard of.

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.430
They wrote a movie
called "Iron Man."

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:24.440
They wrote one called
"Children of Men."

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.510
And they're really
good at what they do.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:31.930
And they did-- we were put
together by a producer.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:35.410
Sean Daniel and
Jason Brown got them

00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:41.140
to sign on and write a
pilot script for this.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:43.560
And they then shopped it.

00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:48.080
We don't-- I know basically
nothing about Hollywood.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:51.520
Ty knows a little bit.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.460
But we weren't really consulted
on a whole lot of the thing.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:59.400
We were trotted out as
sort of the oh, look.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:02.200
And here are the writers,
which was apparently useful,

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.070
which was nice.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:06.970
And a bunch of people were
really interested in it.

00:45:06.970 --> 00:45:10.400
And the people who offered
the most money bought it.

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:14.570
And that was cool.

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.990
And in theory, it's-- well, no.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:22.380
It's going to see air
sometime next year.

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.380
And there's a whole bunch
of stuff we can't say.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.780
But it's really cool.

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:30.000
INTERVIEWER: So we know
that we can't talk too much

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.835
about the specific
of the show because

00:45:31.835 --> 00:45:34.200
of the whole yada, yada, yada.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.440
But tell me between
the two of you,

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:39.180
who is the sort of
more visual person,

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.519
like when writing,
like sort of--

00:45:41.519 --> 00:45:42.310
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Ty.

00:45:42.310 --> 00:45:45.530
Ty's the type of guy
I feel is more visual.

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:47.630
TY FRANCK: Yeah, I spend
a lot of time thinking

00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:50.970
about what things look
like, which is nice

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:55.411
because one of the things
that's exciting and not secret

00:45:55.411 --> 00:45:56.910
is that they've
asked me to help out

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:58.430
a lot with that on the show.

00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:59.596
INTERVIEWER: I figured that.

00:45:59.596 --> 00:46:00.360
TY FRANCK: Yeah.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.320
They've asked for my opinion
on a great many of those things

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.070
and seem to be taking it
seriously, so that's very cool.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.250
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And the
amount of participation

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:10.670
we've gotten to
have in the process

00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:14.870
is as far as I can
tell, unprecedented.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:16.940
We've actually been
in the writer's room

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:21.020
and talking with the show
runners for almost two months

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.240
now.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:28.250
And that's a terrible plan.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:31.630
I mean, writers are
cranky, antisocial people.

00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:37.210
And putting them in the middle
of this really complicated

00:46:37.210 --> 00:46:39.940
social negotiation,
generally speaking,

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.410
I would recommend against it.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:43.030
It's worked out well for us.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:48.560
But as a result, we've gotten to
be there for a lot of the work

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:53.590
that they've done on how to
take the text and take the story

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:56.590
and reimagine it for
a different medium

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:58.690
and for the requirements
of that medium.

00:46:58.690 --> 00:46:59.950
That's been a really cool.

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:07.830
AUDIENCE: Dovetailing on
this, I have a pet theory

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:11.760
that really iconic stories
come out of changes in medium,

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:14.830
like what persists
through all the mediums

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:19.180
is like the stuff that
will persist a long way.

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.540
And so I was kind of curious.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:23.680
It sounds like this actually
started as an MMORPG,

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.000
then it went to table
top, then became a novel,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.710
and is now going to
TV, which is the most

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.604
medium hops I've ever heard.

00:47:30.604 --> 00:47:32.687
So I was wondering if you
could tell us about some

00:47:32.687 --> 00:47:36.040
of the early media hops,
and like what was retained

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.864
and what dropped, and
where new things came in.

00:47:39.864 --> 00:47:41.530
DANIEL ABRAHAM: I can
only get into that

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:43.738
when you start going from
table top to novels, so I--

00:47:43.738 --> 00:47:45.780
TY FRANCK: Yeah.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:49.560
We didn't get too far in
the MMO, other than just

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.360
sort of the world building.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.410
When I start running it as an
MM-- or as a tabletop game,

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:59.750
I had to obviously
find some rules.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:03.430
In that case, I wound up using
the open source d20 Modern

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.150
rules as sort of
the skeleton for it

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:08.650
and then made up all
my own space rules,

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:12.300
because the d20 future
rules are stupid.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:14.100
That was the big shift there.

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.920
And there wasn't
really a story yet.

00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:18.380
So I didn't have to change
anything story-wise.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.650
It was actually in coming
up with what the events were

00:48:21.650 --> 00:48:24.050
for the tabletop
game that actually

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.300
started creating story.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:30.480
And then when Daniel wanted
to turn it into a novel,

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:32.480
that it is evolved greatly.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.300
Because the things that work
in games don't work in novels,

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.220
or it's not 100%.

00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:41.747
There's a little sliver on that
Venn diagram where it works.

00:48:41.747 --> 00:48:43.580
So you drop all the
stuff that doesn't work.

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.330
You add a bunch of
stuff that does work.

00:48:47.330 --> 00:48:52.092
We're not going to game Miller
being sad in his apartment.

00:48:52.092 --> 00:48:54.300
DANIEL ABRAHAM: A chapter
of my character sits there.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.070
TY FRANCK: Yeah.

00:48:55.070 --> 00:48:56.005
And drinks and is sad.

00:48:56.005 --> 00:48:57.880
DANIEL ABRAHAM: Role
your disconsolate rogue.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.190
TY FRANCK: Yeah, right.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:00.370
DANIEL ABRAHAM: You
are disconsolate.

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:01.411
TY FRANCK: Yeah, exactly.

00:49:01.411 --> 00:49:03.730
That's not going to work.

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:06.680
And then now between
novel and TV,

00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.890
You're seeing the
same sorts of things.

00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:10.946
Again, in the novel,
it works to have

00:49:10.946 --> 00:49:12.570
Miller sit in his
apartment and be sad.

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:13.944
Because we're
inside of his head.

00:49:13.944 --> 00:49:16.540
And we get to see all the
interesting internal dialogue

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.589
he's having.

00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:19.130
That would be a
really boring episode

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:22.200
of TV, 42 minutes of Detective
Miller drinking scotch

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.260
in his apartment and being sad.

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:27.720
So now we're looking for ways,
how do you visually dramatize

00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.920
that you've got a guy who's sad.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.990
And it's interesting
watching that transition.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:40.120
DANIEL ABRAHAM: And to go
to your theory, the model

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.390
that I have for
this is translation.

00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:44.009
And I know only one language.

00:49:44.009 --> 00:49:45.550
So all of my knowledge
or translation

00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.133
comes from reading
Douglas Hofstadter.

00:49:49.410 --> 00:49:53.100
But the idea of
changing the obstacles

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.140
that you have in
telling the story

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.060
changes the form of the story.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.160
And it can be related.

00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.430
And it can be very close.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:04.070
Or it could be more
general what level

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:06.290
you're trying to translate
on whether you're

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:09.480
trying to translate the exact
words, or the exact actions,

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.050
or the effect that
those actions have,

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:15.270
or different sets of
solutions to the problem.

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:17.080
