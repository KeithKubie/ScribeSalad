that is not modernizing its nuclear

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279
that is not modernizing its nuclear
 

00:09:05.279 --> 00:09:08.269
that is not modernizing its nuclear
forces we get into a discussion of

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279
forces we get into a discussion of
 

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.189
forces we get into a discussion of
whether we should or we shouldn't I

00:09:10.189 --> 00:09:10.199
whether we should or we shouldn't I
 

00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:12.110
whether we should or we shouldn't I
don't think well that's not my point my

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120
don't think well that's not my point my
 

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.230
don't think well that's not my point my
point is that there's a broad macro

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240
point is that there's a broad macro
 

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.970
point is that there's a broad macro
trend and nuclear weapons are becoming

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980
trend and nuclear weapons are becoming
 

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.949
trend and nuclear weapons are becoming
more embedded in international affairs I

00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959
more embedded in international affairs I
 

00:09:20.959 --> 00:09:25.220
more embedded in international affairs I
see no possibility in the foreseeable

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:25.230
see no possibility in the foreseeable
 

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.240
see no possibility in the foreseeable
future of a global zero I say that with

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.250
future of a global zero I say that with
 

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:31.910
future of a global zero I say that with
regret of which there were I am one of

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920
regret of which there were I am one of
 

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.790
regret of which there were I am one of
the biggest supporters of global zero if

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800
the biggest supporters of global zero if
 

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.410

you're an American looking at american

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:36.420
you're an American looking at american
 

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:38.389
you're an American looking at american
national interests I don't see how you

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399
national interests I don't see how you
 

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:41.120
national interests I don't see how you
couldn't but my problem is that other

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.130
couldn't but my problem is that other
 

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:44.660
couldn't but my problem is that other
countries like Russia China India see

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:44.670
countries like Russia China India see
 

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.990
countries like Russia China India see
that also and conclude that this is a

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000
that also and conclude that this is a
 

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.329
that also and conclude that this is a
world which it's even it's much worse

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339
world which it's even it's much worse
 

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:52.069
world which it's even it's much worse
from their point of view because it

00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:52.079
from their point of view because it
 

00:09:52.079 --> 00:09:53.600
from their point of view because it
gives conventional advantages to the

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:53.610
gives conventional advantages to the
 

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.900
gives conventional advantages to the
United States so my big point is that we

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:56.910
United States so my big point is that we
 

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.550
United States so my big point is that we
are entering a second nuclear Asian we

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560
are entering a second nuclear Asian we
 

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.410
are entering a second nuclear Asian we
don't realize how bad it could get I

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:02.420
don't realize how bad it could get I
 

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.540
don't realize how bad it could get I

don't think to take the fact that the

so there's huge tranches of literature

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640
so there's huge tranches of literature
 

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.639
so there's huge tranches of literature
which were well developed in the Cold

and look it's at the technological

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:12.770
and look it's at the technological
 

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.580

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.370
1950s and the 1960s it is different from
that era so for example there's

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:29.380
that era so for example there's
 

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.190

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:51.490
missile crisis look like between Israel
 

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:55.440
missile crisis look like between Israel
and Iran what would be the dynamics of

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:55.450
and Iran what would be the dynamics of
 

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:59.070
and Iran what would be the dynamics of
that so what I think is happening what

00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080
that so what I think is happening what
 

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:01.380
that so what I think is happening what
what should happen and frankly what will

00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:01.390
what should happen and frankly what will
 

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.539
what should happen and frankly what will
happen is that we have this

00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:03.549
happen is that we have this
 

00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:05.820
happen is that we have this
non-proliferation and containment

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:05.830
non-proliferation and containment
 

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:09.110
non-proliferation and containment
morphing into containment on one column

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120
morphing into containment on one column
 

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.759
morphing into containment on one column
where we need to go is to think about

00:31:11.759 --> 00:31:11.769
where we need to go is to think about
 

00:31:11.769 --> 00:31:17.180
where we need to go is to think about
some aspects of dynamics and instability

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:17.190
some aspects of dynamics and instability
 

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:21.029
some aspects of dynamics and instability
so I see dynamics by which I mean that

00:31:21.029 --> 00:31:21.039
so I see dynamics by which I mean that
 

00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:22.980
so I see dynamics by which I mean that
these systems can change and take on a

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:22.990
these systems can change and take on a
 

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.710
these systems can change and take on a
very different trajectory in a short

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:25.720
very different trajectory in a short
 

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:30.899
very different trajectory in a short
period of time we need to ask whether or

00:31:30.899 --> 00:31:30.909
period of time we need to ask whether or
 

00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:32.669
period of time we need to ask whether or
not fear and prudence which were the

00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679
not fear and prudence which were the
 

00:31:32.679 --> 00:31:35.190
not fear and prudence which were the
governing mechanisms of the Cold War are

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200
governing mechanisms of the Cold War are
 

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.870
governing mechanisms of the Cold War are
likely to be as effective in India

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880
likely to be as effective in India
 

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:42.539
likely to be as effective in India
Pakistan or in the Middle East and as

00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:42.549
Pakistan or in the Middle East and as
 

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:45.240
Pakistan or in the Middle East and as
far as the other feature of this new era

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:45.250
far as the other feature of this new era
 

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.259
far as the other feature of this new era
that I think when you look at

00:31:46.259 --> 00:31:46.269
that I think when you look at
 

00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:48.960
that I think when you look at
instability this just opens up a whole

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:48.970
instability this just opens up a whole
 

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.060
instability this just opens up a whole
raft of questions about the relationship

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:51.070
raft of questions about the relationship
 

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:55.039
raft of questions about the relationship
of conventional forces to nuclear forces

00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:55.049
of conventional forces to nuclear forces
 

00:31:55.049 --> 00:31:58.379
of conventional forces to nuclear forces
so in conclusion I think we are entering

00:31:58.379 --> 00:31:58.389
so in conclusion I think we are entering
 

00:31:58.389 --> 00:32:00.750
so in conclusion I think we are entering
a nuclear a second nuclear age I think

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760
a nuclear a second nuclear age I think
 

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:04.049
a nuclear a second nuclear age I think
the we need to emphasize its dynamics

00:32:04.049 --> 00:32:04.059
the we need to emphasize its dynamics
 

00:32:04.059 --> 00:32:08.129
the we need to emphasize its dynamics
and it's instabilities in order to get

00:32:08.129 --> 00:32:08.139
and it's instabilities in order to get
 

00:32:08.139 --> 00:32:11.570
and it's instabilities in order to get
manage our way through it as best we can

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580
manage our way through it as best we can
 

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:15.180
manage our way through it as best we can
and the final point I would make is that

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:15.190
and the final point I would make is that
 

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.139
and the final point I would make is that
the greatest source of concern for me is

00:32:18.139 --> 00:32:18.149
the greatest source of concern for me is
 

00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:20.519
the greatest source of concern for me is
stepping back from the rivalries and the

00:32:20.519 --> 00:32:20.529
stepping back from the rivalries and the
 

00:32:20.529 --> 00:32:22.500
stepping back from the rivalries and the
competitiveness looking at this just as

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:22.510
competitiveness looking at this just as
 

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.769
competitiveness looking at this just as
a global structural problem it's the end

00:32:25.769 --> 00:32:25.779
a global structural problem it's the end
 

00:32:25.779 --> 00:32:28.289
a global structural problem it's the end
of the monopoly of new over nuclear

00:32:28.289 --> 00:32:28.299
of the monopoly of new over nuclear
 

00:32:28.299 --> 00:32:31.980
of the monopoly of new over nuclear
weapons by major powers is that what

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:31.990
weapons by major powers is that what
 

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:34.259
weapons by major powers is that what
we're witnessing today this is like a

00:32:34.259 --> 00:32:34.269
we're witnessing today this is like a
 

00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:37.669
we're witnessing today this is like a
monopolistic industry where two players

00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679
monopolistic industry where two players
 

00:32:37.679 --> 00:32:41.730
monopolistic industry where two players
controlled it and yes other players

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:41.740
controlled it and yes other players
 

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:43.490
controlled it and yes other players
could come in but their major powers

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500
could come in but their major powers
 

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.860
could come in but their major powers
what we're seeing today and have for the

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:46.870
what we're seeing today and have for the
 

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:47.970
what we're seeing today and have for the
past ten years or so

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:47.980
past ten years or so
 

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:53.190
past ten years or so
is minor powers secondary powers are

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200
is minor powers secondary powers are
 

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.530
is minor powers secondary powers are

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:55.540
also getting the bomb you know Iran's
 

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.580

really deep structural implications for

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:02.830
really deep structural implications for
 

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:07.200
really deep structural implications for
world order for some time to come so

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:07.210
world order for some time to come so
 

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:09.480
world order for some time to come so
those are my thoughts and the sort of

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:09.490
those are my thoughts and the sort of

the core arguments of the book I'd be

00:33:10.919 --> 00:33:10.929
the core arguments of the book I'd be
 

00:33:10.929 --> 00:33:13.440
the core arguments of the book I'd be
happy to go into any details issues we

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:13.450
happy to go into any details issues we

very much so I'd like to ask the first
 

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.770
very much so I'd like to ask the first
question but if you have questions

question but if you have questions
 

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.010
question but if you have questions
please come up to the microphone so when

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:35.020
please come up to the microphone so when
 

00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.470
please come up to the microphone so when
earlier you mentioned that when you look

00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:37.480
earlier you mentioned that when you look
 

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.470
earlier you mentioned that when you look
back Kennedy's prediction which as it

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480
back Kennedy's prediction which as it
 

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.799
back Kennedy's prediction which as it
turns out was as I said overstating

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:42.809
turns out was as I said overstating
 

00:33:42.809 --> 00:33:46.350
turns out was as I said overstating
Defense Department's own estimate of the

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360
Defense Department's own estimate of the
 

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.909
Defense Department's own estimate of the
extent of proliferation the rapidity of

00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919
extent of proliferation the rapidity of
 

00:33:47.919 --> 00:33:52.350
extent of proliferation the rapidity of
proliferation sure you said that just

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:52.360
proliferation sure you said that just
 

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.180
proliferation sure you said that just
because they were wrong then doesn't

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:54.190
because they were wrong then doesn't
 

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:55.940
because they were wrong then doesn't
mean that we're likely to overestimate

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:55.950
mean that we're likely to overestimate
 

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:59.039
mean that we're likely to overestimate
proliferation now can we learn something

00:33:59.039 --> 00:33:59.049
proliferation now can we learn something
 

00:33:59.049 --> 00:34:02.070
proliferation now can we learn something
from mistakes and forecasting

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080
from mistakes and forecasting
 

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.220
from mistakes and forecasting
proliferation oh yeah how's the can you

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:05.230
proliferation oh yeah how's the can you
 

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:09.690
proliferation oh yeah how's the can you
hear me okay here can you all right yeah

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:09.700
hear me okay here can you all right yeah
 

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:14.639
hear me okay here can you all right yeah
I think we can learn a lot we can learn

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:14.649
I think we can learn a lot we can learn
 

00:34:14.649 --> 00:34:17.399
I think we can learn a lot we can learn
a lot about overestimation and under

00:34:17.399 --> 00:34:17.409
a lot about overestimation and under
 

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:19.440
a lot about overestimation and under
estimation we can learn a lot about the

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:19.450
estimation we can learn a lot about the
 

00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:22.440
estimation we can learn a lot about the
Cold War because the lessons of the Cold

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:22.450
Cold War because the lessons of the Cold
 

00:34:22.450 --> 00:34:25.740
Cold War because the lessons of the Cold

very normative but let me come to your

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:34.540
very normative but let me come to your
 

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.389
very normative but let me come to your
your question Matt yeah I think there's

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399
your question Matt yeah I think there's
 

00:34:36.399 --> 00:34:41.099
your question Matt yeah I think there's
a what this shows is is really

00:34:41.099 --> 00:34:41.109
a what this shows is is really
 

00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:45.750
a what this shows is is really
fascinating to me it's the tendency of

fascinating to me it's the tendency of
 

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:49.200
fascinating to me it's the tendency of
leaders and this is a lesson of the Cold

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:49.210
leaders and this is a lesson of the Cold
 

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:52.139
leaders and this is a lesson of the Cold

Missile Crisis and what Kennedy said he
 

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.670

we got both of these things wrong so

right so it doesn't mean we'll make the
 

00:39:12.669 --> 00:39:15.239

so simplistic about an Iranian nuclear

Israel um I've been hearing similar
 

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:36.800

really isn't it really Washington that
 

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:48.380

the

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280
the
 

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:05.290
the
since late 70s or early 80s in fact it

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:05.300
since late 70s or early 80s in fact it
 

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.960

earlier plans but my point here is that
Israel is the one who's being the

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:18.670
Israel is the one who's being the
 

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:27.160
Israel is the one who's being the

maybe they should do it maybe university

00:50:12.279 --> 00:50:12.289
maybe they should do it maybe university
 

00:50:12.289 --> 00:50:15.789

should do it maybe journalists should do

00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:15.799
should do it maybe journalists should do
 

00:50:15.799 --> 00:50:21.089
should do it maybe journalists should do
it maybe other groups should do it and

00:50:21.089 --> 00:50:21.099
it maybe other groups should do it and
 

00:50:21.099 --> 00:50:25.089
it maybe other groups should do it and
maybe on that list is the way

00:50:25.089 --> 00:50:25.099
maybe on that list is the way

I wanted to ask you if you could say a

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720
I wanted to ask you if you could say a
 

00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:51.730
I wanted to ask you if you could say a
little bit more about the new ways maybe

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:51.740
little bit more about the new ways maybe
 

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:54.370
little bit more about the new ways maybe
of delivering of your weapons are there

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:54.380
of delivering of your weapons are there
 

00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.170
of delivering of your weapons are there
new innovations in this area and how

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:56.180
new innovations in this area and how
 

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.299
new innovations in this area and how
close are we doing this mythical

00:50:58.299 --> 00:50:58.309
close are we doing this mythical
 

00:50:58.309 --> 00:51:01.809
close are we doing this mythical

suitcase nuclear bomb quarter used by
 

00:51:01.819 --> 00:51:03.940
suitcase nuclear bomb quarter used by
terrorists yeah the question is uh how

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:03.950
terrorists yeah the question is uh how
 

00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:06.120
terrorists yeah the question is uh how
are their new delivery mechanisms for

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:06.130
are their new delivery mechanisms for
 

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:10.270
are their new delivery mechanisms for
nuclear weapons there are in the sense

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.280
nuclear weapons there are in the sense
 

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.740
nuclear weapons there are in the sense
that that the end cunted proliferating

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:14.750
that that the end cunted proliferating
 

00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:18.910

on missiles I mean there's a if you

00:51:22.359 --> 00:51:22.369
on missiles I mean there's a if you
 

00:51:22.369 --> 00:51:27.579

looked at the data from the 40s and 50s

00:51:27.579 --> 00:51:27.589
looked at the data from the 40s and 50s
 

00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:30.490
looked at the data from the 40s and 50s
and you said what feature of nuclear

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:30.500
and you said what feature of nuclear
 

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.130
and you said what feature of nuclear
weapons changed faster than anything

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:33.140

package that so I think that's not the

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:40.910
package that so I think that's not the
 

00:51:40.910 --> 00:51:42.549
package that so I think that's not the
thrust of your question but they're

00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559
thrust of your question but they're

going to be able to put them on missiles

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:43.730
going to be able to put them on missiles
 

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:46.000

they will figure this out the suitcase

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:46.010
they will figure this out the suitcase

of the reasons why the estimates might

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:10.700
of the reasons why the estimates might
 

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:12.520
of the reasons why the estimates might
have been way off base in terms of the

and Britain have not but I figure we
 

01:25:37.229 --> 01:25:38.959

probably going to be the last question

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:38.010
probably going to be the last question

probably going to be the last question
so please come to the microphone yes

01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:41.790
so please come to the microphone yes
 

01:27:41.790 --> 01:27:45.590
so please come to the microphone yes
please yeah thank you I just thought of

01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600
please yeah thank you I just thought of

yesterday ratio passed the biggest the
 

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:53.120
yesterday ratio passed the biggest the
defense budget that they ever had which

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:53.130
defense budget that they ever had which
 

01:27:53.130 --> 01:27:55.880
defense budget that they ever had which
is like two trillion rubles or something

01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:55.890
is like two trillion rubles or something
 

01:27:55.890 --> 01:27:58.130
is like two trillion rubles or something
like this but what I thought about was

01:27:58.130 --> 01:27:58.140
like this but what I thought about was
 

01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:02.660
like this but what I thought about was
that I thought about the you know right

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:02.670
that I thought about the you know right
 

01:28:02.670 --> 01:28:04.750
that I thought about the you know right
now we're in a situation where we are

01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:04.760
now we're in a situation where we are
 

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:07.670
now we're in a situation where we are
running out of oil and so people are

01:28:07.670 --> 01:28:07.680
running out of oil and so people are
 

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:09.350
running out of oil and so people are
turning towards nuclear power

01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360
turning towards nuclear power
 

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.450
turning towards nuclear power
essentially for energy use and

01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460
essentially for energy use and
 

01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:15.110
essentially for energy use and
Russia is one of the biggest countries

01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:15.120
Russia is one of the biggest countries
 

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:19.160
Russia is one of the biggest countries
that specializes in promoting themselves

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:19.170
that specializes in promoting themselves
 

01:28:19.170 --> 01:28:22.850
that specializes in promoting themselves
as providers of nuclear power plants and

01:28:22.850 --> 01:28:22.860
as providers of nuclear power plants and
 

01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:24.770
as providers of nuclear power plants and
actually they recently bought the

01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:24.780
actually they recently bought the
 

01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:27.220
actually they recently bought the
uranium deposits in Canada and

01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:27.230
uranium deposits in Canada and
 

01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:29.450
uranium deposits in Canada and
previously they try to buy them in the

01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:29.460
previously they try to buy them in the
 

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:32.090
previously they try to buy them in the
United States so they are truly a great

01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100
United States so they are truly a great
 

01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:34.220
United States so they are truly a great
power in and they are proposing to all

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:34.230
power in and they are proposing to all
 

01:28:34.230 --> 01:28:35.750
power in and they are proposing to all
the different countries in Europe that

01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760
the different countries in Europe that
 

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.490
the different countries in Europe that
they'll build nuclear power plants for

01:28:37.490 --> 01:28:37.500
they'll build nuclear power plants for
 

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:40.610
they'll build nuclear power plants for
them so we have the situation which is

01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620
them so we have the situation which is
 

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:43.840
them so we have the situation which is
the combination of you know energy and

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:43.850
the combination of you know energy and
 

01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:46.450
the combination of you know energy and
maybe maybe nuclear proliferation

01:28:46.450 --> 01:28:46.460
maybe maybe nuclear proliferation
 

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:49.130
maybe maybe nuclear proliferation
because I think that wants to you know

01:28:49.130 --> 01:28:49.140
because I think that wants to you know
 

01:28:49.140 --> 01:28:51.380
because I think that wants to you know
they are building these nuclear power

01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:51.390
they are building these nuclear power
 

01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:52.610
they are building these nuclear power
plants all over the place they are

01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:52.620
plants all over the place they are
 

01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:55.070
plants all over the place they are
increasing capability for it safe when

01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080
increasing capability for it safe when
 

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:58.220
increasing capability for it safe when
I'm proliferation no big huge problem

01:28:58.220 --> 01:28:58.230
I'm proliferation no big huge problem
 

01:28:58.230 --> 01:29:00.020
I'm proliferation no big huge problem
because it looks like nuclear power will

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:00.030
because it looks like nuclear power will
 

01:29:00.030 --> 01:29:01.670
because it looks like nuclear power will
increase dramatically for obvious

01:29:01.670 --> 01:29:01.680
increase dramatically for obvious
 

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.880
increase dramatically for obvious
reasons and the this means more physical

01:29:04.880 --> 01:29:04.890
reasons and the this means more physical
 

01:29:04.890 --> 01:29:08.000
reasons and the this means more physical
material in the world which has got to

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:08.010
material in the world which has got to
 

01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:11.900
material in the world which has got to
be protected and it's a very very big

01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:11.910
be protected and it's a very very big
 

01:29:11.910 --> 01:29:15.050
be protected and it's a very very big
problem I believe some that my sense is

01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060
problem I believe some that my sense is
 

01:29:15.060 --> 01:29:17.240
problem I believe some that my sense is
the US government is is not only well

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:17.250
the US government is is not only well
 

01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:19.820
the US government is is not only well
aware of this is is actually taking good

01:29:19.820 --> 01:29:19.830
aware of this is is actually taking good
 

01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:23.959
aware of this is is actually taking good
planning steps to make sure that that we

01:29:23.959 --> 01:29:23.969
planning steps to make sure that that we
 

01:29:23.969 --> 01:29:25.970
planning steps to make sure that that we
will fund a lot of the protective

will fund a lot of the protective
 

01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:29.330
will fund a lot of the protective
measures or storage measures but it

01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340
measures or storage measures but it
 

01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.970
