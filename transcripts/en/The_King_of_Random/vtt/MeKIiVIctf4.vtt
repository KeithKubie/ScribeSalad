Hey Guys Welcome back to the Workshop in This Video Today, we're doing Some a little bit Different

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.430
We're Making the suckers that's right

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.590
We're gonna Show you how to take a mold of your thumb and then cast it in Hard Candy so you Can Literally have A

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.109
Sucker of your Thumb now nate has Worked Hard Prototype of This Project for us today so Once You go ahead Mate and Show Us

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.509
How to get Started There's A lot of good Candy Recipes out There

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.039
We're Gonna Show you one of the easiest ones and also how to build it up to turn it Into something spectacular and

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.489
Personal Not only, do You get to Make some Delicious Candy for this Project but it's

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.879
Also a great way to practice the basics of Molding and Casting Since

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.800
We are Going to be Molding and Casting one of the Main supplies you're Going to need Is a Two-Part mold Putty I have A

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.200
Couple Different Brands of Mold Putty that I was able to Buy at

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.659
A local Craft Store Both are Easy To use Relatively Inexpensive and are Food safe some of the other Materials

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.000
We're Going to need are Corn syrup White sugar A

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.140
Flavoring of your Choice and Food dye some other Supplies Are Going to need our disposable Plastic cups Clothes Pins, Lollipop Sticks

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.870
Measuring Cups High Heat Spatula and A Candy Thermometer and of Course A pot to cook

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.349
Him You want to Make sure that it's large enough that you Can hold all of your ingredients Easily

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.279
But Small Enough that your Candy Thermometer will Still reach what's Cooking near the Bottom

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.518
Now since I'm gonna be Molding my Thumb for this one I'm Gonna have to lose the Glove

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.929
Most disposable Cups Are large Enough that if You, were to fill them with silicone you Would waste some valuable Putty

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.689
We're Going to cut this cut Down to size to Make it fit our Thumb

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.879
Perfectly measure where you should cut the cup. Line your Thumb up with it leaving About half an inch from the Bottom. For my

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.549
Thumb This Line Perfectly Matches Where, We want to trim the Cup.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.379
The next Important Step is to Make Sure you've Trimmed the nail and wash your thumb Thoroughly. The silicone Putty will pick up every Tiny

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.329
Detail of your Thumb including Dirt . And you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.019
Don't want that Ending Up in your Candy. now it's Time to get Start Molding our Thumb

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.089
Grab a small Handful of each color Putty so that the two together Have about the same volume as your Trimmed-Down

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.640
Cup if it seems like you have more of One Color Putty than the other Just Add a little bit more until they Seem even

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.989
Now, we're Going to mix These two together until, We have one Smooth color We Should Get a, lighter Purple.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.809
Try to Knead The Putty Quickly Because you have a limited Work Time Usually only A couple Minutes

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.780
Once You're Finished Mixing you Should have one Smooth Consistent color with no Streaks in it this Stuff Feels kind

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.620
of like a stiff Play-doh

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.069
Or

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.499
Maybe Silly Putty Press a little bit of Silicone Down Into The Bottom of the Cup and Then Begin Wrapping your Thumb in the rest

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.500
of the Putty

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.639
Press your thumb with the Putty Around it down Into the Cup and Begin Squishing Down all of the Sides all the Way Around you

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.800
Want to Press hard Enough to remove Most of the air Bubbles and to be sure that the Putty Is Forming A good seal Around

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.380
Your Thumb this ensures that your mold will pick up every Detail of your thumb Down to the fingerprints the Putty Takes two

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.710
Or Three Minutes before it Begins to stiffen so try and get your Thumb molded before then

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.690
Once it's Begun Hardening it's a little bit Less Flexible and a little bit more Durable it will Take About 15

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.790
Minutes for This Silicone to Cure Completely

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.040
So just be Patient!

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.270
Update on Where

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.759
We are now we've Made Two molds one of my thumb in One of Grant's it's Time to start making Candy the basic Recipe for

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.070
This Candy is super Simple it's 2 Cups of White sugar 2/3 Cups light Corn Syrup and

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.160
3/4 Cups Water Add All Those ingredients to your Saucepan and Set the stove to medium Heat using your heat-Resistant

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.589
Spatula Mix all Those ingredients until the sugar is Dissolved

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.919
Once The sugar is Dissolved it's actually Time to stop stirring at this Point mixing too much Could actually ruin your Candy and the Bubbling

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.270
Action From The sugar will Circulate it Within the pan as your Mixture is Boiling out the Excess Water

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.609
The Candy Thermometer will Probably Stay Around 200 degrees Fahrenheit for a while you need to

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.070
Be sure that the Head of your Candy Thermometer is Submerged in your Mixture but not Touching the side or Bottom of your pan as

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.349
This Could Throw Off The Temperature Measurement While your Candy Mixture is heating Up it's Time to choose what Flavor and color you

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.560
Want your Thumbsucker to be?

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.410
Since I'm going with the orange Cream Flavor I'm going to try and use the red and Yellow Food coloring to get an Orange Thumbsucker

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.299
Now you want a lollipop stick and A Clothespin so that when our Candy is Done Cooking we'll be all ready to Make our Thumb.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.559
Center it's a simple Thing to Position the lollipop stick Where you're going to want it and Hold it in Place With your Clothespin

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.470
Keep A close Eye on your Candy Thermometer when it hits 260 degrees Fahrenheit it's Time to add your color

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.660
Even After Adding the Food Coloring you

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.689
Don't want to stir the mixture Let the Bubbling Action mix the color in for you as the Temperature Keeps rising Watch it very Carefully

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.109
You'll Need To remove it from the heat the instant it hits 300 degrees Fahrenheit

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.649
Any Longer and the sugar will start To Burn Let the Candy mix cool

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.989
Down Just Enough to stop Bubbling and then Add your Flavoring

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.150
Be Careful as the Steam From the Rapidly Heating Flavor extract Could Cause, Small Splashes of molten Sugar

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.669
Alright Guys our Mixture. Is hot Just off the stove I've Added the flavouring it's Time to pour it Into our mold

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.609
Of Course if You want to speed up the cooling Process you can Pop the whole mold Into the Refrigerator for A few Minutes

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.010
For Easy Cleanup fill your Pot With hot Water and boil it on the stove the Heat will Help Melt and Dissolve the sugar so

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.670
It Comes Off Quickly and Easily if You Have a Certain color you want to achieve you can

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.599
Practice With About Two cups of Water in A glass this way you Can Figure out Exactly how

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.659
Many Drops of Each Color Food Coloring you need Without Ruining A

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.249
Whole Batch of Candy Grant Wanted his Thumb to be Root Beer-Flavored so we're Going for a nice Brown color

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.820
Alright Guys Update we've Finished our Candy Poured them Into our Thumb Molds and They've cooled Down to the point where They're Ready to be

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.580
Pulled Out if You, were Having a hard Time Pulling your Thumb out when you're

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.080
 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.649
the mold it's possible you're Going to need to cut. The side of the silicone to get the lollipop to come out Smoothly

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.210
Well my Cousins might Have

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.930
There you have it guys There's A cast of my Thumb in Candy you can see These

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:34.379
Imperfections in The Cast That's From Where I wasn't Careful Enough Wrapping the Silicone Around my thumb so make sure you do A very good?

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:40.409
Thorough Job of getting it to cover all the Details Something Else is Really, Interesting About this silicone Mold Putty is Look

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.689
How much Detail it picks up you Can Actually See some of my Thumbprint in the Lollipop I guess There's Really

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.450
One Test that Matters the Most and that's how Does it taste I

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:57.419
Used Orange Cream Flavor that's got a great orange Flavor to it it's Nice and Sweet and the

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.029
Shape is great it Fits right in your. Mouth it's a little Strange Feeling the Thumbprint on my tongue as well

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:13.170
After Pouring the Thumbs, We still Had a little bit of Leftover Candy Mixture so we tried Pouring some Candy Lego Blocks and Minifigures

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:49.629
okay, so the Candy Stayed Stuck to the Plastic Lego Sheet and Completely Released from the silicone Mold I Didn't see That Coming but I

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:52.959
Hope it means that we've got good Indentations on the back of These pieces

00:07:56.449 --> 00:07:59.978
That's Looking decent I don't think this is enough that

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.709
We Can pick up quite enough Detail to really get the pieces to Lock together

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:08.769
The Syrup when it Comes right out of the Pot is Still Fairly Thick and it has A hard Time getting Into all the Tiny

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:12.009
Little Nooks and Crannies That you need to Really get A, functional Lego Piece

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.249
