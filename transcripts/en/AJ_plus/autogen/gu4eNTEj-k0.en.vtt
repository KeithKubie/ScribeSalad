00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:03.700
I love boxing and I love my religion.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.110
They, they built me.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.807
To have somebody try and
take away one of them, like,

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.440
"You can have one or the other,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.930
take your hijab off or quit boxing,"

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.110
I'm like, this is part of me, like,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.330
what if they told you, "Shave your head

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.262
before you get in the ring"?

00:00:16.262 --> 00:00:17.929
You'd be like, "No!"

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.320
My dad is an immigrant
and he was a marine.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.610
A couple things I learned from my dad:

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.248
discipline, loyalty, and not giving up.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.041
I started boxing when I was 13.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.830
My dad took me to a
boxing gym, and when you

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.210
walked in, you could hear the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.527
bell ring, like, "Ding, ding, ding!"

00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:39.610
People were yelling and
sweating and working out,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.107
and I was like, "This is
amazing, I love this!"

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.280
I started watching videos,
'Throw punches like Mike Tyson,'

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.298
like, "This is your jab!"

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.932
My gym is my home, I just, I love working.

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:54.862
And my coaches, if they
teach me something,

00:00:54.862 --> 00:00:56.573
I'm gonna do it, like, a thousand times

00:00:56.573 --> 00:00:57.894
until I get it perfect.

00:00:58.236 --> 00:00:59.753
I'm, like, "Let's do this, let's go!"

00:00:59.753 --> 00:01:01.003
I just love it.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.960
2016, I was like, "I'm ready to fight."

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.340
So I went to Florida, to
the Sugar Bert tournament,

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.327
to fight for the championship belt.

00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:10.807
And everybody there was
super nice, they were like,

00:01:10.807 --> 00:01:12.650
"I hope you do good,
let me know how you do!"

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.890
"I'm gonna come watch
your fight tomorrow!"

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.210
I was so, like, "Ahhh,
it's finally happening!"

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.083
I was ready.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.870
The day I was scheduled to fight,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.400
my coaches wrapped my hands,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.120
I had my uniform on, I was wearing this.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.583
I went to go get my
gloves, and they were like,

00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:29.350
"No, you gotta take that off."

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.690
Like, the leggings, and
then the long sleeves.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.227
And I was like, "No, I
can't, because my religion",

00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:36.097
they were like, "No, you can't wear that."

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.770
And I was like, "I'm not taking it off."

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.290
She was like, "Take it off or
I'm gonna cross your name."

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.610
I was like, "Then, cross out my name."

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.050
She crossed off my name.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.340
And they gave the belt to my opponent.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.500
All this build-up, and then,
pshh, that's it, it was done.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.150
So, I'm sitting there next to my mom,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.610
I was, like, on my phone or something,

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.490
and this girl comes up and
puts the belt in my lap.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.010
She was like, "This is yours,
like, I want you to have it."

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.540
"We didn't get to do
our thing in the ring,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.700
and that wasn't fair,
and I stand with you.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.812
I got you, like, let's
change this rule together."

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:08.040
(cheering and applause)

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.720
We blew up. Washington Post,
ESPN, National Geographic.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.340
[Clip]: "My name is Amaiya Zafar."

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.290
The girl who gave me the belt, she got the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.942
Musial Award for Sportsmanship.

00:02:17.942 --> 00:02:20.408
[Clip]: (audience applause)

00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:21.500
And I started doing interviews

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.850
and just trying to get the story out there

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.267
so I can get this rule changed.

00:02:24.267 --> 00:02:27.210
[Clip]: "Amaiya Zafar is
not pulling any punches"

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.680
"in her fight for her
first official bout."

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.129
April 2017, my coach called
me, "Are you sitting down?"

00:02:33.978 --> 00:02:35.520
They told me about the rule changing,

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.470
and I was like, "Can I fight tomorrow?"

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.140
[Clip]: "16-year-old
Amaiya Zafar will make"

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.490
"her ring debut tonight."

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.700
When I had my first fight,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.027
I was like, "This is real", like,

00:02:47.027 --> 00:02:48.770
"I'm about to get in the ring!"

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.895
And there was cameras.

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:52.575
[Clip]: (audience cheering)

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:54.461
After the second round, my coach said,

00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:55.590
"Look outside the ring."

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.423
And I'm like, "Huh?"

00:02:56.423 --> 00:02:57.860
Beause they always told me,
"Don't look outside the ring!"

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.937
He was like, "Look to your right!"

00:02:58.937 --> 00:02:59.770
[Clip]: (crowd cheering)

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.760
I see my sister, I see my dad,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.283
I see all my cousins all crying.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.160
Then I fought every month after that.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.360
[Clip]: "A teenage boxer is
trying to fight her way to"

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.000
"the highest level of the sport."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.860
I just went back to the
Sugar Bert tournament.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.220
[Clip]: (cheering)

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.820
[Clip]: "We are here with Amaiya Zafar."

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.020
"First of all, congratulations"

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.429
"on your victory, you just won."

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.360
I would love to be in the Olympics.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.140
Now, there's nothing holding me back

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.420
from representing Team USA.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.420
I'm boxing.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.253
This is it.

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:28.569
This is what I'm about to do forever.
