00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.410
So we have these three
ordered pairs which represent

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.780
how much time I've worked and
how much money I make.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.090
I want to visualize these and
the best way to do that is with a graph.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.220
And here is my graph paper.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.320
This line here is called the x axis and
this one's the y axis.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.730
The first thing I'm going to
do is decide on a scale.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.309
And I'm going to choose a scale in the x
axis that goes up by fives, 5, 10, 15,

00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:25.280
20, and of course zero here.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.000
I am going to have my y
axis increment by 50 and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.690
note this point here has zero for
its x value, n for its y value.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.916
This point we call the origin but
back to our order pairs.

00:00:35.916 --> 00:00:38.653
Well how am I going to
put 5,50 in the graph?

00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:41.862
Well I'm going to look at
five which means, okay,

00:00:41.862 --> 00:00:45.304
go over here to where x is five,
which is this line and

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:49.238
then I'm going to go up to where
y is 50, which is up to here.

00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:50.400
And then I'm going to put a dot.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.979
Likewise for 10,100.

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:58.433
Go over to 10, up to 100 and
put a dot, and again 20,200.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:01.162
Over to 20, up to 200 and put a dot.

00:01:01.162 --> 00:01:05.310
Once I have a few dots I
can start to connect them.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.830
Now using this graph,
maybe you can answer a question for me.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.770
How much would I make if I worked for
15 hours?

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.900
Enter your answer here and
I've already given you the dollar sign.
