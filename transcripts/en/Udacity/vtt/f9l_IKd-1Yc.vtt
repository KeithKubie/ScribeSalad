00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.390
In this session, we're going to build on
our understanding of Boolean expressions

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.430
to create if else statements.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.370
If else statements will give
us the ability to branch or

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.310
redirect the execution of our
applications based on truth values.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.160
So if something's true, do this.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.660
If something's false, do this.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.950
And that's just a simple case.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.970
But by the end of this session,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.720
we'll build pretty complex
logic using this concept.
