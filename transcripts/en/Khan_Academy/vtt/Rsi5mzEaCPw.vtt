00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.630
So I've got an
arbitrary triangle here.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.830
We'll call it triangle ABC.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.130
And what I want to do
is look at the midpoints

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.840
of each of the sides of ABC.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.050
So this is the midpoint of
one of the sides, of side BC.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.160
Let's call that point D. Let's
call this midpoint E. And let's

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.720
call this midpoint
right over here F.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.320
And since it's the
midpoint, we know

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.380
that the distance between BD
is equal to the distance from D

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.210
to C. So this distance is
equal to this distance.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.380
We know that AE is equal
to EC, so this distance

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.970
is equal to that distance.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.620
And we know that
AF is equal to FB,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.150
so this distance is
equal to this distance.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.399
Instead of drawing medians
going from these midpoints

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.940
to the vertices,
what I want to do is

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.090
I want to connect these
midpoints and see what happens.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.830
So if I connect them, I
clearly have three points.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.970
So if you connect three
non-linear points like this,

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.710
you will get another triangle.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.470
And this triangle that's formed
from the midpoints of the sides

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.623
of this larger triangle-- we
call this a medial triangle.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.880
And that's all nice
and cute by itself.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.060
But what we're going
to see in this video

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.590
is that the medial
triangle actually

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.800
has some very neat properties.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.210
What we're actually
going to show

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.290
is that it divides any triangle
into four smaller triangles

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.220
that are congruent
to each other,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.530
that all four of these triangles
are identical to each other.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.610
And they're all similar
to the larger triangle.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.430
And you could think
of them each as having

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.320
1/4 of the area of
the larger triangle.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.650
So let's go about proving it.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.700
So first, let's focus
on this triangle down

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.310
here, triangle CDE.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.200
And it looks similar
to the larger triangle,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.450
to triangle CBA.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.964
But let's prove it to ourselves.

00:01:44.964 --> 00:01:47.130
So one thing we can say is,
well, look, both of them

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.570
share this angle
right over here.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.650
Both the larger triangle,
triangle CBA, has this angle.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.630
And the smaller triangle,
CDE, has this angle.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.460
So they definitely
share that angle.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.950
And then let's think about
the ratios of the sides.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:14.240
We know that the ratio of CD
to CB is equal to 1 over 2.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.350
This is 1/2 of this entire
side, is equal to 1 over 2.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.980
And that's the same thing
as the ratio of CE to CA.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.040
CE is exactly 1/2 of CA,
because E is the midpoint.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.880
It's equal to CE over CA.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.295
So we have an angle,
corresponding angles that

00:02:33.295 --> 00:02:35.150
are congruent, and
then the ratios

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.840
of two corresponding sides
on either side of that angle

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.480
are the same.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.010
CD over CB is 1/2, CE over CA
is 1/2, and the angle in between

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.120
is congruent.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:03:03.460
So by SAS similarity, we
know that triangle CDE

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.070
is similar to triangle CBA.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.860
And just from that, you can
get some interesting results.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.318
Because then we
know that the ratio

00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:20.230
of this side of the smaller
triangle to the longer triangle

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.880
is also going to be 1/2.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.880
Because the other two
sides have a ratio of 1/2,

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.710
and we're dealing with
similar triangles.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.860
So this is going
to be 1/2 of that.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.750
And we know 1/2 of AB is just
going to be the length of FA.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.960
So we know that this
length right over here

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.911
is going to be the
same as FA or FB.

00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:39.910
And we get that straight
from similar triangles.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:49.290
Because these are similar,
we know that DE over BA

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.730
has got to be equal
to these ratios,

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.650
the other corresponding
sides, which is equal to 1/2.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.580
And so that's how we got
that right over there.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.395
Now let's think about
this triangle up here.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.187
We could call it BDF.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.610
So first of all, if
we compare triangle

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.930
BDF to the larger
triangle, they both share

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.780
this angle right
over here, angle ABC.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.810
They both have that
angle in common.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.279
And we're going to have
the exact same argument.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.714
You can just look
at this diagram.

00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:27.120
And you know that the ratio
of BA-- let me do it this way.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.950
The ratio of BF to
BA is equal to 1/2,

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.725
which is also the
ratio of BD to BC.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.830
The ratio of this
to that is the same

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.710
as the ratio of this
to that, which is 1/2.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.360
Because BD is 1/2 of
this whole length.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.500
BF is 1/2 of that whole length.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.860
And so you have
corresponding sides

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.860
have the same ratio
on the two triangles,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.450
and they share an
angle in between.

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:03.010
So once again, by
SAS similarity,

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.980
we know that triangle--
I'll write it

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:18.750
this way-- DBF is
similar to triangle CBA.

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.420
And once again, we use this
exact same kind of argument

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.435
that we did with this triangle.

00:05:28.435 --> 00:05:31.060
Well, if it's similar, the ratio
of all the corresponding sides

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.070
have to be the same.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.380
And that ratio is 1/2.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.680
So the ratio of this
side to this side,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.420
the ratio of FD to
AC, has to be 1/2.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.100
Or FD has to be 1/2 of AC.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.750
And 1/2 of AC is just
the length of AE.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.710
So that is just going to be
that length right over there.

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.700
I think you see
where this is going.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.470
And also, because it's similar,
all of the corresponding angles

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.490
have to be the same.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.990
And we know that
the larger triangle

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.870
has a yellow angle
right over there.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.766
So we'd have that yellow
angle right over here.

00:06:03.766 --> 00:06:05.140
And this triangle
right over here

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.440
was also similar to
the larger triangle.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.760
So it will have that same
angle measure up here.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.660
We already showed that
in this first part.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.864
So now let's go to
this third triangle.

00:06:14.864 --> 00:06:16.030
I think you see the pattern.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.155
I'm sure you might be able
to just pause this video

00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:19.770
and prove it for yourself.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:25.800
But we see that the
ratio of AF over AB

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.776
is going to be the
same as the ratio of AE

00:06:28.776 --> 00:06:33.380
over AC, which is equal to 1/2.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.970
So we have two corresponding
sides where the ratio is 1/2,

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.960
from the smaller
to larger triangle.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.510
And they share a common angle.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.450
They share this angle in
between the two sides.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.470
So by SAS similarity--
this is getting repetitive

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:59.563
now-- we know that triangle
EFA is similar to triangle CBA.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.460
And so the ratio of all
of the corresponding sides

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.680
need to be 1/2.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.000
So the ratio of FE to
BC needs to be 1/2,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.630
or FE needs to be 1/2 of that,
which is just the length of BD.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.720
So this is just going to be
that length right over there.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.500
And you can also
say that since we've

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.380
shown that this triangle, this
triangle, and this triangle--

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.005
we haven't talked
about this middle one

00:07:24.005 --> 00:07:26.640
yet-- they're all similar
to the larger triangle.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.890
So they're also all going
to be similar to each other.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.080
So they're all going to have
the same corresponding angles.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.332
So if the larger triangle
had this yellow angle here,

00:07:34.332 --> 00:07:35.790
then all of the
triangles are going

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:38.520
to have this yellow
angle right over there.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.620
And if the larger triangle
had this blue angle

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.280
right over here, then in
the corresponding vertex,

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.005
all of the triangles are
going to have that blue angle.

00:07:46.005 --> 00:07:47.880
All of the ones that
we've shown are similar.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:50.750
We haven't thought about this
middle triangle just yet.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.780
And of course, if this
is similar to the whole,

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:56.310
it'll also have this
angle at this vertex

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.820
right over here, because this
corresponds to that vertex,

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.152
based on the similarity.

00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:02.068
So that's interesting.

00:08:02.068 --> 00:08:06.640
Now let's compare the
triangles to each other.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.240
We've now shown that
all of these triangles

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.200
have the exact same three sides.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.520
Has this blue side-- or
actually, this one-mark side,

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.760
this two-mark side, and
this three-mark side.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.220
One mark, two mark, three mark.

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:19.910
One mark, two mark, three mark.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.670
And that even applies
to this middle triangle

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.020
right over here.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:35.049
So by side-side-side
congruency, we now know--

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:38.000
and we want to be careful to get
our corresponding sides right--

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.220
we now know that triangle CDE
is congruent to triangle DBF.

00:08:49.707 --> 00:08:51.290
I want to get the
corresponding sides.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.980
I'm looking at the colors.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.420
I went from yellow to magenta
to blue, yellow, magenta,

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.910
to blue, which is going to
be congruent to triangle

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:04.921
EFA, which is going to be
congruent to this triangle

00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:05.420
in here.

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.180
But we want to make
sure that we're

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.480
getting the right
corresponding sides here.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.010
So to make sure we
do that, we just

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.770
have to think about the angles.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.100
So we know-- and
this is interesting--

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.330
that because the interior
angles of a triangle

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.820
add up to 180 degrees,
we know this magenta

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.600
angle plus this blue angle plus
this yellow angle equal 180.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.010
Here, we have the blue
angle and the magenta angle,

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.610
and clearly they will
all add up to 180.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.600
So you must have the blue angle.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.850
The blue angle must
be right over here.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.300
Same argument-- yellow
angle and blue angle,

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.510
we must have the magenta
angle right over here.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.690
They add up to 180.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.250
So this must be
the magenta angle.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.630
And then finally,
magenta and blue-- this

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:47.192
must be the yellow
angle right over there.

00:09:47.192 --> 00:09:48.900
And so when we wrote
the congruency here,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.890
we started at CDE.

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:53.710
We went yellow, magenta, blue.

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:57.190
So over here, we're going
to go yellow, magenta, blue.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.544
So it's going to be
congruent to triangle FED.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.620
And so that's pretty cool.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:09.472
We just showed that all
three, that this triangle,

00:10:09.472 --> 00:10:11.430
this triangle, this
triangle, and that triangle

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:12.530
are congruent.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.830
And also, we can look
at the corresponding--

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.680
and that they all have
ratios relative to-- they're

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.520
all similar to the larger
triangle, to triangle ABC.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.430
And that the ratio between
the sides is 1 to 2.

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.940
And also, because we've looked
at corresponding angles,

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.520
we see, for example,
that this angle

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.770
is the same as that angle.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.860
So if you viewed DC
or if you viewed BC

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:35.710
as a transversal,
all of a sudden

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:40.440
it becomes pretty clear that FD
is going to be parallel to AC,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.130
because the corresponding
angles are congruent.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:46.900
So this is going to be parallel
to that right over there.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.060
And then you could use
that same exact argument

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.780
to say, well, then this
side, because once again,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.080
corresponding angles
here and here-- you

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.490
could say that
this is going to be

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:01.750
parallel to that
right over there.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.360
And then finally, you make
the same argument over here.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.820
I want to make sure I get the
right corresponding angles.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.060
You have this line
and this line.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:13.850
And this angle
corresponds to that angle.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:14.980
They're the same.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:21.410
So this DE must
be parallel to BA.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.280
So that's another neat property
of this medial triangle,

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.409
[? I thought. ?]
All of these things

00:11:27.409 --> 00:11:29.950
just jump out when you just try
to do something fairly simple

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.180
with a triangle.
