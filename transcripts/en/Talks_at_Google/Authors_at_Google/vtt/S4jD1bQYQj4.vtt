00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
everybody.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.300
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.390
My name is [? Marjay. ?]

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.310
And for this segment of Authors
at Google, I have the

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.980
pleasure of introducing
Jeremy Scahill.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.210
So I had the privilege of
meeting Jeremy at this year's

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.379
Sundance Film Festival after
watching the premiere of his

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.850
new documentary film "Dirty
Wars," which he

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.770
co-wrote and produced.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.120
This talk is pretty timely due
to the US military tactics

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.280
being a hot topic in
the news today.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.270
So we've all been really
anticipating his visit with us

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.729
to discuss his new book "Dirty
Wars, The World is a

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:33.980
Battlefield."

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.130
So I'm going to brag about
Jeremy a little bit here.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.240
So Jeremy Scahill is
a National Security

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.110
Correspondent for "The Nation"
magazine and is a Puffin

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.230
Foundation Writing Fellow
at the Nation Institute.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.250
Jeremy has reported from around
the world in countries

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.900
such as Afghanistan, Somalia,
Iraq, Nigeria, and Yemen.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.270
Jeremy is also author of the
New York Times Best Seller

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.580
"Black Water," The Rise of
the World's Most Powerful

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.290
Mercenary Army."

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.760
Jeremy's courageous work has
sparked several congressional

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.640
investigations and won some of
journalism's highest honors.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.270
He was twice awarded the George
Polk Award, in 1998 for

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.970
foreign reporting and in 2008
for his book "Blackwater."

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.370
I found this quote online
the other day.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.230
And I really think it sums up
Jeremy pretty perfectly.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.930
"There is no journalist in
America who has exposed the

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.310
truth about US government
militarism more bravely, more

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.070
relentlessly, and more valuably
than Jeremy Scahill."

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.050
So that being said, please join
me in welcoming Jeremy

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.580
Scahill to Talks at Google.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.170
JEREMY SCAHILL: It's really
great to be with all of you.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.250
I use so many Google products
that to actually be here is a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.850
bit surreal.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.250
And I'm hoping that one of you
has access to the servers

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.950
because I'd like to permanently
delete some of my

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.130
emails from a few years
ago, if someone can

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.290
help facilitate that.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.110
I've tried very hard to figure
out how to do it.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.330
So, I guess, come see
me afterwards.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.640
It's also interesting because
in looking at the US drone

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.520
program, of course, you almost
never hear any US officials

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.360
publicly acknowledge that the US
is engaged in drone bombing

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.490
around the world.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.780
And the first time that I'm
aware of that President Obama

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.440
actually addressed the issue was
on a Google+ Hangout where

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.920
he was asked a question
by a young person

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.000
about the drone program.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.090
And he answered it.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.200
And it was at his Hangout that
he did it at the White House,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.640
which is interesting because at
the time they wouldn't talk

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.600
to journalists about it.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.730
But then when he did the
Hangout, he talked about it.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.660
So I often joked that the new
way that we declassify

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.190
information in our society is
for somehow to have officials

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.220
go on Google+ Hangouts or late
night talk shows, which is

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.600
primarily how this
administration has discussed

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.630
the more covert aspects
of its wars.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.110
I think we're living in a moment
where, I think, we're

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.020
going to look back years from
now and realize that there

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.450
were things done during the
course of the Obama

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.970
administration that ended up
solidifying, as sort of

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.870
permanent fixtures of US
national security policy, some

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.490
of the worst aspects of what
many people attribute to the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.910
Bush-Cheney era.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.720
And because you have a popular
constitutional law professor,

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.300
Nobel Peace Prize winning
Democratic president in office

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.040
continuing some of the policies
that many liberals

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.870
opposed when they were being
enacted by Bush and Cheney,

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.330
the chances of sort
of dismantling the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.880
counter-terrorism apparatus
that's been built up over the

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.560
past two administrations is
going to be very unlikely.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.030
I think that we are now in
an area where the Obama

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.510
administration has made
assassination a central part

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.200
of what is called US national
security policy.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.170
And if McCain had won the
election in '08, I don't

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.130
believe for a moment that you
would have been seeing polls

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.310
indicating that 70% of
self-identified liberals

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.380
support drone strikes and that
support for those strikes

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.560
drops only negligibly when the
target in question is an

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.380
American citizen.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.430
I think that President Obama
has effectively sold the

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.320
concept to liberals, to the
liberal base, that he's waging

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.579
a smarter war and a cleaner war
where there are strikes

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.839
that are surgically taking out
terrorists that are plotting

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.620
against the United States.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.200
And I think that a lot of the
trust that people place in

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.190
Obama is going to come back to
haunt us when a Marco Rubio is

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.760
in office or a Jeb Bush is in
office and they say, well, you

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.020
guys can't say anything to us
because when Obama was doing

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.130
it, you were cheering it on.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.900
And I think, in sort of looking
at the five years of

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.290
the Obama administration, I've
sort of come to the conclusion

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.930
that our real principles, what
we actually believe, is not

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.490
tested when someone that we sort
of loathe is in office.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.260
It's easy to be against
Dick Cheney.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.940
And I do sort of imagine him as
this Darth Vader character

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.280
in his lair, plotting the
destruction of the world so

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.400
that Halliburton stocks
can go up.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.720
But I think that Obama
is different.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.720
I think that President Obama
believes sincerely that he's

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.640
engaged in the most effective
way to keep the country safe.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.360
And I certainly disagree
with that conclusion.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.190
And I'm going to talk about some
of the reasons why and

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.850
the countries where I've
traveled and sort of how I see

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.850
these covert wars unfolding and
the impact that they're

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:20.720
going to have.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.710
But we're not tested when
someone that's easy to hate or

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.830
oppose is in office, that's
almost sort of cartoonishly

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.870
devilish in his presentation.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.480
Your principles are tested when
someone that you actually

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.390
like is in office or that
you may have voted for.

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:37.250
And when you look at the
policies and say, I like this

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.410
person as a political leader.

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:40.360
And I'm inspired by him.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.670
But I'm against these
particular policies.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.010
That's what principle is.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.500
It's you don't cede
your conscience

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.520
to a political figure.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.160
Then, you're not actually
engaged in fighting for a

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.790
better country.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:55.400
You're ceding your ability to
make decisions or formulate

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.320
principles to a partisan
political figure.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.310
Right now, we don't know how
many countries the US is at

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:05.950
war in or at war against.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.250
There are, by some estimates,
US special operations forces

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.300
deployed in 75 to 100 countries
around the world.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.780
And that doesn't mean that we
are doing drone strikes there

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.430
or cruise missile strikes.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.960
In some cases, there's a very
small covert presence.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.320
And they're doing night raids or
snatching individuals that

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.750
are deemed to be threats
or bumping people off.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.750
In some of the countries,
there are drone strikes.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.010
In many of them, the
relationship is that the US is

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.250
sending some of its most elite
commandos to embed with or

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.070
train or facilitate
the actions of

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.780
local government forces.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.340
In places like Yemen, for
instance, the United States

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.840
has built up a counter-terrorism
unit there.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.020
And it can become problematic
when you build up these units

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.180
with tremendous American
technology and brain power and

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.290
then expect that they're going
to be fighting al-Qaeda when

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.360
what ends up happening at the
end of the day is that these

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.710
elite US trained forces are used
to defend a failing or

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.890
flailing regime.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.130
And that certainly happened
in Yemen.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.640
And it sparked tremendous amount
of anger in Yemen that

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.880
this elite force that the US
built up of Yemenis to target

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.220
al-Qaeda actually was used to
defend the regime when the

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.030
Arab Spring was happening.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.100
In Somalia, I went to Mogadishu,
which at the time

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.760
was in summer of 2011.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.600
There was incredibly fierce
fighting in Mogadishu.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:26.400
A militant movement called
al-Shababb was in control of

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.450
roughly 50% of the capital, and
by some estimates, 40% to

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.620
60% of the rest of Somalia.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.640
And they're fighting against a
network of US funded warlords,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.830
some of whom had actually been
allies of al-Qaeda in an

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.330
earlier iteration
in their lives.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.130
And they're now on the US
payroll as sort of proxy

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.790
forces to hunt down people that
the US has deemed to be

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:50.990
Islamist radicals or within the
leadership of al-Qaeda in

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:52.570
East Africa or in al-Shabaab.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.460
And there's also a massive
African Union peacekeeping

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:58.590
force primarily made up of
Ugandian and Burundian

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:01.150
soldiers that are funded,
trained, equipped, armed by

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:02.430
the United States.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.790
And when I flew into the
airport, into Aden Adde

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:10.925
International Airport, when we
landed on the ground and we

00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:14.550
were taxiing, I noticed this
huge structure that looked to

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:16.650
me like a forward operating
base that you would see in

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.710
Afghanistan or Iraq
or elsewhere.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.780
And it appeared to be a
relatively new construction.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.320
And there was basically like a
small village inside of it of

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.730
houses and administrative
looking buildings.

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:30.020
And then there were some small
hangars for aircraft.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.559
And when I met up with my Somali
contact, who was going

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.200
to take us around Mogadishu
for a couple of weeks and

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.630
hopefully keep us alive, I said,
what's that building?

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.409
And he said, oh, that's
Guantanamo.

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.880
And I say, well, what
do you mean?

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.120
He goes, oh, that's where
the Americans are.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.770
We call it Guantanamo.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.520
And I said, well, what
goes on there?

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.010
And he said, well, the Americans
are training Somali

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:52.770
forces there.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:55.040
And then they go out and do
operations in the city.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.700
And to me it was sort
of incredible.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.310
I had never heard of this.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.730
This is under the Obama
administration.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.320
There's this base.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.280
It's the worst kept secret in
Somalia that the Americans

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.170
have a base at the airport.

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:07.130
I mean, not the greatest place
to stick a covert base for

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:08.330
counter-terrorism operations.

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.800
But nonetheless, there it was.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.950
And I ended up investigating
what goes on at that base and

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:16.360
found Somalis who were liaising
with the CIA.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.260
And they were from the sort
of fragile government that

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.440
existed in Mogadishu.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.310
And they were working with
the CIA and US military

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.990
intelligence to hunt down and
target the leadership of

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.560
al-Shabaab.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:31.380
And one Somali agent described
to me how the Americans would

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.350
line up the Somali operatives
that they were working with in

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:37.950
training and pay them $200 a
month in cash to serve as this

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.270
kind of hit force within
the country.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:45.760
I also discovered that there is
a prison in the basement of

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.990
Somalia's US backed and US
funded National Security

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.010
Service, which is their main
intelligence service.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:55.430
And that in the basement of this
prison, there are people

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.340
that have been snatched from
other countries in East Africa

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.250
and taken there in rendition
flights, some of which have

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.980
been directed by the
United States.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.170
So the Obama administration, or
the CIA, will instruct the

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:13.120
Kenyan military or Kenyan secret
police to go and snatch

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.300
someone from a neighborhood in
Nairobi and take them to

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.400
Wilson Airport and then shackle
them, hood them, and

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.850
fly them to Somalia where
they're then put in this

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.220
prison and interrogated at
times by US personnel,

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.170
intelligence or military
personnel.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:31.310
And I met a journalist who was
put in that prison for filming

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.460
an operation that
the government

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.340
didn't want him to film.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:37.040
And he told me that there were
Americans in there that were

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.260
interrogating prisoners.

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.610
And then we discovered, we had
smuggled out of that prison

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.540
the testimony of a guy who had
been kidnapped in Kenya and

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.180
taken to that prison because the
Americans believe that he

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.010
had information on one of the
senior leaders of al-Qaeda in

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:50.560
East Africa.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.830
And they took him out of his
home in Kenya, flew him there.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.190
And then he was being
interrogated repeatedly by

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.970
American agents.

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:58.510
And the journalists described
the prison to me as infested

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.620
with bed bugs, no
natural light.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.150
Prisoners are never
allowed outside.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.600
None of them have access
to lawyers.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.560
In many cases, their family
members don't even know that

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.180
they're there, including people
that have been taken

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.470
from countries outside
of Somalia.

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.140
And I'm telling you this story
because when President Obama

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.280
was first elected, he issued a
series of executive orders.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:23.780
One was to close the US prison
at Guantanamo in Cuba.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:27.670
Another was to dismantle the
network of secret CIA prisons

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:30.390
in countries like Poland or
Thailand or elsewhere.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.830
And then another was aimed at
ending the practice of torture

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.270
or what the Bush-Cheney
administration liked to call

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.140
enhanced interrogation
techniques.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.010
And President Obama said that
our interrogation methods are

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.050
going to conform to the US Army
Field Manual and that

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:47.070
we're not going to be using
techniques such as water

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.780
boarding on prisoners and
putting them in boxes with

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.400
insects and other things
that happened under

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.900
the Bush-Cheney era.

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.260
But what actually has happened
is that the Obama

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:00.690
administration has sort of
tweaked some of the program

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:05.010
and has re-branded it as a sort
of more humane, lawful

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.640
approach to counter-terrorism.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.440
So instead of snatching someone
ourselves and putting

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.510
them in a CIA Cessna and flying
them to Thailand or

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:16.930
Poland or elsewhere to put them
in a CIA black site, we

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:20.570
are instructing other
governments to abduct the

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.760
people for us or snatch or pick
up the people that we

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.880
want taken and then to fly them
to a prison that's not

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.970
run by the United States.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.840
It's run by something
resembling a

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.240
government in Somalia.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.170
And then our intelligence
operatives have access to

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.390
these prisoners.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.400
So is it different from
the Bush-Cheney era?

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:36.880
Yes, it is.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:39.300
It's that they've outsourced
some of the

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.420
aspects of the program.

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.820
But rendition continues
under Obama.

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:47.750
The use of prisons that are
secret and human rights abuses

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.740
are still happening at the
request of the United States

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:51.450
government.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.300
And so I think that the Obama
administration can say, we've

00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:56.430
shut down all of these things.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:56.840
And it's true.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.510
They have.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:00.440
But they found a way to continue
them through a sort

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.540
of backdoor approach.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.700
Now the President has failed to
close Guantanamo, not just

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.180
because he hasn't fought
hard enough on it.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.990
Republicans have been
blocking funding.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.670
But one of the results of the
sort of Guantanamo issue

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.140
festering, and the fact that
there are 27 people now that

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:16.970
are being forced fed in
Guantanamo that are on hunger

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.720
strike, many of the prisoners
have already

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.670
been cleared for release.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.020
And the US refuses to release
those individuals.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:25.850
President Obama doesn't want
to stick more people in

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:26.790
Guantanamo.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.870
Every time they try to prosecute
someone on terrorism

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.220
charges in the civilian
courts, the

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:32.480
Republicans go bananas.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.930
They want them treated
as enemy combatants.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.030
They don't want them to have
access to Miranda rights.

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.440
So a pattern that we've seen is
that instead of focusing on

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.710
capturing these individuals and
trying to bring them to

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:46.110
justice in our civilian court
system, the program has, in

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.070
many cases, become just
a kill program.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.710
It used to be kill-capture.

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:52.100
And the capture part of it
resulted in secret prisons and

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.980
Guantanamo and military
commissions.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.580
And so it's more convenient and
expedient, in the eyes of

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.040
the administration, to just
start killing the people that

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.810
the US suspects are plotting
acts of terror against the

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:03.800
United States.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.650
Now, having been in Somalia and
traveled in areas that are

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:11.320
under the control of al-Qaeda
in Yemen and Somalia and

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:15.960
elsewhere, I know first-hand
that there are people plotting

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.150
to kill Americans.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.230
These are real plots.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:20.210
They want to blow up
our airplanes.

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.700
They want to poison
water supplies.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.010
They want to set off bombs in
Times Square or elsewhere.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:26.280
I mean, this is real.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.760
This is not some invented
threat.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.380
I mean, there are dangerous
groups of people that are

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.450
plotting these things.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.710
And I believe that, as a nation,
we have a right to

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:36.110
defend ourselves.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.880
So I'm not a pacifist.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.600
But my concern is that in the
pursuit of a relatively small

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.070
group of people, who are
plotting against the United

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:49.530
States, we are actually creating
more new enemies than

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:51.450
we are killing actual
terrorists.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:54.190
I don't know if many of you have
heard of this policy that

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.750
has been popularized under
President Obama with the

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:57.840
approach to drones.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.560
But it's called signature
strikes.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.380
And it started in Pakistan and
has now expanded to Yemen.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.580
And to me, it's sort of a
grotesque form of pre-crime.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.110
it's sort of like "Minority
Report" where if you are a

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.670
military aged male in a certain
region of Pakistan or

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:16.930
a certain region of Yemen and
you are with a group of other

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.010
military aged males and someone
in that group has been

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.930
in phone contact with someone
that the United States is

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.660
watching as a potential
terrorist or you've visited a

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.630
certain building where the
US has been monitoring a

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:32.110
suspected terrorist, they will
create a pattern of life and

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:35.020
preemptively determine that
those people, because of who

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:38.250
they're associated with and
where they reside and the fact

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.580
that they're males, that
they are terrorists.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.940
And so when the US kills them,
then they declare them as

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.890
terrorists, even when they don't
know the identities of

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:48.480
the people that they're killing
or have any actual

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.190
evidence that they're engaged
in terror plots.

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:55.570
And the impact of this on the
ground has been to enrage

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.540
tribal leaders and ordinary
people, Bedouin villagers and

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.210
others, who don't understand
why the United States is

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:04.600
killing them and the leaders
of al-Qaeda in the Arabian

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:08.570
Peninsula are still walking
around as free men.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.590
Said al-Shihri, one of the
leaders of al-Qaeda in the

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:12.860
Arabian peninsula, has been
killed 12 times this year by

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.080
the United States.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.300
He was killed a few weeks ago
just before he released a new

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:19.350
audiotape referencing
current events.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.210
And the point I'm making is
the number three guy in

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.370
al-Qaeda, we've kill
him a bunch times.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.690
But these guys in Yemen, who
are supposedly the most

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.250
dangerous leaders of
the organization,

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:28.150
have not been killed.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.300
And a tremendous number of
civilians have been killed.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.840
So I was hearing from Yemenis,
when I was traveling in these

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.090
tribal areas in the South, you
call al-Qaeda terrorism.

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.740
We say your drones
are terrorism.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:41.260
And for them, they're right.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.420
We are the terrorists to them
because they don't understand

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.290
the logic of why we're drone
bombing their villages.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.300
Many of these tribes are not
inclined to support al-Qaeda.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:51.320
Al-Qaeda has been a threat
to them as well.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.040
And they don't want to be at
war with the United States.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.270
It's not in their interest.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.580
It's not in their
tribal interest.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.110
It's not in their national
interest.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:01.540
And so instead of taking an
approach where we could work

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.010
with some of the tribes who
are predisposed to despise

00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:08.050
al-Qaeda, we are pushing them
into the fold of if not

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.359
supporting al-Qaeda, taking up a
mentality of the enemy of my

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.540
enemy is my friend.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.960
And so I started this at the
beginning by saying that I

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.440
think that a lot of liberals
believe that Obama's waging a

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:18.880
smarter, cleaner war.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:22.560
Because on the Google+ Hangout,
Obama said that the

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.970
numbers of civilians killed has
been exaggerated and that

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:28.510
it actually is a relatively
small group of people.

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.240
Those of us that have been going
to these countries as

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.670
journalists and reporting on
it all have come across

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:36.830
stories that are just shocking
in the number of civilians

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:38.200
that have actually
been killed.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:43.860
And so you can argue that drone
strikes are a smarter

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.560
alternative to big military
deployments.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.470
But Obama was never considering
sending

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.850
in troops to Yemen.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.340
So it's sort of a false
choice that a lot

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.660
of people put forward.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.940
But also, to say that it's a
smarter policy and a more

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:59.840
effective policy and a cleaner
policy without acknowledging

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.310
the potential for blowback that
these strikes are causing

00:18:03.310 --> 00:18:05.340
is to only tell part
of the story.

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.740
And so in order to have an
actual debate in this country

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.920
about what a real national
security policy would look

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.670
like, we would actually have to
have a full assessment of

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.020
who actually has been killed
in the drone strikes.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.180
Because when we're doing
signature strikes and we don't

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.960
know who the people are and we
don't have actual evidence

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.610
that they're engaged in a real
plot, I think we're ultimately

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:26.080
undermining our own national
security because we're giving

00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:30.900
a new generation of people a
legitimate reason to want to

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.360
harm Americans.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.110
This is not about our freedom
or our McDonald's.

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.350
This is, you killed my family.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:40.670
And revenge is a very, very
powerful motivator.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.090
And I fear that we are going to
pay for this, if not in the

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.830
next few years, sometime
down the line.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.310
One of the things we all have
to-- when we look at the

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:52.760
history of how did 9/11 happen,
if we want to really

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:57.110
face the facts, 9/11 happened
in part as a result of US

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.410
foreign policy.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:02.770
And it was a response to a
widely held perception that

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.500
the US was at war against Islam
and that the United

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.630
States was an unquestioning
supporter of Israel's

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.870
activities in the Middle East
and against the Palestinians.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.560
It was not just some sort of
comic book version of they

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.920
hate our freedom.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.190
And I think we don't study
history at our own peril.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:22.550
We have to learn from
these events.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.750
And I think that the people that
will pay the price for it

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.600
are not going to be folks in the
US military or political

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.250
leaders in the US.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:30.920
It's going to be American
tourists somewhere.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.590
Or it's going to be kids
at a sporting event.

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.750
And I fear for the impact that
our policies are going to have

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.430
down the line.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:44.250
We really crossed a line, I
think, in this continuation of

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.220
the Bush era policies
in late 2011.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.540
There were a series of strikes
that were authorized by

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.540
President Obama in Yemen.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:53.660
One was on September 30, 2011.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:57.120
And then the other was on
October 14, 2011 where three

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.720
US citizens were killed
in drone strikes.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.980
And the main target of the first
drone strike was this

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.580
guy named Anwar Al-Aulaqi.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.930
And I'm sure many of you have
seen some clip or something

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:13.310
from his videos that have been
posted on YouTube or elsewhere

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:16.950
where you see this guy with a
big beard with a camouflaged

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:21.450
jacket in front of a black flag
calling for armed jihad

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:25.050
against the United States and
calling on young Muslims in

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:29.440
Western countries to rise up
within their own countries,

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.500
whether it's the United States
or Britain, and plot attacks

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.360
or to come to Afghanistan or
Yemen or Somalia to join the

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.780
fronts of jihad.

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:39.520
Well, Anwar Al-Aulaqi has
a fascinating story.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:41.340
And it really is part of
the spine of my book.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.080
I got to know his family
very well.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.860
And his father is actually an
extraordinary man, this guy

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:50.110
named Dr. Nasser Al-Aulaqi.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.480
He's an agricultural engineer
and one of the leading people

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.170
in Yemen trying to work on the
country's water crisis.

00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.130
Yemen may be the first country
in the world to completely run

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:58.040
out of water.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.020
And this man has spent his
entire life trying to address

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:01.830
that problem.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:06.370
And he came to the US, Dr.
Nasser Al-Aulaqi, in 1966 as a

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:07.970
Fulbright scholar.

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:10.660
And he showed me this essay that
he wrote when he was a

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.550
young student.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:14.810
He said in it that he was
mesmerized by the

00:21:14.810 --> 00:21:17.440
progressivism of America and
that he wanted to be a part of

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.510
it and that he wanted to get an
American education and live

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:22.600
his life according to the
American spirit and then go

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:26.450
back to Yemen and contribute to
improving the lives of his

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:27.280
countrymen.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.720
So he comes here in '66.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.230
And he's studying at New Mexico
State University.

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:34.170
And he ends up getting his
degree very quickly and then

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.520
moves on to getting
a Master's degree.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.760
And his wife comes over
and joins him.

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.900
And she got her GED in
the United States.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.710
And she was working at a candy
factory to help support her

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:44.070
husband while he getting
his education.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:47.920
And in 1971, they had their
first child, Anwar Al-Aulaqi,

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.420
who was born in Las Cruces,
New Mexico.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.550
And Nasser told me, at the time,
you could smoke cigars

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:53.230
in the hospitals.

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.720
And he passed out "It's
a Boy" cigars.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.640
And they really wanted to raise
Anwar as an American.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.310
And they were contemplating
staying in the United States.

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:03.870
And they moved to the Twin
Cities in Minnesota.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.020
And Nasser took a job at
a university there.

00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:09.370
And Anwar went to grade school
and went to the YMCA.

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:10.800
And they took trips
to Disneyland.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.630
And his first language
was English.

00:22:12.630 --> 00:22:17.800
And when Anwar was seven, the
family moved back to Yemen so

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.110
that Nasser could take a job
building up the Department of

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:23.260
Agricultural Engineering
at Sana'a University.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.870
And he did that with millions of
dollars in support from the

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:26.550
US government.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.250
And he worked closely
with USAID.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:32.040
And Anwar went to a school in
Yemen that was bilingual.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.870
And he went to school with
the elite of the country,

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:37.220
including the children of the
dictator Ali Abdullah Saleh.

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:40.070
Some of his classmates in that
school would go on to be the

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:43.530
people the US worked with to try
to kill Anwar Al-Aulaqi.

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.720
He graduates from high school
and then wants to go back to

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.850
the US to go to university.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.200
And he goes to Colorado,
just as the Gulf War

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.720
was starting in 1991.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:53.950
And at that time, Anwar
Al-Aulaqi was

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:54.940
not a religious guy.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.990
He was going to study
engineering.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.650
I remember myself, I was 16
when the Gulf War started.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:02.950
And it was the first time that
I really came face-to-face

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.040
with the fact that the US is
engaged in these wars.

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.120
And I remember being
actually afraid.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.290
You heard Bernard Shaw on the
phone under a desk for CNN and

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:11.910
Peter Arnett.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:13.600
And I was shocked that there
was someone actually named

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.310
Wolf Blitzer who was reporting
from the Pentagon.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:19.190
And Al-Aulaqi sort of became
politicized by that war.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.430
And he started doing some
anti-war organizing and was

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.160
invited by a local mosque
in Colorado to

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.110
come and give a lecture.

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:29.490
And the imam at the mosque was
quite taken with him and said,

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:30.960
you have a real gift
for speech.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.110
I think you should continue
to come back.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.950
And Anwar started to spend more
and more time at this

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.420
mosque and decided that he
didn't want to be an engineer

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.270
but that he wanted to study
Islam and that he wanted to

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:42.310
become an imam.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.980
And so he began a course of
Islamic scholarship and

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.680
ultimately did become an imam.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.950
And while in Denver, Colorado,
his eldest son was born,

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.890
Abdulrahman, in 1995.

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.190
And so Anwar and his family
are in Denver.

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:57.490
Then they moved to San Diego.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.540
And he's an imam at a
mosque in San Diego.

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:03.650
And when 9/11 happened, Anwar
Al-Aulaqi was the imam at a

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.740
large Islamic center in Falls
Church, Virginia called the

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:08.140
Dar Al-Hijrah Mosque.

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.910
And I remember Al-Aulaqi after
9/11 because I was working as

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:12.710
a radio producer.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:16.240
And I remember seeing him on PBS
and hearing him on NPR and

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.040
reading about him in "The
Washington Post."

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.040
Al-Aulaqi was a very public
figure after 9/11 and was much

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:24.470
in demand in the corporate media
because he was helping

00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:27.380
to make sense of the experience
that, I think, was

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.980
common among many American
Muslims where you were

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.110
horrified at the attacks, wanted
justice, like I think

00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:37.280
all of us did, and those who
did it to be brought to

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.690
justice, but also facing this
intense hatred and bigotry.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.700
And Muslim businesses were being
attacked, taxi drivers,

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.180
non-Muslims who people thought
were Muslims, like Sikhs and

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.370
others, were being attacked.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:49.390
There was this real--

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.250
I'm sure we all remember it,
this real climate of fear.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:55.670
And the day after September
11, a woman stumbled into

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:58.020
Al-Aulaqi's mosque, a Muslim
women, after being attacked

00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.230
with a baseball bat.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:03.010
And Muslim organizations and
charities were being raided.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:06.520
The FBI was putting pressure on
imams to become informants

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.400
for the government.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.970
All of this was playing out.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:13.190
And Al-Aulaqi was a prolific
speaker and

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.460
commentator in the media.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.280
And he balanced these
two worlds.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.480
And he said the United States
has a right to go into

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.900
Afghanistan and get
those responsible

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.280
for the 9/11 attacks.

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.320
And he said that the fact that
US policy, pro-Israeli policy

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.810
or what the United States had
done in Iraq during the '90s

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:34.240
with its economic sanctions and
the deaths that it caused,

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.190
that none of that justifies the
killing of one US civilian

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:40.420
in New York or at
the Pentagon.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.340
And he said this
very publicly.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.260
And you can go back and find
some of his speeches.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.340
In fact, he was considered to
be such a part of mainstream

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.000
American dialogue at the time
that he was invited by the

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.270
Pentagon to come and speak at
a luncheon on the state of

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.120
Islam in the world today.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.780
And he, in fact, did go and
deliver a lecture at the

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:00.850
Pentagon shortly after 9/11.

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:04.280
And we got the documents
on his visit.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.380
And I mentioned this
in the book.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.680
You can tell how bad the US
intelligence was at the time

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.310
because among the things they
served was a bacon sandwich at

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:13.880
the event that day when they
invite an imam to come and

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.480
speak at the Pentagon and serve
bacon sandwiches, one of

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.240
the only, I guess, humorous
moments in my book.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:21.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.080
JEREMY SCAHILL: But what ended
up happening is that Al-Aulaqi

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:31.140
was very much radicalized by the
US wars, by the invasion

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:34.340
of Iraq, by the images that came
out of Abu Ghraib, and

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.760
the use of the Guantanamo
prison.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:39.540
And his sermons started to
become sharper and sharper.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.390
And he ultimately leaves
the United States and

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.230
goes back to Yemen.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.220
And he is recording these
audio messages.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.590
And they're becoming very
popular among young Muslims

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:48.510
around the world.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.590
And his tapes start to pop
up in a number of terror

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.110
investigations in Britain,
in the US, and Canada.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:57.690
And US intelligence is becoming
concerned, not that

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.180
Al-Aulaqi is directly involved
with plots, but that his

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:04.290
message, his words, are
inspiring lone wolf terrorists

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.040
or small cells of maybe
unaffiliated potential

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.300
terrorists to attack public
transportation sites in the UK

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:13.390
or in the US.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:18.584
And they first have Al-Aulaqi on
their radar in 2005, 2006.

00:27:18.584 --> 00:27:23.250
In '06, Al-Aulaqi is in Yemen
in Sana'a, living with his

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.860
family and his father's
family.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.340
And he's taking classes.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.300
And he's recording sermons.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.720
And then one day, he is abducted
by Yemen's US trained

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.980
counter-terrorism force
and the secret police.

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.850
And they stick Anwar Al-Aulaqi
in prison for 18 months.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.490
And 17 of them he spends in
solitary confinement.

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:43.130
And he believed that the United
States was responsible

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.930
for his imprisonment.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.350
And when the United Nations
investigated it, they said

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:48.150
that his detention
was extralegal.

00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.040
And I found out through my
reporting that Al-Aulaqi was

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.780
in fact in prison at the
direction of John Negroponte,

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.540
who at the time was the
director of national

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.820
intelligence and knows a lot
about dirty wars from his time

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.810
in Central America in the '80s
when he was a major figure in

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.050
facilitating support for the
contra death squads in

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:07.120
Nicaragua and Battalion
316 in Honduras.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:11.130
But Negroponte met with a
Yemeni official and with

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:14.050
Bandar Bush, the famed Saudi
diplomat whose nickname is

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:17.160
Bandar Bush because he's so
close to the Bush family, and

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.060
said that the position of the US
is that they want Al-Aulaqi

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:22.040
kept in prison in Yemen for
four or five years so that

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.090
people forget about him and
that he's not able to keep

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:26.440
recording these sermons.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.670
And I reviewed Al-Aulaqi's
prison writings.

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:32.180
And they gave him very
few books in prison.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.150
He hated Shakespeare, thought
Shakespeare was an

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.640
imperialist.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.410
He loved Dickens and would
compare figures in the US

00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.475
government or the Yemeni
government to Uriah Heep and

00:28:41.475 --> 00:28:42.910
other characters.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:48.110
But he also started to read the
literature of very radical

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:51.060
Islamic thinkers or scholars,
including some of the people

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:54.480
that were the framers of the
concept that bin Laden used as

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.590
an inspiration to
form al-Qaeda.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.400
And he ends up being released
from prison after 18 months

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.190
because of pressure from legal
organizations in Yemen and his

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.880
tribe, which is very powerful,
the Awlaki tribe, in Yemen.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.820
So he's forced to be released
by the Yemeni government

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.120
because of the political
pressure within the country.

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.690
And he comes out of prison
a changed man.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.000
He's fully blown radical.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.030
And he starts a blog called
Imam Anwar's Blog.

00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:21.180
And the internet becomes
his mosque.

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:25.020
And he starts to celebrate
attacks against US forces in

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.240
various countries and engages
in discussions about whether

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.380
suicide bombing is permissible
under Islamic

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.510
teachings in the Quran.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.970
And ultimately, he comes out
on the side that suicide

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:38.560
bombings are acceptable
in war.

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:43.860
And the US wants
him shut down.

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.090
They're pressuring the Yemeni
government to re-arrest him.

00:29:47.090 --> 00:29:48.660
The house is being surveilled.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.160
And Al-Aulaqi decides that he's
going to go underground.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.990
So he leaves the capital of
Sana'a, goes to Shabwah

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:59.070
province in southern Yemen,
where his family is originally

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:02.450
from, and he continues to record
his sermons there.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.710
The head of Yemen's intelligence
agency comes to

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.790
Dr. Nasser Al-Aulaqi, who's
a very esteemed

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.400
figure in Yemeni society.

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.810
And they say, look Nasser, if
you don't get Anwar to come

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:16.350
back to Sana'a and go back into
the prison, the Americans

00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:17.570
are going to kill him
with a drone.

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.760
This was in April, May, 2009.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.960
And so Nasser, not wanting his
son to be killed and feeling

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.980
like there's no evidence that
he's doing anything-- yes,

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.470
he's engaged in this
radical speech.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.460
But my son's not a terrorist.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.460
He's just a guy who's views on
the world I don't share.

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.180
But I respect his freedom
of speech.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.050
He goes down to meet with his
son and says, they're going to

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.840
kill you if you don't come
back and go to prison.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.040
And Anwar sort of angrily says
to his father, what?

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.650
Are you working for
the Americans now?

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:45.920
I'm not going to let them tell
me which way to put my bed

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.660
when I sleep at night.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:47.400
I was born free.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.010
I'm going to die free.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.820
And that was the last
conversation that his father

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:51.540
had with him.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.530
So Nasser goes back.

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:54.000
And he's raising
Anwar's family.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.405
There is these three kids,
including the eldest son, who

00:30:56.405 --> 00:30:57.960
was born in Denver, Colorado.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.260
And Anwar is underground.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.830
The US starts to hunt for him.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.670
The first time that the US
tried to kill him was in

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:07.160
December of 2009.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.850
And what really sealed
Al-Aulaqi's fate was when

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:15.620
Major Nidal Hasan shot up and
massacred more than a dozen of

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:17.910
his fellow soldiers in Fort
Hood, Texas, if you remember,

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:19.420
in November 2009.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.290
And it emerged that Al-Aulaqi
had been in email touch with

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.060
Nidal Hasan.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.740
And to this day, the story
persists that Al-Aulaqi had

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:27.650
something to do with the
Fort Hood massacre.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:29.250
But the emails have now
been declassified.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.360
And if you read them--

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:34.260
US intelligence, by the way,
believed that he did not have

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.810
anything to do with the
Fort Hood massacre.

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.100
But if you look at the
declassified emails, Nidal

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.890
Hasan was almost like a creepy
stalker and was sending

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.490
Al-Aulaqi these notes saying,
I want to give

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.130
you a prize of $5,000.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:45.830
I want to have an essay
contest in your name.

00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:47.530
At one point, he asks Al-Aulaqi
to help him find a

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:48.780
Yemeni bride.

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.450
And Al-Aulaqi is like,
yeah, I'll keep an

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.140
eye out for a brother.

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.640
But he basically is sort of
batting him away and treating

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.110
him kind of like a stalker.

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:58.050
And Hasan has an interesting
story that

00:31:58.050 --> 00:31:58.900
often doesn't get told.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.720
He was an Army psychiatrist
who had been interviewing

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.930
Afghan and Iraq war vets.

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.570
And he actually tried to have
some of them prosecuted for

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:09.450
war crimes up his chain of
command for the things that

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:12.640
they had told him during their
therapy sessions and was

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.280
clearly a guy that was on
a path toward doing

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:15.190
something like this.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.450
But Al-Aulaqi, it seems, did not
have anything to do with

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:18.900
the attack.

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.390
But the fact that he had
been in email touch

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:21.260
with him became relevant.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.970
And then the day after the Fort
Hood massacre, Al-Aulaqi

00:32:24.970 --> 00:32:27.710
posted a blog post that said
Nidal Hasan is a hero and

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.540
called on other Muslims in the
military to do the same thing

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:32.100
that Nidal Hasan had done.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.530
And that's when the campaign to
try to kill Anwar Al-Aulaqi

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.110
just intensified.

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:38.410
Then when the underwear
bomber happened.

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:40.450
This deranged young Nigerian
guy, Umar Farouk

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:43.260
Abdulmutallab, tried to bring
down the US airplane by

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:46.810
setting his underpants on fire
on Christmas Day 2009.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:49.900
After that, it turned out that
Al-Aulaqi had been in

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:50.760
contact with him.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.610
And Al-Aulaqi at one point
said he was my student.

00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:53.920
But I didn't direct
him to do that.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.750
But I know him.

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:57.120
And I support what he did.

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:02.880
And so from December of 2009
until September of 2011, by my

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.020
count, the US tried to kill
Anwar Al-Aulaqi more than a

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:06.110
dozen times.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.680
And there were several very near
misses, some of which are

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.440
sort of like out of a spy
movie where they have

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.450
Al-Aulaqi's vehicle.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:14.950
They're tracking it
in the desert.

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:18.560
They shoot a hellfire missile
from a predator drone.

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.760
It misses.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.970
Al-Aulaqi calls for backup.

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.010
There's a smoke dust up.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.060
These guys come to
pick him up.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:25.540
They switch vehicles and drive
off in different directions.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.390
And the CIA ends up blowing
up the guys that

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.260
come to rescue him.

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.880
And Al-Aulaqi gets away.

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.050
And so there's this intense
hunt for him going on.

00:33:33.050 --> 00:33:37.410
And behind the scenes, there's
this incredible story.

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.320
And I tell it in my book.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.990
While the US is hunting
Al-Aulaqi, this Danish guy

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.370
named Morten Strom, also known
as Murad Storm, which is sort

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:47.430
of an amazing name given what
I'm about to tell you.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.930
He goes to the Danish
intelligence service, the PET,

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:53.630
and he says, the Americans are
looking for Anwar Al-Aulaqi.

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:54.870
I can help you find him.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.340
He's like, I was an old friend
of Al-Aulaqi's back in Yemen.

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.660
We were in school together.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.620
And we were close.

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.160
And Morten Storm was a former
motorcycle gangster with a

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.390
long criminal record who
converted to Islam and was

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.030
sort of an aspiring jihadist.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:08.340
And he had gotten to
know Al-Aulaqi in

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.520
Yemen in 2004, 2005.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.350
And so Storm goes to the Danish
intelligence and says,

00:34:13.350 --> 00:34:14.659
I can help you.

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:16.690
The Danish intelligence service
then calls in the CIA.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:18.540
And the CIA, Danish
intelligence, and this guy

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:22.909
Morten Storm concoct a plot to
find Anwar Al-Aulaqi a new

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:25.850
wife to have while
he's underground.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.010
And Morten Storm emails
Al-Aulaqi in encrypted emails

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:30.790
and says he wants to help
him find a wife.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.500
And Al-Aulaqi agrees and
wants to do this.

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:36.960
So they literally put an ad
on Facebook for a wife.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.030
And it's like Jihadist OK
Cupid or something.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.730
So they put an add
on Facebook.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:44.370
And they get all these
responses from women.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:48.530
And this young woman from
Croatia, who was a Catholic

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:53.030
who converted to Islam named
Aminah, ends up being selected

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.260
as the wife.

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.210
Now, she has no idea that she's
part of a CIA plot.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:34:58.340
She thinks she's going to marry
Anwar Al-Aulaqi and

00:34:58.340 --> 00:34:59.600
says, I'm prepared to die.

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.070
And I want to marry you.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:04.410
And Al-Aulaqi and Aminah
exchange these

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:05.830
videos back and forth.

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.300
And the videos have now
been made public.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.680
And you can see they're sort
of like Skype dating or

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:11.860
something for a while.

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.830
And eventually she says, yes,
I'm going to go and marry him.

00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:17.150
And so the CIA paid
for everything.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:19.630
They buy her plane ticket.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.460
They bought her luggage that
had tracking devices in it.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.990
And the plan was that she's
going to fly to Yemen with the

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.770
CIA tracking device Louis
Vuitton bags.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:32.210
And then she's going to go meet
up with Anwar Al-Aulaqi.

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.050
And the US is going to kill
both of them in a drone

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:37.530
strike, which there's such a
morally reprehensible aspect

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:38.010
to that story.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.590
I mean, this woman didn't
know that she was being

00:35:40.590 --> 00:35:41.820
used in this way.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:44.510
But sort of the tables turned
when she arrives in Yemen.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.210
And Al-Aulaqi's guys go to pick
her up at the airport.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:49.080
And they force her to ditch the
bags and her clothes and

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.070
give her new clothes.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.260
So the bags and clothes that
the CIA provided for her

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.090
remain in Sana'a.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.770
And she disappears into the
wilderness of Yemen and

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.630
actually marries Anwar
Al-Aulaqi and has

00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:59.570
a child with him.

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:01.370
So it's like the CIA's
dating service.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:03.450
They found this bride
for Anwar Al-Aulaqi.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.390
And she's still alive
to this day.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.480
I think she writes for "Inspire"
magazine, which is

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.080
the publication of al-Qaeda
in the Arabian Peninsula.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.010
But eventually the US finds
Anwar Al-Aulaqi in

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.380
September of 2011.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.290
And they've located him
in the north of Yemen.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.300
They had been looking all
in the south of Yemen.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:20.460
They find him.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.510
He's in the north of Yemen.

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:23.280
And he's with another American
citizen, this

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.950
Pakistani-American named Samir
Khan, who was basically like a

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:29.800
propagandist for jihadist
causes around the world.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.880
And Samir Khan's family,
I got to know them.

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.020
And they had been told by the
FBI that there's no charges

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:37.710
against Samir Khan.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:38.940
But they're very concerned
about what

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:39.590
he's up to in Yemen.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.550
They wanted him to come home.

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:42.820
And he'd found his way to Anwar
Al-Aulaqi and was sort

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:45.220
of like his assistant
or something.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:48.220
So these guys are in
this house the CIA

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.460
is monitoring it.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.530
And they're watching through
the satellites.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.510
And they're waiting for
President Obama to sign off on

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.240
the hit against Anwar
Al-Aulaqi.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.570
This was a big deal in the White
House because this was

00:36:57.570 --> 00:36:59.280
the first time that
they were going to

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.930
assassinate a US citizen.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.300
Assassinate is my word,
not there's.

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.440
They call it targeted killing
or liquidating the enemy.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.300
But it is assassination.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.760
So the US is contemplating it.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.260
And Obama ultimately says, I
want to take him out and

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:15.560
becomes prosecutor,
judge, jury, and

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:17.000
executioner of Anwar Al-Aulaqi.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.920
While they're monitoring that
house and these discussions

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.640
are going on, Al-Aulaqi's eldest
son, Abdulrahman, who

00:37:21.640 --> 00:37:24.150
hasn't seen his father in years
and is a totally normal

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.480
teenager living with his
grandparents in Sana'a and

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.210
likes hip hop music, goes to
the square with the young

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:33.570
nonviolent revolutionaries, and
was really close to his

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:34.200
younger siblings.

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.640
And I got deep into
who that kid is.

00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.410
And I know that he wasn't
involved with anything vaguely

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.720
resembling terrorism and that
he wasn't in any touch with

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.110
his father.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:46.660
A few days after he turned 16,
he sneaks into his mother's

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.670
bedroom one morning and steals
$40 from her purse, the

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.750
equivalent of $40
in Yemeni rials.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:54.250
And then he climbs out the
window of the kitchen and goes

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:56.580
to the bus station in Bab al
Yemen, in the old city in

00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.630
Sana'a, and takes a bus
to Shabwah, where he

00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.810
thinks his father is.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:03.100
And his idea is to try to ask
around and see if anyone can

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.110
find him because he wants
to speak to his father.

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:06.140
He wants to see his father.

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.030
And he felt like turning 16 was
a moment where he was a

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:10.630
man and could go and do this.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.170
And he had a very different
recollection of who his dad

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:16.230
was and sees reports of his
father being compared to Osama

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.600
bin Laden and is this
great terrorist.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.410
And so the kid runs away
to look for his dad.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.250
And while he's in Shabwah,
looking for his father, his

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.650
father is killed hundreds
of miles away in

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.850
the north of Yemen.

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:29.790
And so the grandparents call
him, who are effectively his

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.960
parents at this point, and they
said, Abdulrahman, you

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.650
have to come home.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.000
Your father's dead.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.060
And at the time, there was
a revolution in Yemen.

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.740
And there was fighting in that
part of the country.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.850
And the roads were blocked.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:39.640
And he had to stay.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.860
He couldn't go back.

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.190
So he had to stay for
a couple of weeks.

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:50.440
And so on October 14, 2011, he's
out at dinner with his

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:53.000
cousin Ahmed, who is 17, and a
bunch of other young people

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.040
from the tribe.

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.270
And a drone appears above them
and launches a missile and

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.600
blows them up, killing
this kid and a

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.170
group of other teenagers.

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:07.280
And you had three US citizens
that were killed in a two week

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.820
period in these operations
authorized by the President.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:14.550
The killing of Anwar Al-Aulaqi,
I think, was a

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:15.520
turning point.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.040
But I understand why the
US wanted to kill him.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.480
And his family understands why
the US wanted to kill him.

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.070
And there was nothing but
praise from Washington,

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.490
Democrats and Republicans
alike, for

00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:25.770
killing Anwar Al-Aulaqi.

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:28.510
And almost no one seemed
concerned about the fact that

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.880
we had just killed a US citizen
who had never been

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.160
charged with a crime, who the
United States had never sought

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.460
to extradite, never presented
any public evidence against

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.930
him, killed him without
any trial.

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:41.850
And he was not on a battlefield

00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:43.180
shooting at US soldiers.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.910
To me, it was a significant
moment in our history.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:46.230
We can debate what we
think about that

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:47.700
strategically or legally.

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.930
But I believe it was
significant, particularly

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:52.490
because a popular constitutional
law professor,

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.420
Nobel Peace Prize winning
president was the one that

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.510
authorized it.

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.110
But then the two weeks later,
the killing of this kid, the

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:01.585
White House has never explained
why Abdulrahman

00:40:01.585 --> 00:40:03.320
Al-Aulaqi was killed.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.140
I've spent months and months of
my life working on trying

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.920
to get an answer.

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:11.790
At one point, a US military
official leaked to the press

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.740
that he was actually
21 years old.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:15.320
Well, then we went and got his
birth certificate from the

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.100
state of Colorado.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:18.940
He had just turned 16, as
the family alleged.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.040
Then they said, well, he was
at an al-Qaeda meeting.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:24.090
And yet, they couldn't produce
a single name of someone from

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:26.310
al-Qaeda that they killed
at this meeting.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:27.590
And then they said, well, he
was meeting with this guy,

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:30.190
Ibrahim al-Bana, who was a
propagandist for al-Qaeda in

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:31.650
the Arabian Peninsula.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:34.350
And then it turns out Ibrahim
al-Bana is still alive and

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:35.130
wasn't there.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.360
So why was this kid killed?

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.410
I recently met a former senior
official of the Obama

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:44.380
administration who told me that
when President Obama had

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.670
been briefed on that strike, the
one that killed this kid,

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.410
that he had been told by the CIA
and military intelligence

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:53.510
that Ibrahim al-Bana
was there alone.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.460
And no one mentioned
anything about the

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:57.330
Al-Aulaqi kid being there.

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:59.910
And this former official told me
that Brennan, John Brennan,

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.060
who at the time was the senior
counter-terrorism adviser and

00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.330
is now the CIA director, that
Brennan believed that it was

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:08.370
an intentional hit on the kid
and ordered a review.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:10.990
And that review, I tried to
inquire with the White House

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.830
and the National Security
Council, to my knowledge has

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.730
never been published.

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.790
So the official that told me all
of this said to me, look,

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:19.450
I assure you.

00:41:19.450 --> 00:41:20.600
This was just a mistake.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:21.440
It's just a mistake.

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.500
It was collateral damage.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.520
And I said, well, if you have
evidence to that effect and

00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.210
that's true, why not
just say it?

00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:28.730
Because it really does seem
like an impossible

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:29.840
coincidence.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.620
And I say at one point in our
film, it's like a tale from

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:32.135
Greek mythology.

00:41:32.135 --> 00:41:34.630
You kill the father
and then the son.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:37.320
And at the end of the day, we
don't know why he was killed.

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:40.320
But I asked this official, why
don't you just say, if it's

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.650
collateral damage, that
that's what it was?

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:43.390
And if you did kill someone that
you think was plotting

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.390
against the United States, then
say it so that at least

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:47.370
that family knows.

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:50.140
And I think also the American
people have a right to know.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.290
This is serious business when
you're drone striking American

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:56.000
teenagers that have never been
charged with anything.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.130
And if it's just because his
last name is Al-Aulaqi, then

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:00.070
that's just stunning.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:01.070
So he's assuring me all this.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:02.050
And he said, well, look.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:03.350
Look at it this way--

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.280
this is a former senior
White House official--

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:07.730
we had just killed three US
citizens in a two week period,

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.430
two of whom weren't
even targets.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:10.490
It didn't look good.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:11.520
It was embarrassing.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.290
That was his answer.

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:13.560
It was embarrassing.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.730
I mean, that to me, is just
sort of shocking.

00:42:15.730 --> 00:42:18.160
When Robert Gibbs, who's the
former White House press

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.880
secretary, was asked during the
2012 election campaign,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.920
when he was serving as a senior
surrogate for President

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.980
Obama, he was his major
spokesperson.

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:29.020
He was asked by this young
reporter named Sierra Adamson

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.210
about the killing of Abdulrahman
Al-Aulaqi.

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.200
And you know what Gibbs said?

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.070
He said, he should have had
a more responsible father.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.180
There are few things in history
more shameful than

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:41.360
blaming the death of a child
on who their parents were.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:42.160
And you can go and see that.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:43.250
It's on YouTube.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:45.190
And it's gone all around.

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:47.280
He should be ashamed of himself
for saying that.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.610
Harry Reid, the Senate Majority
Leader, was on CNN

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.060
after that killing and was asked
about the killings of

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.250
Anwar Al-Aulaqi, Samir Khan,
and Abdulrahman Al-Aulaqi.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:59.840
And Harry Reid said to Candy
Crowley, I do know this.

00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.920
If there were three Americans
that deserved to be killed, it

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:02.960
was those three.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.840
And I tried to get Harry Reid's
office to comment.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.950
I said, are you really saying
that this 16-year-old kid

00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:07.890
needed to be killed?

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.220
What evidence do you have he
was involved with anything

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.920
threatening the United States?

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.700
And they wouldn't answer.

00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.210
And then I went after
them on Twitter.

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:15.310
And then they blocked me.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.060
And there was no--

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:21.700
it was a badge of pride that I
was blocked by Harry Reid.

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:27.770
So it's mystifying to me that we
don't have an answer on who

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:29.030
killed this kid.

00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:33.180
And I think that we're going to
look back on this moment in

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.770
time and realize that a lot of
us were asleep at the wheel

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.330
and weren't really being
responsible citizens because

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:42.180
we just kind of trusted that
Obama was going to do the

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:42.950
right thing.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:47.580
And I imagine Darth Vader Cheney
fly fishing somewhere

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:50.340
and kind of having a good
chuckle about this and saying,

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:54.070
it's a good thing that Obama
cleaned this up for every one.

00:43:54.070 --> 00:43:56.750
Because now these policies can
continue when Rubio or Jeb

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:59.520
Bush or whoever is going to
come back into power.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:03.490
And I think that a big part of
our problem as a society is

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:08.810
that we don't see people in
Yemen or Pakistan or Somalia

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:14.300
as human beings whose stories
are worthy of being told or

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.810
demanding our attention.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:19.970
And I think if we had empathy,
if we saw them as equals and

00:44:19.970 --> 00:44:22.480
that our lives are not worth
more than them, I think it

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.390
would be a lot harder to have
these policies continue.

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:26.500
I think we'd have
a more rigorous

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:27.750
debate in our society.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:34.880
I watched the Boston Marathon
bombing aftermath just with my

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:37.370
jaw on the floor at how terrible
the media coverage

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:40.620
was and the smearing and tarring
of the reputation of

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.740
that young high school track kid
who Rupert Murdoch put his

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.640
picture on the "New York Post"
and said, Bag man, these are

00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:48.100
who the Feds are looking for.

00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:51.950
And this high school track
runner, it's shocking that he

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.890
actually went to the marathon
because he liked to run and

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:56.000
wanted to watch the marathon.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.520
And somehow, because he had
brown skin, he becomes a

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:02.380
suspect in this in the eyes of
one of the most powerful media

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:03.800
moguls in history.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.380
And there's so much
misinformation.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.310
And there's just this rush
to judgment always.

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:10.630
When Oklahoma City was bombed,
the first thing was, it's got

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.290
to be Islamic radicals
that did this.

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:14.220
And the hysteria around
this also.

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.980
And I don't know the motivations
of the people that

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:17.030
did this bombing.

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:21.730
I mean, the story of the
Tsarnaev guys, I want to see

00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:22.550
it all play out in court.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:23.350
I want to know the evidence.

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:25.690
And I want whoever did this
to be brought to justice,

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:26.830
whatever their motivation was.

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:28.740
But I also want to understand
why they did it because I

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.660
think that's important.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.310
But there was a part of the
media coverage that was

00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:34.100
remarkable.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:38.170
And that is the stories of the
heroes that responded to the

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:41.680
bombing, like this guy Carlos
Arredondo, who ran toward the

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:42.970
blast after it happened.

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:46.180
And his son had been killed
in Iraq as a soldier.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.530
And Carlos Arredondo,
I know him.

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:52.510
He's a brilliant guy and a brave
man and a noble citizen.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.730
And he runs toward the blast.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:56.260
And there's that iconic
picture of him.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.200
I'm sure all of you have
seen it where he has

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.410
the cowboy hat on.

00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:02.120
And he's running the
double amputee--

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.800
a guy, both of his legs
are blown off.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.130
And he's trying to
save his life.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:07.920
And he's tying his leg to try
to stop the bleeding.

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.800
And watching Carlos Arredondo
talk about this and also

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.160
knowing that he has lost so
much in his own life, it's

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.830
just this remarkable human story
that I think all of us

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:19.320
can relate to and say, that's
an amazing person.

00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.370
And then we had the story of the
kid, the 8-year old kid,

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:24.110
and that beautiful painting
that he did that

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:25.430
went viral on Facebook.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:28.750
And we know his story and
what is dreams were.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:33.530
And the Chinese graduate
student, I was with a friend

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:37.040
from China recently when I was
giving a talk in Boston.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.410
And it was right after the
Boston Marathon bombing.

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:43.530
And this friend from China said,
you know, when President

00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.530
Obama said her name, the name of
this Chinese woman who was

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:50.160
a graduate student in the US,
there was a blog post that

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.030
went viral in China.

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:55.720
And the title of it was "Where
You Die Matters."

00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:00.510
And the point of it was that if
she had died in a factory

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:05.330
explosion making iPhones for
Americans, her name wouldn't

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:06.210
have been mentioned by the most

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:07.820
powerful man on the planet.

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:11.370
But because she died in Boston,
her life mattered.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:16.650
And that struck me as sort of
profound because if you think

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:20.400
about the reason why we have
the response to the school

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:21.320
shootings--

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:26.150
and I was devastated when the
"New York Times" put the list

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:27.830
of all of the kids killed
at Newtown.

00:47:27.830 --> 00:47:30.410
And you just saw five
years old, six years

00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:31.450
old, six years old.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:35.570
I mean, you can't not cry when
you actually internalize it

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:38.130
because you think, what
if that was my child?

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:42.530
And in thinking about it, I've
spent so much time in

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:44.380
Afghanistan and Somalia
and Yemen.

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:47.840
And I have these faces of kids
that I've met there.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:49.390
And their parents
were blown up.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:53.570
Or some of them have been maimed
in a missile strike.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.460
Or they're orphaned.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:57.960
Or I've met women whose entire
families have been killed.

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:01.500
And I wonder, what if we
knew their stories?

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:05.140
What if we knew that little
girl who was killed in a

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.170
bombing in December of '09 in
a US cruise missile strike?

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:10.380
What if we saw the picture that
she had painted or knew

00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.520
the dream that she had?

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.270
Well, then it doesn't become
collateral damage in a strike

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:15.650
aimed at killing dangerous
terrorists.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.600
Then it becomes real people
that we relate to.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.050
The reason why these school
shootings strike us so hard is

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:26.520
that we feel it as though
it's our own people.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.600
But we should extend that right
also to the people that

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.660
live on the other side of the
missiles that are being

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:33.450
launched from our country.

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:37.090
The last thing I'll say is last
night I did an event at

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:38.510
the Commonwealth Club
in San Francisco.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:42.540
And they always ask at the end
of it for a 60 second idea to

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.360
change the world.

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:45.520
And I had forgotten that I was
supposed to come up with

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:46.380
something ahead of time.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.630
And I had forgotten.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.370
But what I ended up saying
was, I don't know that it

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:52.200
would change the world.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:55.440
But I think it would be an
important exercise for all of

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:55.970
us to engage.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.180
And then I realize that part
of why I do this is because

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.110
I've long been engaged with
this, and it really has

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:03.200
changed the way I see the world,
is if we all adopt the

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.660
story of someone who has either
lost their lives or

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.890
lost something deep as a result
of our wars and to know

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:11.360
their story.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.450
So that when we're talking about
it and we say we defend

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:17.160
the drone strikes, that we also
can talk fluently about a

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.030
case where it went wrong or
about a case where the death

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:22.560
of someone could potentially
come back to inspire new

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.600
enemies to want to attack us.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:25.350
Because if we have empathy--

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:28.450
only through empathy can you
actually care about someone

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:30.330
enough to stand up and say,
I'm not going to let that

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:30.970
happen to them.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:32.690
Or I don't want that
to happen anymore.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.230
It's why so many Americans now
are paying attention to the

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:38.560
gun debate is because we don't
want this to happen ever again

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.750
in our schools.

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:44.010
And so I think our challenge
really is all of us are busy.

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:45.800
And a lot of people in this
country are struggling.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:49.500
And it's a hard ask to say to
a single mother in Tennessee

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.210
who's struggling to put food
on the table for her kids,

00:49:52.210 --> 00:49:54.490
care about what goes
on in Yemen.

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:55.380
People are struggling here.

00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:55.970
And I know that.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.260
But I think that for those of
us that have the luxury of

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:01.980
some free time in our life, that
the least we could do is

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:04.220
to actually personalize
these wars.

00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:06.430
It shouldn't just be families
with loved ones in the

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:08.300
military that have to pay
attention to what's happening

00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.230
in Afghanistan.

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:10.640
We're paying for it.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.490
We're paying for
it financially.

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.280
And we're paying
for it morally.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:19.060
And I think that if we ignore
the potential impact of these

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.330
policies, we do it
at our own peril.

00:50:21.330 --> 00:50:25.190
I have much more faith in my
fellow country people than I

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:28.120
do in the jokers on
Capitol Hill.

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.340
And I think that if we start a
hearts and minds campaign in

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.430
our own country, to actually
realize who's being killed and

00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:36.020
who's not being killed,
who are we

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:37.330
actually targeting here?

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:39.570
Are we safer or less safe
because of the drone strikes

00:50:39.570 --> 00:50:41.350
policy and the signature
strike policy?

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:44.910
What would an actual national
security policy look like?

00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:46.700
This should be all
of our business.

00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:47.900
And with that, I thank
you for your time.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:48.750
I'm happy to answer any

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:49.940
questions or hear any comments.

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.960
It's really an honor
to be with you.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:51.970
And thank you.

00:50:51.970 --> 00:51:03.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:06.170
AUDIENCE: Hi, I want to thank
you for so many thought

00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:09.660
provoking observations
and ideas.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.710
One idea that I would like to
ask you to answer maybe a

00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:14.430
little bit more.

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:16.580
And I say this because I'm
conflicted about it.

00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:17.600
I don't know the answer.

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:21.660
You clearly thought about
a lot more than I have.

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.380
Why does it matter or does it
matter that Al-Aulaqi, the

00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:28.630
father, was a citizen
of America?

00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:31.260
Does that make it worse that
we assassinated him?

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.310
Because your empathy argument
suggests that actually it

00:51:34.310 --> 00:51:34.850
doesn't matter.

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:37.430
We shouldn't have assassinated
anybody.

00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:38.590
JEREMY SCAHILL: I'm glad
that you asked that.

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:40.190
And I often do try to
make the point.

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:43.040
I mean, on a moral level,
there should not be any

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:46.560
difference between how we view
the rights of citizens and

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.830
non-citizens to not be killed
in a drone strike,

00:51:48.830 --> 00:51:51.820
particularly if they haven't had
any actual charges against

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.780
them or there isn't evidence
to prove that they are

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:57.760
involved with the plots
that we say they are.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.260
The reason why I raise the
Al-Aulaqi issue is that I

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:04.210
think there's another dimension
to this that cuts to

00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:06.480
the heart of who we
are as a society.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:09.500
And how we treat the most
reprehensible of our citizens,

00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.770
I think, speaks volumes
to who--

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:13.330
I'm more concerned with who we
are than who Al-Aulaqi was.

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:18.980
And if in some cases, like
with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:21.400
Boston, the Republicans said,
we want him treated as an

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:22.340
enemy combatant.

00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.690
And some said, we want him
shipped to Guantanamo.

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:28.370
And in defending the Al-Aulaqi
thing, they say, well, he

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:30.750
didn't have actual rights
to due process

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:32.480
because he was a terrorist.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.470
And that's the line on it.

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:40.030
To me, if we're going to allow
the mob to grab the pitchforks

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:43.200
and torches and go and deliver
citizens justice in certain

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.800
cases, then we should stop
saying that we're a nation

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:47.330
based on the rule of law and
that there are certain

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.570
circumstances where the
mob is allowed to

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:50.910
sort of enforce justice.

00:52:50.910 --> 00:52:53.050
And we don't actually need
to abide by our own laws.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:57.640
And I think that if you allow
that line to be crossed and

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:01.180
this happens to our own
citizens, then I think that

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.490
there is a serious
constitutional crisis.

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:06.830
I, unfortunately, agreed with
Rand Paul, I wish there was a

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:08.850
more credible person that had
done this in the Senate, when

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:11.180
he was raising some legitimate
questions.

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:12.980
There was also a lot of
craziness that day when he did

00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:13.530
the filibuster.

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:14.920
But he raised some legitimate
questions.

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.590
But on a moral level, I don't
think there's any difference

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:19.440
whatsoever between doing this
to an American or a

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.120
non-American.

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:20.735
You have a response.

00:53:20.735 --> 00:53:21.360
Yes?

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.370
AUDIENCE: Well, it's not a
response so much but just to

00:53:23.370 --> 00:53:24.740
make sure I understand things
a little bit better.

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.220
So you're saying, specifically
in this case, you want to see

00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.490
us following our own laws.

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:32.390
And that is an important
aspect of the argument.

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:33.160
JEREMY SCAHILL: Yeah,
I think--

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:33.880
AUDIENCE: Other than
the fact that he

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:34.730
was an American citizen.

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:35.700
JEREMY SCAHILL: Oh
yeah, right.

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.290
I mean, this is a bigger
picture idea.

00:53:38.290 --> 00:53:41.930
But I think that we should
demilitarize our response to

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:46.710
terrorism and view it as a crime
and view terror plots as

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:48.100
crimes not acts of war.

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.800
I mean, I think that we have a
robust justice system in this

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:56.230
country that has been the only
vehicle for actually bringing

00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:58.360
people to justice is when
they're tried in

00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.110
the civilian system.

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:01.760
Guantanamo has been a
catastrophic disaster.

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.610
I believe that our society would
be stronger if Anwar

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:10.280
Al-Aulaqi had been charged
and indicted and

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.500
his extradition demanded.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.150
And if we can't get him after
having done all of that, then

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.190
the US has all sorts of options,
some of which would

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:17.570
be military in nature.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:20.660
But to just skip right to the
death penalty before even

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:24.700
indicting someone, I think
that's something we have to be

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:26.440
really nervous about
in our society.

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.750
I think it would have been
much wiser for the US to

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:33.710
charge Anwar Al-Aulaqi.

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:36.310
And I think he potentially could
have been put on trial.

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:38.370
I think that there would have
been an incentive for people

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:39.430
to give him up.

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:41.940
And others might debate that.

00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:42.980
But I know that tribe well.

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.220
They would have given them up,
I believe, if the US put

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:47.620
pressure on them or figured
out a way to make it worth

00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.040
their while.

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.030
Yeah, go ahead.

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:53.080
AUDIENCE: So it seems like a
large part of your argument is

00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.380
a pragmatic one that we're
creating more terrorists by

00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.550
killing, accidentally or
negligently, some civilians.

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:03.480
And I was wondering if you
could talk about how that

00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.010
played out when the US was
involved militarily in Central

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:11.650
and South America in the
'70s, '80s, and so on.

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:12.490
JEREMY SCAHILL: Could
you rephrase it?

00:55:12.490 --> 00:55:13.885
So you're asking the--

00:55:13.885 --> 00:55:16.890
AUDIENCE: I'm asking about
the blowback that the CIA

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:22.520
involvement in Central and South
America had and how that

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:24.800
changes your opinion about the
blowback that we might

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.550
experience as a result
of drone strikes.

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:33.280
JEREMY SCAHILL: I think the
legacy of what the US did in

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.000
the '70s, '80s in Central
America is still

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:36.690
felt to this day.

00:55:36.690 --> 00:55:41.160
Right now there's the trial of
Rios Montt in Guatemala.

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.960
And the US was supporting
these murderous juntas.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.100
And the people have spent
decades trying to get justice

00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:51.020
for what had been lost in the
contra death squads in

00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.330
Nicaragua and Battalion
316 in Honduras.

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:58.110
I think it really sparked a lot
of anti-American hatred.

00:55:58.110 --> 00:56:02.470
Whether or not there was
specific blowback from that, I

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:04.810
don't know in terms of Americans
being attacked

00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:06.650
inside of the United States.

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:11.090
I also think that there was a
different mentality in those

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:13.340
countries then there is in a lot
of Muslim countries around

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.150
the world in terms of
the way that the

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:17.980
wars are being fueled.

00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:21.400
The US in Central America
was primarily

00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.560
working with proxies.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.720
And with the exception of the
mining of the Nicaraguan

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:29.860
harbor, where the US had a
guilty verdict against it at

00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:34.690
the World Court for having done
that, the US tried to use

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:37.430
proxy forces and more
covert presence.

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:41.070
I think the drones are a great
recruiting tool for al-Qaeda

00:56:41.070 --> 00:56:43.660
or other militant organizations
because it's

00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:44.790
very good branding.

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:49.560
And so I do fear that we are
giving the perception that

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.350
we're at war with Islam.

00:56:51.350 --> 00:56:53.670
And I think that that is really

00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:56.160
just very, very dangerous.

00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.670
Thank you.

00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:58.880
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jeremy.

00:56:58.880 --> 00:56:59.540
Thank you for coming.

00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:02.170
A very quick technical question,
when you mentioned

00:57:02.170 --> 00:57:06.200
Aminah was a covert from the
Catholic to Islam, where did

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.510
you get that information?

00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:09.150
JEREMY SCAHILL: I read
Serbo-Croatian.

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:10.690
Actually, I can speak
Serbo-Croatian.

00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:15.310
And there was extensive coverage
in the Croatian media

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:19.510
about who she is and very, very,
very technical details

00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:24.400
about her life and her work and
her conversion to Islam.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.000
AUDIENCE: I read too.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.876
So maybe you can tell me later
on which publication that was.

00:57:27.876 --> 00:57:28.220
Thanks.

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.560
JEREMY SCAHILL: Yeah, yeah,
there were a number of exposes

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.230
about her in the local
press in Croatia.

00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:34.395
And in Serbia, there were some
reporting on it as well.

00:57:34.395 --> 00:57:34.740
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:36.260
JEREMY SCAHILL: Yeah, thanks.

00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:37.320
AUDIENCE: I have
two questions.

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.270
You answered half of the first
one was you consider the

00:57:40.270 --> 00:57:40.910
alternatives.

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:42.680
And the alternatives you
suggested were to bring him

00:57:42.680 --> 00:57:45.490
here to face our civil
justice system.

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:48.500
But there may be something else
because that seems to me

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:52.360
like a very steep battle to
fight or disadvantageous

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:56.580
battle to fight when you've got
some compelling evidence

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:58.510
to bring against them.

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:02.910
And the second one is, as I
travel through Middle East,

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:05.200
what I see is America
gets the blame and

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.560
this unjustified blame.

00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:11.250
Really what happens is they see
the United States as an

00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:12.960
oppressor when it's really their
own government that's an

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:17.980
oppressor because the foreign
aid that gets there is

00:58:17.980 --> 00:58:19.630
somewhat diffused.

00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:21.750
It's siphoned off by
the people that

00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:23.760
are powers that be.

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:28.270
And there doesn't seem to be any
correction for that type

00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:29.260
of activity.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.680
And that's essentially
what's spawning--

00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:34.820
in my opinion, that's
what spawns this

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:37.180
anti-American sentiment.

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:37.950
JEREMY SCAHILL: I
agree with you.

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:42.900
I mean, I don't necessarily
agree with saying that that's

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:45.250
the actual thing and that it
has nothing to do with the

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:46.100
US's actions.

00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:51.660
But I agree strongly with your
sentiment that these regimes--

00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:55.470
the overthrow of Mubarak in
Egypt, for instance, he was a

00:58:55.470 --> 00:59:00.420
widely despised man for what he
had done to his own people.

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:03.820
But people are also aware that
he stayed in power in part

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:06.350
because of his tremendous
support from the United States

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:07.980
through successive
administrations.

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.660
And we've given a lot of
military aid to the

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:15.460
Jordanians, to the Egyptians, at
times we worked with Bashar

00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:19.580
al-Assad in Syria when it was
convenient for us, the Saudis,

00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:20.390
the Yemenis.

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.880
And I think that it's
a double punch.

00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:25.710
I think people perceive the
United States as being on the

00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:27.960
side of these dictatorships
and not on the side of

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.200
ordinary people.

00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:31.200
I've certainly heard that in the
countries that I've been

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.110
talking about today.

00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:36.595
But I do think though that the
US has a long, or I know that

00:59:36.595 --> 00:59:39.330
the US has a long track record
of bolstering these

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.970
dictatorships, the Bahraini
regime, the Saudis.

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:44.530
I mean, we are a big part
of that problem.

00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:48.480
But I do think that those
regimes deserve their fair

00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.910
share of the blame for what
they've been involved with.

00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:55.620
AUDIENCE: One last thing, US
presence in the Gulf in the

00:59:55.620 --> 01:00:00.840
Middle East during the Iran-Iraq
War was a huge

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.020
stabilizing factor
in the region.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:07.740
And as you start to withdraw,
there's all sorts of upheaval

01:00:07.740 --> 01:00:08.710
going on over there.

01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:12.840
So there seems to be
consequences no matter going

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.770
forward or going in reverse.

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:16.990
There appear to be consequences
either way.

01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:18.920
JEREMY SCAHILL: Well, I
have a little bit--

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.270
you and I could have
a debate club here.

01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:21.670
I have a little bit of a
different take on the

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:23.130
Iran-Iraq thing.

01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:25.175
Kissinger famously said, we
should arm them both so they

01:00:25.175 --> 01:00:27.070
can kill each other off.

01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:29.160
I think we were a highly
destabilizing presence,

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.970
particularly in Iraq.

01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:34.620
The US was supporting Saddam
Hussein in the '80s when he

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.200
was at his most brutal.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.880
And Donald Rumsfeld went over
as an envoy in '83 and gave

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.130
Saddam golden cowboy spurs,
a gift from Ronald Reagan.

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:46.070
And they removed the Iraqi
government from the list of

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.640
state sponsors of terrorism so
that they could sell them

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.390
weapons that were then used to
use chemical weapons on the

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:53.670
Kurdish population in
the north of Iraq.

01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:58.240
And I think that you can jump in
to history midway and then

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.695
say, well, the US
was stabilizing.

01:00:59.695 --> 01:01:02.320
And the US was a big part of
creating that or making that

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:05.570
war possible, the
Iran-Iraq War.

01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:09.060
AUDIENCE: I sort of agree with
you to a degree on that.

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.410
JEREMY SCAHILL: Yeah, but your
broader point though about the

01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:13.400
withdrawal, look, in
Afghanistan, I think there are

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.390
pockets of Afghanistan where
people are grateful that the

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:18.620
United States went in
and got rid of the

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:19.690
thugs from the Taliban.

01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:20.940
And girls can go to school.

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.940
And women are not living
in constant

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.180
fear of being attacked.

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:27.270
But then there are large parts
of Afghanistan where the

01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:28.930
Taliban are still in control.

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:32.310
And there's the added hostility
of US night raids or

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:33.320
strikes that are happening.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.610
And they're sort of getting
punched from both sides.

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:38.130
So I do think that when there's
a withdrawal from

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.850
Afghanistan, there will
be a mixed bag.

01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:43.330
But at the end of day, I think
we have to look back and say,

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:45.220
what was the point
of any of this?

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:48.170
I don't know anyone in the
military today, guys that are

01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.410
being tasked with fighting the
war, that think that it's a

01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:51.750
good idea to be there.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.540
I mean, most Americans supported
us going into

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.080
Afghanistan early
on after 9/11.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.190
At this point, I think the
majority of Americans are sort

01:01:58.190 --> 01:02:00.330
of like, what's the
point of this now?

01:02:00.330 --> 01:02:02.490
Who are we fighting anymore?

01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:04.060
AUDIENCE: I'll try
to make it brief.

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.120
First, thank you very much for
the fantastic reporting and

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.540
all this incredibly dangerous,
hard work you do.

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:13.120
And sort of related to that,
especially as you've done what

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.450
could be termed kind of exposes
or what would normally

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:19.190
be called just good
investigative journalism, you

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:22.670
talk about Blackwater and all
these people and the US

01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:24.320
government and the drone strikes
and things where

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.910
people tend to, I think, believe
they operate sort of

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.410
above the law.

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:31.670
How much do you actually fear
for your personal safety,

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:33.980
aside from the people that are
dangerous that you normally--

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:34.790
JEREMY SCAHILL: Did
Jay Leno put you

01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:35.930
up to this or something?

01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:37.620
AUDIENCE: No, I don't
listen to Jay Leno.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:38.056
JEREMY SCAHILL: No.

01:02:38.056 --> 01:02:38.930
I'm just kidding.

01:02:38.930 --> 01:02:41.510
No, he just asked me the same
question on a TV show once.

01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.630
AUDIENCE: Oh, really?

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:42.200
JEREMY SCAHILL: And
it was weird.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.190
AUDIENCE: Now I feel bad.

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:45.030
JEREMY SCAHILL: And it scared
my mom to death.

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:48.280
Why does Jay Leno think
someone's going to kill you?

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.540
I always get embarrassed when
people ask me that.

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.140
And I appreciate your
kind words.

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:56.100
But I was talking to a colleague
earlier today--

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.200
I mean, there are journalists
that are missing in Syria.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.580
This young guy who was
a former Marine

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.150
named Austin Tice.

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:03.710
He's been missing in Syria
for over a year.

01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:07.420
We believe that he's being held
by the Assad government.

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.350
He was a reporter for McClatchy
News Service.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:11.190
Record numbers of journalists
are being-- one of the most

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:14.950
dangerous places on Earth to
be a journalist is Mexico.

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:17.690
Mexican journalists that report
on the drug cartels are

01:03:17.690 --> 01:03:20.520
just being bumped off and
assassinated left and right.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.050
Journalists in Somalia are
being murdered by various

01:03:23.050 --> 01:03:25.690
sides of the fighting
factions there.

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:30.000
And I always get embarrassed
because I live in a nice

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.110
neighborhood in Brooklyn,
New York.

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:35.690
I live in Park Slope, the land
of lattes and baby strollers

01:03:35.690 --> 01:03:37.320
and double wide baby
strollers.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.170
And I get to come back.

01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:40.000
And that's where I am.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.190
And I know that I'm
safe there.

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:46.310
And so many of our colleagues
that are in these places, they

01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:47.740
live in a constant
state of danger.

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:51.220
And I always try to recognize
their sacrifice because I

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.210
think they are the actual
heroes of all this.

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:56.640
It's why my book is dedicated
to journalists locked up for

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.140
doing their job or who died
in pursuit of the truth.

01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.300
Because a lot of times
people like me--

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.440
I go on MSNBC.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:02.910
And I talk.

01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:03.800
And people know my name.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.540
And I have a book on the New
York Times Best Seller list.

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:08.680
And it's like, what about
Abdulelah Haider Shaye, this

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:11.010
journalist who's in prison
in Yemen in part because

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:13.240
President Obama told the Yemeni
government he wants him

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.440
locked up for having exposed
a US missile attack?

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.390
I'm no Braveheart.

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.690
My colleagues in Yemen,
Somalia, Syria, Libya,

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:24.880
everywhere else, those
are the real heroes.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:26.920
And we don't know their name
because they're not reporting

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.940
in English necessarily.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:29.730
Or they're behind the scenes.

01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:32.820
If I see Thomas Friedman quote
one more time his taxi

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:34.760
drivers, his concierge, I'm
going to go and shave his

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.880
mustache myself.

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.840
I'm so tired of the sort of
pontificating there because

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.540
there are real journalists
that do serious work.

01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.950
And they get almost
no credit for it.

01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:44.920
AUDIENCE: No doubt.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.780
JEREMY SCAHILL: But thank you
very much for the compliment.

01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:47.603
I appreciate it.

01:04:47.603 --> 01:04:49.495
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:04:49.495 --> 01:04:51.480
FEMALE SPEAKER: Jeremy, I just
want to say thank you so much.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.110
Everybody, if you could give a
round of applause for Jeremy.

01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:53.710
JEREMY SCAHILL: Thank you.

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:54.310
[APPLAUSE]

01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:54.910
JEREMY SCAHILL: Thank you all.

01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:55.810
Thank you for the
people watching.

01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:58.932
[APPLAUSE]
