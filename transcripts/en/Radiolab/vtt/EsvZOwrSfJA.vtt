00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.200
Hello, this is Lynn. Someone on the other side of this. Hey,

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.820
so a couple months ago, our producer Lynn Levy,

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.420
did an interview with this woman. Yeah. Her name is Margaret. Love it. Yes.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.870
And this was Margaret's first time doing a radio interview.

5
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.990
That magic voice. This is so fun,

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.790
but this was definitely not her first time talking into a microphone. One, two,

7
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:27.660
three, four. This is the yellow mine. Frank, two three, four.

8
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.830
This is the orange mind almost exactly 50 years ago.

9
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.150
The following recording was made on November,

10
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.420
1919 64 at 2100 hours.

11
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.900
Margaret was epicenter of this amazing, weird experiment.

12
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.530
Yeah. Who were you at that time? Like what were you like? Well, I,

13
00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:50.780
I've always had a bit of, if everybody's going left, I'll go right.

14
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.660
She tried college for a while, too, lane university for a year,

15
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.040
but she dropped out and I was 20 or 19 or something at that point and moved to

16
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.730
St Thomas in the Caribbean. Had never been turned Ireland.

17
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.240
Got a job at this hotel. Did Menus check people in and out?

18
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.660
And one day she hears about this strange research facility on the other side of

19
00:01:08.661 --> 00:01:10.880
the island. And I thought, I wonder what that is about.

20
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:12.680
And I asked a few people and they said, oh no, no,

21
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.160
they don't like people there can't go there. And I was told not to go there.

22
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:18.150
So I went there.

23
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.540
<v 1>Mm.</v>

24
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.320
<v 0>And that's how it all started. That's how we're going to start this show.</v>

25
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:30.380
I'm Jab. I'm Ron, I'm Robert Krulwich. Today on Radio Lab,

26
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.100
a producer Lynn Levy brings us a couple of close encounters.

27
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.380
Although not with aliens. No, it's not.

28
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.390
It's not in outer space because it's much closer to home in this case.

29
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.940
Although they are kind of alien, like yes, but alien life, uh, not

30
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.480
Lynn Dolphin shows about dolphins. Hey,

31
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.070
we're calling this our hello. So when Margaret got to this mysterious place,

32
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:54.950
there were dolphins there and uh, the,

33
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.010
what happened was she ended up becoming roommates with the Dolphin.

34
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.700
Do you mean in the like Bed-Stuy one bedroom apartment sense? Sort of. Yeah.

35
00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:04.480
She did end up living with a dolphin for,

36
00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:07.280
for many months in this apartment,

37
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.200
a big apartment party. Had a little desk,

38
00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:14.390
had a little kitchen area with a stove.

39
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.290
It was a little two burner stove or something and a pop, a kettle.

40
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.800
But the thing that's a little bit weird about the apartment is that the whole

41
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:25.480
apartment was filled with water, was completely filled.

42
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.950
Well I wasn't submerged, but I was in water up mid five,

43
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.560
sort of flooded with water just about there so she could share it with this

44
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:35.720
dolphin. A young male, Peter, Peter,

45
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.870
Peter was a 10 foot long bottlenose dolphin, young adolescent male.

46
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.680
And he lived there with Margaret and like he would, um, you know,

47
00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:47.890
he could like swim under the desk and uh, there was a balcony,

48
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.850
like swim out onto the balcony and balcony was flooded to the balcony was also

49
00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:54.190
flooded. Yeah, it's really cool. And what was the idea?

50
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:58.840
I mean to try and study the dolphin to study the dolphin, um, first of all,

51
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.460
and take a lot of notes, extensive

52
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.040
<v 2>notes. Did you have waterproof paper? No,</v>

53
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.220
I had a typewriter on this board hanging from the ceiling or they also had

54
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:11.560
microphones everywhere. And specifically the tasks she was given.

55
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.970
I was to teach Peter to speak English.

56
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.650
She was supposed to teach the dolphin English. Yup. Really? Well,

57
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.170
I mean this was John Lilly's project.

58
00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.230
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

59
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.340
<v 0>just for some context,</v>

60
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.400
you know how people get all like a little bit crazy these days about dolphins.

61
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.121
They have like, you know,

62
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:37.270
shirts with dolphins and necklaces with dolphins and everybody has like dolphin

63
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:39.250
hairbands, dolphin, black light posters, right.

64
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:43.630
So this all kind of sort of comes from this Guy John Lilly,

65
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.950
who was a scientist, a researcher starting in the forties

66
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.080
<v 3>total rights stuff, physics major kind of guy out of Caltech</v>

67
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.550
<v 0>man's man. According to Graham Burnett, I'm a historian of science.</v>

68
00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:59.270
But then according to Graham, John Lilly has this epiphany

69
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.070
<v 3>during the second world war.</v>

70
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.610
<v 2>At the time people just weren't thinking that much about dolphins in general.</v>

71
00:04:07.611 --> 00:04:10.970
Like there was not this idea that they were sort of extraordinary beings.

72
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.660
They were just like big dumb fish, you know, they were shot for sport.

73
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.540
So John Lilly is doing this, um,

74
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.630
research about brain mapping and he ends up working with dolphins and when the,

75
00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:28.211
the story that he's told goes that he was experimenting on these dolphins and as

76
00:04:29.631 --> 00:04:33.620
he's working with them, you know, kind of like shoving things into their brains.

77
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.230
They make noises as would anyone.

78
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.040
And when he listens back to the noises which he's recorded,

79
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.370
it sounds to him like the dolphins are trying to speak to him to say something

80
00:04:46.851 --> 00:04:50.510
to him in not in a non, in a dolphin e way,

81
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.370
but in a human way. Like trying to speak English to him. Really. Yeah.

82
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.800
What did he say the Dolphin was trying to say to him?

83
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.540
I don't think that we know that,

84
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.690
but it sounded to him enough like human speech that he,

85
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:08.030
he thought like something's going on here. This is important.

86
00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.350
According to Graham, he's said later that it made him realize like we're in

87
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.890
<v 3>not the only intelligent organisms out there,</v>

88
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.720
like we have company that maybe humans are what happens when high intelligence

89
00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:25.721
evolves in an animal that also has hands and dolphins are what happens when

90
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.720
comparably if not still more extravagant intelligence evolves in an animal

91
00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:33.374
without him.

92
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.800
<v 2>Oh, what do hands get you?</v>

93
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.450
<v 3>Well, our hands basically get you an appetite for uh,</v>

94
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.930
punching people in the head. You know,

95
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.180
it makes us tool users, but the distance between, uh, you know,

96
00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.200
the hammer that you use to uh,

97
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.060
knock open your coconut and the hammer that you use to knock open the head of

98
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:57.740
that other cro-magnon you were never that keen on is um, in fact, zilch.

99
00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:58.743
There's no difference at all.

100
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.950
<v 2>By the time we get to the 60s with, you know, like peace and love.</v>

101
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.970
<v 3>It was exciting to think that the dolphins and the whales have these huge</v>

102
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:10.790
brains, but they don't, like, they're not after anything.

103
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:13.220
They're not doing anything with it. They're not trying to hurt anybody.

104
00:06:13.221 --> 00:06:17.210
They're not building cities. They're just like being a man

105
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.290
<v 2>and keep in mind,</v>

106
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.160
this is on the verge of the Vietnam War where you have all this anxiety about

107
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.720
two, the air overpopulation, environmental destruction,

108
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.350
what have they done to our fair system?

109
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.530
So very quickly the dolphins become like this vision

110
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:40.600
<v 3>of how we might ourselves be so different than we'd come to feel we were</v>

111
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:43.280
tragically. Does that make sense?

112
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.540
<v 2>So John Louis was one of the first people to get swept up in all this.</v>

113
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.980
He quits his government job, moves to the Caribbean and sets up this lab.

114
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.940
John Lilly's communication research institute to try to talk to dolphins,

115
00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.990
which is where Margaret ended up. And my feeling was this or that.

116
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.970
Everybody was talking about how bright they were and how smart they were.

117
00:07:00.971 --> 00:07:04.270
And it was dolphins, dolphins, dolphins, and then it was, it was the hot topic.

118
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.340
And yet every day everybody at that building would get in their car and go home.

119
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.710
Yeah, on a foot. What is that? So she volunteered to stay. Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.040
Her bed was on this kind of wooden platform in the middle of the apartment.

121
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:20.410
I was maybe two and a half,

122
00:07:20.411 --> 00:07:25.411
three inches above the water and Peter was right there and Peter could flip me a

123
00:07:26.051 --> 00:07:29.590
little water and wake me up at any point. And that was the whole point of it.

124
00:07:29.591 --> 00:07:32.830
I mean this wasn't just sleep all night and then, excuse me,

125
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.070
work in the day and then sleep again all night and then do some work in the day.

126
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:39.840
I might as well go home. Yeah. So I eventually, um,

127
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.280
I didn't really shave my head but I buzzed it,

128
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.840
whatever it's called now really close because any,

129
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.970
you know the hair getting wet thing in the middle of the night was very

130
00:07:48.971 --> 00:07:53.110
annoying. Yeah, of course. I just got rid of her hair and that was helpful.

131
00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:56.440
And then when Peter would come and squirt some water or want to play or throw

132
00:07:56.441 --> 00:07:57.274
something at me,

133
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:00.520
then I could just roll off this elevator into the water and be with him and do

134
00:08:00.521 --> 00:08:04.210
whatever she says. He was fascinated by the things she brought with her.

135
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:09.310
A piece of cloth, a tea bag, tea bag was a fascinating thing.

136
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.240
I drank,

137
00:08:10.241 --> 00:08:15.241
I drink tea and the tea bag would fall into the water and he would come and get

138
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:19.810
it. And Sonar at, uh,

139
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.120
this creaking noise they make on their sonar.

140
00:08:22.121 --> 00:08:25.710
And you'd look at it and take the string over his beak,

141
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:29.080
sort of whim around very proudly with this teabag.

142
00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:32.440
And then he'd throw it up against the wall and it would stick.

143
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.850
And then he'd squirt water on it and it would come back down into the water and

144
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.030
he would play with this teabag. Eventually, of course, he would, would bite.

145
00:08:40.031 --> 00:08:42.400
It is very sharp teeth. Yeah. And it would break.

146
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.910
And that was a very exciting thing when the teabag finally broke open.

147
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.840
It had babies, as it were, zillions of tea leaves floating around.

148
00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:53.650
And he was so, not of them all in one count, every single one of them.

149
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.323
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

150
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.150
<v 2>and what did you think you would find out? I didn't know.</v>

151
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:03.470
You know,

152
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:08.470
I was not coming at this from a science point of view that that's not what I was

153
00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:13.430
bringing to the table. Yeah. I just, I just, I just, I had no idea. I,

154
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.810
I was, uh, programmed by, by John to work on the speech.

155
00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:24.660
[inaudible] I all he had sort of declared that they could probably speak

156
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:30.523
Aye.

157
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:34.843
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

158
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.420
<v 2>look when, when you're trying to have a conversation with someone</v>

159
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.933
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

160
00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.300
<v 2>when you do listen, uh,</v>

161
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:48.370
one person speaks and the other one listens and then you're speaking and I

162
00:09:48.741 --> 00:09:52.250
listen. And people sort of normally do that back and forth.

163
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.960
When you start with a dolphin making airborne sounds, once they get the idea,

164
00:09:56.961 --> 00:09:58.620
this alarm is, it goes

165
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.260
the very show. Offy and they want to override you.

166
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:18.710
So you have to spend a lot of time getting it down to I'm talking now. Right.

167
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:20.690
<v 5>Wow.</v>

168
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.650
<v 2>And now it's your turn.</v>

169
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.490
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

170
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.920
<v 2>now any other Fuze upset about something, he'll override</v>

171
00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.070
pater and it's annoying. Yeah. Listen again.

172
00:10:34.030 --> 00:10:34.630
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

173
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:39.010
<v 7>Hey, what's this? Come on Peter. One, two,</v>

174
00:10:39.011 --> 00:10:39.844
three.

175
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.410
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

176
00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.840
<v 7>no, start again. One, two, three.</v>

177
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.060
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

178
00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:56.000
<v 2>yes, but he learned very quickly to listen to me. One, two, three, four</v>

179
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:00.703
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

180
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.833
<v 7>woo.</v>

181
00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.730
<v 2>And not to pick up my instructions if I would say, no, no, no,</v>

182
00:11:08.731 --> 00:11:13.080
Peter, I don't want you to do that. I want you to do this, this,

183
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.250
this, Huh? He would give me back this, this,

184
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.030
this parrot will often say, no, no, no, probably want to crack her.

185
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.290
They will Pete, the whole thing of whatever you said. Huh.

186
00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.260
But Peter Wood would pick up what I wanted when he was being a good student and

187
00:11:29.261 --> 00:11:31.180
he was a good student. There seemed to be

188
00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.300
with this one dolphin anyway, can speak for all of them. An interest in,

189
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:42.250
in what we were doing. He wanted to practice, he wanted to get it right.

190
00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:48.040
He a, there was a mirror and he would spend long periods of time by himself.

191
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.870
Didn't want me to be part of it.

192
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:55.120
And he would practice whatever it was we had been in the lesson that day over

193
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:58.300
and over and over and over. He wanted to get it right.

194
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:02.963
Yeah.

195
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.060
And he, he would work at that for no reason. He's not getting fish.

196
00:12:12.061 --> 00:12:14.790
I'm not interacting with them and nothing. He just wants it. Right.

197
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.290
Like doing homework, like homework.

198
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.133
<v 5>Exactly.</v>

199
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:21.710
<v 2>And after a few months of this,</v>

200
00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.030
Peter did start to sound really different.

201
00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.400
<v 7>One two</v>

202
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.633
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

203
00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:32.670
<v 7>one, two, three.</v>

204
00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:35.580
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

205
00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:37.410
<v 7>yeah, they're [inaudible].</v>

206
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:44.640
<v 2>He kept getting better. It's an extremely difficult for them.</v>

207
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.510
<v 6>Oh,</v>

208
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.690
<v 2>they just have a blow hole. They,</v>

209
00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:53.300
they do have the apparatus to where the s's are almost impossible.

210
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.640
Uh, I would feed him my name and m is very hard.

211
00:12:58.641 --> 00:13:03.470
He would eventually roll over almost into the water with the blow hole to

212
00:13:03.471 --> 00:13:04.304
muffle.

213
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.953
<v 6>No</v>

214
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.880
<v 2>kind of a thing. Really. You're saying he would,</v>

215
00:13:10.881 --> 00:13:14.180
he would use the water as a way to help him make the sound. Yes.

216
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.430
I'll work with that word.

217
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.493
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

218
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:23.900
<v 2>and he knew that was your name.</v>

219
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.480
<v 5>I don't know.</v>

220
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.750
<v 2>But nevertheless, we were a pretty good match. He,</v>

221
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:37.340
I, I knew his mood, his temperament, and he, and he knew mine.

222
00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:41.150
He knew when I was sick and I would get sick and you're in the water all the

223
00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:45.500
time. You're bound to get a cold or something. He, he just loved my anatomy.

224
00:13:45.501 --> 00:13:47.750
He wanted to know what my knees were doing.

225
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:53.500
He would go behind my knee and sonar and look at it and feel it and push it and

226
00:13:53.871 --> 00:13:58.850
find out which way it wouldn't, wouldn't go. He just, and I gave him the time

227
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:06.230
cause I wasn't going home to look at my knee to look at my feet.

228
00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.700
He was enormously interested,

229
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.620
oddly enough in the space between my fingers.

230
00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:18.900
Really not the fingers so much, but he would, I mean, you know,

231
00:14:18.901 --> 00:14:20.400
his beat could just barely fit there,

232
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:25.401
but he wanted to put in between each finger and see what that was all about.

233
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:29.950
The same with the toes. He didn't have any spaces anywhere. He, you know,

234
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:34.050
he had solid flippers but no space in between them.

235
00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:37.830
Do you think he was so interested in your fingers and toes because he didn't

236
00:14:37.831 --> 00:14:39.450
have any? Yes, I do.

237
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.240
Margaret and Peter ended up spending about nine months living together,

238
00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:52.220
but towards the end things kind of started to, first

239
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.710
<v 9>of all, they weren't really results from this experiment.</v>

240
00:14:54.711 --> 00:14:59.060
They never were able to publish any scientific papers and there were other

241
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:03.380
problems. Lily got very involved in drugs, especially

242
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.450
<v 2>LSD. He did bring it down.</v>

243
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:10.130
He did a give LSD. He says he did.

244
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:13.970
I believe him to to, to have that arms. I would not let him give LSD to Peter.

245
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:15.620
I wouldn't allow that. Why would he give them,

246
00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:19.350
<v 9>well it's not a hundred percent clear,</v>

247
00:15:19.351 --> 00:15:24.090
but it seems like he was trying to find a way to get the dolphins to open up to

248
00:15:24.091 --> 00:15:24.924
connect,

249
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:29.190
maybe to talk in any case by 1965 66,

250
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.710
his funding had started to dry up. And when people heard about Margaret's work,

251
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.550
they tended to focus on like one particular part of the story.

252
00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:38.970
You don't have to answer,

253
00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:43.971
but a lot has been made of your uh ha sort of sexually engaging with Peter.

254
00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.590
And I just want to ask, cause you don't seem like a shrinking violet.

255
00:15:46.591 --> 00:15:48.930
I just want to ask, is there anything you want to say about that?

256
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.680
<v 2>Um, what would I like to say about that? I think</v>

257
00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:57.470
the sensational side of it is,

258
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:00.530
<v 9>here's what Margaret told me. Peter was a young dolphin,</v>

259
00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:05.480
he was horny and he would hump her leg a lot, kind of like a dog might do,

260
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:06.860
which was getting in the way of their work.

261
00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:10.820
So eventually I just said the heck with it. And she used her hand to,

262
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.251
<v 2>you know, and,</v>

263
00:16:12.251 --> 00:16:15.400
and it would quickly satisfy him and then we could go back to doing what we were

264
00:16:15.401 --> 00:16:19.030
doing. And I, I never really gave it another thought. I never thought, Oh,

265
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:22.720
don't let anybody know. I never thought, oh, this shouldn't be.

266
00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:25.440
<v 9>But because of details like this and the drugs,</v>

267
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.470
this experiment became extremely controversial,

268
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.350
<v 11>almost untouchable. People didn't want to be associated with Lilly.</v>

269
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:37.950
Nobody wanted to fund anything that sounded like Lilly.

270
00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.540
It just got this like aura of don't go there,

271
00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:43.403
don't go there.

272
00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.010
Even people who wanted to do really rigorous work with human dolphin

273
00:16:47.011 --> 00:16:49.680
communication had a tough time getting any funding.

274
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.620
And that lasted for a long time.

275
00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:56.800
<v 9>And the thing is,</v>

276
00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.750
even though there are so many reasons to disapprove of this experiment,

277
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.180
when you talk to Margaret,

278
00:17:04.181 --> 00:17:09.160
you can't read each other's company help but want to be in that apartment with

279
00:17:09.161 --> 00:17:09.994
them.

280
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:14.120
<v 2>He would come over and when he was in what I call his sweet mood and Peter had a</v>

281
00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:16.190
lot of very, very sweet mood to him.

282
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.270
He would sink to the bottom and take my foot in his mouth and he wasn't so

283
00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.510
knowing and he wasn't looking at anything.

284
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.170
It was almost like a little kid comes and just wants to hold your hand and he

285
00:17:30.171 --> 00:17:33.590
would just sink to the bottom and close his eyes and just hang onto my foot.

286
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:35.970
<v 5>Okay.</v>

287
00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:40.970
<v 2>And then you'd have to come up and breathe and then you'd go back down and he</v>

288
00:17:41.191 --> 00:17:42.630
just grabbed my foot.

289
00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:45.530
<v 5>Um,</v>

290
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:49.360
<v 2>and he would do this for all a good while. [inaudible]</v>

291
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:15.873
<v 5>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

292
00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:27.423
[inaudible] [inaudible]

293
00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:40.123
[inaudible] [inaudible]

294
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.410
<v 12>we'll be back in a moment with another encounter.</v>

295
00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:00.690
<v 13>You have two new messages. Hi, this is d Graham Burnett. Yes.</v>

296
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.630
Hi, this is Margaret [inaudible]. Here we go.

<v 9>hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today. Hello.</v>

315
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:20.360
Yes. Or as a dolphin might say, how would it often say it? I don't know.

316
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:21.321
We'll end that. You know what?

317
00:20:21.321 --> 00:20:23.780
That is exactly kind of the question of this next segment.

318
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.850
<v 12>I mean the dream that a human being and talk to a dolphin or any animal really</v>

319
00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:29.950
get in their heads, cross that gap.

320
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.370
This is a dream that humans have had for since like forever. Yeah,

321
00:20:33.371 --> 00:20:34.570
St Francis of Assisi.

322
00:20:34.571 --> 00:20:37.960
It goes away back now and so far as dolphins are concerned,

323
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:43.010
after the John Lilly's situation, researchers did get a little tepid,

324
00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.850
but they didn't stay tepid as you say, for long.

325
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:52.290
<v 2>No, because along came this woman,</v>

326
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:55.290
Dr Denise Hersey, director of the wild dolphin project,

327
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:59.490
who basically decided to take John Lily's experiment and flip it rather than

328
00:20:59.491 --> 00:21:03.270
have the dolphin speak English, let's have the humans speak dolphin,

329
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.140
or at the very least let's create a shared language where humans and dolphins

330
00:21:07.141 --> 00:21:07.974
can speak

331
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.710
<v 12>or at least whistle. Well, you know, it's about finding,</v>

332
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:16.580
finding a place you can meet back to produce your Lynn Levy. Okay.

333
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.910
So for Denise, this dream of finding that meeting spot,

334
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:23.830
it goes back to when she was a little girl. Well, when I was 12 years old,

335
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.670
I used to page through the encyclopedia Britannica.

336
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:31.750
In the days when we had books and I would always stop at the whale and Dolphin

337
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:35.230
page, look at the dolphins and go, wow,

338
00:21:35.231 --> 00:21:37.150
I wonder what their brains are like.

339
00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.510
Cause they've evolved in the water that when you were 12 I was, I was,

340
00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.350
I was a total nerd. In fact, I, I entered this contest in Minnesota.

341
00:21:44.351 --> 00:21:46.390
Like what would you do for the world if you could do something?

342
00:21:46.391 --> 00:21:47.440
And I actually wrote,

343
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:50.800
I would build a human animal translators so we could figure out what was going

344
00:21:50.801 --> 00:21:53.230
on in the minds of animals. So yeah, I don't know.

345
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:55.130
I got the bug early and here I am. Do you have,

346
00:21:55.250 --> 00:22:00.050
were you having a fantasy about what you might learn or fantasy? None.

347
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.180
I was just curious. So I don't know. You look in their eyes,

348
00:22:03.181 --> 00:22:06.120
there's definitely something behind there. You just want to know what it is.

349
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.050
Fast forward many years,

350
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.820
Denise got a boat and I went out to The Bahamas. She was like,

351
00:22:12.821 --> 00:22:15.190
if I'm going to study these dolphins, I'm going to do it in the wild.

352
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:19.240
That's where they live. So she tracked down a pod of wild dolphins. Yep. Yep.

353
00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:20.950
And she just tried to blend in.

354
00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.910
I actually anchored the boat in one spot most of the time.

355
00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.340
This spot in the Bermuda Triangle in the middle of,

356
00:22:27.341 --> 00:22:29.650
I call it the Dolphin highway, where dolphins come and go.

357
00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.070
They could come by if they wanted to, and if they didn't, they didn't.

358
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:35.110
When they would come by,

359
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.950
she and her team would just slip into the water and behave ourselves.

360
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.350
Just sort of watch paying attention to who was who,

361
00:22:41.351 --> 00:22:44.620
which dolphin had a crooked Finn, which one didn't, and when they'd leave,

362
00:22:44.621 --> 00:22:47.890
we'd get out. And that's really how we operated for the first five years.

363
00:22:47.891 --> 00:22:49.240
And it had worked five years.

364
00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.480
She spent five years just watching not doing anything else. Yes.

365
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:55.950
Doesn't just take an enormous amount of patients. Well, sure. I mean,

366
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.350
but after about five years, they started realizing, well,

367
00:22:58.351 --> 00:23:01.710
these guys aren't gonna grab us and pocus and products.

368
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.710
So they started just going about their own business, like feeding, mating,

369
00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.180
nursing, and talking

370
00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.203
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

371
00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.310
<v 2>or at least making a lot of noises,</v>

372
00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:21.180
which she and her team would record. Wow.

373
00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:24.720
That's all dolphin. Well, Dolphin make things. They make all these, yeah,

374
00:23:24.721 --> 00:23:25.620
like that. That's like,

375
00:23:25.621 --> 00:23:28.980
there's like a clicking kind of quaking sound that they make.

376
00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.980
That sounds like a zipper. That's pretty, yeah. Yeah.

377
00:23:34.981 --> 00:23:38.040
They make like whistles that are more kind of distinct and then they make them

378
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.250
sound they're like longer and weirder.

379
00:23:41.251 --> 00:23:45.980
And do you have any sense that each of these sounds mean something different?

380
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.620
<v 12>Well that's exactly what we don't know.</v>

381
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.800
I couldn't tell you what kinds of sounds are correlated with fighting and with

382
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:55.250
mating or disciplining a calf. What we don't know is,

383
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:58.790
are there detailed kind of words in there or is there a more kind of encoded

384
00:23:58.791 --> 00:23:59.510
information?

385
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.900
But what they do know is that each dolphin seems to have its own kind of

386
00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:05.570
signature whistle, which is basically a name.

387
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:09.020
Every individual has its own name. Peter had a name,

388
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.020
nobody's ever asked me that. Here's Margaret again. And his name was

389
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.830
<v 16>s s</v>

390
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.200
<v 12>really? It is almost saying Peter here. Right.</v>

391
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.360
So I can call you Lynn by your whistle and knew Robert by your whistle.

392
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:30.390
It could be a dolphin going, Eh, Lan. Exactly. Do they do that?

393
00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.570
They do. Huh? Not only that, uh,

394
00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:38.070
apparently dolphins will use the names of other dolphins who aren't even around.

395
00:24:38.071 --> 00:24:41.010
Like they can't see them. Like they'll talk about each other behind their backs.

396
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.580
Yes, maybe. Wow, good.

397
00:24:43.581 --> 00:24:48.581
That means that they're using representations of things which aren't in front of

398
00:24:49.381 --> 00:24:51.240
them, which is sorta like the beginning of language,

399
00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.300
if that's okay they're doing and we don't know.

400
00:24:53.301 --> 00:24:54.860
But if that's what they're doing, then yeah,

401
00:24:54.861 --> 00:24:58.010
that's kind of like the edge of language. So, you know,

402
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:01.610
it gives us hope that there's probably more information going on there than we

403
00:25:01.611 --> 00:25:02.330
know.

404
00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:07.330
And now finally she has that device,

405
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:13.130
<v 0>which device is the</v>

406
00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:14.420
<v 12>magical, you know,</v>

407
00:25:14.421 --> 00:25:17.990
human animal translator device that she was dreaming of writing about when she

408
00:25:17.991 --> 00:25:18.824
was 12.

409
00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.920
She has this box that can generate dolphin noises and it can recognize dolphin

410
00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:29.190
noises. And if it works the way that you know that she's dreaming it all work,

411
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:34.420
it could be the first like real two way back and forth conversation between a

412
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:40.280
human and a wild animal.

413
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.100
So we're looking forward to the summer and getting out and getting more data and

414
00:25:43.101 --> 00:25:45.710
really exercising the boxes. And see what happens.

415
00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.110
<v 0>[inaudible] good. We're ready. So I begged my way of board.</v>

416
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.650
Everybody good. See you. Sick pills talking.

417
00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:00.460
We left on July 8th from Florida next month. Yeah.

418
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.140
And headed for The Bahamas to see this pod that she has been following kind of

419
00:26:05.141 --> 00:26:06.850
forever, almost 30 years now.

420
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.230
<v 5>Hey, hello.</v>

421
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.080
<v 0>Boat is called the, um,</v>

422
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.580
RV stoneleigh vanilla is the scientific name for this particular type of

423
00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:18.190
Dolphin. The spotted dolphin. Have you seen the spot at Dolphin?

424
00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:19.810
I've never seen one in person.

425
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:22.640
<v 5>All right. [inaudible] what</v>

426
00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.710
<v 0>is this boat like? It's like not a tiny boat,</v>

427
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:29.711
but it's not a big boat and it was just absolutely full of humans.

428
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:34.310
And who, who is it? Who are your humans? Yeah, well there's Denise obviously.

429
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.220
How's it gone? And you've got a captain. My name is Keir Smith,

430
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:41.690
first mate and Yo, research assistance. Alison Meyers. Les Mason,

431
00:26:41.691 --> 00:26:44.430
Bethany Oli air, Nathan's script check volunteers.

432
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.920
There's a acoustics expert,

433
00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.410
which he has Hoffman for a long time I couldn't even figure out where everybody

434
00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:51.030
was sleeping cause the boat seems so small.

435
00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.030
It was like there was not room for all these people on this boat behind you.

436
00:26:54.031 --> 00:26:56.790
There's a soft hot soldering iron next to the fridge and I haven't even gotten

437
00:26:56.791 --> 00:26:58.010
to this guy. Don't get into it.

438
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:00.350
<v 5>Ding, Ding Ding.</v>

439
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.890
<v 0>He, his name is [inaudible].</v>

440
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:06.500
So you didn't have like any dolphin experience before this, right? Oh Hell No.

441
00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.660
He's one of the guys who invented Google glass.

442
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.510
I became a computer programmer so I'd never have to lead air conditioning.

443
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.890
Right. And I'm out here. And what is this a hundred degree weather to do what?

444
00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.720
So his job on the boat is to, he's in charge of these these boxes.

445
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:23.030
This box is probably costs a hundred k at this point.

446
00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:26.720
[inaudible] for funding Louis for funding. So he's the tech Wiz.

447
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.280
When he came down to visit my lab,

448
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.760
I was telling you about the two way work and the difficulty with underwater

449
00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:35.750
stuff and he said Oh I build wearable computers cause how can you build me an

450
00:27:35.751 --> 00:27:40.400
underwater wearable computer that it shouldn't be hard four years later?

451
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.330
What does this machine look like that you looks like when a toaster like one of

452
00:27:44.331 --> 00:27:48.590
those fancy chrome toasters, except you wear it on your chest. Are they silvery?

453
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:49.760
In fact, they are silvery.

454
00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:52.910
They have a bunch of sort of knobs and buttons and speakers on them.

455
00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.070
<v 12>It's got preprogrammed whistles in it.</v>

456
00:27:55.190 --> 00:28:00.040
I can punch a key and it projects whistle eight here. Whistle beat

457
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.480
<v 0>here it was the seed.</v>

458
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.470
She's programmed in signature whistles of some of the dolphins, right?

459
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.730
Hello p shoes and [inaudible]

460
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:12.730
<v 12>we uh, made signature whistles for ourselves. Oh,</v>

461
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:16.330
she can call their names and they can call her names. That's,

462
00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.480
that's what you're saying. That is the idea. Yeah. And,

463
00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:23.050
and if they do call her name, this name that she's made for herself,

464
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.080
then the box should be able to recognize it and can tell her that she has been

465
00:28:28.091 --> 00:28:32.360
called by name. It'll actually sit say into her ear in English, Denise, Oh,

466
00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.890
this is real time. I call it real time sound recognition, but it's real time.

467
00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.950
Whistle recognition underwater. How does,

468
00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.110
if she's made up this name for herself,

469
00:28:41.111 --> 00:28:43.510
how is it that they're going to know that that's her name? Well,

470
00:28:43.511 --> 00:28:44.830
the idea is that they're learning.

471
00:28:44.831 --> 00:28:47.830
So she gets into the water over and over and she says,

472
00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:50.080
you know the equivalent of hi, I'm Denise. Hi,

473
00:28:50.081 --> 00:28:53.620
I'm Denise over and over and over and they learn it. You know,

474
00:28:53.621 --> 00:28:56.980
they developed this little like maybe they'll just start to use it and call her.

475
00:28:57.010 --> 00:28:59.350
Yeah. So you hope you hope they call you.

476
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.530
I'd be really sad if they didn't call my name,

477
00:29:02.531 --> 00:29:07.060
but Vegas at the very least you could call their names and see how they react.

478
00:29:07.061 --> 00:29:09.040
Right. We'll see. That would be a Eureka moment.

479
00:29:09.041 --> 00:29:14.041
I think if you hit the Lolita button and Lolita suddenly turned and looked right

480
00:29:16.481 --> 00:29:19.900
at you with a shock. Exactly. What the heck? Wow.

481
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:23.410
That human called me by my signature whistle. Whoa. That, has that happened yet?

482
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.120
It hasn't happened yet

483
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.210
<v 0>and this is something I just did not appreciate for awhile. I was on the spot.</v>

484
00:29:31.211 --> 00:29:34.350
I was like, why is this so hard? Like this seems like it should be.

485
00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:36.570
These people are so smart, like this should be easy,

486
00:29:36.571 --> 00:29:41.130
but they're just like constantly being defeated by the ocean basically,

487
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:44.050
which I'm the ocean is like a worthy foe,

488
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:48.250
but it's like the first year, first year was complete disaster,

489
00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:49.540
trying to get the hardware to work.

490
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.350
What happened the first year everything broke. It was leak city.

491
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.580
Basically the boxes just kept shutting down. As soon as they would get in there,

492
00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.980
that's not good. It's not good. That's the sort of not what you want. No,

493
00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.600
and last year the box is working, but then we couldn't find the dolphins.

494
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.910
Dolphins just disappeared. You know?

495
00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.980
They went a hundred miles away to another location. They don't know why.

496
00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.650
I kept up with my side of the deal.

497
00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:17.660
Today's your dolphins stood you up g and one of the reasons I was on the boat is

498
00:30:18.421 --> 00:30:20.940
it felt like everybody was thinking like, this is it.

499
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.550
This is the year we're going to go out there and we're going to find some

500
00:30:23.551 --> 00:30:25.500
dolphins and we're going to make some history.

501
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:28.523
<v 5>You Ready?</v>

502
00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:37.960
[inaudible] now.

503
00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:41.630
<v 0>Any minute now?</v>

504
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:48.980
<v 12>Okay. It turns out it's not that easy to find these dolphins.</v>

505
00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.160
They're not tagged, you know, they're wild dolphins.

506
00:30:52.161 --> 00:30:55.670
So you just like you go to where you think they might be. You know that song?

507
00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:56.970
<v 16>Yeah.</v>

508
00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.210
<v 12>You stare at the water and you wait.</v>

509
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:02.803
<v 16>Yeah. What is that</v>

510
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.200
<v 12>for the first three days? Pretty much I would, we were just driving around</v>

511
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.780
in circles, like literally in circles, you know? I feel like I had like a,

512
00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.840
like a five hour conversation about game of Thrones.

513
00:31:21.841 --> 00:31:25.260
I've never even seen an episode of game of Thrones, dolphins. Any dolphins,

514
00:31:25.261 --> 00:31:27.840
anywhere. No.

515
00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.950
<v 17>It was nothing else to do at all. Just come on dolphins. We need you now.</v>

516
00:31:31.951 --> 00:31:35.370
Come on. Dolphins. Dolphins come on dog to kick in

517
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:39.193
bed.

518
00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:40.260
<v 0>Seaweed. It looked like a [inaudible].</v>

519
00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.213
<v 17>Come on dog.</v>

520
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.130
<v 12>Oh waive. That looks like a dolphin.</v>

521
00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.140
<v 17>I just say that I would be like,</v>

522
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.310
everything looks like a dolphin to me right now. There are days like that

523
00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:06.450
<v 5>open. They are right there.</v>

524
00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:12.640
All of a sudden out on the water receive one. Fin Two fins, three fins, five,

525
00:32:12.641 --> 00:32:15.050
six, seven, eight. Oh,

526
00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.220
there's so many of them and they're so cool standing

527
00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:22.160
<v 0>there and watching them. Denise turns to me and she goes, you want to go there?</v>

528
00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:27.050
I don't know, do you recommend it? And I was not prepared for her to say that.

529
00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.840
And also I was holding recording equipment and everything and so I just,

530
00:32:29.841 --> 00:32:32.180
I ended up just having to go in like in my clothes,

531
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:36.230
like wearing like my shorts and like a bra and I like,

532
00:32:36.231 --> 00:32:39.920
I all modesty aside, like thrown aside, they were like, you can go in.

533
00:32:39.921 --> 00:32:41.440
And I was like, oh, okay. Okay. Okay.

534
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.870
<v 6>Okay. Go on. Jesus Christ. Here we go.</v>

535
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:47.953
Um,

536
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.230

<v 0>Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich,</v>

550
00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.850
Radiolab and today the show is called hello back to Lynn.

551
00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.800
<v 6>I mean, it's a total sensory shift.</v>

552
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:08.800
<v 0>The temperature changes, everything goes quiet.</v>

553
00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.860
It almost feels like this, like the classic through the looking glass moment.

554
00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:16.811
Where are you?

555
00:34:16.811 --> 00:34:20.080
Like you go through the looking glass and like everybody's walking on the

556
00:34:20.081 --> 00:34:20.914
ceiling.

557
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:26.520
And I jumped in and there were two pretty big dolphins coming right at me,

558
00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.530
like maybe two feet from my head, um,

559
00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:37.150
and staring at me and I was like, uh,

560
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:42.730
I don't know. What do you know? What did you do? I stayed very,

561
00:34:42.731 --> 00:34:47.510
still pretty much froze. Now. How far were they from two feet.

562
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.000
Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. Dolphins are not small.

563
00:34:50.001 --> 00:34:53.090
And they were looking at me in a way that was like, we see you.

564
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.670
And also there they make these um,

565
00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:00.130
sort of clicking sonar sounds, which are like,

566
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.290
they were talking to you or just talking about, well, know what I mean?

567
00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:06.360
What I think they were doing is, is,

568
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:10.220
is sonar in me sort of looking at me with their, with sound.

569
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.360
I mean my head was vibrating. I mean they can see not just body shape.

570
00:35:14.361 --> 00:35:16.510
They can see your bones. Oh,

571
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.630
they can see into you like you really feel looked at.

572
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.000
Wow. It was heart stopping.

573
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.333
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

574
00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.560
<v 0>believeable it was weird.</v>

575
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:37.560
It was so cool at that point.

576
00:35:37.561 --> 00:35:38.070
It's like the trip

577
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.490
<v 9>couldn't know and I go home happy, you know? And everybody was like,</v>

578
00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.780
calm down. Those weren't even the right dolphins. What do you mean? Well,

579
00:35:45.781 --> 00:35:49.780
those were bottlenose dolphins, Denise studies spots. Uh, but

580
00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:55.420
<v 0>the next day, all right. Onwards for spots, spots or bust,</v>

581
00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:59.380
we set out again, go for a few hours.

582
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:06.240
Bethany does this dolphin daily energetic spotted and got some

583
00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:13.660
dance. You saw him, right? Yeah. Right there. Yeah. There we go.

584
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.860
Gotta be spot. So then everybody's like, you know,

585
00:36:17.861 --> 00:36:19.410
it's like all hands on deck situation.

586
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:22.630
Everybody's like strapping on the boxes and strapping on the headphones,

587
00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:26.340
which is a lot of scrambling. There's so much scrambling. Oh,

588
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.380
there's one off the bow here. It's like a fight. It's like a fire drill.

589
00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.170
Now I'm putting on my box. Here's the problem.

590
00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:36.610
<v 9>I'm just testing. I'm like a captive dolphin. Wild Dolphins.</v>

591
00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.790
They have other things to do. They have, you know, fish to catch.

592
00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:42.430
You kind of have to entice it into having a conversation,

593
00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.990
otherwise it'll just swim away.

594
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:48.310
But how do you do that when you don't know its language? Well,

595
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.840
turns out dolphins are just crazy for scarves. Skirt high, uhm,

596
00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.930
scarf low. When you throw them a scarf,

597
00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:59.500
they sweep it up with their tailfin and then they let it go and it wafts through

598
00:36:59.501 --> 00:37:03.010
the water and another dolphin comes up and sweeps it up with their rostrum.

599
00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.040
So the idea is use the scarf as kind of like a, a bridge.

600
00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:10.660
Denise and another diver will get in the water with a scarf.

601
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:13.610
<v 12>We'll get in the water and we'll just start passing it back and forth.</v>

602
00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:16.610
It's human to human. Like, Hey, look at this fun thing. We're doing,

603
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.280
let them watch. If they want to get in the game, we let them in the game.

604
00:37:19.281 --> 00:37:21.230
Sometimes we'll take the toy over to them,

605
00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:26.180
show it to them and press the word for scarf. Say, hey, this is a scarf.

606
00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:30.310
<v 9>They just made up a whistle for scarf. Yup. And ideally, and this is the key,</v>

607
00:37:30.490 --> 00:37:33.100
the dolphins will pick up the word and use it to,

608
00:37:33.101 --> 00:37:35.890
to ask for the scar if and when they do that,

609
00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.960
then you've got like a tiny bit of common ground that you can build on.

610
00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:47.170
<v 0>Okay. Well you got, we have four spot at Dolphin. Yeah. Little candidates.</v>

611
00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.390
Alex. Yes. You've been waiting for them, right? Yeah. Just before they jump in.

612
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:54.570
Denise walks another diver through the game plan. Oh,

613
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.190
so you're going to hold it and you're not going to give it to them. Okay.

614
00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.640
You're going to entice it with them. You're going to be like, oh, this is fun.

615
00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.220
It's like dive down with it and like wave it or, yeah,

616
00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:07.990
start at the surface and just really get them with you moments later.

617
00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.630
All clear. Good. We're ready.

618
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:14.320
And East jumps in followed by three other divers.

619
00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:19.540
Where you in the water at this time?

620
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.050
<v 9>No, I actually had to watch the whole thing from the deck and like you could see</v>

621
00:38:23.051 --> 00:38:25.300
from the surface three or four

622
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.290
<v 0>adolescent dolphins see the nieces right up next to one of them.</v>

623
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.530
You see the back of her head in her little snorkel. That's good.

624
00:38:32.531 --> 00:38:35.520
She's surrounded right now. What are they doing? Sure.

625
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.990
Oh they're kind of like twisting around each other. I will say this.

626
00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:44.980
She is tremendously graceful in the water.

627
00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.940
She gets in the water and she's like totally at home. So maybe she is a dolphin.

628
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:51.700
She might secretly be a dolphin going like around and around.

629
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:55.120
And then she goes on there man. What is happening under there?

630
00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.630
This is what it sounds like underwater.

631
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:09.010
<v 18>This is the actual sound from the scarf dance.</v>

632
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.920
They record everything that goes on under there.

633
00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.020
<v 0>I mean a lot of that is the dolphins just doing whatever they're doing. Um,</v>

634
00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:33.750
but some of it is nice with the box making this scarf whistle over and over.

635
00:39:33.751 --> 00:39:34.410
Like

636
00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:38.580
<v 19>scarf. You want the scarf? Yeah. Scarf.</v>

637
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.200
<v 0>Cause she's like trying to get the dolphin to say the word, right?</v>

638
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.113
<v 19>Yeah.</v>

639
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.370
<v 0>Eventually she and the dolphins surface and</v>

640
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.160
he's got the scarf. One of the dolphins is holding the scar. Hey,

641
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:58.360
it's like this flash of red and then they all go back under

642
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:01.383
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

643
00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:09.840
<v 0>and Denise comes back up with it. That's real good. All right. Wait and see.</v>

644
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:15.390
After about a minute she surfaces. I think Denise has it now.

645
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:18.840
She dies one more time.

646
00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:24.043
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

647
00:40:26.170 --> 00:40:30.070
<v 0>a minute later, Dolphin has the scarf and this one on and on.</v>

648
00:40:30.071 --> 00:40:34.870
They were passing it back and forth so fluidly that I thought maybe the Dolphin

649
00:40:34.871 --> 00:40:36.940
has begun to ask for the scarf by name.

650
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:43.990
Eventually lease gets gravity sucks hauled back up onto the boat

651
00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.820
and we all just sort of gather around like, wow, well yeah,

652
00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:52.840
the two juveniles picked up the scarf right away and played some signature

653
00:40:52.841 --> 00:40:54.640
whistles, played some scarf whistles,

654
00:40:54.641 --> 00:40:57.070
and then some Sargassum came flooding by piece of seaweed.

655
00:40:57.220 --> 00:41:00.250
Throw it on that played the Sargassum. Listen, you think you got an mimic?

656
00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.150
Nothing that triggered the system, but you know, we'll see what it looks like.

657
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:11.530
That's exhausting. She didn't get anything. Well, I mean, nothing the box.

658
00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.640
<v 9>Hey guys, as a match, you know,</v>

659
00:41:13.641 --> 00:41:16.400
nothing that indicated the dolphin like learned a word.

660
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.433
<v 19>Aw.</v>

661
00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:20.310
<v 0>Sounded like they were right there.</v>

662
00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:32.130
<v 9>But there was this one thing that happened. She said that when she,</v>

663
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:38.060
um, addressed one of the dolphins by its name, uh,

664
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.660
the dolphin turned around and looked at her and kind of cocked its little

665
00:41:41.661 --> 00:41:43.520
dolphin head. Really? Yes.

666
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:50.300
[inaudible] I was hoping you'd say that. Wow.

667
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:52.470
<v 0>Also, there was this moment where that,</v>

668
00:41:52.471 --> 00:41:55.250
and Celeste were looking at the data later that,

669
00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:59.760
and they saw that right after Denise made her signature whistle cause that

670
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:03.030
somebody responding with her seizure was another dolphin made its signature

671
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.610
whistles. Sweet. Oh, that's pretty cool.

672
00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:10.290
You mean like she said hi and it said hi back. Yeah. That's amazing. Well,

673
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:11.460
maybe, I mean,

674
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:15.360
<v 9>the thing is dolphins make their signature whistles all the time.</v>

675
00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.540
So it could be nothing or it could be this,

676
00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:27.990
I mean, she's a very rigorous scientist.

677
00:42:27.991 --> 00:42:32.991
Like she wants that to happen another 30 times before even starting to take it

678
00:42:33.061 --> 00:42:33.894
seriously.

679
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:38.230
But still it does make you think about the possibilities.

680
00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.550
What do you want to ask?

681
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:43.220
<v 12>I don't know. I want to ask everything. So</v>

682
00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:45.280
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

683
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.540
<v 12>like what? I'd like to know what their lives are like when we're not around.</v>

684
00:42:49.541 --> 00:42:53.110
And then how do you spend your day, you know, do they think about things?

685
00:42:53.111 --> 00:42:57.280
I mean, do they think about the future? Did they think about the past? I mean,

686
00:42:57.281 --> 00:42:59.230
we know they have longterm memories, you know,

687
00:42:59.231 --> 00:43:02.710
do they remember their calves from 10 years ago? Did they think about death?

688
00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:07.570
Yeah. And they certainly see it. Just be anything you'd ask your friends, right?

689
00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:13.913
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

690
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:17.770
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

691
00:43:17.770 --> 00:43:18.780
<v 0>although part of me wonders like,</v>

692
00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.260
I think we're going to get even get there.

693
00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:27.370
Well that's the goal is to have a conversation and he can't do it this way where

694
00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:30.310
you're in the wild and you can't touch them and you've got to verify every

695
00:43:30.311 --> 00:43:31.930
whistle 35 times. What?

696
00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:36.010
Are they ever actually going to have a conversation because they one of the

697
00:43:36.011 --> 00:43:37.810
language lesson I could, yeah, I get it.

698
00:43:37.811 --> 00:43:41.170
But like don't you feel like Margaret was all the problems

699
00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.070
<v 9>in terms of that experiment aside which she was actually getting somewhere with</v>

700
00:43:45.071 --> 00:43:47.500
Peter? Like they were actually having a real exchange

701
00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:50.560
<v 20>in the moment perhaps. But thinking forward,</v>

702
00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:54.250
I believe that what you can accomplish by talking,

703
00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.330
by having a two way conversation is just infinite.

704
00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:59.910
<v 9>Yeah, and I totally agree,</v>

705
00:43:59.911 --> 00:44:04.911
but if it's taken her 30 something years to get to a maybe hello?

706
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.000
Yeah, she doesn't even know if she got to hello yet.

707
00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.780
And if all she has is a just a limited amount of time with these dolphins every

708
00:44:12.781 --> 00:44:14.470
summer, then 50 more times.

709
00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.560
If you can tell your 50 more years and I'm just like, Oh God,

710
00:44:16.561 --> 00:44:19.080
the plant is going to be 17 degrees warmer. By that point,

711
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:22.560
dolphins are going to have all migrated to some other spot. It just feels like,

712
00:44:22.561 --> 00:44:25.490
Ugh, come on. Just get in the pool and hold. Let, let,

713
00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:30.120
let the Dolphin hold your foot. She's already got the how low going for her.

714
00:44:30.121 --> 00:44:33.540
Maybe. So like a start and then, yes. In 50 years.

715
00:44:33.541 --> 00:44:37.080
Should we have moved past hello to a three word sentence.

716
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:42.120
How's your macro today? Yeah. I think that two or three word sentence. Yes.

717
00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.900
I would put money on a three word sentence in 50 years. The question is,

718
00:44:45.901 --> 00:44:50.270
do we ever get to the point of exploring death? Yeah. Yeah.

719
00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.050
I don't know. Lynn, do you have faith

720
00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:59.210
[inaudible] I have faith that if Denise continues with what she's doing,

721
00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.280
that we'll be able to talk about concrete things.

722
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.330
We'll be able to talk about seaweed and we'll be able to talk about,

723
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:15.180
um, coral and we'll be able to have a scintillating conversation about scarves.

724
00:45:15.181 --> 00:45:18.930
I do believe that, and that is not nothing. I mean,

725
00:45:18.931 --> 00:45:21.030
that is pretty impressive in its own way.

726
00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.220
Big thanks to our, to our producer.

727
00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:39.270
I'm Jack. I'm Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich. Thank you guys for listening.
