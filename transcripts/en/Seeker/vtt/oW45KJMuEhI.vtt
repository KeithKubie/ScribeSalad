00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.220
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.100
In 1964, a landmark report U.S. Surgeon General
Luther Terry made the case for the link between

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.930
smoking and cancer and heart disease.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.360
In the years since, there the evidence pile
against smoking has only gotten larger.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.360
There’s a more than a few ways smoking harms
the body, but let’s just focus on a few

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.360
certain compounds.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.360
Smoking is lethal in a few ways.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.200
In those early studies I mentioned, researchers
found that cigarette smoke causes ciliostasis.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.980
Which is when those little hairs lining your
airways die.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.450
Without those hairs, your body has a hard
time filtering out bad things, like cigarette

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.450
smoke.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.800
Smoke isn't just one thing, it's a combination
of particles that result when you burn cigarettes.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.030
As the more you smoke, the more smoke gets
in your lungs and the more likely tumors will

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.130
form due to the damaging particles.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.610
As you know, tobacco smoke has lot of carcinogens.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.360
According to a study published in the journal
Molecular Cancer Research there’s over 60

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.230
compounds known to cause cancer.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.060
Compounds like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAH).

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.770
Which are formed when things like oil, gas,
and yup, tobacco are burned.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.130
They can even form if you char things like
steak.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.070
And once those compounds get past the dead
cilia, they find their way to vulnerable parts

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.070
of your lungs.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.360
Some of these PAHs lead to chronic inflammation
of the lung, a condition which raises the

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.689
risk of cancer[1].

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.210
Some of these chemicals trigger mutations
when they bind to the DNA.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.290
The compounds get stuck, forming what’s
called an adduct that makes it really hard

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.300
for the DNA to replicate, which can potentially
lead to mutations.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.909
When this does happen, one of the most significant
mutations occurs in a protein called p53[2].

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.350
The protein handles a lot of cell regulation,
and its function depends on a variety of factors,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.190
but often it’s a tumor suppressor.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.100
When this protein experiences a mutation,
that function gets switched off, allowing

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.310
tumors in the lungs to grow and spread.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.320
One study published in the journal Clinical
Cancer Research found that a mutation in p53

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.880
was a maker of poor cancer prognosis.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.590
And polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons aren’t
linked with just cancer, but research published

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.560
in the journal The FASEB Journal, found that
these compounds can trigger heart disease

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.560
too[3].

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.350
Basically these compounds cause an overproduction
of certain fatty acids in endothelial cells,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.340
the cells that line your blood vessels, which
causes them to die.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.620
So yeah, smoking literally kills your blood
vessels.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.650
Smoking also increases the risk of heart disease
by narrowing the blood vessels and increasing

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.530
the formation of clotting plaque, which can
lead to deadly heart attacks.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.060
In fact it counts for 33% of all heart disease
related deaths in the US.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.710
Still don’t believe smoking hurts?

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.080
Well it can literally turn your lungs black.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.510
two recent studies confirm that yup.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.510
Smoking is deadly.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.510
The smoking gun?

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.510
Carbon nanoparticles.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.390
Similar to black lung syndrome, when coal
miners inhaled coal dust, these particles

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.950
from cigarettes get stuck in the lung and
wreak havoc.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.160
In smokers the particles can build up and
lead to severe emphysema.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.970
A nasty and potentially fatal condition that
makes it harder to breathe.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.290
The particles come from material that hasn’t
burned up all the way, which in this case

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:01.590
is the tobacco itself.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.560
They’re small, around 30 and 40 nanometers
in size; about half the width of a human hair.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.890
But over time these nanoparticles build up
and can do some serious damage.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.290
The first study published in the journal eLife,
found that they are so small that once they

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.320
get into the dendritic cells they can break
apart DNA.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.790
So yeah, there’s lots of ways cigarette
smoke causes cellular damage through variety

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.650
of molecular mechanisms.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.530
With all this scientific evidence against
it, I’m baffled why so many people still

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.530
smoke.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.420
But hey it’s a comforting habit for some,
and as we've discussed before, an addicting

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.450
one too.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.810
Thanks nicotine.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.480
But there’s some good news.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.260
Studies show that some of the effects might
be reversible… except those particles.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.210
You’re stuck with those.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:53.070
So the evidence is overwhelming.

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.970
You should probably quit smoking now.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.230
Plus it’s just gross.
