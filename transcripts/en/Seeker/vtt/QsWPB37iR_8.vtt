00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.510
We’ve detected gravitational waves AGAIN!

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.040
And guess what caused the ripple in spacetime?

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040
Yes!

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.090
MORE colliding black holes!

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.160
Hi there spacetime entities, Ian here for
DNews on a very, VERY big day for physics.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.669
Since the discovery of gravitational waves
hit the headlines back in February, we’ve

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.220
been patiently waiting to see whether or not
it was a fluke.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.669
And I can tell you now, it wasn’t!

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.769
The LIGO project has detected these ripples
in spacetime AGAIN.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.809
It’s hard to put into words just how momentous
the first historic discovery of gravitational

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:33.980
waves is for science.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.930
A little over 100 years ago Albert Einstein
predicted their existence, but it wasn’t

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.170
until the ultra-sensitive Laser Interferometer
Gravitational-wave Observatory, or Advanced

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.640
LIGO, went online that we stood a chance of
detecting them.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.949
Gravitational waves are basically ripples
through spacetime, traveling at the speed

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:48.949
of light.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.289
If you imagine ripples traveling across the
surface of a pond after dropping a pebble

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.570
into the water, you’d have a 2-dimensional
idea about what’s going on.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.019
But to detect 3-dimensional gravitational
waves passing through Earth -- and therefore

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.809
passing through US -- we need a very, very
sensitive detector.

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.960
This is where LIGO comes in.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.299
The project consists of two observing stations
-- basically two L-shaped buildings with two

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.410
and a half mile long tunnels -- one in Washington
and one in Louisiana, nearly 2 thousand miles

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.410
apart.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.060
Two stations are needed to confirm the presence
of a gravitational wave signal and tell which

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.210
direction it’s traveling in.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.810
And that’s what happened on December 26,
2015; a second spacetime “chirp” was detected.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.759
Really, when converted into an audio representation,
gravitational waves sound like a “chirp,”

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.070
listen.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.290
Through analysis, LIGO physicists were able
to deduce that the first LIGO chirp in September

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.080
was created by a black hole merger.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.140
That first famous signal was generated by
two black holes, one 29 times the mass of

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.650
our sun and one 36 times the mass of the sun
getting trapped in a gravitational spiral,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.190
eventually colliding and creating one large
black hole.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.649
So that “chirp” is the cataclysmic collision
of two black holes some 1.3 billion light-years

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.649
away.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.700
The most recent event, called GW151226, that
has just been announced TODAY was caused by

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.649
two smaller black holes, one 14 solar masses
and the other only 8 solar masses.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.670
When they merged, they created one spinning
black hole of 21 solar masses.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.910
Now, you may think my math is off, surely
14 plus 8 equals 22?

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.150
Where did that 1 solar mass go?

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.290
Well, during the collision, which happened
1.4 billion light-years away, one whole solar

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.569
mass of material was converted from matter
into energy and that energy is what created

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.629
the powerful gravitational waves that, literally,
shook spacetime.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.720
Cool, right?

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.800
There’s more.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.069
Because LIGO has 2 observing stations, we
can roughly work out where this black hole

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.709
merger occurred in the sky.

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.430
Check out this map of the general region of
sky where LIGO thinks these two black hole

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.430
mergers occurred.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.390
In a statement, Caltech’s Albert Lazzarini,
the deputy director of the LIGO Laboratory

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.709
said: “LIGO is bringing us a new way to
observe some of the darkest yet most energetic

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.099
events in our universe”

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.129
And he’s not wrong.

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.110
We are seeing a revolution in astronomy -- for
the first time we can “hear” the passage

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.800
of gravitational waves from violent events
that occurred billions of years ago and deduce

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.849
what caused them.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.600
Now there are plans for more gravitational
wave detectors to go online, including the

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.159
European Virgo project, so we can better understand
how many black holes there are in our universe

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.270
AND pinpoint WHERE these amazing black hole
mergers are happening.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.720
The discovery of gravitational waves sent
ripples through spacetime and humanity, check

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:40.830

detection of gravitational waves.

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.939

holes collide?
