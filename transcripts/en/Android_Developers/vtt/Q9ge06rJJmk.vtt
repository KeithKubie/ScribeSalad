JAY HARMON: As an
entrepreneur, you

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.230
have the chance to turn your
vision into a product people

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.060
love.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.560
Putting your ideas
in front of users

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.510
is a great way to
learn what people like

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.955
and what could use some work.

00:00:09.955 --> 00:00:12.070
The quicker you build,
the faster you learn.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.940
And prototyping is the best
way to iterate and refine

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.000
your ideas.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.720
In Rapid Prototyping
by Google and Udacity,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.050
you'll build fast, code list
prototypes using InVision,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.460
test with real users, and
get feedback on your ideas.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.220
You'll use that feedback to make
quick and insightful iterations

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.410
to your design and move
forward with confidence.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.440
You'll test with users
across the globe in realtime

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.260
and use their
qualitative feedback

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.250
to hone in on a better design.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.460
Dream, build, and iterate.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.200
Get to work building
your idea today.
