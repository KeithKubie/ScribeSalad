00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.246
Does it make sense?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and

00:00:01.246 --> 00:00:05.436
I appreciate you giving me credit for
thinking of this idea, but

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:09.250
the reality of it is you kind
of forced my hand by not.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.700
I couldn't said right,
right, right, right, right,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.280
down because I don't see
the low level grid positions.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.725
So I don't know if it's 100 or
1,000 or 60 or anything, but cool,

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:21.140
I mean that gives me credit for
something that I don't really deserve.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.100
&gt;&gt; Well, but I did tell you that
you could go up, down, left,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.864
right if you'd said well,
I'd tell you to go right,

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:26.102
I just would move right a little bit.

00:00:26.102 --> 00:00:27.340
And you would have seen where I was,
and you would have,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.739
I gotta keeping going right,
keep going right, keep going right.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.390
And yeah, I could have made that
as granular as I wanted to,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.445
but it has to be fairly granular.

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:37.936
There's no way to get from here
through one of the doorways,

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:39.859
which you absolutely have to do.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.774
So let's be a little bit more concrete.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.040
So let's write down exactly
what that action was.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.760
I don't know what it is, but you created
a bunch of actions that I'm going to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.720
say are things like goto doorway.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.840
And we can even name those doorways.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.340
Let's call therm x.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.490
And so that would be one, two,
three, four more actions,

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.850
which are going to allow me to
save possibly many, many steps.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.926
So let's think about that.

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:01.586
What if I had started here?

00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:03.188
What would you have told me?

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:07.270
&gt;&gt; Well, in principle, the plan
that I gave you could still work.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.070
Just go to the doorway to the east and
then go to the doorway to the south.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.480
&gt;&gt; Right, and by the way,
well, go ahead.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.710
&gt;&gt; Well, it seems like the room layout
that you have makes it possible to go

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.040
kind of the southerly route as well.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.120
&gt;&gt; Right,
there's some point where going east and

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.070
then south is not as good as
going south and then east.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.230
And I don't know exactly where that
point is, but I'll make it easy for

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.645
you by drawing a dot there.

00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:34.570
[LAUGH] What would you
tell me to do there?

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.101
&gt;&gt; I would totally tell you
to go east and then south.

00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:37.010
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.230
&gt;&gt; So east to the doorway,
south to the doorway, then down.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.720
&gt;&gt; Right, so for a whole bunch of states
inside of this room, no matter what I

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.460
do, the action is the same,
even though I'm in different states.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.296
I should still just go here.

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:50.131
I take one action for
one particular state.

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:54.551
So the plan itself and sort of what I'm
searching over is actually much simpler,

00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:59.340
and that would be true for, I think,
probably any space inside of this room.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.130
Your answer would be?

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.100
&gt;&gt; To go to the south door.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.260
&gt;&gt; Right, and not to drive the point
home too much, but what about from here?

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.810
Well, I think it's obvious,
you tell me to go here, from here,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.940
you tell me to go here, from here,
you tell me to go here.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.197
At some point, there's a switch off
between whether going through this

00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:15.948
door or going through this
door is the right thing to do.

00:02:15.948 --> 00:02:17.440
But there you go.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.640
And then once you're in the room,
well then,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.200
you're going to have to take, I guess
sort of baby steps towards the goal.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.870
But regardless, I'm going to claim that
this is an easier kind of space to

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.629
reason over than having to live
in the original action space.
