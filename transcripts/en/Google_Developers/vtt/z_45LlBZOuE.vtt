KUNAL SONI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:02.754 --> 00:00:03.420
Thanks, Francis.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:03.960
I'm Kunal.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.770
And I look after the Google
Play Apps and Games business

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.660
for Southeast Asia and India.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.160
Welcome.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.530
It's fantastic to have all
of you here, this evening,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.560
and to be talking to you
about the exciting world

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.820
of mobile apps.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.220
So clearly, I think, as Google,
one of our most important

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.670
objectives is to work with
you all, our developers,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.380
our partners, to help create
high quality apps, apps that

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.220
will connect meaningfully
with users in India

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.870
and touch lives, delight users,
engage users, and entertain

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:33.690
users.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.380
Right?

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.610
As we all know, Android has
seen some massive momentum

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.970
over the last few years.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.750
And the exciting
part is that even

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.920
going forward, given that
there is so much opportunity

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.830
for smartphone penetration
in this country to improve,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.140
that momentum will continue
to drive growth forward.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.910
Right?

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.430
As a community, I think
the one big challenge

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.540
that we need to think
deeply about-- if we

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.790
are to really unlock
this opportunity

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.070
and make on-boarding, engaging,
and retaining users easier--

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.380
is about creating apps
that will work effectively

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.180
in the hardware and
connectivity landscape

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.130
that you see in India today.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.430
Will this app work even
if connectivity is poor?

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.130
Will this app work effectively
across various devices?

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.090
Those are very, very
important questions.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.310
So in other words, as
the title suggests,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.240
how do we create apps
that are fit for India?

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.250
That's going to be the focus
of this discussion today.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.210
Let's move forward.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.918
And let's quickly look
at the opportunity

00:01:32.918 --> 00:01:34.070
that we see on Android.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.500
Super exciting.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.790
Canalys, which is a
leading research firm,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.790
predicts that in just
over two years from now,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.600
India will have about half
a billion smartphone users.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.380
And as you can see, from
the green bar right there,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.880
Android will be at the
forefront of that revolution.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.020
Right.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.600
So clearly, the challenge
does not lie in users

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.670
or getting enough
users for content.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.390
The challenge could
be in making sure

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.820
that the content that
you create is engaging

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.784
enough and impactful enough.

00:02:05.784 --> 00:02:07.200
There are three
challenges that we

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.789
need to think deeply about,
as we think about delivering

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.620
an excellent user experience.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.500
Let's talk about the first one.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.120
The first one is related to
mobile connections because

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.050
of connectivity in this country.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.490
Unfortunately, the average
connection speed, or even

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.660
the peak average
connection speed,

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.000
tends to be among the lowest,
in this country, globally.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.470
And that's something which
impacts user experience

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.274
and, therefore, should be
an input into your own app

00:02:33.274 --> 00:02:34.190
development lifecycle.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.100
Let's talk about the
second challenge.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.410
And that relates to the
quality and adoption

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.020
of broadband in India.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.170
Interesting stat-- just 11%.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.180
Just 11% of all of the
broadband connections

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.250
in the country, today, operate
at speeds greater than 4 Mbps.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.600
And even a smaller
percentage operate

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.020
at speeds greater than 10 Mbps.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.110
So clearly, I think
all of these factors

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.862
influence the kind
of user experience

00:03:03.862 --> 00:03:05.570
and the kind of data
consumption that you

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.141
can drive through your apps.

00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:10.640
Let's talk about
the third challenge

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.306
that we need to take
into account, which

00:03:12.306 --> 00:03:15.580
is about affordability of data.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.390
The relative cost of
data, as measured by cost

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.740
as a percentage of per capita
national income, in India,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.360
is high compared to some
other markets in the region.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.530
Even a market like
Singapore, for example,

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.790
is eight times cheaper when
you look at relative data

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.310
cost for mobile data--
for mobile broadband--

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.000
and 12 times cheaper when
it comes to mobile data.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.290
So clearly, there is work
to be done, to make data

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.610
more affordable, and
at the same time, work

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.820
to be done in creating
content that works effectively

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.110
despite all these challenges.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.610
So what do you want to do?

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.050
Our vision is really to help you
work through these challenges

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.640
and create apps that
will work effectively

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.610
despite these conditions.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.010
Apps that will
empower the next wave

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.870
of online users in the country.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.770
Apps that will build trust
and confidence among users.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.260
And clearly, apps that will
deliver a seamless, consistent

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.880
experience,
regardless of devices,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.399
regardless of connectivity.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:21.290
That's what our goal is.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.390
So how do you do this?

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.270
It's a nice, noble
thought to have.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.360
How do you do this?

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.680
What we've done is, essentially,
worked with a lot of experts,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.850
both within Google
as well as outside,

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.880
to come up with a list of
practices and guidelines

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.930
that we believe are
important for you

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.680
to take into account as
you think about getting fit

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.104
for India.

00:04:40.104 --> 00:04:41.520
So essentially,
what we've done is

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.320
we've identified a set of
benchmarks and best practices

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.930
across connectivity,
compatibility, and cost,

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.330
and essentially identified
certain tools and procedures

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.710
that you should be taking
into account, into your app

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.200
development cycle.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.910
To tell you more
about this, I'm going

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.950
to invite Ankur Kotwal from
the developer advocate team

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.960
at Google, to take you
through this, in more detail.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.422
Please welcome Ankur.
