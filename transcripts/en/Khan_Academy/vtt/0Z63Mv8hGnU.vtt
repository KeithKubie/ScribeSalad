00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.833
- [Voiceover] If p and n are integers

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:05.366
such that p is greater than
n, is greater than zero.

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:08.140
So this tells us since p
is strictly greater than n

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.863
that means that they're
two different integers.

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:12.233
p is larger of these
two different integers

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:13.325
and that they're both positive.

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:15.367
They're both greater than zero

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:17.433
and they tell us that p
squared minus n squared

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:18.740
is equal to 12.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.566
p squared minus n squared is equal to 12.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:26.366
Which of the following can
be the value of p minus,

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.566
the value of p minus n?

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.233
So one thing that might
jump immediately out of use

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:34.366
and you could factor p
squared minus n squared,

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.900
that this is a difference of squares.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.100
And why it especially jumps out this,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.858
when you factor it, one of
the factors is p minus n.

00:00:40.858 --> 00:00:45.666
So this could be factored as p plus n,

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.879
times p minus n.

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.673
This is just factoring
a difference of squares,

00:00:50.673 --> 00:00:52.776
is equal to 12.

00:00:52.776 --> 00:00:55.600
Is equal to 12.

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:57.166
Now, what we essentially have

00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:00.166
is a product of two
expressions is equal to 12

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:01.233
but each of expressions,

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:03.300
this expression right over here, p plus n,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.458
this is the sum of two positive integers.

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:07.304
This is a difference of
two positive integers

00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:09.776
so both of these are going to be positive.

00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:11.500
Both of these are positive integers.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.376
The reason why we know p
minus n is a positive integer

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:15.842
is they tell us that p is greater than n.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.900
So this is going to be a positive value.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.966
So let's think about all
the different combinations

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:22.900
of positive integers that
we could take their product

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.900
and get to 12.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.596
So, it could be and this of course,

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:30.325
this of course is going
to be larger of the two.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:32.500
This is going to be the larger of the two

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.633
and this is going to be the smaller.

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:37.366
Smaller of the two.

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:38.300
So let's see.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.950
You could have 12 times one.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.166
12 times one is definitely equal to 12.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.792
You could have, let's see.

00:01:48.792 --> 00:01:53.792
You could have six times
two which is equal to 12.

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:58.966
You could have four times three

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:00.966
which is also equal to 12.

00:02:00.966 --> 00:02:02.607
So these are essentially
all of the contenders

00:02:02.607 --> 00:02:06.167
for p plus n and p minus n.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:10.242
So let's think about how
we can rule some of these,

00:02:10.242 --> 00:02:12.303
some of these scenarios.

00:02:12.303 --> 00:02:15.366
Some of these scenarios out.

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:16.361
So let's take the first scenario.

00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:18.402
Let's say that p plus n.

00:02:18.402 --> 00:02:20.509
p, let me write it in green.

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.433
So the first scenario.

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:26.146
Let's say that p plus n is equal to 12

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.997
and p minus n is equal to one.

00:02:28.997 --> 00:02:32.633
p minus n is equal to one.

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:35.033
Well, we could solve for p here.

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:37.023
We could add the left hand side.

00:02:37.023 --> 00:02:39.149
It's the left hand side
as the n is canceled out.

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:41.366
You're left with two p.

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:42.695
And you add the right hand side.

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:45.012
You get 13, p.

00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:46.366
You divide both sides by two,

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:49.533
you get p is equal to 13 over two.

00:02:49.873 --> 00:02:51.273
Now, this is not cool

00:02:51.273 --> 00:02:54.234
because this contradicts
one of our first assumptions

00:02:54.234 --> 00:02:56.633
that p needs to be an integer.

00:02:56.633 --> 00:02:59.700
This right over here is not an integer.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.233
So, p plus n could not be 12

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:04.376
and p minus n cannot be one.

00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:07.642
So, p minus n cannot be one.

00:03:07.642 --> 00:03:10.118
So actually we can rule
this out right over here.

00:03:10.118 --> 00:03:12.500
p minus n cannot be one.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.233
Now let's think about this scenario

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:16.700
where p plus n is equal to six.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.381
p plus n is equal to six.

00:03:19.381 --> 00:03:21.500
That's the larger of the two factors.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.500
And p minus n is equal to two.

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:28.730
Well, same idea.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.330
We can add the left hand side.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.842
We go off with two p

00:03:31.842 --> 00:03:33.233
and then the right hand side,

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:35.166
we get six plus two is equal to eight.

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:36.530
Divide both sides by two,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.366
you get p is equal to four.

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:42.730
And if p is equal to four then you see,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.361
well, see four plus what is equal to six?

00:03:45.361 --> 00:03:47.227
Well, four plus two is equal to six

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.263
and is equal to two.

00:03:49.263 --> 00:03:50.100
And that works out here.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.366
Four minus two is equal to two.

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:53.966
So, this is completely consistent.

00:03:53.966 --> 00:03:55.612
Both of these are positive integers.

00:03:55.612 --> 00:03:57.100
They're different positive integers,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.700
p is greater than n.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.263
So it's completely possible that p minus n

00:04:01.263 --> 00:04:02.761
is equal to two.

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:07.635
So, this is completely a
possible value of p minus n.

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:09.382
And then let's look at this last.

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.827
So this one works out.

00:04:10.827 --> 00:04:13.433
Let's look at this last scenario.

00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:17.433
So we have p plus n is equal to four

00:04:17.447 --> 00:04:22.447
and p minus n is equal to three.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.196
Well, same idea.

00:04:25.196 --> 00:04:29.889
The left hand side you get
two p is equal to seven.

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.366
Well once again, we
divide both sides by two.

00:04:32.366 --> 00:04:34.100
p is equal to 7/2.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.300
This is not an integer.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.094
Just like here, this cannot be the case

00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:39.166
because p needs to be an integer.

00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:41.156
In this case, p is being forced.

00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:45.566
If p plus n was four
and p minus n is three

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:47.725
then you are not going to have,

00:04:47.725 --> 00:04:50.100
then p is not going to be an integer.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.633
So this is also not a possibility.

00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:56.300
Now, we could have ruled this out

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.166
even without doing that exercise

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:00.776
because if p minus n was four,

00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:02.635
if p minus n was four,

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:05.033
then p plus n would have to be three.

00:05:05.033 --> 00:05:08.700
But p plus n is going to be
the larger of the two values.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.700
So, p minus n even if this
were a possible scenario,

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.500
even if we didn't end up with
a non-integer right over here,

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.967
we could have gotten p minus
n to three but not to four.

00:05:19.967 --> 00:05:23.109
p minus n is going to be the
lesser of the two factors

00:05:23.109 --> 00:05:25.946
between if four and three
were even contenders.

00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:27.833
But we know here that they aren't.

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.633
But anyway, we could rule that one.

00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:31.909
We can rule that one out as well.

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:34.300
So the only possible value of p minus n

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.166
or which of the following
can be a value of p minus n?

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:38.466
Two.
