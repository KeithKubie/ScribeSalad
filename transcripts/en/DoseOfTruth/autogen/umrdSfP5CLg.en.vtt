specialized in saying hey what are the
 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.040
specialized in saying hey what are the
opportunities and then we had other

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050
opportunities and then we had other
 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.690
opportunities and then we had other
people who specialized and saying well

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
people who specialized and saying well
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.430
people who specialized and saying well
but what are the risks and it just so

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440
but what are the risks and it just so
 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.839
but what are the risks and it just so
happens that a lot of people have

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849
happens that a lot of people have
 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.550
happens that a lot of people have
trouble doing all that in themselves

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
trouble doing all that in themselves
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.560
trouble doing all that in themselves
when we have systems that are well

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
when we have systems that are well
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.330
when we have systems that are well
constituted with people who have

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
constituted with people who have
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.470
constituted with people who have
different personalities and different

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480
different personalities and different
 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.330
different personalities and different
motives and goals we actually can get

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340
motives and goals we actually can get
 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.800
motives and goals we actually can get
better outcomes we can have a discussion

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
better outcomes we can have a discussion
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.689
better outcomes we can have a discussion
between them yeah well that's exactly

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699
between them yeah well that's exactly
 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.790
between them yeah well that's exactly
why that it's it's for that precise

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
why that it's it's for that precise
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.460
why that it's it's for that precise
reason that that I've been so interested

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
reason that that I've been so interested
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.220

well even on the economic front it's
 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.880
well even on the economic front it's
pretty obvious if you look at things

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
pretty obvious if you look at things
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.150
pretty obvious if you look at things
economically that the entrepreneur types

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
economically that the entrepreneur types
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.010
economically that the entrepreneur types
who start businesses are lumped in with

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
who start businesses are lumped in with
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.779

the liberal creative types we've done a
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.190
the liberal creative types we've done a
lot of work on the prediction of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200
lot of work on the prediction of
 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.080
lot of work on the prediction of
entrepreneurial behavior and ability and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090
entrepreneurial behavior and ability and
 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.910
entrepreneurial behavior and ability and
its openness that's the big predictor

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
its openness that's the big predictor
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.410
its openness that's the big predictor
it's not the only one it's openness and

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
it's not the only one it's openness and
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.930
it's not the only one it's openness and

they he

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
they he
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.830
they he
Vence factory owners in Germany to get

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
Vence factory owners in Germany to get
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.690
Vence factory owners in Germany to get
rid of the rats in the might and mice

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
rid of the rats in the might and mice
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.910
rid of the rats in the might and mice
and the and the insects in the factories

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
and the and the insects in the factories
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.440
and the and the insects in the factories
and also to clean them up and beautify

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450
and also to clean them up and beautify
 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.600
and also to clean them up and beautify
them but the gas they used to clean up

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610
them but the gas they used to clean up
 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.780
them but the gas they used to clean up
the factories was Zyklon a and it was

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790
the factories was Zyklon a and it was
 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.090
the factories was Zyklon a and it was
the variation of that gas Cyclon B that

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100
the variation of that gas Cyclon B that
 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.830
the variation of that gas Cyclon B that
was then used in yeah so you could see

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
was then used in yeah so you could see
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.900
was then used in yeah so you could see
this ramping up date so it was yeah

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910
this ramping up date so it was yeah
 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.900
this ramping up date so it was yeah
absolutely so it was public health then

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910
absolutely so it was public health then
 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.870
absolutely so it was public health then
it was social cleanliness then he went

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880
it was social cleanliness then he went
 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.910
it was social cleanliness then he went
into the asylums and cleaned them up and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920
into the asylums and cleaned them up and
 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.730
into the asylums and cleaned them up and
so it was just this expansion of of who

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740
so it was just this expansion of of who
 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.190
so it was just this expansion of of who
was contaminated and who was impure and

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200
was contaminated and who was impure and
 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.710
was contaminated and who was impure and
I think also his fascination with fire

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
I think also his fascination with fire
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.530
I think also his fascination with fire
and his use of fire symbolism was also

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
and his use of fire symbolism was also
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.650
and his use of fire symbolism was also
associated with that with that appeal to

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660
associated with that with that appeal to
 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.240
associated with that with that appeal to
purification because the whole idea of

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
purification because the whole idea of
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.070
purification because the whole idea of
purification by fire is a very ancient

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080
purification by fire is a very ancient
 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.620
purification by fire is a very ancient
idea
