00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.296
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.830
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: For those
of you who've just come in,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.120
welcome to the Mystery
and Fiction Tent.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.880
My name is Maureen Corrigan,
and I'm a regular reviewer

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.006
for the Washington Post,
and the book critic

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.460
for the NPR program Fresh Air.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.700
Thank you.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000


00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.030
[ applause ]

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.966
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: The
Washington Post has been a sponsor

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.400
of the National Book Festival
since it began 10 years ago.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.810
It is my great pleasure to be
able to introduce to you one

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.956
of the great names of mystery
fiction, Martha Grimes.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.540
I think -- yes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000


00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.040
[ applause ]

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.603
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I think one

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.580
of the highest compliments I can
tell you about that's been paid

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.800
to Martha Grimes is that
even the British adore her.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.720
[ laughter ]

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.413
And I think that the British in
general kind of take a dim view

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.293
to us Americans stepping
on their literary turf,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.516
especially when that literary
turf is the mystery novel.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.120
But Martha Grimes' novels manage
to capture the odd eccentricity

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.810
of England without committing
that greatest crime of --

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.846
in literature of being cute.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.430
Her 20 Richard Jury
novels are set in England.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.230


00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.910
Imagine dampness, coolness, green
pastures, a landscape very different

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.270
from the landscape of
-- that you're in today.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.903
They also all of them
take their titles

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.793
from the titles of
quaint English pubs.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.696
Her newest novel is
called The Black Cat,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.176
which of course has an
Edgar Allan Poe echo to it.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.423
And without further ado, I will
introduce to you Martha Grimes.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.510
[ applause ]

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.260
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Well
thank you very much.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.363
And I'm very glad to be here.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.190
And I was reminded just a few
minutes ago by my PR person,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.143
who is also my son, of the event in
Chicago, the Baucheron [phonetic] --

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.196
I mean I learned how to say it
before I went, but now it's all

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.710
over so I've forgotten
how to pronounce it.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.513
And there was a similar setup where
you had an escort who would take you

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.866
to the room in which
you were giving a talk.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.683
And we were standing at the
door while this other writer was

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.273
speaking, and I saw a boy,
this Dennis Lahane [phonetic],

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.090
who I personally love,
I love his books.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.093
So I was standing there waiting to
go in, and his talk came to an end

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.816
and Dennis Lahane walked out
with his looked like two handlers

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.143
to me rather than escorts.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.010
He walked out, and
when he walked out --

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.510
I mean there was thunderous
applause.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.710
It was one of these long, narrow
rooms, something like this but not

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.683
as big, and huge applause.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.900
So I walked in, and everybody
got up and walked out.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.720
[ laughter ]

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.986
And I was watching.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:05.810


00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.770
&gt;&gt; But then I figured they're just
saying to themselves what the hell,

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.316
we're inside a tent, we
might as well hang around.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.270
[ laughter ]

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.470
I was speaking a couple
of days ago to a reporter

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.310
about the National Book Festival.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.143
He asked if I had ever been to
one before, one of these, the --

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.420
the, you know, sponsored
by the Library of Congress,

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.403
Laura Bush and people like that.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.236
And I said yes, I think
I was in 2005, 2006.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.510
And he said well how does it
compare with other festivals?

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.510
[ silence ]

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.543
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: I
had nothing to say.

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.743
I mean other festivals.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.713
And he said, or large events?

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:20.950
[ laughter ]

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.700
And all I, you know,
I thought large event.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.506
I said you know, I really
haven't been to any large events.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.850
Of course I forgot the Baucheron
or however you pronounce it.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.580
And I thought well, there's
the National Book Award,

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.406
I however have never graced,
it has never seen me there.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.950
So festivals and large events.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.450
And I thought to myself,
I wonder what sort

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.430
of image people have of writers now.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.673
While I was talking to him I was
looking at the card, you know,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.170
this -- it's really a
very nice logo, okay.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:24.356
So I was sort of fooling
around with this card.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.680
And I was thinking to
myself, oh, I guess this --

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.026
this shows you how observant I am.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.180
I guess -- I guess
these are caricatures

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.156
of the writers who
are gonna be there.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.300
[ laughter ]

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.593
And thinking that, of course I
started scanning it for my face.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.970
Then we come to the
-- what is the tree?

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.883
I don't know who the tree is.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.150
Then I started looking,
and wait a minute Martha.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:04.136
He said these are famous
writers, well --

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.066
or famous characters
rather, famous characters.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.823
This is really a -- a
marvelous sort of logo.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.180
I hadn't even noticed that.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.646
I thought that -- I
thought that these --

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.126
these people back here were sort of
kneeling over a kind of watermelon.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.633
And then I realized hey, this is a
chair, and there's a girl sitting.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.486
And oh for God's sake, these
are characters in books,

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.373
and this is just about
the imagination.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.950


00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.026
So I thought -- we were talking
about festivals and events,

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.536
the sort of life the writer leads.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.640
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: I
remember one book signing,

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.656
a reader in the line said now
Mrs. Grimes I've written a book,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.210
and I'd like to get some idea
as to how I shape my career.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.320


00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.830
And I said career?

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.773
He said yes, I want to
know what to do about it.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:40.576
And I said well, you know, well --
well -- I mean, you know, here I am,

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.573
and I guess what I had is a career.

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.026
You -- you just -- you
said you've written a book.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:54.170
Well you just keep on writing books.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.680
[ laughter ]

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.480
And the sum and substance of
this is gonna be your career.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.470


00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.303
You see me -- you see me
opening this book here.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:08.446
You think I'm gonna
read, but I'm not.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.626
I'm trying to sell it.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.660
[ laughter ]

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.490
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: And
I never -- I --

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.070
I mean Mister Spencer
[phonetic] is a wonderful reader.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.550
You know, I don't like following
people like that, and trying to --

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.450
I can't -- I'm a terrible reader.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:34.633
And besides, people
think that if I'm reading

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:36.490
from a Jury book I'm gonna
do it with a British accent.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.510
[ silence ]

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:48.110
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: But this
idea of the writer's life --

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.040
oh I've sort of killed
that one I think.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.510
[ silence ]

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:02.983
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: I was gonna
say something back there

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.230
when we were talking about
the logo, about imagination.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.703
In addition to the Richard Jury
books I also write, for you people

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.170
over there on the far left side
who are not paying attention.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:23.510
[ laughter ]

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:31.240
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: You know what
I've noticed about giving talks?

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.096
At just about every talk, I'm
looking at the people here

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:41.856
on the front row, I have found there
is always one person who hates me.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.023
Now there could be many
more people who hate me,

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:49.656
but they're far more polite.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:51.790


00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:52.770
But the one who seems
to hate me the most sits

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.703
in the first row, front and center.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.706
And just I think last
week I gave this --

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.700
this talk over in Friendship
Heights for Neiman Marcus' --

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:13.436
it wasn't in Neiman Marcus, I
would have been happy to have it

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:21.130
in Neiman Marcus, or -- or move
across the street to Bloomingdales,

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:21.523
that would have been delightful.

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:26.123
But there was a gentleman
in the first row

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.516
who clearly was not interested,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.653
and who was there only
by I guess default.

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:39.486
But -- so I like to
yell you ought to smile.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:44.210
I like to look over the first
row -- oh my -- oh it's my son.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.510
[ laughter ]

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.830
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: So imagination.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:56.850
There is this series of books
besides the Richard Jury books.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:01.350
They're narrated by this 12-year
old girl Emma Gramm [phonetic].

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.456
And these books -- these books
really are not mysteries.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.006
There is a mystery in them,
they're not mysteries.

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:16.336
And I'm tired of people
sending me e-mails telling me

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:18.760
that they're really lousy mysteries.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:21.940
[ laughter ]

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.896
But the -- and this is --

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.963
if you like Emma Gramm
books, this is the next one.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:34.700
[ applause ]

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.233
Well I wasn't -- I wasn't
really looking for applause.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.013
It says advance uncorrected
proof, not for sale.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:46.770
But I figure you can either
be [inaudible] some questions,

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.843
we can have an auction.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.810
[ laughter ]

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:57.010
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Anyway, the title
of this book is Fade Away Girl.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:00.986
And for anyone who is -- I
was gonna say as old as I am,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:06.610
but that cuts out about nine-tenths
of the audience right there.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.043
Well actually even I'm
not quite that old,

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:18.503
but there was an illustrator, Coles
Phillips, who did a series of these,

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:24.246
and magazine covers, The New
Yorker, Saturday Evening Post.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.266
I love this technique.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:28.820
As you can see -- some of
you can see from this one,

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:33.700
the figure fades into
the background.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.366
And he called this
technique a fade away.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.736
So that's the next book,
now to sell my back list.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.566
The last book was Black Cat, and
-- I heard an applau [phonetic].

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:55.510
[ laughter ]

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.306
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: That's terrific.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.540
[ applause ]

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:10.986
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: I remember
when that comedian --

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.980
what is his name, he's very, very
funny -- had Tom Hanks as his guest,

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.006
and he introduced him as Tom Hank.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.740
[ laughter ]

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.740
I always -- I -- I loved that.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:26.006
So did Tom Hank, Tom liked it too.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.006
The Black Cat is the I don't know,
the twenty-second or something

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.393
that like Richard Jury novel.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.906
And I'm currently writing
another one,

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:45.160
at the same time I'm writing a
book with my son on addiction.

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:48.910
How about that?

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.970
You didn't see that coming, did you?

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:53.250
[ laughter ]

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.233
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: I remember a
book signing I had in Florida

00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:57.993
where in the front -- and again,

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:00.270
it's the front row is the
place for this sort of thing.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.583
In the front row a woman sat, this
was in a Barnes and Noble I think.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.000
And she raised her hand
to ask a question, and --

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.593
and she said, Ms. Grimes, now I
have never read one of your books.

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:25.006
Now I always figure that right out
of the gate that's not what you say.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.510
[ laughter ]

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:29.320
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: You
don't have to say anything.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.766
You don't have to say I've
read all of your books,

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:34.833
just don't say I've never read one.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.480
You don't follow it up by
saying I'm with the prison --

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.786
the prison system, and I work
particularly in addiction,

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:51.050
drug and alcohol abuse -- alcohol
of course as we know isn't a drug --

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.593
drug and alcohol abuse,
and I just have a question.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:59.996
I just -- now I notice all of
your books are named after pubs.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280


00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.740
I said yes, they are.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.503
And she said -- I couldn't
imagine where all this was going.

00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:13.733
And she said well my question
is was there any alcohol abuse

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.600
in your family?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000


00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.100
[ laughter ]

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.440
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: I said oh
yes, and you're looking at it.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640
[ laugher ]

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.020
[ applause ]

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:36.666
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Can you imagine?

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:38.600
I mean there's this one question,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.133
it's like well there is a lot more I
could say, there's also a lot less.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.700
[ laughter ]

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:53.566
So -- but I would like you to
ask questions if you want to.

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:58.530
That's usually the way it
goes, no interest whatsoever.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:00.930
[ laughter ]

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.506
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Yes.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:08.540
[ silence ]

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.130
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Scott
Spencer [inaudible] microphones

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:16.196
in the audience, I don't.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:17.620
I'm sorry.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.753
Oh, the microphones are up here.

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.260
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.526
I just wanted to know, you never
finished telling us what the man

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:26.136
in the front seat said to
you when you went to the --

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:27.926
you always said people
in the front seat.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:30.840
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Oh,
what about him?

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.706
Yeah, you knew him.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.880
You know him.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000


00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.440
[ laughter ]

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.946
&gt;&gt; It's probably my ex-husband.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000


00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.440
[ laughter ]

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:43.040
&gt;&gt; I thought maybe
he made an odd remark

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:44.573
to you, that's why I was asking.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.906
But I guess he didn't.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.440
[ laughter ]

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.440
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: I guess not.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.440
[ laughter ]

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:54.780
&gt;&gt; I'd like to ask you -- I'm sorry,

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.213
I'm over here to the --
to the -- your right.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.306
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Oh, sorry.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000


00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.220
[ laughter ]

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.983
&gt;&gt; You're a real pleasure.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.223
My question to you is what's
your process for writing?

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:09.316
I mean do you just write
anyplace, anywhere?

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:11.610
Or do you have a special
place that you write?

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.330
Do you write in the
middle of the night?

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.353
Or what's your process?

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:24.686
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Well my -- my
preferred place used to be a pub.

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:29.510
[ laughter ]

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:35.336
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: But now

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:38.936
that avenue has been closed
to me forever I guess.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.346
No, the process?

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:42.780
[ silence ]

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:48.210
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Okay, number
one I don't wait for inspiration.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:48.343
I don't wait until I want to write,

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:51.476
if that were the case you
all wouldn't be here today,

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.210
because you'd never see anything.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:56.276
I write in longhand in notebooks,
and I try and do this for three

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:57.143
or four hours a day, in
the morning if possible.

00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.543
Then I transcribe this
onto a computer.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:01.143
And I have found -- you
know, the reason I write

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:04.743
in longhand doesn't have anything to
do with well, doesn't have anything

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.010
to do with what I'm gonna say.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.810
What I've found was that when
the computer eats your work,

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:29.086
as it has been known to
do, and it was sorry --

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000


00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:11.510
[ laughter ]

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:58.406
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: -- I could go
back to notebooks and find it.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.050
And that's really -- you know,
that's really quite a boon.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:03.680
So I transcribe it on the computer,
and that's sort of the process,

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.060
if that's what you're talking about.

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.236
The things I don't do.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.960
I don't have outlines,
I don't have summaries,

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.446
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.580
I don't know

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.580
[ laughter ]

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.756
-- I don't know what the plot is,
I don't know any of that stuff.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:24.736
It's just sitting down writing.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:27.513
And that's why I say to
people you seem to think --

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:29.970
a lot of people who
haven't tried writing seem

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.950
to think -- I'm not, no.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.906
I'm sorry, I'm not.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.006
The question time is not finished.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.240
[ laughter ]

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.513
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Is
that Peter Straub?

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.720
[ laughter ]

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:46.850
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: That you really
don't have to have anything

00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.396
in advance of just
writing, I mean just sitting

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.380
down with a pen and
a piece of paper.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.120
And some people find it very
difficult to believe this,

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.726
but it's true, because that's
the way I started writing.

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.700
And I still do it that way.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.746
And it doesn't get any
easier, I'd like to point out.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:13.463
All right, I just had a 10 minute
card held up, which means I've been

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:16.713
on for 10 minutes, so that
means we've got another 25.

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.820
Yes, sir.

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:20.820
[ laughter ]

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:22.953
&gt;&gt; So with your alcohol
abuse that you mentioned

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:24.820
[ laughter ]

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:26.073
have you had a pint
in each of the pubs

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:30.366
for which you've named your books?

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:31.043
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: What
is -- what about the pub?

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:34.293
&gt;&gt; Have you had a pint
in each of the pubs

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:36.020
that you've named your books for?

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:37.886
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Until lately.

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:40.820
[ laughter ]

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.353
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: I have
been in every pub, every pub,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.400
except for The Old Contemptibles,
and there were a couple of others

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.003
that were either logistically
impossible to get to.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.586
But in -- I've been in
all of those pubs, yeah.

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:08.943
The Lamorn Wink [phonetic], and
of course all of these pubs are

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:13.370
in London, for which
unfortunately a couple of --

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:17.870
which have been changed and
modernized and so forth.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.063
I mean The Five -- no, not
The Five Bells and Blade Bone.

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:24.220
Yeah, The Five Bells and Blade Bone,

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.306
which was a really great
grotty [phonetic] pub,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.400
now is a -- what do they call it?

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.543
It's got a special
kind of designation.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.020
Gastro pub for a fern
[phonetic] bar.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.573
I haven't been into one of those
recently though, a gastro pub.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.336
But they have snakes, they
have a boa constrictor,

00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:58.696
a pet boa constrictor.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.943
That's really taking it to
another level, isn't it?

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:02.850
Yeah.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000


00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.350
[ laughter ]

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.003
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Yes, ma'am.

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:12.136
&gt;&gt; Hi. It's a real pleasure to
be here, to see you here today.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:13.936
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Thank you.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.270
&gt;&gt; I -- I love all of your books.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:17.603
And you haven't said anything
about your other series,

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.220
and I'm dying to know what's
going to happen after Dakota.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.653
Do you have anything in mind?

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:23.026
Or are you -- are you
working on another?

00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:26.413
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Which
series are you speaking of?

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.080
Because there's more than one.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.080
&gt;&gt; The -- the -- the --
the books that have --

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.013
that the last one was Dakota.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.383
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Oh,
oh yeah, oh yeah.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.563
&gt;&gt; I'm dying to know what -- what
happened to that young woman,

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:38.980
so I'm -- I'm hoping
you're working on something.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.400
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Well I
certainly -- I certainly will be.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:47.730
I have an idea for the third one.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.706
But this young woman, Andi,
for anyone who is interested

00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:01.793
in doing a complete literary
critique of all of my books,

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:04.500
I don't know if you've
noticed, a few have.

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.900
[ laughter ]

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:09.300
Indeed, it came to me as a surprise.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.900
[ laughter ]

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:16.633
Andi is another -- there was
a book called The Deer Leap,

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:21.543
in which there was a character
named Kerry Fleet [phonetic].

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:26.350
Andi is another Kerry Fleet, she's
another Nell Ryan [phonetic],

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:34.020
the young woman in
The Grave Maurice.

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.000
And I have an idea that she
also has something to do

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.846
with that mysterious girl
in the Emma Gramm books.

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:47.236
But to answer your question,

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:48.036
absolutely I intend
to write another one.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:53.903
I mean I keep turning books into
series, and it's got something to do

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.973
with not wanting to
let the characters go.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.653
My publisher is dying for
the sequel to Send Bygraves.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.600
Look -- look at that.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.333
You see? You see?

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.400
Send Bygraves is a book of poems.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:15.700
[ laughter ]

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:26.816
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Yes.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.443
&gt;&gt; First of all, your
book on addiction --

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.180
and I appreciate that because I
have been addicted to your books

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000
[ laughter ]

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.800
for absolutely decades now.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.486
And I'm pleased that you're
going to do Fade Away,

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.446
because I've been waiting
for another one

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:42.913
for that series, so that's nice.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.770
And my question though is
about the Richard Jury.

00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:49.856
During all of the books
I've tried to assess

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:51.753
about how many years actually pass
in the lives of the characters.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:54.973
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Oh yeah, yeah.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.840
&gt;&gt; And Carol Ann [phonetic]
seems to get no --

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:58.893
no older, and no less presumptuous.

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.586
So I wondered approximately how
many years are passing in the course

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:08.203
of the Richard Jury books.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.766
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Yeah, well I mean
you don't see me getting any older,

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:12.840
do you?

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:14.840
[ laughter ]

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.573
&gt;&gt; Well no, certainly not.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.573
And I saw you about nine years
old, you don't look older.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.373
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Thank
you, thank you.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.173
Yeah, this is a very good question.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:24.040
Okay, let me point something out.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.573
Many of these books, indeed
most of these books follow --

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.113
one follows very closely
after another.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.760
So the first book was published
actually in -- in 1981.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.090
Okay, in our time it is
now 2010, it is not 2010,

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:48.750
indeed the millennium hasn't
even come in -- in book time.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:53.436
As far as the characters getting
any older is concerned now, I mean,

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:01.170
you know, really why should they?

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:02.736
Why should they?

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:07.603
But this, I would say that right
now we're kind of in the --

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.950
we're in the 90s, the
1990s in these books, yeah.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:19.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:20.370
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: You're welcome.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.170
Good question.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:25.170
Yes?

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.370
&gt;&gt; Hi. As much as I look forward
to your books and your stories,

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.036
I look forward to your
characters even more.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.236
I can just see them sitting
around the pub, Melrose [phonetic]

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.103
and all the other characters.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:35.036
My question is are they
based on real people

00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:38.503
that you know, or your imagination?

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:39.660
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Oh,
how I wish they were.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.680
[ laughter ]

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.080
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Consciously,

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.280
none of the characters is
based on anyone I know.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.233
&gt;&gt; Even Melrose's aunt?

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:53.700
[ laughter ]

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:54.766
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Even Melrose?

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:57.700
&gt;&gt; Aunt.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.300
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Oh,
Agatha [phonetic].

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.700
&gt;&gt;

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:04.966
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Consciously, no.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:13.333
Uh-uh. There's always
an Agatha, isn't there?

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000


00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.700
[ laughter ]

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.100
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Okay, two minutes.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.033
That gives us 13 [inaudible] to go.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:16.033
Any other questions?

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.700
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.566
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Oh, sorry.

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:21.700
&gt;&gt; This side.

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:25.433
&gt;&gt; Hi, I just want to
say it's a pleasure.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.100
I was on bed rest with my
second child for 30 weeks,

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.300
and I started with
the first Jury novel,

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.633
and went up until I think the
nineteenth one, and read those

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:32.966
in the 30 weeks I was on bed rest.

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:35.366
So thank you for getting
me through that.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:37.700
[ laughter ]

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:38.900
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: You're welcome.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.143
&gt;&gt; My question is when you finish
one do you know what's gonna happen

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:43.123
in the next -- kind of have an idea

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.390
of what's gonna be
going on in the next?

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.656
Or is it just you finish one

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:49.906
and then you don't have any
idea of what's coming up?

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:51.693
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: I don't
even know what's going

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.453
on in the one I'm writing.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.720
[ laughter ]

00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:01.520
So any future projection is
-- that's not completely true.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:09.263
Occasionally my mind will dart
out to something or other.

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:15.130
That's about as vague
as -- as you can get.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.533
I'll -- I'll tell you one thing.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:23.410
The -- although I said, you know,

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:28.376
I don't wait for inspiration before
I write, a lot of inspiration comes

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.406
from the actual names of pubs, like
the Richard Jury book I'm trying

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.756
to work on at the moment.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.040
It's purely on the
basis of pub name.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.016
And for some reason there is --

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.816
the names have some
kind of emotional weight

00:29:50.390 --> 00:29:52.456
that I don't really understand.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.040
So some of these names I regard
as irresistible, you know,

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:57.456
I am the only running
footman [phonetic].

00:29:59.410 --> 00:30:03.010
I mean, you know, how could
you think of better titles?

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:05.753
Although people can't
remember the titles,

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:09.566
which is definitely a negative.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.553
But why am I -- why am I here
wondering what to say next?

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.200
Did I answer your question?

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.400
&gt;&gt; Yes ma'am.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.266
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Thank you.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.400
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.066
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Oh
we're into overtime.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.533
The Redskins might like
it, I don't know that --

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:36.570
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:39.170
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Right.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.303
&gt;&gt; You do so well with
the verbiage coming

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.660
out of the cockney
or whatever, English.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.206
How often -- how long do you
spend in England each year?

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:46.970
Or did you just live there some
time, and now know how to speak it?

00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:54.203
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: I don't
really know how to speak it.

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.463
I sort of absorb the
speech patterns I guess.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.600
The longest I was in England
I guess was about what,

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:09.790
four months, five months in England.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:14.286
And for the most part
it's visiting every year,

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.346
for a relatively short
period of time.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:24.446
For some reason I just sort of
-- I'm really just a sponge.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.013
I mean I just sort of --
I'm able to absorb this

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:33.953
when I can't absorb anything else,
except what I already [inaudible].

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:35.510
[ silence ]

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.363
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Anything else?

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:42.830
All right, good for you.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:44.230
:

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.096
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Thank you.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:48.730
[ applause ]

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:01.366
&gt;&gt; Martha Grimes: Thank
you very much.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:08.370
I like -- I usually like to say that
if it weren't for you all sitting

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:15.750
out there, I would not
be standing up here.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:19.306
So I think the thanks goes
in the other direction.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:20.570
Thank you.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000


00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.070
[ applause ]

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:26.356
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
