I love history,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.143
and in K-12, you take history classes,

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:13.775
and a lot of kids are bored silly in them.

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:17.287
The history I learn is whenever I go someplace,

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:19.737
I want to know what happened each decade,

00:00:19.737 --> 00:00:23.665
you know, for the last like 500 years before.

00:00:23.665 --> 00:00:27.732
And I'm passionate about trends,

00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:30.087
and what does that information about the past

00:00:30.087 --> 00:00:31.702
tell you about the future

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:36.501
and how I can be part of the future

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:37.616
and shape the future

00:00:37.616 --> 00:00:38.568
and bring people together

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:40.401
to do innovative things.

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:41.981
So, I'm passionate about knowing

00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:43.451
where things have come from

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:45.786
and helping shape where they can go.
