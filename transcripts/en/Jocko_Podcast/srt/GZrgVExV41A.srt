00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,600
This is Jocko podcast number
eight with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,490
Jocko Willink. Good
Evening Echo. Good evening.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,420
In 1952 a young marine Robert a Gannon,

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,140
arrived on shore at Incheon Korea where
he was going to be shipped north to

5
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:30,520
fight.
As they gathered to head north,

6
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,190
he saw stacks of c bags,

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,780
which is like a military duffle bag
and he saw him sitting in the rain.

8
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,450
No one had to explain what they were
doing there or why they belong to marines

9
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,700
that had been killed on the front.

10
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:50,890
Yeah,

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,890
he wrote this poem years later
about seeing those sand bag,

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,100
seeing those sea bags piled high

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,250
when clouds are gray and lowering
and fog obscures the plane.

14
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,440
I sometimes think I catch a
site of sea bags in the rain.

15
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,270
I know what is a vision
to a theorial to last,

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,830
but it brings a wisp of sadness
and a haunting of the past.

17
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,480
We'd come ashore at Inchon in
1952 and administrative landing,

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,520
just a unit passing through.

19
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,170
We mustered at the rail head lining up
to board a train when through the stormy

20
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:45,160
darkness.
I saw sea bags in the rain,

21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,090
there was no need to question why they
were lying there looking lonely and

22
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:55,310
abandoned in the damp Korean air.

23
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,010
They're owners had gone northward and
would not return again from where Hell's

24
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:06,700
of bitter battle took the
lives of fighting men.

25
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,230
Now when fog and darkness gather,

26
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:17,980
I rarely can restrain my sad and thoughts
of Incheon and see bags in the rain.

27
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:26,530
So imagine that you're a young marine who
has joined the Marine Corps and you're

28
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:33,191
fired up and you have the visions of glory
and that romantic vision in your mind

29
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,040
of what war is going to be like.

30
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,640
And you get to Korea and it's
an administrative landing.

31
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:44,960
So there's no shooting going on and
you're now you're on the ground and you're

32
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:49,961
in Korea and then you muster to go
north and go to the battlefield,

33
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,990
go to the front and you see these see
bags of all these marines that had been

34
00:02:56,841 --> 00:02:58,850
killed in combat.
And you

35
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,580
imagine what that does psychologically
to guys and obviously to a Robert

36
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,370
[inaudible], Gannon, it affects
him, affected him his whole life.

37
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,420
And he still thinks about it.
And as much of a

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,250
intense experience as that is

39
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,320
the Marine Corps has been

40
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,760
walking past those bags,
you know,

41
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:35,761
theoretically walking past those bags
for over 200 years and going forward,

42
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,420
going into the fray towards the risk
towards in many cases toward death.

43
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,160
And I'm kind of leading in with talking
about the Marine Corps tonight who I

44
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:58,630
have just absolute respect for
the United States Marine Corps.

45
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:04,110
We worked closely with them when we
were in Ramadi in 2006 mostly with the,

46
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:09,880
the three eight marines, which is the
third battalion, Eighth Marine regiment.

47
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,480
And they were there for the
bulk of the deployment with us.

48
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,970
Then they got relieved by the one six
marines who arrived towards the end of our

49
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:22,510
crews. And, but prior to that,

50
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,660
my whole career I was
working with marines.

51
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:28,450
I was did multiple shipboard
deployments with marines.

52
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,050
I did a turnover with the first MARSOC
company in Baghdad and 2004 so I know

53
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:39,940
marines well. And like I said,
they just have my absolute respect.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,230
And
as a warrior class,

55
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,640
which is what they are,
a warrior class of men and women,

56
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,060
their professionalism
and their commitment,

57
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,100
it is,
it's impeccable.

58
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,320
And because they fought,
you know,

59
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,750
in all major wars,

60
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,500
they know and understand combat very
well and therefore they know and they

61
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:15,070
understand combat leadership very well.

62
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,380
And with that we are going to look tonight
at what used to be called the f m one

63
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:31,540
tax zero and that was the
fleet marine force manual,

64
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,320
which is now called the MC WP,

65
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:40,321
the Marine Corps war fighting publications
six [inaudible] 11 and the title of

66
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:45,811
the of the document is
called leading marines.

67
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,540
And so what I did as a kind of like I
do with most of these books that we look

68
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:00,050
at,

69
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,050
I went through it and found the pieces
that struck me as highly applicable to

70
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:08,270
combat,

71
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:13,270
which makes them highly applicable to
life and to business and to the way we go

72
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,460
through this world.
Right.

73
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,690
So I've pulled some of these ideas out,
some quotes out,

74
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,090
some sections out to talk about

75
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,820
and discuss.
And here we go.

76
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,250
Imagine you are rifleman in a company
ready to assault align of enemy machine

77
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:41,190
gun bunkers.
You are lying flat on the ground,

78
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:45,810
protected further moment by a slight
rise between you and the enemy,

79
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,170
but just above your head,
the anemia,

80
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,200
the enemy's guns are throwing a visible
and audible curtain of lead which thuds

81
00:06:54,901 --> 00:06:58,980
into the trees around you, causing you
to wonder if it makes the same sound.

82
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,360
When it hits flesh,

83
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,710
you tell yourself it's impossible,

84
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,090
impossible to penetrate
that curtain of fire alive.

85
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:14,130
Yet in a moment a
sergeant's voice will boom,

86
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,920
let's go.
You can't live forever,

87
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,180
but I'll you hear now is
the clatter of machine guns,

88
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,060
the vision of dead and wounded.

89
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:28,250
You saw on the way up to the
front rises to plague you.

90
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Your belly deflates and lies flat
against your backbone and all the gallon

91
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,060
thoughts you would hope
to have at this moment

92
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,113
are gone.

93
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:45,550
You are naked and alone with the
instinct of self preservation

94
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,700
and that's what soldiers and marines face.

95
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:57,930
Not all of them,

96
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,110
but many of them and they in these
situations and situations even worse than

97
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:09,570
this,
they do decide to go forward.

98
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:15,380
They decide to go forward into
that Maelstrom of fire and of deaf

99
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,393
and

100
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,360
soldiers in warriors have done that for
thousands of years and you ask yourself,

101
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:33,490
and the purpose that they wrote that
paragraph was so that they could ask that

102
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:38,310
question why? And here's what
the Marine Corps says about it.

103
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,050
Why do individuals rush forward against
their mate? Most basic instincts,

104
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,210
why do marines take their lives in their
hands and lead a charge straight into

105
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:51,540
enemy guns in World War II?

106
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,690
What was it that made marines
clamber out of their landing,

107
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,740
landing craft into water of unknown depth
and charge into a hail of machine gun

108
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:06,050
and artillery fire not knowing whether
they would ever make it to the beach in

109
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:07,104
Vietnam?

110
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,210
What was it that made a marine take
the point and start down the dark and

111
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:17,211
misdeed jungle trail at the heart of
why Marines are able to put mission

112
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:22,341
accomplishment over concerned for their
own safety is leadership leadership.

113
00:09:24,071 --> 00:09:29,071
That is the combination of the intangible
elements of our ethos and the more

114
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:32,920
tangible elements of our
leadership philosophy.

115
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:39,530
So they're saying that this courage comes
from the leadership and from the ethos

116
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:42,870
that they live.
That is,

117
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:47,430
that is brought to the troopers
through the leadership,

118
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,710
which is a pretty profound statement.

119
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,130
It's a very profound statement and I
jumped out of this manual for a moment and

120
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:59,490
I grabbed sort of the marine corps
principles of leadership there. Key words.

121
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,900
Here they are, justice,
judgement, dependability,

122
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,880
initiative, decisiveness, tact, integrity,

123
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,080
enthusiasm, bearing on selfish, nish,

124
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,710
courage, knowledge, loyalty,

125
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,510
endurance.

126
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,960
Those are the traits that they talk
about and what I actually from that list,

127
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,030
I think they're all pretty pretty
obvious why they're on that list.

128
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,240
The one exception or I would say the one
that stands out to me a little bit as

129
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:38,280
maybe what people wouldn't
expect his tact. Yeah.

130
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,280
I didn't say tactical or tactics.

131
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:45,780
I said tact and they actually go on
to define that a little bit further.

132
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,180
The definition of tact is the ability to
deal with others in a manner that will

133
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:54,630
maintain good relations and avoid offense.

134
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,130
More simply stated,

135
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,240
tact is the ability to say and do
the right thing at the right time.

136
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,690
So obviously almost every time we sit
down at this podcast table and do our work

137
00:11:07,661 --> 00:11:08,410
here,

138
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:13,120
we end up somehow talking about the
interactions between human beings and they

139
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:17,350
actually put this as a, one of their
tenants is that you have to have tact.

140
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,010
The, the quality of
consistently treating peers,

141
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:28,780
seniors and subordinates with respect
and courtesy is a sign of maturity.

142
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,330
Tact allows commands,

143
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,490
guidance and opinions to be expressed
in a constructive and beneficial manner.

144
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:41,950
This deference must be
extended under all conditions,

145
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,260
regardless of true feelings,

146
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,070
regardless of true feelings.
They are saying you,

147
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,660
despite the fact that that person annoys
you or that you'd think you could do a

148
00:11:52,661 --> 00:11:55,870
better or all those things that
we talk about regularly here,

149
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,120
you have to have tact regardless
of your true feelings. Yeah.

150
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,040
Like, you know how you know
people, rude people, for example,

151
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,360
they'll, they'll, they'll
say stuff like, hey,

152
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,140
it was true. You know, they'll say
something that's rude or whatever,

153
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:17,350
and there'll be like, hey, I speak
the truth. If you don't like it.

154
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:22,060
Kinda that's like lack of tact. That is,
I've always, I've always thought that.

155
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,760
Were you always wondering why those people

156
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,890
aren't in leadership positions?
Yeah, for the most part,

157
00:12:29,891 --> 00:12:33,130
they don't have tact because who wants to
be around somebody that acts like this?

158
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,510
And what's interesting about it is,
you know,

159
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:37,210
one of the other words that they
have honors integrity, right?

160
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,140
And yet they're saying that, you know,
regardless of your true feelings,

161
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,650
so there's a little bit of a deck
of a dichotomy there, you know,

162
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,130
and to be the person that says, well, it's
true, so I'm just going to say it right.

163
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,630
No tact should override integrity in
dealing with people and human emotions.

164
00:12:52,631 --> 00:12:53,790
Yeah.
And it,

165
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,760
that's kind of what I've always thought
when I hear people say rude things and

166
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:00,520
be like, oh, it's okay for me to say
these kinds of the kinds of things.

167
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:03,280
Because they're true, even though a
lot of times it's just their opinion,

168
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:05,320
but they kind of,

169
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,500
it's cloaked in this like presentation
that they're just being honest,

170
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,460
you know? So, yeah. That's
interesting how it's, Oh,

171
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,190
they're saying the tact overrides
that quote unquote honesty. Yeah. Um,

172
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,580
you know, for the, for the sake of
leadership or the group or whatever. Yeah,

173
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,810
no doubt about it. Um, so
now as we get into this,

174
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,790
in what leaders,
what leaders are actually leading against.

175
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:35,290
Now of course there's an
enemy. You're right. There's
a force that's opposing you.

176
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:39,190
So you're leading against them,
but they have another word that,

177
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,020
and the word is friction.

178
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,520
And this is something for anybody that
knows anything about sort of military

179
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:50,380
science, understand, understands and
has heard the word friction before.

180
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,770
And it's a word that comes from Carl
von Clausewitz who was a great Prussian

181
00:13:56,591 --> 00:14:01,591
Dren general born in 1780 fought in the
Ryan campaigns and the Napoleonic wars

182
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,180
was a famous military theorist
and he wrote the famous book,

183
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,950
Vaughn Craig,
which means on war.

184
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,870
So that was his, that was his
sort of masterpiece that he wrote.

185
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:21,130
And it's well read by anybody
that's in the military. It has red

186
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,310
on war by crosswords.

187
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,780
So friction is a term that
he coined as far as I know,

188
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,020
it's a term that he coined.
I haven't read it prior to him.

189
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,000
And to talk about friction here
as what Clausewitz says about it.

190
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,000
And this is from onshore.
Then again,

191
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:44,140
I departed from the Marine Corps manual
here for a few minutes to go a little

192
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:49,090
bit deeper into friction.
Everything is very simple in war,

193
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:52,040
but the simplest thing is difficult.

194
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,713
Hmm.

195
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,350
These difficulties accumulate and produce
a friction, which no man can imagine.

196
00:14:59,351 --> 00:15:01,150
Exactly who has not seen war.

197
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:07,130
So when war through an influence of an
in an infinite of petty circumstances,

198
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,470
which cannot properly be described
on paper, things disappoint us.

199
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:16,350
And we shot and we fall short of the rank.

200
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,890
So this idea of friction is all the little
things that build up against you and

201
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:26,700
against what you're trying to accomplish.

202
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,400
And I love what he says next.

203
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,260
A powerful iron will
overcomes this friction.

204
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,270
It crushes the obstacles.
So your will can overcome them.

205
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,980
But there's a,
but there's a caveat,

206
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,510
but certainly the machine along with them

207
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,210
so your iron will can
smash these obstacles,

208
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,770
but it does take a toll on the will.

209
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,200
The strong will of a proud spirit stands
prominent and commanding in the middle

210
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,240
of the art of war. And we'll get
to, we'll a little bit later,

211
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,070
but right now we're
talking about friction.

212
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,290
Activity in war is movement
in a resistant medium.

213
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,910
So it's, it's, you know,

214
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,720
as opposed to doing stuff on the ground
and the air you didn't get in the water

215
00:16:18,721 --> 00:16:20,240
or you're doing it in all your,

216
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:23,130
all you're doing in something that
is slowing you down and stops you.

217
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,650
It is there for this friction
or what is so termed here,

218
00:16:28,651 --> 00:16:32,580
which makes that which appears
easy in war, difficult in reality.

219
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,990
And I will tell you,

220
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,640
in working with all kinds
of companies and businesses,

221
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,110
there's friction in every business.
There's friction, everything,

222
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,360
every goal that people
have in a business world,

223
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,570
there's friction and resistance to
trying to stop me from getting there and

224
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:56,630
obviously that just slides right over
into your life and those goals that you

225
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,600
have and you're fighting against this
friction and what is this friction?

226
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,860
This friction is everything.

227
00:17:01,861 --> 00:17:05,280
It's everything that is stopping you
from achieving your goal and in war,

228
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,330
it's what the enemy does. It's the whether
it's a lack of ammunition, it's the,

229
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,200
it's the materials that you need that
are arriving in time. It's a muddy road.

230
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,430
It's a strong, a strong wind.
It's all these little things.

231
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,700
It's the weird attitude of
your subordinates. It's the,

232
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,470
it's the mental capacity of your
leadership. It's all these things.

233
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:28,260
Create this friction that are going
to stop you from achieving your goals,

234
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:31,110
or at least it's going to try to
stop you from achieving your goals.

235
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,100
And it's the same thing when you get a
business that's trying to make something

236
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:40,560
happen. You know, when you
go to formulate a business,

237
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,930
this is not an easy process.

238
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,620
This is a challenging process and there's
a friction that comes up against you.

239
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,170
And obviously, like I said,
with your personal goals,

240
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,620
we see friction all the time. Now
the Marine Corps, here's their take.

241
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:58,770
So that was some class fits and it was
a little bit of an abridged version,

242
00:17:58,771 --> 00:18:00,630
but you know, um, uh, bridging.

243
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,970
So this one is the marine corps and
you'll notice a little bit more clarity

244
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:09,240
because it's written directly
in English by Marines. So it's,

245
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,410
it's clearer. And here's the
Marine Corps take on friction.

246
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,460
Friction dominates war.
It makes simple tasks,

247
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:24,461
hard acts constantly to tear down
the will of the individual marine and

248
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,260
interferes with unit cohesion.

249
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,400
It operates across the entire spectrum
of conflict from garrison activities to

250
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:38,870
combat from senior command elements down
to the most forward fighting position.

251
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:43,730
So the friction is everywhere. It's
everywhere. It's on the front line.

252
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:46,240
Troopers are feeling
friction. You know, the,

253
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,050
the senior command has friction that in
this day and age that friction can be

254
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,070
loss of connectivity. You know, you're
sitting there on the, on the Internet,

255
00:18:55,071 --> 00:18:58,490
when you trying to communicate with
troops that are in the field nowadays that

256
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:03,020
Internet goes down, there's friction or
your broadband cable gets stuffed up.

257
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,230
It's literally, that's friction.
Everything is friction.

258
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,150
Friction can be caused by external
factors such as physical environment,

259
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,690
the nature of the mission
or friendly or enemy action.

260
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,000
Inadequate or inaccurate intelligence
also contributes to friction by causing

261
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:20,900
uncertainty.

262
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,800
This uncertainty is sometimes called the
fog of war where things are not always

263
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:30,870
what the leader expected.
This expression,

264
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,040
this expression describes both
the literal fog created by dust,

265
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,670
smoke and debris on the battlefield.
And more importantly,

266
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,700
the mental fog of confusion
and uncertainty created by
lack of knowledge of the

267
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,870
enemy,
chaotic noise,

268
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,470
mental and physical fatigue and fear.

269
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,060
And interestingly, uh, Lafe and I,

270
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,710
the book that we wrote, extreme
ownership, the first chapter,

271
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,380
it's called the fog of war.
And it is,

272
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,710
and I talk about this fact right here.

273
00:20:04,711 --> 00:20:08,220
It was the literal fog of war because
it was burning tires in the streets,

274
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:09,450
creating suit everywhere.

275
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:14,280
And there was concrete dust
floating through the air
and smoke from machine guns

276
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,260
and and smoke from smoke grenades.

277
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,540
And so there's a literal fog
of war where you can't see.

278
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:23,160
And then on top of that you add the
theoretical fog where I didn't know where

279
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:25,260
everyone was and I wasn't
sure what was happening.

280
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:28,110
And so this fog of war is so very real

281
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,570
frictions.
Most lethal form,

282
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,500
it's most lethal form,
however

283
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,370
is self induced and maybe
termed internal friction.

284
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,930
So this again,

285
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,220
it's just incredible how
these theories of war,

286
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:56,221
parallel life and although you have these
things that are going on in your world

287
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:00,910
that are trying to stop you from
achieving your goals, [inaudible]

288
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:07,510
the most lethal force of friction is self
induced. It's what you do to yourself.

289
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,280
Fear of the unknown breeds this paralysis.

290
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,460
It is best overcome by
vigorous leadership,

291
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,160
which clearly sets out what is happening,

292
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,570
how would is happening and most
importantly why is why it is happening.

293
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,610
So again,
it is

294
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,953
almost,

295
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't know if at some point I'm going
to stop being surprised and stop being

296
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,440
shocked and stop being

297
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:45,060
stop being amazed in that
and the parallels between
a war and life and this is

298
00:21:49,691 --> 00:21:54,340
just one of them. Another one of them
to the the self induced friction.

299
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,930
Yes. I think a big one that
I've kind of noticed in,

300
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,620
I think most people have, this
is his pet peeves. You know,

301
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,650
people will have these pet
peeves about like for example,

302
00:22:05,651 --> 00:22:08,530
when people call me boss, you know, you
don't, you know, when people say, Hey,

303
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:11,690
what's up? You talked about
on the first podcast. Yeah.

304
00:22:11,691 --> 00:22:14,410
So when they some friction
with Echo Charles. Yeah.

305
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,740
And this totally self induced don't
mean anything bad by the word boss.

306
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,160
But meanwhile I'm like, I have this
little almost like check against them,

307
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,830
you know, because they referred
to me as boss or, dude,

308
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,180
I don't know why I do not actually,
you know what if a girl calls me dude,

309
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,130
it's like it's, it seems real
condescending even though
I, I figured they don't,

310
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,430
but that could jam up the relationship
and potentially jam up any kind of task

311
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,200
we have.
That can be just,

312
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,890
just one little element at a jam
you up and pet peeves in general.

313
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,720
I know it'll get in people's way. Yeah.
Pet peeves are stupid in my opinion.

314
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:54,390
So you need to correct yourself on that
one. Yeah. But there are, I mean it's,

315
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,190
we could, we could just sit here and
the rest of this podcast, could you be,

316
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:01,060
you and I coming up with the various
frictions in life, whether it's, you know,

317
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,950
wanting to sleep more, wanting to not, not
the gym isn't close enough to my house.

318
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:09,200
The, you know, it's, you've
got a million reasons. Yeah.

319
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,720
You got a million pieces of
friction. Countless. Or as they say,

320
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,650
as the Marine Corps says,
countless minor incidents,

321
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,920
the kind you can never really first see
combine to lower the general level of

322
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:28,390
performance. So that one always
fall short of the intended goal.

323
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,980
And this is very similar to
class fits here. I yearn,

324
00:23:32,981 --> 00:23:37,981
willpower can overcome this friction
it pave arises every obstacle,

325
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,850
but of course it wears
down the machine as well.

326
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,930
You can see they obviously took
that directly from Clausewitz. Okay?

327
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,820
Whatever form it takes,
because war is a human enterprise.

328
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,260
Friction will always have a psychological
as well as a physical impact.

329
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,250
So you're getting worn,
you are getting worn down by the friction.

330
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:03,020
Friction is inevitable.
Marine leaders must accept it,

331
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,980
do everything in their power to
minimize its effects and learn to fight

332
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,570
effectively in spite of it.

333
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,510
What I,

334
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,510
one of the things that I really like
about this term is that it captures

335
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:22,790
everything and it turns everything.
You know,

336
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,120
it clarifies what you're up against.

337
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:29,960
You're not just up against all these
little things. You're applicants friction.

338
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,810
And actually, uh, I was with, uh,

339
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:37,040
Joe Rogan and he talked about this book,
the war of art,

340
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,780
which I haven't read yet by Pressfield.

341
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,420
And he does the same thing, but what
does he call it? He calls it resistance.

342
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,860
And so it's the same idea. You
know, you put a name on your enemy,

343
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:50,300
you identify them,

344
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:55,301
whether it's laziness or sugar or lack
of movement or whatever that thing is.

345
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,550
That's what they do.
And,

346
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:06,290
and it allows you to identify it
and be aware of what is happening.

347
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,850
Now,
speaking of how to overcome that,

348
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:15,650
this next part of leadership here is it,
and we already mentioned it's will,

349
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,030
and it's something that I obviously
identify as extremely important

350
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,900
because it's the driver
of life.

351
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:30,380
It's the driver of your discipline
is your will to make things happen.

352
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,220
And it keeps us on the path. You know,
it keeps us on the path to victory.

353
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:39,221
And I talked about it when I was on the
Sam Harris' podcast and I also talked

354
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:45,161
about it on the history channel when
they formed the live to tell episode,

355
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:49,340
which is about Mark Lee, the first seal
killed in Iraq. And I talked about,

356
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,110
you know,
what does it take to win?

357
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:56,290
And the most important thing it
takes to win is will the will to win.

358
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,850
So the Marine Corps goes into a story
that's about will and I'm going to read

359
00:26:06,851 --> 00:26:07,684
it,

360
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:16,800
assigned to defend a three mile mountain
pass along the division's main supply

361
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:20,350
line and commanding the
only route of approach.

362
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,090
Captain Barbara took position with his
battle weary troops and before nightfall

363
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,770
had dug in and set up a defense along
the frozen snow covered hillside.

364
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:31,690
Okay.

365
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:36,690
When a force of estimated
regimental strength savagely
attacked during the night

366
00:26:36,851 --> 00:26:41,590
and flipping has heavy casualties and
finally surrounding his position following

367
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:43,890
a bitterly fought seven hour conflict.

368
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,620
Captain Barber after repulsing,

369
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:51,330
the enemy gave us [inaudible] that he
could hold if supplied by airdrops and

370
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:56,331
requested permission to stand fast after
orders were received to fight his way

371
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:58,560
back to where we're leaving force.

372
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,480
After two reinforcing units had been
driven back under fierce resistance in

373
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:05,670
attempts to reach the isolated troops.

374
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:10,080
So here was Captain Barber with his
troops there on this ridge line.

375
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,850
They hold off the enemy and then
they get told, hey, you know what?

376
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,760
Now that you've held the enemy off,
go ahead and fight back to our position.

377
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:22,740
And he says, no, no, we're not fighting
back. We're going to stay here.

378
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:27,480
We're going to hold this ground.
Although severely wounded,

379
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,020
Captain Barbara continued to
maintain personal control,

380
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:35,700
often moving up and down the lines
on a stretcher to direct defense and

381
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:40,590
consistently encourage and inspiring
his men to supreme efforts.

382
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:45,620
Despite the staggering opposition waging
desperate battle throughout five days

383
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:51,630
and six nights of repeated onslaughts
launched by fanatical aggressors,

384
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,790
he and his heroic command accounted for
approximately 1000 enemy dead in this

385
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:59,670
epic stand in bitter subzero weather.

386
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,980
And when the company was relieved,

387
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,190
only 82 of his original 220 men were
able to walk away from the position.

388
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:11,910
So valiantly defended
against in Superbowl odds,

389
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,570
his profound faith and courage,

390
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,860
great personal valor and
unwavering fortitude,

391
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,530
which is, in other words, his will.

392
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,750
We're decisive factors in the successful
withdraw of the division from the death

393
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:30,390
trap in the chosen reservoir sector.

394
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,220
That's a will. And that shows
you what will is capable of.

395
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:43,750
I mean, when you talk about
subzero temperatures, you put,

396
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:47,590
you just put people out in sub zero
temperatures for a night that we'll break.

397
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:50,950
Most people now get attacked all night

398
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,460
now stay up there for five
days and six nights. It's just,

399
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,560
it's the only thing that can win
in that battle is will human will

400
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,740
from the same battle.
Lieutenant Colonel Murray,

401
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,960
who was commanding the
fifth marines at the chosen,

402
00:29:10,961 --> 00:29:15,700
where's a var summed up what was
required of leaders. And this is, um,

403
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,370
very impactful.
When I read this,

404
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:21,730
I personally felt in a state of shock,

405
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,530
the kind of shock one gets from
some great personal tragedy.

406
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,900
The sudden loss of someone close.

407
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,080
So he gets into this bad situation.

408
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:36,280
That's what feels this guy's the commander
of all those marines in the chosen

409
00:29:36,281 --> 00:29:37,114
what reservoir.

410
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:43,430
And he gets this shock like someone
like someone's died and he feels it.

411
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,420
And then he says,
my first fight was within myself.

412
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:54,190
I had to rebuild that emptiness of spirit.

413
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,350
And you know, I get asked,
I've gotten asked on Twitter,

414
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:07,240
I've gotten some direct messages,
people that ask me about loss,

415
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,430
they've lost people
that are close to them,

416
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:13,150
whether it's guys talking about being in
combat or whether it's people that are

417
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:17,620
in civilian world and disease or
accidents has taken people from them.

418
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:22,070
And I think one of the
things that the kind of the,

419
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,880
the thing that I say to people
when they say, look, this is,

420
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,090
this is crushing me and I feel horrible
and I don't know if I'm going to be able

421
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:34,420
to get back and, and, and my
first statement is always like,

422
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,270
of course,
of course.

423
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,210
And that is normal.

424
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,740
It is normal for you to feel
that way when you lose people.

425
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,550
And you could see that this,
you know,

426
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:53,200
lieutenant colonel in combat,
he went through the same thing.

427
00:30:53,201 --> 00:30:57,100
This hardcore Badass marine had to go,
okay,

428
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:00,160
I fuel this loss and I have to rebuild.

429
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,080
I have to rebuild.
The fight was within himself.

430
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,410
And so I think that's very important
for people that are listening,

431
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,920
this podcast that are in the military.

432
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,380
You are going on the battlefield and you,
if you're in the,

433
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,680
if you're fighting long enough,
you will have casualties.

434
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,540
And that is one of the things I
know when my guys were killed,

435
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,260
I felt the same damn thing,

436
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,370
the horrible,
wretched emptiness.

437
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,543
And

438
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:42,440
I knew I had to rebuild it.

439
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:44,750
And,

440
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,750
and so reading this quote
definitely brings me back to that.

441
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:55,200
And it clarifies it when I talked to other
people about losing someone that that

442
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,230
last,
that you're feeling that emptiness,

443
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,980
that shock is normal and it's okay and
don't think that it's going to just

444
00:32:05,861 --> 00:32:08,410
disappear.
You've got to rebuild it.

445
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,410
You got to rebuild that spirit.

446
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,800
And so this manual goes on to say for
leaders to hold units together under

447
00:32:21,711 --> 00:32:23,210
adverse conditions,

448
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:28,360
they first must fight and win
the battle within themselves

449
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,010
and that's not me talking.
That is this manual talking.

450
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,790
That is the Marine Corps
talking about leading marines.

451
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,000
They know that there's a
battle going on within you,

452
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,460
that there's a battle you
got to fight every day,

453
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,850
that there's a spirit that's got to
be rebuilt when it's broken down.

454
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,140
This is what combat is. This is what
war is and this is what life is.

455
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,300
It goes on to talk about the
difference between peace,

456
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,300
time and combat.

457
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,780
Leading in combat is vastly
different from leading in peacetime.

458
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,340
Anybody can give orders and have them
obeyed at a peacetime poster station

459
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,210
there nothing blocks the way to obedience.
The Brig,

460
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:22,330
meaning jail pay reductions in demotion
may be all the incentive necessary to

461
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:24,290
instill good order and discipline,

462
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,563
but

463
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:32,700
execution of orders in combat may
mean an immediate danger or even the

464
00:33:32,701 --> 00:33:35,910
likelihood of getting killed.
The Marines,

465
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:40,980
the marine needs to know why an order
is given and how it is to be executed.

466
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,450
We talk about this all the time,

467
00:33:42,451 --> 00:33:44,700
people got to know why they're
doing what they're doing.

468
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,770
And I'll tell you the first section of
that, the marines don't lead like that.

469
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,330
The Marines don't go around saying,
Hey,

470
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,690
you will do this or I'll send you to the
brig or I'll give you pay reductions or

471
00:33:53,691 --> 00:33:56,900
demotions. That's that. That's
not how leadership works.

472
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,880
And it's not that way in the Marine Corps.
Of course,

473
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:03,080
those are there if you need them.
But you don't want to lead like that.

474
00:34:03,081 --> 00:34:05,520
You don't want to lead with beatings.
Yeah.

475
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,330
Above all,

476
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:14,340
marines need to feel that the leader
giving the order knows what he or she is

477
00:34:14,341 --> 00:34:15,174
about.

478
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,460
Even given the best trainings,

479
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,330
how marines perform will depend
on the kind of leadership they had

480
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,870
by the example. And courage demonstrated
by their leader. Napoleon said,

481
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,350
there are no bad regimens,
only bad kernels,

482
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,080
which is very interesting.

483
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,060
And it's a very common statement
that Napoleon said. And uh, you know,

484
00:34:41,061 --> 00:34:43,520
we've talked where we've done the,
the about face on this,

485
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:47,960
cause David Hackworth says there's
no bad units, only bad officers,

486
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,370
and then lay off. And I and extreme
ownership. We have, there's no bad teams,

487
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:55,760
only bad leaders and they always
say there's no bad students.

488
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:56,900
There's only bad teachers.

489
00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:59,360
So there's no bad students who
was only in bed instructors.

490
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,640
That's like the thing,
right is the same thing.

491
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,940
It's the same thing and you know from
Napoleon to Hackworth to Lafe and I saying

492
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:10,400
that, uh, what the Marine
Corps is saying here,

493
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:13,730
a unit led by an able
and aggressive leader,

494
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:18,800
aggressive leader who commands respect
because he sets the example and

495
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:23,801
demonstrated courage and confidence
will perform any task asked of them.

496
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,573
Okay?

497
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:31,510
Not some tasks, not most of
the tasks, not the easy tasks.

498
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,620
Any task.

499
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,553
Okay.

500
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:39,300
Aggressive leader who commands respect
because set the example and demonstrated

501
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:43,470
courage and confidence will
perform any tasks asked of them.

502
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,660
That's what leadership is about.

503
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,223
Okay?

504
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,160
Now we get into the moral challenge.

505
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:59,630
Armies of superior numbers have been put
to flight before one man out of 10 is

506
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:05,220
fallen.
They were not beaten by blows,

507
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,850
which became more than flesh could bear.

508
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,990
They were beaten in
spirit according to laws,

509
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,910
as old as the human heart,

510
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:20,780
and the victor is the one who can best
apply those laws so you can have a great,

511
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,750
huge force,
a much bigger force,

512
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:28,110
and they can break before anyone's even
been killed or one of only a few people

513
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:30,360
have been killed because
their spirit is broken.

514
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,730
When people conduct lives built on high
moral standards and physical fitness,

515
00:36:38,731 --> 00:36:43,050
they tend to develop qualities
that produce inspired
leadership and discipline.

516
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:48,690
It is not a new notion. It can be found
in any great military force in the past.

517
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,120
Gaining moral ascendancy requires that
subordinates feel that their leaders

518
00:36:54,121 --> 00:36:55,980
genuinely care for them,

519
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,590
that they are fighting for a worthy cause
and ensuring that their sacrifices are

520
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:02,580
not made in vain.

521
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,290
I talk about that one regularly.

522
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,590
You're your people have got to know that.

523
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:14,910
You cannot think that you care about them.

524
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,320
They got to know that you care about him.
That's what leadership is.

525
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,650
You're leading this group because
you care about this group.

526
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:31,370
Acting as a buffer to protect subordinates
is a key responsibility of any

527
00:37:31,371 --> 00:37:35,180
leader.
Leaders must avoid passing the buck.

528
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:40,730
Leaders must, if necessary, act from
the courage of their own convictions.

529
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,840
Even when such a position runs
counter to the policy of seniors.

530
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:50,330
We talked about that last time.
Remember Napoleon said that if,

531
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,450
if you're following my orders and
you get a bunch of guys killed,

532
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,690
it's your fault, your car, you're
culpable if it was a bad plan, right?

533
00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:00,410
If you listen, if you will bade
my bad order, it's your fault.

534
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,870
It's the same thing
that's being said here.

535
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:06,800
Even when a position runs
counter to the policy of seniors,

536
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,950
leaders must always accept full
responsibility for their actions.

537
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,450
Hello, extreme extreme ownership, right?

538
00:38:17,451 --> 00:38:21,500
They're leaders must always accept full
responsibility for actions for their

539
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:24,920
actions and like you said, extreme
ownership. That's what our books about.

540
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:26,540
Trying to make that

541
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:33,790
at the utmost level of responsibility
is to own everything that's happening

542
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:38,620
regardless of who's at fault,
who might be at fault,

543
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:42,340
what other factors were in play, doesn't
matter. Take ownership of it all.

544
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,940
Now we get into physical challenge.

545
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,663
Okay?

546
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,050
Physical demands of battle
encompass more than being fit.

547
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,730
And these demands influence
both the leader and the lead,

548
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,370
the effects of sleep deprivation,
poor diet, poor hygiene.

549
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,520
And most importantly fear have to be
understood and be a part of everyday

550
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,240
training.
No one is immune to fatigue.

551
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,930
As marines become increasingly tired,

552
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,760
they may lose the ability to make rapid
decisions and are susceptible to being

553
00:39:24,761 --> 00:39:29,260
confused,
disoriented and ultimately ineffective.

554
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:35,350
Guts and pride are not a
substitute for fitness.

555
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,080
And one,

556
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:43,120
one place where that becomes completely
evident is in mixed martial arts where

557
00:39:44,501 --> 00:39:48,610
you get guys, they got a lot of
guts and they got a lot of pride,

558
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,100
but a,

559
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:56,101
you think all this person's never going
to tap in once they get broken down and

560
00:39:56,951 --> 00:39:59,610
fatigue sets in, you know, uh,

561
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,290
fatigue makes cowards of us all right.

562
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:07,090
It's not a substitute. So guts and
pride are not a substitute for fitness.

563
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:11,410
There are good augment to fitness, but
they don't take the place of it. Yeah.

564
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:16,780
A leader relying on guts and pride will
not be able to fully concentrate on the

565
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:18,250
mission or the task at hand.

566
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:23,830
Exact limits of endurance
cannot be determined,

567
00:40:24,010 --> 00:40:27,940
but physical conditioning is one method
of reducing the effects of physical

568
00:40:27,941 --> 00:40:28,774
exertion.

569
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,160
And it can increase individual
self confidence and reduce stress.

570
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:37,930
So I always tell people to work out,
that's why you got to get up and go.

571
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,690
Because it increases individual
self confidence. It reduces stress.

572
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,670
I'm produces the effect of
fizzle desertion it's just good.

573
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,440
So many benefits.

574
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,441
Yeah.
And that's the,

575
00:40:51,441 --> 00:40:56,441
I think the most important is that
it reduces the via effects later.

576
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,740
So you know, if you're in
shape, your heart strong year,

577
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,940
your mind is strong because you've
worked out your whole life or,

578
00:41:07,491 --> 00:41:11,570
or just you're just into fitness. You,
you perform. There was this, Oh man,

579
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:16,571
I heard this thing where it was an article
or I read where it said why exercise

580
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,750
is the most important part of business.
And um,

581
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,000
and the whole thing was,
you know, it said a lot,

582
00:41:23,001 --> 00:41:24,680
but the whole thing was exercises.

583
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:28,310
The only thing that affects every other
part of your life, the only thing.

584
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,460
So you can have all these
other traits and you know,

585
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,580
and sure they might affect one thing.
Most things don't affect anything.

586
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:36,770
They just affect that one thing.
Like if you have money,

587
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:39,160
you go okay of money and
that affects like Xyz,

588
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:42,110
but exercise will affect
your ability to make money.

589
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,220
It will affect your relationship,
it will affect,

590
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:48,260
it will affect everything and it's the
one thing that does break out your jump

591
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:53,200
rope. People get out. She kettlebells
time to get it on. Yeah. That's why.

592
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,110
That's why if you're ever,

593
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:59,111
if you ever get in a relationship
where the girl's like,

594
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:00,531
oh,

595
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:05,531
you know you put the gym or
Jujitsu or something before me,

596
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,170
that's a red flag. Red Flag, red flag.

597
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,860
I'm not saying break up with them saying
that's a red flag. It is a warning. Yes,

598
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:17,150
it is a warning. It's some friction
at some friction. Friction.

599
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,130
The physical development back to the book
of the physical development of marine

600
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:25,860
leaders must include
dealing with the nature,

601
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:28,920
natural fear of interpersonal violence,

602
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:32,850
which contributes significantly
to the fog and friction of combat

603
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,520
dealing with the fear of
interpersonal violence.

604
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:43,850
So I talked about this with Sam Harris
and that is if you're one of the worst

605
00:42:46,831 --> 00:42:50,820
things that happens when somebody
gets assaulted, if they've never been,

606
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:55,170
had somebody on them grinding on them
before in grabbing them and holding them

607
00:42:55,171 --> 00:42:58,260
and smashing them,
they've never had that feeling before.

608
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,030
They're already way behind.

609
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:02,520
They're way behind because
they're just not used to it.

610
00:43:02,521 --> 00:43:03,780
It's completely new to them.

611
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:09,320
Whereas obviously someone that trains in
martial arts like Jujitsu where you're

612
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:13,920
getting ground on and people are
smashing you and you're used to it,

613
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,050
it's part of your deal.
It's part of your life

614
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,070
and you,
and you've been in actual firefights.

615
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,690
But that's why getting,

616
00:43:22,691 --> 00:43:26,590
getting some sort of a gun tranq gun
training or firearms training is good

617
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,740
because if you've never shot
a gun before and you fire it,

618
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,640
you don't watch the movies and stuff does
not prepare you for how loud that is.

619
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:38,590
And then like just the, just the impact
on your whole, your whole thing. You know,

620
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:42,580
when, when you fired guns. So if that were
to happen in some stressful situations,

621
00:43:42,581 --> 00:43:45,970
someone attacks you or someone fires a
gun in your presence and it's, you know,

622
00:43:45,971 --> 00:43:46,804
this commotion,

623
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:52,050
just dealing with the fact that a gun
was fired alone is like this huge battle

624
00:43:52,271 --> 00:43:55,150
that you have to, they, you
essentially lost. Cause you're not,

625
00:43:55,151 --> 00:43:57,220
you're just not used to
it. That's a hit. You know,

626
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:59,800
you need to inoculate yourself
to these situations. Yeah.

627
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,770
And we will actually be talking about
that a little later tonight, Tim and

628
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:10,270
units and their leaders that do not
have the mental and physical strength to

629
00:44:10,551 --> 00:44:14,960
overcome fear will not be able to fight
effectively and overcome friction.

630
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:20,450
In fact, one of the greatest sources
of friction is physical exertion.

631
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,290
And it may be required of individuals,

632
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:28,910
units or both. And again,
the physical exertion thing,

633
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:32,490
you know,
we do at the gym,

634
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,620
we do Shark Tank,
right?

635
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,260
So guys got a fight coming up or a
guy's got a tournament coming up.

636
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:40,260
And so we put them in the middle and
they're getting fresh guys, you know,

637
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,840
every two minutes, one
minute, sometimes for minutes,

638
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:45,540
sometimes five minutes depending
on what they're going into.

639
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:51,260
But you can watch and see a total
destroyer of a guy after they reach that

640
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:57,780
breaking point, just get
mopped up. And again,

641
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:00,540
we're taking them there for a reason.
You know, we're taking them there.

642
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:05,340
So they do have to rely on their technique
and so they do get conditioned and

643
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:09,870
inoculated against that breaking point.
So they learn how to dig even deeper.

644
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,610
Yeah.
But you can get anyone there.

645
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:16,170
I mean you can get any so
physically exhausted that
they're no longer capable of

646
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,070
doing.

647
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:20,530
Even a slight percentage of what they
would normally be capable of [inaudible]

648
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:25,230
so you have to maintain that conditioning
at the highest level all the time that

649
00:45:25,231 --> 00:45:25,950
you can.

650
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:29,010
And that's like the,
I mean really like you're saying it's,

651
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,000
it's not just the physical
and physical conditioning,

652
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,460
your conditioning them to the situation.

653
00:45:35,461 --> 00:45:38,820
Like how you said when they're beyond
their physical kind of breaking point

654
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,200
where they don't have
all their strength date,

655
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:46,470
the point where you feel like
stopping going beyond that point,

656
00:45:46,471 --> 00:45:50,310
if you rarely or never been beyond
that point, once you get there, you're,

657
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,610
you're completely done. Yeah. You once you
realize that you can push through that.

658
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,080
Yeah. That there was a little more
than you think there is. Yeah.

659
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,180
Conditioned to it and you're ready for it.
Yeah.

660
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:05,460
The gain in moral force deriving from
all forms of physical training is an

661
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,820
unconscious gain. Yeah. I actually think
it's not just an unconscious thing.

662
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:15,340
I think it's a conscious game too. I think
when I get, when I train, I feel better.

663
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,340
I feel stronger.
I feel sharper.

664
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,440
Willpower,
determination,

665
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,560
mental poise and muscle control arm
all march hand in hand with the general

666
00:46:30,161 --> 00:46:33,130
health and wellbeing of the individual.

667
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:36,250
So again,

668
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:41,251
according to the Marine Corps that
this physical training increases your

669
00:46:41,471 --> 00:46:45,730
willpower, your determination, your
mental poise, your muscle control.

670
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:48,640
Clearly,
as you stated earlier,

671
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:52,090
physical training is
important across the board.

672
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,830
Establishing and maintaining standards.

673
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,680
Maintaining this attitude and standard
of excellence is a responsibility not

674
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:09,660
limited to officer's staff,

675
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:13,140
noncommissioned officers or
noncommissioned officers.

676
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,650
It is the responsibility of all marines.

677
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,920
That's the attitude you want to have
with your team, with your company,

678
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:22,880
with your business.

679
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:27,500
That that attitude of excellence and
maintaining the standard of excellence

680
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:31,600
isn't responsibility. Just the leadership.
It's the responsibility of everyone.

681
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,300
Leadership in the long run depends
upon the example set by the leader,

682
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:42,640
not only as a war fighter,
but also as a citizen and a human being.

683
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:49,200
So the leader has to display a high level

684
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,020
of [inaudible].

685
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,380
I'm not sure what the right word is,
a high level of bearing,

686
00:47:57,381 --> 00:48:00,980
a high level of presence in all
situations, not just as a marine,

687
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:02,030
but in all levels.

688
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:09,290
Setting a personal example requires
high moral standards, reflecting virtue,

689
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,030
honor,
patriotism,

690
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:15,140
and subordination and personal
behavior and in performance,

691
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:19,490
these inner qualities that mark leaders,

692
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,640
these are the inner qualities that mark
leaders rather than outward marks of

693
00:48:24,741 --> 00:48:25,730
greatness.

694
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:30,410
They are often deeply
buried and in many cases,

695
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:35,480
one must look closely to see an
individual's inner strengths. So you're,

696
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,480
you're not always going to see is
not always the guy beating his chest.

697
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:43,550
That's the, the best leader.
And has an example of that here.

698
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:50,140
Major General John a lazoon
describe medal of honor recipients.

699
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:54,500
Sergeant Major John h quick perhaps
of all the marines I ever knew,

700
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:59,120
quick approached, more nearly the
perfect type of noncommissioned officer.

701
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:03,500
I'll calm, forceful, intelligent, loyal,

702
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:08,570
and courageous man. He was, I
never knew him to raise his voice,

703
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:09,950
loses temper,

704
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:15,130
used profane language and yet he
exacted and obtained prompt and explicit

705
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:20,510
obedience from all persons
subject to his orders,

706
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:28,440
the image of the marine barking orders.

707
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,260
You have to balance that.

708
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:37,110
You have to balance that
with the reality of the,

709
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,480
the example just given made
sergeant major John h quick.

710
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:46,130
In the Marine Corps,

711
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:51,310
we are trained to endure combat violence
and death along with other less arduous

712
00:49:53,811 --> 00:49:56,210
situations in both peace and war.

713
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,650
Simply because we bear arms
and wheeled awesome power.

714
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:06,800
We do not have limitless authority
to unleash it without do requirement.

715
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,360
We may not say as one
enemy commander said,

716
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:15,860
kill all, burn all, destroy all.

717
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:19,783
So again,

718
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:24,820
the image and the stereotype of a marine
or of a American soldier has to be

719
00:50:28,221 --> 00:50:31,430
balanced with the facts
of who they really are.

720
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,210
And that is that they are trained,

721
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:42,270
that they don't have limitless of 40
to unleash the awesome power without do

722
00:50:45,161 --> 00:50:47,860
requirement.
Now,

723
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,130
of course we,

724
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:56,220
these are human beings and
there are military people
in the Marine Corps and the

725
00:50:57,761 --> 00:51:02,350
army in the seal teams in special
operations that go over the line.

726
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,140
And that's something that gets dealt with.

727
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:09,970
So I'm not sitting here
claiming that this is a,

728
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,520
you know,
a perfect situation,

729
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:18,060
but I am giving you the ideal that the
Marine Corps itself sets out upon it's

730
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:21,880
marines of what it wants
their marines to be like. Hmm.

731
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:30,820
And a good, we, we, uh, actually used
to say this in the seal teams as well.

732
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,640
And this is how do you figure out
when something is like, you know,

733
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:35,410
the right thing to do,
do the right thing.

734
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:40,300
Because sometimes doing the right thing
is opposed to what you're being ordered

735
00:51:40,301 --> 00:51:41,590
to do or what the rules are.

736
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:47,770
If you are prepared to talk about your
actions or lack thereof in front of a

737
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:51,580
national audience made up
of all your seniors, peers,

738
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:55,900
subordinates and friends who share
the same professional values and whose

739
00:51:55,901 --> 00:51:57,100
opinions you value,

740
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,990
then your behavior was or is
probably ethical in nature.

741
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:05,140
So when you're doing something, if you
say, okay, I'm going to go on you know,

742
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:10,180
Cable News tomorrow and I'm
going to debrief everybody
what I did and if you can

743
00:52:10,181 --> 00:52:11,260
be proud of it,

744
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:15,970
then it was ethical and if you're going
to be hanging your head low then it

745
00:52:15,971 --> 00:52:18,610
wasn't a good decision.
You weren't doing the right thing.

746
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:24,450
And that is definitely something that I
use to guide my judgment and cause the,

747
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:25,623
again,
the,

748
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,870
the rules are not always what they
should be and what are the rules.

749
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:35,190
They don't fit over the
situation that you're in.

750
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:40,060
Laura is a dynamic thing and so sometimes
the rules that have been put in place

751
00:52:40,061 --> 00:52:44,500
for one region, they don't
work in the region urine.
And so you have to say, okay,

752
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:48,850
do you know what by the book they could,
they could burn me on this one,

753
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:53,320
but I can look whoever's
charging me and say,

754
00:52:53,321 --> 00:52:57,550
this is what I did and this is why I did
it. And if you want to send me to the,

755
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:01,720
to Leavenworth for that,
get out the handcuffs and let's go.

756
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,223
Hmm.

757
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,780
Well, this is a powerful,
this is a powerful uh,

758
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:12,780
paragraph I'm about to read and
it's actually, if you listened to

759
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,350
the podcast that I did with Sam Harris,
this is just a,

760
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,780
this is a little bit of a different
spin on bravery and on courage.

761
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:23,343
Okay.

762
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:26,370
Courage can be misunderstood.

763
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:32,160
It is more than the ability to
overcome the jitters to quell fear,

764
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,110
to conquer the desire to run.

765
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,060
It is the ability to know what
is or is not to be feared.

766
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:45,080
And infantry chart an infantry
men charging a bunker is
not hampered by the fear

767
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:48,870
that he might be struck down a
few paces from his fighting hole.

768
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,510
A pilot is not afraid of losing
all hydraulic power in his haircut,

769
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,470
in his aircraft.

770
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,670
They are both prepared for those outcomes.

771
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:05,160
A marine in battle fears
disgracing himself by running.

772
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,690
He fears not losing his life,
but losing his honor.

773
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,440
He may not be able to preserve his life,

774
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:18,950
but he can always preserve his honor
that much is within his power to fear

775
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:26,280
disgrace, but not deaf to fear, not duty,

776
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:31,230
but dereliction from duty.
This is courage.

777
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:39,210
The truly courageous do not live
in anxiety from morning to night.

778
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:43,930
They are calm because
they know who they are.

779
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:57,150
In that last two sentences
about the truly courageous,

780
00:54:57,151 --> 00:54:59,610
do not live in anxiety
from morning to night.

781
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:03,090
They are calm because
they know who they are

782
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:08,640
in. I definitely, when
I hear that statement,

783
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:11,610
I think about the guys that I
know that we're truly courageous

784
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:13,973
and

785
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,910
how they did have that

786
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:25,790
almost peaceful attitude of acceptance
because they knew who they were and they

787
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,980
knew what they would do if the moment came

788
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,273
for them.

789
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,940
Another type of more kind of overt
courage here from Major Jim Crow,

790
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,360
former enlisted man, marine
gunner, distinguished rifleman.

791
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:51,540
Star football player
was a tower of strength.

792
00:55:51,541 --> 00:55:54,240
Throughout the battle is trademark.

793
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,860
Red Mustache bristling a combat
shotgun cradled in his arms.

794
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,410
He exuded confidence and professionalism.

795
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,590
Quality sorely needed on that long day,

796
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,450
CHRO ordered the Coxson
of his landing craft,

797
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,770
put this goddamn boat in the boat,
hit the reef at high speeds,

798
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:16,590
sending the marine sprawling
quickly recovering.

799
00:56:17,310 --> 00:56:19,350
Cro ordered his men over the sides,

800
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:23,040
then led them through several hundred
yards of shallow water reaching the shore

801
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:25,660
intact.
Only four minutes behind the last wave,

802
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:30,940
CHRO clenching a cigar in his teeth
and standing upright. Groundling.

803
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:31,774
It is men.

804
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:33,933
Look,

805
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:38,490
the sons of bitches can't hit me. Why do
you think they can hit you? Get moving.

806
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:42,990
Go Red Beach through you
was in capable hands,

807
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,900
kind of a larger than life,

808
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,860
a larger than life image

809
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,140
of courage.

810
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,370
Adaptability,

811
00:57:00,510 --> 00:57:05,430
adaptability has long been our key to
overcoming the effects of friction and its

812
00:57:05,431 --> 00:57:09,360
components. Although it is
synonymous with flexibility,

813
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:12,990
adaptability also embraces
the spirit of innovation.

814
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,770
Marines constantly seek
to adapt new tactics,

815
00:57:16,771 --> 00:57:20,760
organization and procedures to
the realities of the environment.

816
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:26,390
Deficiencies and existing practices
are identified, outdated structure,

817
00:57:26,391 --> 00:57:31,391
discarded and modifications made
to maintain function and utility.

818
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,040
That's a little something you
might want to do in your life.

819
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:40,290
Deficiencies in existing practices
are identified, outdated structure,

820
00:57:40,430 --> 00:57:45,430
discarded and modifications made
to maintain function and utility.

821
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:49,590
Yes,
go ahead and note to self.

822
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:56,340
The ability to adapt enables marines
to be comfortable within an environment

823
00:57:56,370 --> 00:58:00,780
dominated by friction
and we just talked about innovation.

824
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:05,340
Innovation has always been a key component
of marine corps tradition and our

825
00:58:05,341 --> 00:58:07,530
style of leadership.
It isn't.

826
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:12,590
It has come naturally because our
combatant function was and is unique.

827
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,980
Innovation requires that leaders
listen to their subordinates.

828
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,510
I'm going to say that again.

829
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:25,910
Innovation requires that leaders listen
to their subordinates and that a two way

830
00:58:25,911 --> 00:58:29,810
system of communication has
maintained. Corporals, sergeants,

831
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,840
captains and generals all
have responsibility to be
innovators as everybody in

832
00:58:35,811 --> 00:58:39,470
your chain of command has a
responsibility to be innovational

833
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:45,250
because innovation is imprecise
and because subordinates,

834
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,570
especially junior one's a, we'll
make mistakes, protect them.

835
00:58:51,010 --> 00:58:54,700
Zero defects are not a
standard of measurement.

836
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,360
They do not encourage initiative.
They stifle it.

837
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:03,940
So your junior folks and some of your
junior leadership and maybe some of your

838
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:04,774
senior leadership,

839
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,950
they're going to make some mistakes and
you've got to protect him and encourage

840
00:59:08,951 --> 00:59:12,040
him to continue on to
try to be innovative.

841
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,580
If we wished to think clearly,
if you wish to free your mind,

842
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:22,220
if you wish to think clearly,
we must cease imitating.

843
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:27,560
If we wish to cease imitating, we
must make use of our imagination. Now,

844
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:31,610
how often is it that you see a
marine in his dress service dress,

845
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:35,720
blue uniform looking like
a statue of perfection?

846
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:40,730
How often is it you think that their
manual tells them that they have to make

847
00:59:40,731 --> 00:59:44,900
use of their imagination? Yeah.
People don't get that image,

848
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:47,570
and I've said this before
and I'll say it again,

849
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:51,230
combat is an absolute
exercise and creativity.

850
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:52,910
That's what it is.

851
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:56,710
And you've got to use your imagination.

852
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:03,690
We must train ourselves for the unexpected
in place of training others for the,

853
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,420
for the cut and dried

854
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:14,040
audacity and not caution must be
our watchword got take some risks.

855
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:20,170
Got To take some risks.
Now here's a term

856
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:25,570
that I just like. As a matter of
fact, I'm going to use the l word.

857
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,770
I love this term.

858
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,790
The term is fighting power.

859
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:37,710
Fighting power is an organization's
ability to conduct combat operations by

860
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,880
overcoming challenges to lead,

861
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,940
compete and prevail on the battlefield.

862
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:47,890
Fighting power rests on mental,

863
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:53,070
intellectual and organizational
foundations in its manifestations in one

864
01:00:53,711 --> 01:00:57,640
combination or another.
Our discipline and cohesion,

865
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,390
morale and initiative,
courage and toughness,

866
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:06,660
the willingness to fight and the
readiness if necessary to die.

867
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:15,520
Fighting power in brief is defined as
the sum total of mental and physical

868
01:01:17,031 --> 01:01:21,710
qualities that make armies fight.
And you know what?

869
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:25,430
I just added something in there because
it actually says mental qualities that

870
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,181
make armies fight.

871
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:29,690
And I'm adding mental and physical
qualities cause we've talked about the

872
01:01:29,691 --> 01:01:32,450
physical qualities and
how important it is.

873
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,480
Fighting power in brief is defined as
the sum total of mental and physical

874
01:01:38,481 --> 01:01:41,870
qualities that make army fight,
make armies fight in.

875
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,360
What I like about this
idea of fighting power

876
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:51,280
is what can you do to improve
your fighting power today?

877
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,820
What can you do?
Is what you're doing helpful?

878
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:57,440
Are you moving it forward?

879
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:01,550
Are you increasing your fighting
power or are you decreasing it?

880
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:05,850
Are you going backwards?
That's the real question here.

881
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:06,783
Hmm.

882
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:13,450
And I think that when you realize that
what you do in your life is either doing

883
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:15,980
one or two things,

884
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:20,100
it's either increasing your fighting
power or it's your fighting power.

885
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:23,160
Cause if you're staying stagnant,
you're, you're basically going backwards.

886
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,410
And here's a little wrap up.

887
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:38,170
Here's the, uh, leadership principles.

888
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:41,620
Be Technically and tactically proficient.

889
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:47,140
Know yourself and seek self improvement.
Boom.

890
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:50,890
No your marines and look
out for their welfare.

891
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:53,030
Yeah.

892
01:02:53,030 --> 01:02:57,590
Keep your marines informed.
Set the example.

893
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:03,680
Ensure the task is understood,
supervised and accomplished.

894
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:08,340
Train your Marines as a team.

895
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:09,460
Okay.

896
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:12,160
Make sound and timely decisions.

897
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:17,800
Develop a sense of responsibility
among your subordinates.

898
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,290
Little decentralized command.

899
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:24,790
Employ your unit in accordance
with its capabilities.

900
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:31,500
Seek responsibility and take
responsibility for your actions.

901
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,760
Once again,
ownership.

902
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:36,930
And I like the seek responsibility and
a little little seal sale saying that we

903
01:03:36,931 --> 01:03:41,160
used to have was a look for work.
So if there's nothing going on,

904
01:03:41,161 --> 01:03:42,330
look for work man.
You know,

905
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:44,910
say you see a new guy standing
there not knowing what to do. Hey,

906
01:03:44,911 --> 01:03:48,540
go look for work means go pickup
security position, go help move bodies,

907
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:51,660
go do something, make something
happen, seek responsibility.

908
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:55,620
And this last statement

909
01:03:57,430 --> 01:04:02,430
is just a note to remind everybody
of the troopers on the front lines.

910
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:06,370
Throughout history,

911
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:13,100
the time always comes in battle
when the decisions of statesman,

912
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:16,460
end of generals can no
longer affect the issue.

913
01:04:17,030 --> 01:04:21,110
And when it's not the power of our
national wealth to change the balance

914
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:21,980
decisively,

915
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:26,290
victory is never achieved
prior to that point.

916
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,280
It can only be one after the battle has
been delivered into the hands of men who

917
01:04:33,221 --> 01:04:36,430
move in.
Imminent danger of death.

918
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,260
And that's SLA Marshall.

919
01:04:41,090 --> 01:04:41,923
Okay,

920
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,370
the folks on the front lines.

921
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:50,970
So for everyone out there that's
listening to this podcast,

922
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,340
that's all on the front lines right now.

923
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:59,040
I salute you all.
Let's get to the questions.

924
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:03,660
All right.
Okay.

925
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:07,110
First question from narco 31 11

926
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:08,873
okay.

927
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,010
Will you guys cover injury
recovery and the mentality,

928
01:05:13,011 --> 01:05:17,980
the quick recovery and
advice, how to find physical

929
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,850
limit without injury?
Okay,

930
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:24,790
so for this one,

931
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:29,130
well first of all,

932
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,940
train hard but always trained smart,
you know,

933
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
don't do things that are going to
hurt you and this is a balance.

934
01:05:39,221 --> 01:05:40,510
Just like everything else,

935
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:43,990
you have to push yourself hard
enough that you get stronger,

936
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:47,590
but at the same time you can't push
yourself so hard that you get injured.

937
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:52,060
So I think that's one of the keys.

938
01:05:52,061 --> 01:05:55,360
I'll another key is making
sure you take adequate rest,

939
01:05:55,990 --> 01:06:00,010
which of course I'm usually
guilty of not doing.

940
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,710
That being said, when you see
me training every day, I'm not,

941
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:10,570
you know,
I'm not going 110% every day.

942
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:14,340
There's some days where I roll into the
gym and I say, yeah, okay, this is not,

943
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:17,770
this is not a day to push myself on
the injury. Prone today, you know,

944
01:06:17,771 --> 01:06:22,540
and so I will tape or my workout and
I'll usually do some other kind of

945
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:23,374
intensity.

946
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:27,550
But let's say I'm not going to lift
heavy weights or I'm not going to sprint

947
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:30,250
because I'm feeling tight and I don't
want to pull muscles. So you just,

948
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,830
you got to listen to
what your body is saying.

949
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,490
Another thing that I think is
important about it is, you know,

950
01:06:36,491 --> 01:06:39,080
we talked about on the last podcast is,
you know,

951
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:43,230
changing your goals and constantly
chasing after different goals. You know,

952
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:48,270
we were going for a dead lift and then
you're going for a mile time run and then

953
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:49,810
you're going for number
of pull ups into your,

954
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,700
you're constantly kind of changing those.

955
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:57,030
And I think that is a good way to avoid
injury because you're not just hammering

956
01:06:57,401 --> 01:07:01,390
the same thing over and over and over
again, which I think leads to injury.

957
01:07:01,391 --> 01:07:02,680
Now that being said,

958
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:08,890
you don't ever want to just completely
stop, you know, elements of your workout,

959
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,970
you know,
you want to keep.

960
01:07:09,970 --> 01:07:13,210
That's why it's good to not go
into these extreme directions.

961
01:07:13,690 --> 01:07:18,460
And I'll tell you one what I think is
the most important thing for me for being

962
01:07:18,461 --> 01:07:23,461
relatively injury free and be able to
list all my injuries on the next question,

963
01:07:23,951 --> 01:07:27,340
but relatively injury free
is that I always work out,

964
01:07:27,730 --> 01:07:30,520
I always work out and I think that

965
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:37,000
when people, I think when people
take extended periods of time off,

966
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:40,570
and by that I think, I mean, you know,

967
01:07:40,571 --> 01:07:42,940
you're starting to get into
like two weeks, three weeks,

968
01:07:42,941 --> 01:07:45,220
maybe a month of not doing anything.

969
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:49,840
I think when people come back from those
is when they get injured is when they

970
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:53,170
get hurt because their body's just,
it's still strong.

971
01:07:53,230 --> 01:07:57,910
It's still thinks it can do what it
did three weeks ago, but it can't,

972
01:07:57,911 --> 01:08:02,500
it's not conditioned for it. And that's
when that's when you get hurt. Uh,

973
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:07,530
another good piece I think
for recovery and is a,

974
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:12,640
is a MobilityWOD the Kelly k star,
you know,

975
01:08:12,641 --> 01:08:16,010
go to mobilitywod.com and just look
at that, look at what he's doing,

976
01:08:16,011 --> 01:08:20,990
look at what he's putting out and he's
got some great stuff to heal yourself and,

977
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:25,070
and square away your injuries.
I think stretching,

978
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,750
I think stretching is important,
but I think people take it to an access.

979
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,480
And I think when you do too much of it,
I think it's,

980
01:08:32,930 --> 01:08:37,880
I think it's causes problems.
Um, I know, I know some,

981
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:42,970
some guys that have done extreme
yoga and I think extreme yoga is,

982
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:46,850
you know,
once you're,

983
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:51,380
once you go beyond what is
normal or a little beyond normal,

984
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:54,950
you start to injure yourself and I think
that's not good. And they get leads to,

985
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:56,870
you know, joint laxity where your, your,

986
01:08:57,260 --> 01:09:01,400
your joints can actually move too much
and there's not enough holding them in

987
01:09:01,401 --> 01:09:03,860
place and there the ability. Right. Right.

988
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:08,950
And so I think just listen to your body
and I think that the next part of this

989
01:09:09,761 --> 01:09:11,690
question we'll answer
in the next question.

990
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,710
Just kind of add to that nutrition as
well. Eating enough. So a lot of people,

991
01:09:18,711 --> 01:09:23,090
especially if they're trying to cut up
or, or, or drop some weight and you know,

992
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:25,250
if you're training for something, you
got to make weight that's, you know,

993
01:09:25,251 --> 01:09:27,620
that's going to be a little
bit more specific strategy.

994
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:31,520
But a lot of times if we
will starve themselves,

995
01:09:31,790 --> 01:09:35,270
I'm always telling people
like when they're feeling
negative or they're feeling

996
01:09:35,271 --> 01:09:38,240
like their injury prone,
I'm always telling people
they're probably lacking fats.

997
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:42,900
They're probably lacking good fats,
you know? So I agree with you.

998
01:09:42,901 --> 01:09:46,670
Diet is extremely important. Yeah. And
what, like when you, when you work on,

999
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:50,270
this is what I learned early on and an
understanding the importance of this I

1000
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:55,160
think really, really helped is if
you eat right after you work out,

1001
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:55,850
don't,

1002
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:59,030
don't think that you're gonna eat a meal
and that's going to fuel your workout.

1003
01:09:59,100 --> 01:09:59,860
Cause he's like,

1004
01:09:59,860 --> 01:10:04,670
it takes a while for the calories to
go into your system to fuel a workout.

1005
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,590
It's not going to do it in like an hour.
So I don't eat.

1006
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:12,180
So go workout and then eat after so that
those calories in those nutrients will

1007
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,430
help your body recover.
And within that hour,

1008
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:20,070
that's when your body wants to
recover. Once those nutrients. Yes.

1009
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:21,680
So doing that,

1010
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:25,990
if you starve yourself or don't
eat or eat very little, you're,

1011
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,950
your muscles are going to be recovered.

1012
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:30,860
Your tendons are going to be a little
bit more weak, even when you do recovery,

1013
01:10:30,861 --> 01:10:35,770
didn't take in those nutrients. So you
will be way more prone. I probably,

1014
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:38,400
I probably need to do a better
job of that as you. Well, I,

1015
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:40,690
people always ask me and I, I get
done working out, you know what,

1016
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:43,130
like five or six as well,
maybe six o'clock in the morning.

1017
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:44,750
I'm done working out and I usually don't,

1018
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:49,580
I usually don't eat until nine or 10,
you know,

1019
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,620
so I probably need to
do a better job of that.

1020
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,370
I'll often take echo Charles his
advice on that one. Yeah. That's um,

1021
01:10:55,490 --> 01:10:58,850
it's the funniest, but I haven't opened
mine, so it's cool. I can do that. Yeah.

1022
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:03,350
Good. In the budding bill bodybuilding
world, that's like a no brainer.

1023
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:06,140
It's called the anabolic
window and it's like,

1024
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:10,130
you can see little jokes on it where
it's like of jumped through all this

1025
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:14,490
anabolic window and it shows a picture of
like a guy, a d guy dying or something,

1026
01:11:14,491 --> 01:11:17,340
you know, it's like, it's a real
important thing and it helps so much.

1027
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:21,420
We'll give it a shot.
Right on. Next question

1028
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:24,263
from

1029
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,790
what honey bees do.

1030
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:32,423
Oh,

1031
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:35,170
when it's all one word, it's
just kind of, it's strange. Okay.

1032
01:11:35,171 --> 01:11:37,360
What honey bees do not on the decoding.

1033
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:43,110
Could be like walk though me.
These dough,

1034
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,820
you don't care.
Be That honeybees.

1035
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:49,240
Do you never know what the honey bees do?

1036
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:54,990
What injuries?
What honeybees do not the hood.

1037
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,180
All right, there you go.
You get a third chance.

1038
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:02,410
What injuries have you
gotten and how did you adapt?

1039
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,940
Uh, so obviously active
lifestyle, you know,

1040
01:12:08,110 --> 01:12:12,940
growing up and spending
my life in the seal teams,

1041
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:19,120
ton of injuries from everything
I've had. Mcl, terror,

1042
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:23,200
sprained ankles, shoulders,
wrists, slower back, elbows.

1043
01:12:23,530 --> 01:12:27,640
But the most serious actual
injury that I had, um,

1044
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,660
was I had neck, I had neck surgery,
so I had a foraminotomy and my neck,

1045
01:12:31,661 --> 01:12:36,661
which is they go in and they scrape some
bone away from the frame and which hurt

1046
01:12:37,481 --> 01:12:42,400
bad and when they did it. And,
but it's been really good.

1047
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:43,473
Um,

1048
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:45,823
Aye

1049
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:50,850
was real. I mean, I, I had like lost
movement in my arm for a little while.

1050
01:12:50,851 --> 01:12:53,940
My right arm from your neck, from
my neck, injury from the nerves,

1051
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:57,780
just grinding over time and,
and you know,

1052
01:12:57,781 --> 01:13:02,250
I remember there's one part of seal
training where you're carrying these boats

1053
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:04,860
on your head,
which is not that big of a deal,

1054
01:13:04,890 --> 01:13:07,980
but then the instructors
would jump from boat to boat.

1055
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:11,190
So you get these 200 pound instructors
and they're just jumping at their boats

1056
01:13:11,191 --> 01:13:14,340
on your head and they're jumping
from boat to boat. And it's,

1057
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:19,170
I remember an instructor jumping into
the boat landing pretty much where I was

1058
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,920
and I remember hearing a
grinding noise in my neck and I,

1059
01:13:24,990 --> 01:13:29,130
you know, of course I was 19 years
old, so I didn't care, bring it on.

1060
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,770
But they don't,
they don't do that anymore.

1061
01:13:31,771 --> 01:13:34,650
They actually don't jump from boat to
boat anymore, which is, which is cool.

1062
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,370
They shouldn't because it's not
good for you. So, but, but anyways,

1063
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:41,640
with all these injuries, whether it's
MCL tear or whether it's, you know,

1064
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:45,660
high ankle sprains and,
and all kinds of ligament damages in my,

1065
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:49,210
in my ankles and my lower back,
which I've mentioned a few times,

1066
01:13:49,470 --> 01:13:52,770
almost all muscular there.
Uh,

1067
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:56,220
what I do is I do the same thing
with all of them. And that is,

1068
01:13:56,221 --> 01:13:59,690
I do whatever I can, you know, if I, if I,

1069
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,570
when I hurt my knee and I couldn't squat,
I could do like a quarter squat.

1070
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,100
I did a quarter squats,
you know,

1071
01:14:05,101 --> 01:14:07,550
I'd go out the garage and I'd
stand there with nobody waiting,

1072
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:11,000
just do quarter squats and get
the blood moving. And you know,

1073
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:14,920
I try and do my other body parts and
you know, could do pull up still.

1074
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:16,750
And so I did dead hang.
Paul was,

1075
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,650
cause I couldn't even move my
need at like Kipp and all right,

1076
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:24,280
so I did what I could there, you know, so
you can't do ring dips, do regular dips.

1077
01:14:24,281 --> 01:14:27,190
If you can't do dibs, do pushups. You
can do push ups, push off of a wall,

1078
01:14:27,191 --> 01:14:30,370
whatever it takes to get something done.

1079
01:14:30,371 --> 01:14:33,950
You can't live that 40
kilogram Kettlebell lift,

1080
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:38,440
the 24 kilogram Kettlebell,
just do something, move,

1081
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,440
get the blood in there and not only
does to get the blood in there,

1082
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:43,360
cause I always think that
the more you're moving in,

1083
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:47,170
the more you're using that range of
motion, the faster you're going to heal.

1084
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:51,340
You know, you're just circulating
more, repairing nutrients to your body.

1085
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:55,120
So it would make sense to me that
that's going to help you heal.

1086
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:59,770
Now of course you can read damage, you
can go worse, you know, if it hurts,

1087
01:14:59,771 --> 01:15:04,210
do a a quarter squat and so you do half
squat, you're going backwards, you know,

1088
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,810
so you want to stay within the range of
motion where you're not reentering it or

1089
01:15:07,811 --> 01:15:10,960
making it worse.
So don't be stupid,

1090
01:15:11,770 --> 01:15:15,490
but do get the movement going.
And also,

1091
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:19,840
I don't know what I would do mentally
if I like couldn't do anything at all.

1092
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,880
Now when I hurt my neck
though, I was, I was laid up.

1093
01:15:21,881 --> 01:15:23,830
I didn't think I was going to be,
I was going to go to power through it.

1094
01:15:23,831 --> 01:15:25,090
And then the tough guy. Yeah, no,

1095
01:15:25,091 --> 01:15:29,650
I was laid up with my
head and just hurting and,

1096
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:33,160
but I'll tell you as soon as I could
get up and start trying to walk around,

1097
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:36,160
I did it. And like I said,
try to try to stay sane.

1098
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:40,150
And then the other thing that happens is
when you have these injuries, you know,

1099
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:42,400
you're, you got to adapt
your goals, you know,

1100
01:15:42,401 --> 01:15:45,160
and you gotta just got to set new
goals. Okay. You know, and, and really,

1101
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:49,210
I've never really fully
regained the strength in my
right arm and my right pack.

1102
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:53,710
It's not as strong as it was. And it's
definitely way weaker than my other side.

1103
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:54,371
You know,

1104
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:59,371
it's probably at 70 or 80% and you know,

1105
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,440
I just have to say, okay, well
what can I do? It's like, okay,

1106
01:16:02,441 --> 01:16:06,340
you're going to be normal. You're a normal
human now. You know, so, so here's what,

1107
01:16:06,341 --> 01:16:10,030
here's, here's, here's what your
new goals are. And I'm s you know,

1108
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:13,960
I'm still trying to improve and
get better at whatever it is,

1109
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,130
but you know,

1110
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:20,250
injuries are going to happen in life and
you gotta just do your best you can to

1111
01:16:20,861 --> 01:16:25,230
work through them as smartly
as you possibly can. And
kind of to add to the, the,

1112
01:16:25,231 --> 01:16:29,380
the train smart,
this may seem obvious,

1113
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:33,420
but when you do like higher rep, like
heavier weight or not higher reps, sorry,

1114
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,660
heavier weight,
lower reps or real explosive stuff,

1115
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:39,430
you're going to be more prone to injury.

1116
01:16:39,431 --> 01:16:44,070
So even being just more conscious
of your movement. Yeah. And,

1117
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:48,130
and really avoiding those types of
movements when you feel an injury start to

1118
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:50,440
come out. Like if you get a
little lower back thing or,

1119
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:52,600
or a shoulder thing for sure.
Um,

1120
01:16:53,410 --> 01:16:58,210
just be conscious of your movement way
more today I was deadlifting and I,

1121
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:03,210
I was like, hmm, nope. Okay.
We're done deadlifting for
the day and, and you know, I,

1122
01:17:03,211 --> 01:17:06,640
I definitely spared myself being laid up,
you know,

1123
01:17:06,641 --> 01:17:10,060
and I just got out the roller and
just grounded out for a while, got off

1124
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:13,000
the ball, grounded out for awhile.
But for sure you gotta listen,

1125
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:17,120
you gotta pay attention and if you feel
that little twins, it's no big deal.

1126
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:17,570
You know,

1127
01:17:17,570 --> 01:17:21,770
there's plenty of other ways to get your
get your workout on besides Jack and

1128
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:25,790
the big steel. So yeah, you
um, like are your thing,

1129
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:28,560
your body weight squats, you'll just
do it, you know, like if you're,

1130
01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:33,580
if you had a six squat workout planned
and you feel your lower back or it,

1131
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:38,960
Ben is a big one where when you, when
you get after it and squats that'll um,

1132
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:40,100
a lot of times act up.

1133
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:44,210
Well I sprained my ankle sick enough
probably four or five months ago and it,

1134
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:47,180
I couldn't do, it was weird.
It's one of those weird things.

1135
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:51,620
I couldn't do overhead squats
but I could do overhead squats,

1136
01:17:52,150 --> 01:17:53,350
snatch,
yes.

1137
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:56,360
I couldn't do overhead squats cause
it hurt my ankle for whatever reason.

1138
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,940
But I could do front squats and regular
squats and I couldn't go to full debt.

1139
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,940
The ones I could still go
to full depth on. Again,

1140
01:18:01,941 --> 01:18:05,600
I don't know why I'm not a physician.
Front squats felt the best.

1141
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:09,860
So I started doing more and more front
squats at the time and then eventually,

1142
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:12,320
you know,
and now I'm back to doing everything.

1143
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,180
So figuring out what
you can get away with,

1144
01:18:14,181 --> 01:18:19,010
figuring out what you can do and new it
also went in regards to being conscious

1145
01:18:19,011 --> 01:18:22,000
of like your movement.
A lot of times I know this is,

1146
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:27,030
this is the case for me were all get
little injuries from just like racking or

1147
01:18:27,051 --> 01:18:29,150
unpacking weight just because it's like,

1148
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:31,250
well you're not need to do more
functional training, my friend.

1149
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,380
I don't always get injured.
Little things, you know,

1150
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:39,170
because that a lot of times
that is like it's unconscious.

1151
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:42,110
I'm just putting this over here,
you know, and you're not. Meanwhile,

1152
01:18:42,111 --> 01:18:45,530
if you do a clean and jerk
and you're like, okay,

1153
01:18:45,531 --> 01:18:49,250
I'm going to focus on this good technique.
So again,

1154
01:18:49,251 --> 01:18:53,480
that goes along with being careful of
your mo movement being, being conscious,

1155
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:56,750
conscious. Especially when you
feel when you hit that fatigue,

1156
01:18:56,751 --> 01:18:59,660
when you know you've been working
out for three weeks straight, hard,

1157
01:18:59,661 --> 01:19:00,980
very little risks, you're on it, you know,

1158
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:05,030
and you start to feel these
little things come about.

1159
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,220
I think it's important too,
to be conscious of those things.

1160
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,160
And also to what you were saying earlier,
if my head's not in the game,

1161
01:19:13,161 --> 01:19:16,670
I'm not Jack and the big weights
cause you gotta be thinking about it.

1162
01:19:16,671 --> 01:19:20,640
You gotta be thinking about your body
position, you know, before you do, before,

1163
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:23,960
before you just try and grab on this
big weight and throw it around. Yeah.

1164
01:19:23,961 --> 01:19:24,980
You gotta get your head in the game.

1165
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:32,570
All right, next question. Uh,
this was actually my question.

1166
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:37,070
A question from echo bind with a question
from someone else. Yeah. Yes, yes,

1167
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:41,900
that's true. Okay. So public
speaking, right? How did you, like,

1168
01:19:41,901 --> 01:19:45,320
I've seen some of your speeches. How did
you get good at it? Because that's a,

1169
01:19:45,321 --> 01:19:49,460
that's a daunting nerve wracking
thing in fight. Like some people,

1170
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:55,070
they prefer death over public speaking.
Literally.

1171
01:19:56,630 --> 01:20:00,200
That's heavy. So what's your, um,
what's your mindset, you know,

1172
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:02,240
for keep you from it,
from being nervous.

1173
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:08,010
And then that coupled with
another question here,
which we got from conquering

1174
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:11,640
fear in general, right? Right. If
you're a failure or a fear of rejection,

1175
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:12,810
fear of the unknown,

1176
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:18,780
what would your advice be to someone
who wants to like start a business or a

1177
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:23,580
major project? But they're, but
they're held back by fear. So

1178
01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:28,110
this is,
again,

1179
01:20:28,111 --> 01:20:31,500
it's interesting for me because public
speaking is not something that induces

1180
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:33,670
fear and made, it never has. Uh,

1181
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:37,980
but I know that it does
make people scared.

1182
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:43,880
And I think that overcoming the key to
any overcoming any fear in my mind is,

1183
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:50,460
we talked about this a little earlier,
wishes inoculation and this idea,

1184
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:54,640
and I actually looked up the definition
of inoculation and it's the introduce

1185
01:20:54,670 --> 01:20:58,920
the introduction of a pathogen or antigen
into a living organism to stimulate

1186
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:03,570
the production of antibiotics antibodies.
So you're giving yourself a little bit,

1187
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:07,620
right? Right. You give yourself a little
bit and you build up off there and,

1188
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:10,560
and that's what you do.
You take the small doses.

1189
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,890
So it prepares you for the bigger, bigger
doses. And I, uh, one of my daughters,

1190
01:21:13,891 --> 01:21:14,724
my middle daughter,

1191
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:20,270
she was really wanting to
be in the school play right.

1192
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:25,560
And other plays around town
and Oh, you know, okay, cool.

1193
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:29,970
Well that's cool. But she was horrified
to go out in front of an audience.

1194
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,230
Horrified. And so I looked
up and I said, okay,

1195
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,150
well how do you stop your kids from being,

1196
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:40,650
getting stage fright is the one they call
it. And you know, I read about people,

1197
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:44,970
what they did and what I did
was I said, I'd say, we're okay.

1198
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:49,740
Uh, the singer Song for me, and it's not
that big of a deal cause I'm her dad.

1199
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:53,460
And so she'd sing a song for me and even
then she'd be a little bit embarrassed,

1200
01:21:53,461 --> 01:21:55,620
but she'd sing a song for
me and then then, you know,

1201
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:58,560
a couple of days they don't have my
wife, Hey, sing that song for both of us.

1202
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,250
And then it was, oh my wife's
got a friend over, hey,

1203
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:05,910
sing that song for the three of us.
Because how you get a mystery person,

1204
01:22:05,911 --> 01:22:07,200
an unknown in the room.
Okay.

1205
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:10,500
So she's overcoming that fear and each
time she's getting a little bit more and

1206
01:22:10,501 --> 01:22:13,170
more confident because we took her to a,

1207
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:18,030
what do they call tryouts, what's
tryout called audition. Audition.

1208
01:22:18,031 --> 01:22:22,470
We took her to a couple auditions where
it was her turn and she didn't go.

1209
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:27,120
She broke down just crying and
just, just, just couldn't handle it.

1210
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,180
And so then it was,

1211
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:34,050
then it was a few of my wife's friends
were over then it was some of my friends

1212
01:22:34,051 --> 01:22:35,250
were over. So now you've got, you know,

1213
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:40,310
guys and girls and each time she got more
and more confident and eventually she

1214
01:22:40,381 --> 01:22:45,120
just didn't care anymore and
she was totally confident
and she got the lead role

1215
01:22:45,121 --> 01:22:48,090
in the school play. She legitimately got
the lead role in the school play, so,

1216
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,070
so she was able to overcome that fear.

1217
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,050
And in the seal teams we
do the same kind of thing.

1218
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:56,970
We know where you're going to get a knock
related against stress as much as they

1219
01:22:56,971 --> 01:22:58,740
can stress you out in the seal teams,
they're going to stress you out.

1220
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:00,840
There's going to be machine gun fire,
you're going to be used to that.

1221
01:23:00,841 --> 01:23:02,550
They're going to be explosions going off.
You're going to be used to that.

1222
01:23:02,551 --> 01:23:07,190
We used to do, we used to do live
fire machine drills and, and, and uh,

1223
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:11,170
I add drills, immediate action
drills. We are maneuvering around.

1224
01:23:11,171 --> 01:23:13,060
We do that without your ear protection.

1225
01:23:13,061 --> 01:23:15,700
And sometimes so you get
used to this crazy banging.

1226
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:18,490
We don't do that anymore
because it's not smart. But uh,

1227
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,900
but you do that to inoculate. It's like
what you were talking about earlier.

1228
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:25,420
When that gun goes off, you should
be completely comfortable with it.

1229
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,360
And there's a, uh, one of
my favorite stories on that,
one of my favorite stores,

1230
01:23:28,361 --> 01:23:32,860
but one of them, one of the, uh, a
buddy of mine who actually took my job,

1231
01:23:33,310 --> 01:23:36,070
I was a tasking your commander and he
actually took my job as task in your

1232
01:23:36,071 --> 01:23:36,904
commander.

1233
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:41,890
And a flash bang is a grenade that you
throw into a room before you go into the

1234
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:46,450
room and it makes a loud explosion and
smoke and then it allows you to enter in

1235
01:23:46,451 --> 01:23:48,880
on the room when the people that
are inside are now startled.

1236
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:53,250
So you have an advantage.
Well occasionally, you know,

1237
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,590
you have to open the door to throw the,

1238
01:23:54,591 --> 01:23:58,000
the crash in there and
occasionally someone will open
the door and someone will

1239
01:23:58,001 --> 01:24:00,640
run in by,
they didn't coordinate it well.

1240
01:24:00,641 --> 01:24:04,180
And so the open the door guy runs in
and then someone throws the crash.

1241
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:05,560
And so now you're crashing yourself.

1242
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:08,320
It's not that big of a
deal you got to use to it.

1243
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:12,280
But what happened with one of his
new guys, you know, that happened.

1244
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:13,480
So the door went open,

1245
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:17,380
the guy went in and while the guys running
and somebody throws a crash in there,

1246
01:24:17,650 --> 01:24:20,410
the guy sees the crash and
he runs back out of the room,

1247
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:22,870
which is not what you're supposed to do.

1248
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:27,190
So this guy was the task unit commander
and he goes, Hey, come with me down here.

1249
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:32,080
And so they walked down and he brought
them into a closet in the kill house and

1250
01:24:32,081 --> 01:24:34,300
just sat in there and
said, yeah, how's it going?

1251
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:38,410
And they just sat there in the dark and
dropped like eight crashes at their feet

1252
01:24:38,411 --> 01:24:41,650
and just blasted the guy.
Cause you realize that you
just got to get inoculated.

1253
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:45,460
You know, you just got to
overcome it. So that's kind of,

1254
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:47,020
I guess my,

1255
01:24:47,470 --> 01:24:52,470
my theory here would be if you're
afraid of fighting and altercations,

1256
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:58,960
go train Jiu Jitsu. If you're afraid
of heights, work on some rock climbing,

1257
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:03,040
climbing. If you're afraid of the water,
it's the time to swim. It's time to surf.

1258
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:05,300
It's trying to get out there.
If you're afraid of pull ups,

1259
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:08,350
if you're a prey to pumps, do pull
ups. If you're in squats, do squats.

1260
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:12,160
If you're afraid of public speaking,
go speak in public.

1261
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:18,490
If you're afraid to start a business,
start a business, make it small.

1262
01:25:18,491 --> 01:25:19,330
And on all of these,

1263
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:21,940
which you have to do is you have to
mitigate the risk and you have to ease

1264
01:25:21,941 --> 01:25:24,880
yourself into it.
But you got to go for it.

1265
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:30,750
And eventually you will
overcome that fear.

1266
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:36,160
But the hard part is you
got to take that first step.

1267
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:41,550
You got to take that first step to begin
to inoculate yourself against the fear,

1268
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,620
against the fear of the
thing that's in your mind.

1269
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:48,400
Because that fear generally is
in your mind that, you know,

1270
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,010
when you get up on stage,
do public speaking,

1271
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,740
people are not going to throw tomatoes at
you and say, Oh my God, you're an idiot.

1272
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,840
Get off the stage. No, they, they're
going to sit there, you know,

1273
01:25:58,841 --> 01:26:03,770
so there's nothing to fear it's
in, it's in your head. Hey,

1274
01:26:03,771 --> 01:26:08,420
those flash grenades don't
cause any damage to people.

1275
01:26:08,421 --> 01:26:11,510
They're just, I mean, you don't
like want them next to your eye.

1276
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:15,830
They're rare and they're loud and they
make a big boom and during explosive.

1277
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:19,460
Yeah. But yeah, they don't, they don't
hurt you. Right. Generally the days you,

1278
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,490
they hadn't even days they stun you.
Yeah.

1279
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:27,320
So like what if I had one in my pocket
and it went off? Yeah. You'd get a little,

1280
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:31,130
you'd get a little something.
Not an Indian. I'd get hurt.
Not Injured. You'd get,

1281
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:35,010
yeah. You get hurt, not injured.
Yeah, I can do lift or some trees.

1282
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:39,950
You'd be sore. Yeah. Yeah. I never
let went off in my pocket. Yeah.

1283
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:40,750
I always wonder about

1284
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:45,520
does cause they're all right.
Next question. Um, okay.

1285
01:26:45,521 --> 01:26:47,830
And podcast number seven,
you answered the question,

1286
01:26:47,831 --> 01:26:52,600
which was essentially about how a
subordinate might cope with a leader who

1287
01:26:52,601 --> 01:26:56,710
wasn't competent. Um, so this,

1288
01:26:56,711 --> 01:27:01,450
this person is interested in your
thoughts on the opposite side of the coin.

1289
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:05,980
For example, if you're that guy,
quote unquote, and you know it,

1290
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:11,450
how can you still lead a team effectively
given the lack of competence, um,

1291
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:16,930
given the lack of competence can undermine
the team's trust and confidence in

1292
01:27:16,931 --> 01:27:17,430
you.

1293
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:20,820
So, so this question is,
you are that guy. Yeah.

1294
01:27:20,821 --> 01:27:22,890
You're the guy that
doesn't have the knowledge.

1295
01:27:22,891 --> 01:27:25,890
You're the guy that's an experience too.
You're the guy that just got hired.

1296
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:29,100
That's good that he, you know
it. That's good, right? Yes.

1297
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:33,600
He said he's done a good job by,
by recognizing that is step number one.

1298
01:27:33,601 --> 01:27:36,470
He's recognized that he's the
guy that he's inexperienced,

1299
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,990
doesn't have the knowledge, et
cetera. So this, this question,

1300
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,930
while it might seem like a tough question,

1301
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:45,000
it's actually easier than
you might think because

1302
01:27:46,650 --> 01:27:51,240
competence and knowledge definitely
are very beneficial for leadership.

1303
01:27:51,330 --> 01:27:52,620
The knowledge piece and,

1304
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:56,610
and knowing the technical side of
what you're trying to lead a team in.

1305
01:27:57,150 --> 01:28:02,010
But it is definitely not mandatory.
Now if you don't have it,

1306
01:28:02,011 --> 01:28:05,640
of course you should strive to get it
because it will make you a better leader.

1307
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:10,140
But in certain situations there's times
where you have to lead and you have to

1308
01:28:10,141 --> 01:28:12,420
lead.
Now that does happen.

1309
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:16,920
So what do you do and how do you lead
when you're in that situation and it's

1310
01:28:16,921 --> 01:28:17,760
actually pretty easy.

1311
01:28:17,970 --> 01:28:22,500
You lead almost the exact same you way
that you would in any other situation

1312
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:26,490
humbly and with an open mind.

1313
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:31,760
So leadership is the same
regardless of what you know.

1314
01:28:33,660 --> 01:28:35,880
Think about it. Leadership is the
same regardless of what you know.

1315
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:39,630
What you're gonna do is you're going to
gather ideas cause you don't really have

1316
01:28:39,631 --> 01:28:42,210
in your own. So you're going to gather
them from the other people, right?

1317
01:28:42,420 --> 01:28:45,090
You're going to explore the
different methods, right?

1318
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:46,770
Cause you don't know any
of the other methods.

1319
01:28:46,771 --> 01:28:48,690
So you're just going to explore
and say, oh, how would you do it?

1320
01:28:48,691 --> 01:28:49,524
Or how would you do it?

1321
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:54,480
You're going to weigh the
different courses of action because

1322
01:28:56,220 --> 01:28:58,320
you're not sure which one
is going to be the best.

1323
01:28:58,321 --> 01:29:01,020
It's not going to be super evident,
which course of action is going to be the,

1324
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:03,480
you're going to listen,
listen to what people are saying.

1325
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:07,620
You're going to keep an open mind
and hear what they're saying.

1326
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:09,213
Okay.

1327
01:29:10,510 --> 01:29:14,680
You're going to show that you're a quick
learner and you're going to listen in

1328
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:16,900
and learn. And how do you show
that you're a quick learner.

1329
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:19,720
You show that you're a quick
learner by being a quick learner.

1330
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:23,500
And how do you be a quick learner
by studying? So when it comes,

1331
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:25,180
when there's stuff that you should know,

1332
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:30,520
then you study it and you learn it and
you prove and then you take all this

1333
01:29:30,521 --> 01:29:35,521
information that you've got and you
weigh the decision and then you make one.

1334
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:41,650
And again, that's how you should
be leaving anyways. Right? So,

1335
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,410
so let me ask you this just
because you know the most, right?

1336
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,090
If you are the most
knowledgeable on the team,

1337
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:49,360
does that mean you're gonna plan
everything yourself? No. No it doesn't.

1338
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:53,410
Does that mean you're going to make
your decisions in a vacuum by yourself?

1339
01:29:53,410 --> 01:29:56,530
Just know if you're a good leader,
you're not going to do that at all.

1340
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:59,650
Does it mean you're going
to make decisions and move
forward without consulting

1341
01:29:59,651 --> 01:30:02,200
with people? No, it doesn't.

1342
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,500
So all this means is that you're
going to do all those things.

1343
01:30:05,501 --> 01:30:08,650
You are going to get
consensus from the group.

1344
01:30:08,651 --> 01:30:10,030
You're going to get people on board.

1345
01:30:10,031 --> 01:30:13,360
You're going to talk to them and see
what their, their ideas are. Any, again,

1346
01:30:13,361 --> 01:30:16,300
I shouldn't have used the word
consensus because you can always lead by

1347
01:30:16,301 --> 01:30:19,240
consensus. That can be, that can become
difficult, but you're going to listen.

1348
01:30:19,241 --> 01:30:20,021
You're going to learn,

1349
01:30:20,021 --> 01:30:25,021
you're going to talk to people about
what you're doing and that's how you're

1350
01:30:25,841 --> 01:30:29,590
going to lead. Again, it's
almost the exact same. The
only thing that gets added.

1351
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,750
If you are sort of a technical expertise,

1352
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:35,440
you can be a little bit more
of a sanity check on, you know,

1353
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:39,040
let's say a plan that people
are coming up with. If, if,

1354
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:43,990
if we were doing a computer, you
know, software engineering problem,

1355
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:50,220
I would not be able to add my technical
expertise. But if, you know, for the comp,

1356
01:30:50,290 --> 01:30:53,200
the engineers came to me and
presented what their ideas were,

1357
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,090
I'd be able to look at them
logically and say, okay,

1358
01:30:55,091 --> 01:30:57,520
explain to me how and ask enough
questions until I said, okay guys,

1359
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,100
here's what I'm thinking here. I
think we should go with, you know,

1360
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:03,880
method B or whatever and the other
people can kind of counter and then

1361
01:31:03,881 --> 01:31:06,010
eventually we can make
that decision happen.

1362
01:31:06,011 --> 01:31:10,930
So if I had the knowledge myself that
I could make that decision a little bit

1363
01:31:10,931 --> 01:31:12,970
easier and I could add a
little bit of a sanity check,

1364
01:31:12,971 --> 01:31:16,060
but it's not life and death.
Uh,

1365
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:21,010
and the other thing that's interesting
is when you do have the knowledge

1366
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:23,710
yourself,
you can,

1367
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:28,780
you can actually come off as a know it
all, which is not a good leader. Yeah.

1368
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:31,120
So in both cases,

1369
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:36,010
whether you are the technical expert
or whether you're not the leadership

1370
01:31:36,011 --> 01:31:40,660
principles, stay the same, be
humble, be open minded, listen,

1371
01:31:41,290 --> 01:31:45,310
learn and lead.
Last question.

1372
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:51,450
What is your greatest weakness and what
are you doing to work through or around

1373
01:31:52,391 --> 01:31:53,224
it?

1374
01:31:55,210 --> 01:31:59,320
What is my greatest weakness?
My biggest weakness?

1375
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:07,080
And that's actually a hard question
because when I think about it,

1376
01:32:08,740 --> 01:32:11,650
frankly,
I am nothing bought weakness.

1377
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:15,250
I'm not naturally strong.
I'm not naturally fast,

1378
01:32:15,251 --> 01:32:20,251
I'm not naturally flexible
and I'm certainly not the
smartest guy in the world.

1379
01:32:23,670 --> 01:32:24,160
And,

1380
01:32:24,160 --> 01:32:29,160
and I get emotional over stupid things
and I eat the wrong foods and I don't

1381
01:32:29,421 --> 01:32:34,421
sleep enough and I procrastinate and I
waste time and I cares too much about

1382
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:38,600
stupid things and not enough
about important things.

1383
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:43,160
And of course my ego is too big,

1384
01:32:45,380 --> 01:32:50,150
but at the same time, my mind is too
small and it's trapped inside itself.

1385
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:58,310
But now that being said,
I have a saying and it's,

1386
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:00,290
and you've probably
heard me say it before,

1387
01:33:00,440 --> 01:33:04,970
a person's strengths are often
their biggest weaknesses.

1388
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:10,840
And so that also means that their
weaknesses can be their strengths.

1389
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:16,680
So me,

1390
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:22,890
I am weak in all those ways that I listed.

1391
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:24,270
I am weak,

1392
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:32,640
but I don't accept that I don't accept
that I am what I am and that that

1393
01:33:35,020 --> 01:33:38,230
is what I'm doomed to be.
No,

1394
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:41,260
I don't accept that I'm fighting.

1395
01:33:42,820 --> 01:33:43,960
I'm always fighting.

1396
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:48,961
I'm struggling and I'm scrapping and
kicking and clawing at those weaknesses to

1397
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:52,960
change them to stop them.

1398
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:57,390
Some days I win.

1399
01:33:58,700 --> 01:33:59,533
Okay.

1400
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:01,380
Some days I don't,

1401
01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:08,190
but each and every day I get
back up and I move forward

1402
01:34:10,350 --> 01:34:14,940
with my fist clenched toward the battle,
toward the struggle

1403
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:21,570
and I fight with everything I've got
to overcome those weaknesses and those

1404
01:34:21,630 --> 01:34:23,910
shortfalls and those flaws

1405
01:34:25,410 --> 01:34:29,130
as I strive to be just a
little bit better today

1406
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:33,200
than I was yesterday.

1407
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:38,003
Yeah,

1408
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:44,720
and I think that that about
wraps it up for tonight and

1409
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:48,030
like we always say,

1410
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:53,280
if you want to continue this conversation
or you want to engage in one or you

1411
01:34:53,281 --> 01:34:58,100
want to hang with us virtually,
you can find us on Twitter.

1412
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:02,270
I'm at Jockowillink and
echo is at echocharles.
