00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature, and today we’re going to talk

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:08.140
about Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe.
Things Fall Apart is set in what is now Nigeria

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.520
during the late 19th century, but it was written in 1958,
as the colonial system was falling apart in Africa.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.040
And one of the reasons Things Fall Apart is so important is that prior to it, most novels about Africa and Africans

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.760
in English had been written by Europeans. Achebe
turned the traditional European notion of Africans

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.900
as savages on its head, and confronted
the great failure of people to, quote,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.340
“see other human beings as human beings.”
With characters that you can feel with and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.550
think with and breathe with, layer after layer
of the reality of the colonial situation in

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.970
Igboland is exposed, and we see the vicious,
cyclical realities that are produced by both

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.050
individual and institutional power when it’s
based in fear and hatred and ignorance.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.400
[Theme Music]

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.540
So things fall apart in Things Fall Apart not only
because of the outside pressures of colonialism,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.000
but also because of the interior pressures of the main
character, Okonkwo. Okonkwo is a man known,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.440
“throughout the nine villages and even beyond” whose
“fame rested on solid personal achievements.”

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.099
He is known for his strength
and his wrestling ability.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:20.649
Like during his prime, in one of the community
festivals, before a crowd of 10,000 or more

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.039
people, Okonkwo out-wrestled a man known as
the Cat in a match. The Cat!

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.840
And we’re told of this match, “ the old
men agreed it was one of the fiercest since

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.120
the founder of their town engaged a spirit
of the wild for seven days and seven nights.”

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.060
We learn all of this, by the way, in the opening
paragraph of the novel, so we're immediately

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.200
drawn into this world of order and belief,
of competition and struggle, and of stories

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.739
that are kept and passed down by elders.
And we know from the beginning that Okonkwo

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:51.519
is a man held in high esteem not only for his
wrestling ability, but also because he had, quote

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.940
“risen so suddenly from great poverty and
misfortune to be one of the lords of his clan.”

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.940
But despite his status and his achievements, Okonkwo
is haunted. Now it’s not quite the ghost of the Hamlet’s

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.939
father walking around at midnight brooding
about vengeance, but Okonkwo sees his father

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.890
everywhere he goes. His father, Unoka, owed
debts all over town and spent like all of

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.299
his time playing the flute and drinking palm
wine.

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.619
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, that sounds pretty good
actually!

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.420
I’m sure it sounds lovely, Me from the Past,
although we both know you can’t drink a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.790
bottle of Strawberry Hill without vomiting.
But the important thing here is that in 19th

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.640
century Igboland, you couldn’t get ahead
in life if you weren’t willing to work.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.489
Which, come to think of it, is also true today,
Me From the Past.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.719
So Okonkwo grew up knowing that the whole
village thought his dad was a loser, and the

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:41.849
pain of it stuck with him. Like, Achebe writes,
“his whole life was dominated by fear, the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.829
fear of failure and of weakness.”
And this isn’t like my fear of spiders or

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.549
my fear of heights or my fear of air travel
or my fear of peanut butter sticking to the

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.400
roof of my mouth. This is serious fear.
For Okonkwo, “It was deeper and more intimate

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.579
than the fear of evil and capricious gods
and of magic, the fear of the forest, and

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.420
of the forces of nature, malevolent, red in
tooth and claw.”

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.280
Which quote allows me to mention something
really important about Things Fall Apart.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.909
That “red in tooth and claw” line is borrowed
from a Tennyson poem.

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.129
And throughout the novel, Things Fall Apart
is conscious both of African storytelling

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.109
forms and of European ones.
This exploration of connections and differences

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:21.310
between two narrative traditions is really
interesting and it’s not something you find

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.900
as much in, like, you know, Jane Eyre or Hamlet.
Anyway, Okonkwo is always running from this

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.920
deep down fear of weakness and failure, and
it gives him the drive to go from being a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.499
sharecropper to power and status and wealth.
It also makes him into kind of a jerk.

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:40.719
Okonkwo develops “one passion—to hate
everything that Unoka had loved. One of these

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.120
things was gentleness and another was idleness.”
There’s a great moment in the novel where

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.060
Achebe says Okonkwo, “seemed to walk on
springs, as if he was going to pounce on somebody.”

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.260
And then notes, “And he did pounce on people
quite often.”

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.800
This pouncing, and more generally just his
rage, eventually drive him to three transgressions

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.340
that he can’t undo, and his punishment
is seven years of exile.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.739
And then, of course, his dreams of greater
power within his clan dissolve. So let’s

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.840
look at Okonkwo’s first two big mistakes
in the Thought Bubble.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.590
Okonkwo’s world, much like the ancient Greek
world in Oedipus, is one where mistakes are

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.889
always punished. and he does get punished
for his three mistakes.

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.340
The first is his ferocious beating of one
of his wives during the Week of Peace, a week

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.370
when all violence is forbidden, to honor the
Earth goddess and make sure that this year’s

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.750
harvest will be bountiful.
Okonkwo doesn’t just break the Week of Peace,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.090
he shatters it. Not only does he beat his
wife for going to get her hair plaited rather

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.509
than cooking, he tries to shoot her. Luckily
for all involved, he is a terrible shot, and

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.319
he misses.
Side note, Okonkwo has a real problem with

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.560
women throughout the book. He’s consistently
brutal and violent, and the description that

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.430
he “rules his household with a heavy hand”
is an understatement.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.610
His brutality is closely connected to his
fear of anything that he perceives as gentle

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.419
or weak and his ignorant belief that those
traits should be associated with the feminine,

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.919
which the book itself later dispels by showing
one of his other wives and her courage and

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:04.979
strength when it comes to protecting her daughter.
Okonkwo’s second transgression is the killing

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:08.680
of a boy with his machete, and it’s not
just any young man. It’s Ikemefuna, who

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.210
Okonkwo raised in his house for three years,
a young man who called him Father.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.860
Ikemefuna had been turned over to the clan
as a sacrifice by another village in order

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.889
to avoid war and he’d been sent to live
in Okonkwo’s compound, where he became a

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.749
member of the family, and a great friend to
Okonkwo’s son.

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:27.020
And we’re told, “Okonkwo was inwardly
pleased at his son’s development, and he

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.050
knew it was due to Ikemefuna.” Of course
he never shows it, for “Okonkwo never showed

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.030
any emotion openly, unless it was the emotion
of anger.”

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.199
So eventually, the clan decided that Ikemefuna
should be killed to satisfy the Earth Goddess.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.219
And Okonkwo is advised not to participate,
due to his close relationship with the boy,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:48.040
but he ultimately does the killing himself, because
“He was afraid of being thought weak.”

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.960
Thanks Thought Bubble. Oh man, this is a sad
book. But it’s sad on, like, 82 different levels;

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.960
that’s what makes it so good.
So Okonkwo is finally exiled, not for beating

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:01.440
his wife, not for killing Ikemefuna, but for
an accident. His gun explodes during a funeral,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.110
and a man is killed. This is called a “female
ocho,” or female murder, because it was

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.830
not on purpose.
I’ll just briefly point to the irony of

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.470
his avoidance of all things feminine and also
the association of a gun exploding with femininity.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.560
Although it was an accident, Okonkwo had killed
a clan member and had offended the earth goddess,

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:23.750
and so he goes into exile. He and his family
flee the village and their home compound is

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.379
burned to the ground.
Now Okonkwo’s best friend, Obierka, who

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:32.860
helps Okonkwo during his exile, wonders, “Why
should a man suffer so grievously for an offense

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.940
he had committed inadvertently?”
As is often the case in the village, the answer

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.990
comes in the form of a proverb. “As the
elders said, if one finger brought oil it

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.080
soiled the others.” Okonkwo had done wrong,
and he must be exiled, or else the whole community

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.960
might be punished for what just he had done.
This attitude preys on the community’s fear

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.909
of being entirely destroyed along with their
communal memory of elders and ancestors.

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:59.720
And that desire to keep the community intact
at all costs is why the community ultimately

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.120
doesn’t follow Okonkwo at the end of the
novel.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.930
But then of course even though they don’t
follow him, the community can’t stay intact.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.980
Why? Well, because missionaries. And the British
Empire. Which are really branches of the same tree.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:16.180
When the first missionaries appear before Okonkwo
and his family, during their exile, only one young person

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.280
was truly captivated, Okonkwo’s first son, Nwoye.
And Okonkwo can sense his son slipping away,

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.360
and filled with his tragic rage, he tries
to control him by pinning him down at the

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.250
throat and threatening him.
And as you may know if you’ve ever tried

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.520
threatening a teenager, threats only drive
them further away, and after this incident,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.200
Nwoye joins the missionaries for good.
What can I say, Okonkwo, you should’ve read

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.280
more young adult novels.
And Okonkwo’s takeaway from this experience

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.949
is not that he’s a jerk, but instead that
his son is weak. He sits, staring into a fire,

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:53.569
and reflects upon his son’s departure and
remembers that people called him “the Roaring

00:07:53.569 --> 00:07:59.020
Flame.” And as he considers this, “Okonkwo’s
eyes were opened and he saw the whole matter

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:03.520
clearly. Living fire begets cold, impotent
ash.”

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.620
So Okonkwo decides that he was the roaring
flame and that his son is the cold, impotent ash.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:15.480
Oooh man, Okonkwo’s eyes get opened a lot in Things Fall Apart, but his eyes never actually get opened!

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.460
By the time Okonkwo returns from exile, a
Christian missionary church has arrived in

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:22.379
his own village, and many people have converted
to Christianity.

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:25.849
The first converts are those outcasts from
society, they’re not even allowed to cut

00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:27.879
their hair.
And that reminds us that it’s not only the

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:32.090
Europeans who at times have failed to see
human beings as human beings.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.210
So those outcasts are the initial converts
and it eventually leads to the arrival of

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.630
the British Empire and radical change in Igbo
society.

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:42.950
And in that we see how the community’s obsession
with strength and stability ultimately leads

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:46.770
to weakness and instability. Just as it does
in Okonkwo’s life.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.090
So the British Empire follows on the heels
of the church and sets up courts and police

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.700
and prisons and trading posts.
And then finally, Okonkwo’s world completely

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.880
crumbles.
We’ll talk more about that next week but

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.550
for today, I want to end with another author
who wrote about power in colonial Africa,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.140
Frantz Fanon, who talked about means of resistance.
In one of his most famous works about how

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:13.420
power operates, his final invocation, his
gesture of resistance is, 'O my body, make

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:18.290
of me always a man who questions!'
And maybe that’s where Okonkwo fell down.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.690
He isn’t able to question a system that
discards individuals for the perceived greater

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:26.570
good. And he isn’t able to question his
own narrow definition of strength.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.730
But let me submit to you that these problems
are not exclusive to 19th century Igboland.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:35.640
Like Okonkwo and his community, we both as
individuals and as communities also struggle

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:41.010
to see other human beings as human beings
and just as in Things Fall Apart, the consequences

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.730
are often disastrous. Thanks for watching.
I’ll see you next week.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.020
