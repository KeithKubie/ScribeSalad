In today's video,

00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:03.451
we're looking at a couple
of DJI products,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.460
the Mavic 2 Zoom and
the DJI smart controller.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.500
With that, we're also going
to be showing you a bit of

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.180
what Grant's been up to.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:19.180
[Music]

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.016
Hey guys, for those of you
who don't recognize me,

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:22.266
I'm Mark, the camera guy.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.047
I've been filming

00:00:23.047 --> 00:00:25.300
for The King of Random
for almost three years now.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.550
And since I'm the one
who's behind the camera,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.200
you usually don't see my face.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.800
But since DJI sent
us a couple of drones

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.104
and the new smart controller,

00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:35.420
me and Calli thought I
better get my own opinion.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.860
Now, I've flown
all sorts of drones,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.300
and honestly, DJI is
my favorite brand.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.725
My two favorite drones
are the Mavic Air,

00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:42.960
and the Mavic 2 Zoom.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.685
The Mavic Air for its small
lightweight form factor,

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:46.731
and the Mavic 2 Zoom

00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:48.400
because it has
the zoom lens on it.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.400
So DJI did give us
these drones for free.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.827
They didn't pay us to say
anything special about it.

00:00:52.827 --> 00:00:54.749
They just wanted me
to give an honest opinion

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.500
about what I think
about the drones.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.500
They also give us

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.300
an extra Mavic 2 Zoom
so we can give that one away.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.500
So if you want
to win this drone,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.798
stick around to the end
of the video,

00:01:02.798 --> 00:01:03.700
and we will tell you how.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.610
And let's do a quick unboxing
of the DJI smart controller.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:17.800
[Music]

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.300
All right, sweet.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.770
So here's the controller.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.960
It looks pretty cool.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.420
Oh, I like the heft.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.540
It has a good amount
of weight to it.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.892
I like the flip up antennas
that reveal two joysticks.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.940
That's pretty cool.

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.560
[Music]

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.080
It has some pretty
standard buttons on here,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.600
similar to what other
DJI controllers have.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.700
That start up has a really
nice bright display.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.600
So that's pretty cool.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.560
[Music]

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.760
I will just quickly do
the setup for the controller.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.540
Go into the quick tutorial.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.116
Peeling off some stickers.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.100
Oh sweet, it looks like it has
an HDMI port, SD card slot,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.253
and a USB port.

00:01:57.253 --> 00:01:58.380
I wonder what that one is for.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.040
Yeah, I really like
this 5.5 inch display.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.000
And the touch screen
is really nice,

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.400
just like any other smartphone.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.915
Okay.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.420
Let's see what else
comes in the box.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.560
It looks like a power cable,
an extra set of joysticks.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.260
Oh, and the pretty
hefty wall wart.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.110
All right, sweet!

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.670
Let's take this over
to Nate and Calli,

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.400
and show it off.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.300
Hey guys, have you guys seen
the new DJI smart controller?

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.100
Sweet.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.600
It's got a 5.5
inch screen built-in.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.900
It's full HD, 1080p.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.900
It has the OcuSync 2.0,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.600
which gives you 8 kilometers
of connection with the Drone.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.400
Holy cow.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.100
It runs Android operating system

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.190
so you can like
download third-party apps.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.300
Can I play Angry Birds?

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.470
I don't know.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.040
I'm gonna try.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.140
[Music]

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.700
I'm very impressed

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.300
that you can just play this
on this controller.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.213
That's awesome.

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:52.330
Hey, what do I did?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.570
Do I-- No, I'm helping.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.452
&gt;&gt; I'm--
&gt;&gt; You're not helping.

00:02:54.452 --> 00:02:54.976
I'm helping.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.840
&gt;&gt; Not helping.
&gt;&gt; I'm helping.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.000
&gt;&gt; Very unhelpful.
&gt;&gt; I'm helping.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.800
What am I doing?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.993
What am I supposed to be doing?

00:02:58.993 --> 00:02:59.642
Ruining things.

00:02:59.642 --> 00:03:00.620
Look at that, how I helped.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.500
Ruining things.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.700
I ruined?

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.700
I fixed it.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.450
So you said that you've already
kind of field tested this,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.600
and you like it, right?

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.939
Yeah, I like it a lot.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.400
So we need more footage.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.177
We need to see.

00:03:11.177 --> 00:03:12.110
I think we gotta--

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.600
Yeah, we got to take this thing
out, and see what it does.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.100
Go.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.600
I want to see.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.713
I wanna see what
this looks like.

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:17.900
Sweet, I'll take it
out to the desert.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.280
Cool.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.400
Hey, you guys want
to come with me?

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.540
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.300
Okay.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:06:45.580
[Music]

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.960
Yeehaw!

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.800
It's a little bit
frosty out today,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.858
but we made it happen for you.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.320
All right, we got it.

00:06:52.323 --> 00:06:53.300
That was cool.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.500
That was amazing.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.900
So, would you recommend
this to everyone?

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.300
Probably not everyone.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.200
It's kind of like
a niche market I feel

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.480
like for who should buy this.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.660
People probably already know
if they need it or not.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.530
So if you're debating on
whether you should get it,

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:08.600
I say go ahead and get it.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.200
What are-- What are like the top
two reasons you should use that,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.729
instead of the original
controller with your phone?

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:14.840
Because it was beautiful.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.400
The footage that we got
in the desert was phenomenal.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.894
Yeah.

00:07:17.894 --> 00:07:20.207
Definitely with that
1000 nit display

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:23.023
on here versus like what,
it's like 700 or 800 nits.

00:07:23.023 --> 00:07:24.200
It's a lot brighter.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.100
It's just built in.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.290
You don't have to worry
about having your phone charged

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.450
and the controller charged.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.600
You can just charge this,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.400
and be good for two
and a half hours.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.300
Guys, check the link
in the description

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.965
for how to enter to win
your very own Mavic 2 Zoom.

00:07:35.965 --> 00:07:37.565
This is still sealed in the box.

00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:38.590
This is a cool drone.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.400
You can get good footage
of this thing.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.980
It may--

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.120
It's the same.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.000
&gt;&gt; It may--
&gt;&gt; It's the same.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.740
It make it shipped out.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:45.340
It may--

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.660
Calli might steal--

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.680
We'll make sure to get
it back from her.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Hey guys, thanks for watching.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.785

That's it for now.

00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:01.500
Have fun.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.200
Be safe.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.000
See you tomorrow.
