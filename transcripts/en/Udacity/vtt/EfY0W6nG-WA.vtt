00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.750
&gt;&gt; That's a good answer, David. Note that David did several things in coming up

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:46.400
with his answer. First, he made sure that his answer covers all these signs and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.210
symptoms. This is the principle of coverage. We want to make

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.660
sure that the diagnostic conclusion actually accounts for all the input data.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.980
Second, we chose a single hypothesis over a combination of hypothesis, although

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.090
the combination could have explain this data as well. This is the principle of

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.030
parsimony. In general, we want a simple hypothesis for explaining the entire

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.300
data. Third, these hypotheses can have greatest interactions between them, and

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.950
these interactions can make your diagnostic task quite complicated.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.121
Fourth, they would use the term explanation. This is an important aspect for

00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:27.556
diagnosis. We want a set of hypotheses that could explain the input data.

00:01:27.556 --> 00:01:31.570
Now this [UNKNOWN] we did it in this simple exercise, because there is one

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.830
single disease that can, in fact, explain all the input data. What would

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.930
happen if there was no single hypothesis that could cover the entire input data?

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.790
Or what would happen if there were multiple hypotheses that could equally well

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.730
explain the input data? [UNKNOWN] diagnostic task can be quite complicated.
