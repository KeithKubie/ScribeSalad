GLENN FRANKEL: Let me do
some Google analytics.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.070
How many of you have seen
"The Searchers"?

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.550
All right.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.230
We got pretty much
the whole group.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.020
And anybody here from Texas?

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.300
Ever hear of Cynthia
Ann Parker?

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.410
Yes.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.740
All right.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.560
Well, that's a start.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.490
I had never heard of
Cynthia Ann Parker.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.910
I grew up in Rochester,
New York.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.220
So Texas was just what I saw in
a John Ford movie, mostly.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.200
But I did know "The Searchers,"
and I wasn't the

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.030
only one, of course.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.570
A lot of people saw it when
they were young, including

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.220
Steven Spielberg and George
Lucas and Martin Scorsese.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.970
And it was a really formative
film for them and launched

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.870
them on their careers.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.200
It was a formative
film for me too.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.560
I ended up being a journalist
and saw it again several times

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.260
along the way.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.440
And I was moved by it.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.810
It's a very powerful--

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.400
for those of you who have seen
it know it's a very powerful

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.560
and unsettling film
in many ways.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.440
And after spending years abroad
and coming back to the

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.550
US and then going out to
Stanford University to teach

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.720
journalism, I wanted to
do an American book.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.820
And "The Searchers" seemed
like a great

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.850
subject for a book.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.240
Again, I got on Google.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.210
Google has a lot to do with
getting me started on this,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.710
because I got on and noticed
right away first of all, there

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.430
wasn't a mainstream book
about "The Searchers."

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.340
But with another click or
two, I found that--

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.810
I thought OK, so I'll do a
making of the movie book, a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.050
fairly standard thing--

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.370
John Ford, John Wayne.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.750
That'll be fine.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.290
But it only took a couple more
clicks searching around to

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.150
find Cynthia Ann Parker and to
find that, to my surprise,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.570
this incredible movie was
actually loosely based on

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.690
something that had really
happened, a nine-year-old girl

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.960
being kidnapped by Comanches
in Texas.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.040
So that just sort of changed--
it didn't change the focus,

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.150
but it just sort of expanded
the whole thing from being

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.500
making of the movie to something
that covered,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.370
frankly, in the end, 150 years
and about not only going to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.590
Hollywood and then to Monument
Valley, but also to Texas and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.150
many, many more archives.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.230
And it became a long and
fascinating trek for me.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.360
But it all begins
back in 1836.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.130
So Cynthia Ann Parker was part
of a family that's kind of one

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.040
of your iconic American
pioneer families.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.720
They started out in Maryland
and Virginia, before the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:38.990
Revolutionary War.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.710
Her grandfather fights in
the Revolutionary War.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.240
Then they head first
down to Georgia.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.890
Then they go to Tennessee,
then to Illinois.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.310
You could kind of say
they failed West.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.360
Each place they went
they tried to farm.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.200
They tried to establish
a life.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.110
Some of them were preachers.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.740
A lot of them were farmers.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.610
They were both actually.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.930
And when they ran out of soil,
or they wore out their

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.490
welcome, they would
move further west.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.420
They were sort of kicking down
the doors of Western expansion

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.530
the whole time.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.980
And eventually a couple of them,
specifically, her uncle

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.210
James goes down to Texas at a
time when it's still a Mexican

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:21.440
colony, and where white folks,
American folks, can come and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.710
get a large quantity of land for
just a few hundred dollars

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.560
and start new.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.980
And so Uncle James heads
back up to Illinois.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.870
And in the end, about 40 members
of the family had on

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.700
down, along with dozens of
other folks from a couple

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.010
rural communities in Illinois.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.910
And they make their
way to Texas.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.900
The Parkers set up
a farming area.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.240
Well, they split up.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.330
Some of them head to basically
where most of the white

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.240
settlement was in East Texas.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.910
But some of them, with good old
Uncle James, moved further

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.860
to the north and west into the
beginning of Indian territory.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.970
The land's good there.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.260
There's not a lot of competition
to farm there.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.580
And they build themselves
a fortified settlement.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.140
But a lot of things happened in
1836 in Texas, as some of

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.825
you may know, including the
Alamo and the defeat of Santa

00:04:12.825 --> 00:04:16.500
Ana, and the declaration
of a republic.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.660
They had to leave their
fortified settlement for

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.279
several weeks.

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:22.980
And by the time they got back
to it, they were running out

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.110
of time to plant.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.380
They planted in a hurry.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.000
They left the gates of the
settlement wide open, the sort

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.090
of fortified area.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.420
And sooner or later, a
group of Comanches

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.280
and Kiowa come down.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.090
This is in May 1836.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.760
And we don't know exactly
what triggered what.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.620
They didn't have CCTV or video
cameras recording the results

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.420
on the stockade walls.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.090
But the Indians killed five men
there, including Cynthia

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.100
Ann's father, her uncle,
her grandfather.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.940
And they abducted five young
people, including

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.260
nine-year-old Cynthia Ann.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:01.600
And they hauled them off
to Comanche territory.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.725
And Uncle James survived
that raid.

00:05:04.725 --> 00:05:07.630
He helped take folks
back to safety.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.180
And then he set out to try
to find these kids.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.490
He had help along the way.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:14.920
Sometimes he had a large
group with him.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.830
Sometimes it was just him.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.920
And eventually he helped
recover four of them.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.530
But he never found
Cynthia Ann.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.570
And she ended up spending 24
years with the Comanches.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.440
She married a Comanche.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.630
She had three Comanche
children.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.542
She became for all intents
and purposes a Comanche.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:36.790
The Comanches, if they'd had a
team of psychologists, they

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.670
couldn't have come up with a
better system for taking young

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.820
people and Indianizing them.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.750
These sort of tough young men
would haul you off and

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.940
brutalize you on the way home.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.350
But when you got there, if you
were young and of a certain

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.230
age, you would be adopted by a
Comanche family, because birth

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.340
rate was low.

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.800
People died.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.120
Infant mortality was high.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.150
So Cynthia Ann was, as far as we
know, probably adopted by a

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.170
family and treated
very warmly.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.100
And so within a year or so, most
of these kids would lose

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.080
their Anglo-Saxon roots,
whatever they were, including

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:10.525
their language.

00:06:10.525 --> 00:06:15.010
And they would really
become Comanches.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.900
And she spent 24 years
with them.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.170
Meanwhile, as I say, Uncle James
spent something like

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.180
seven or eight years
looking for her.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.920
He wrote a rather plaintive
narrative about it in the

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.600
early 1840s, where he cast
himself as one of the sort of

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.340
classic figures from the
American West, the man who

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.140
knows Indians.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:33.915
He knows their lore.

00:06:33.915 --> 00:06:35.440
He knows their customs.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.050
Often the man who knows Indians
is also an Indian

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.180
fighter or sometimes
an Indian hater.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.810
And Uncle James was certainly
all of that.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.320
And he was unsuccessful.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.710
I mean the other four kids, as
I say, they got them back

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:49.660
slowly but surely, but
not Cynthia Ann.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.820
And so his book is this effort
to explain his own version of

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.500
what happened during the raid,
why the doors and the gates

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.950
were open, all those things.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.850
So right from the beginning,
people are taking this basic

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.790
simple story of the abduction of
a little girl, and they're

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.100
starting to retell it and to
embroider it a bit, change the

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.510
parts they don't like, parts
that don't fit their own

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.780
sensibility, and then giving
us another version.

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.490
And Uncle James, in that sense,
is one of the first

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.270
storytellers.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.320
When I first thought I'd do
the book, I thought well,

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.760
there'll be one chapter near the
beginning about captivity

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.510
narratives, because
"The Searchers"

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:26.850
is a captivity narrative.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.880
Well, I had no idea, though,
as I started expanding my

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.390
concept of what this was, how
important captivity narratives

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.510
were in early America.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.760
Turns out they were like our
first literary genre,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.580
distinctly American genre.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.480
They date back to the 1680s.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.790
Mary Rowlandson, a woman who was
kidnapped with two of her

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.210
children by Narragansset Indians
in New England, had

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:54.410
the first best seller
in America.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.020
And it was about her
time in captivity.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.870
And their stories, and at the
time Cynthia Ann was kidnapped

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:06.330
in 1836, three of the four
bestselling books were James

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.230
Fenimore Cooper novels,
including "The Last of the

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.920
Mohicans." And all of those
books had captivity narrative

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.560
themes running through them.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.570
And then the fourth one was
about Mary Jemison, who was

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.330
kidnapped by Seneca Indians
actually, not far from where I

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.790
grew up in Rochester,
New York.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:25.320
So this really inflamed
people's imaginations.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.090
The idea of women and children
being hauled off into the

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:35.100
forest primeval by these men,
by these savages, became one

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:40.520
of those sort of scary but in
some ways attractive themes.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.020
There's a lot of psychosexual
connotations to being taken

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:47.610
off by native men.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.170
And one of the sort of themes
that came out of that is

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.490
something called "a fate
worse than death"--

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:59.060
the idea that women could be
taken by Indians and forced to

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.210
have sex with an Indian or to
marry an Indian, whether

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:04.380
willingly or unwillingly.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.930
This was one of the
things that made

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.130
these books so popular.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:11.940
And again, there's one of the
themes of the conquest of the

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:17.000
West, because if the indigenous
peoples are taking

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.640
our families and destroying them
in this way, we need to

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.940
conquer them to protect
our families.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.200
And it becomes one of the
justifications for a lot of

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.120
imperial action, including
in Texas.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.680
Because once you get the
Comanches and the Texans at

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.980
war with each other, Comanches
are abducting a lot of people.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.470
They need to abduct people to
run-- they've got a great

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.860
economy of horsemanship
and buffalo.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.230
And they have a low
birth rate.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.520
And so they need people.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.490
Mostly they're kidnapping
people from Mexico.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.370
But when the Texans start
settling in the area, they

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.125
become fair game as well.

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:53.170
And there's a 40-year war
between Texans and

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:54.050
Comanches going on.

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.510
It's the longest war really ever
fought on American soil.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.160
And it's a very intimate war.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.190
They didn't have drones.

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.990
You looked at your enemy
when you killed him.

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.920
And families weren't just like
the collateral damage.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.025
Oh, we're really sorry that
we killed your child.

00:10:12.025 --> 00:10:13.240
We didn't mean too.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:13.620
Uh uh.

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.060
That wasn't what it was about.

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:18.560
It was very much about
destroying the

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.590
other side's family.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.330
It was about crushing
their culture.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:23.950
It was about conquest.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:24.530
And this thing--

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.690
as I say, this was a
40-year struggle.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.750
And Cynthia Ann, in many ways,
became sort of a symbol of

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.590
this for the Texans.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.910
She became this mythic white
Comanche princess.

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:37.510
They didn't know
where she was.

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.510
There were a couple of sightings
over the years.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.330
Some were imaginary, fiction.

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.680
Others were real.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.030
But they couldn't find her, and
the Comanches would hide

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.410
her when the time came.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:50.090
And as I say, she grew up
to become a Comanche.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.570
She had three children.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.260
And so the story was told.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.620
It was kind of bubbling
out there.

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.890
And then in 1860--

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:02.040
and so we're talking 24 years
after she's first abducted--

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.410
she's involved in
another raid.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.460
Only this time, not Indians
attacking her home.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.970
It's US Cavalry and Texas
Rangers attacking her village.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.530
And they kill the people
around her again.

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.850
Strange men come, speaking
a language she doesn't

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.610
understand and kill
a lot of people.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.940
And they're about to kill her,
but somebody notices that this

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:27.540
woman who looks all Comanche
has blue eyes.

00:11:27.540 --> 00:11:29.690
And so they don't shoot her.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:32.920
And she kind of cries out
Americano, Americano.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.890
She speaks no English.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.510
She speaks a bit of Spanish
and Comanche.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:37.980
So they take her and
her little baby

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.120
daughter who's with her.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.600
And they take her back to Camp
Cooper in North Texas.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.280
And they figure out pretty
quickly that she's got to be

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.930
the legendary Cynthia
Ann Parker.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.210
And they get ahold of her Uncle
Isaac, and he comes out

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.710
in the buckboard from
about 90 miles away.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:58.210
And she listens to him talk to
the commander and get the

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:59.020
circumstances.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.240
And at one point, she pops up
and hits herself in the chest,

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.950
saying "Me, Cinny Ann.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.960
Me, Cinny Ann."

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.770
So it was clear who she was.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.950
Uncle Isaac's going
to take her home.

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:12.610
She doesn't want to go.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.260
She's got two Comanche
sons back somewhere.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:16.560
And she's got a Comanche
husband.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.120
And that's her life.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.350
But she has no choice.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:24.680
So she begs the commander, if
you see my sons, be sure to

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.280
find them and-- you
know, call me up.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.680
Let me know.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.130
And she goes off with
her Uncle Isaac.

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:33.170
And not surprisingly,
it's not a very good

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:36.510
fit after 24 years.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:39.940
It was very hard for people
who had been captive, who

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.570
crossed that sort of invisible
border, if you will, from one

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.990
culture to another, and cultures
who were at war with

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.690
each other.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.720
Very hard to come back.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:52.150
Her family was actually-- her
Texan family was actually very

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.400
kind to her.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:59.760
But they couldn't grasp what had
happened to her, nor the

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.910
fact that she wasn't grateful to
be restored to a Christian

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.810
redemptive situation.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.600
They couldn't quite get it.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.190
And she, of course, didn't
understand them.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.600
So for a while she's kind
of a minor celebrity.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.610
They take her to the state
legislature, and they get her

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.640
a parcel of land
and an annuity.

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.410
They show her off.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:24.300
There's one sort of sad scene of
her being put on a soapbox

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.260
outside a store in Fort Worth
and kids being let out of

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.220
school early to go
look at her.

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:31.190
And she's crying.

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.150
Because it's very hard for her
to process any of this.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.850
There are a couple photos of
her where she looks like a

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.040
deer in the headlights,
really.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.380
So eventually to her family,
she becomes not so much the

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.610
celebrity but an
embarrassment.

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.070
They don't know what
to do with her.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.250
And eventually, they pack her
off to a family sawmill in

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:55.150
East Texas about
100 miles away.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.390
And we don't know exactly
when she died.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.240
There's no obituary of
this mini-celebrity.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.410
And there's no real sense of
what had happened to her

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.130
during those 24 years when she
was with the Comanches.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:07.120
She doesn't leave a narrative.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.390
She doesn't give-- nobody really
ever does a thorough

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.360
job of interviewing her.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.410
Which, in a way, is great
for the myth, right?

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:18.000
Because people can just imagine
whatever they want.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.370
Texans can imagine whatever
they want about her life.

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.330
And Comanches, turns
out, do the same.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.950
They have their own oral version
of her life and times.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:28.000
And theirs is very
romanticized.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.820
And in the Texans' version,
she's beaten up, and all this.

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.270
But neither one is based on
anything near that we could

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.440
begin to call fact.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.100
And what happens is eventually
her little girl dies, probably

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.340
of typhus or one of the diseases
raging through

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.775
periodically.

00:14:44.775 --> 00:14:48.280
And soon afterward, Cynthia
Ann dies as well.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.405
In the legend, it all takes
place in 1864, and she dies of

00:14:51.405 --> 00:14:54.430
a broken heart, immediately
after Prairie Flower, her

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:55.750
daughter, dies.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.170
But the fact is there's--

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:01.220
a researcher I know came up with
the 1870 census and found

00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:04.540
Cynthia Ann's name in the 1870
census from Anderson County.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.090
So we know she lived
that long.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.130
But we know she died
miserably.

00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.280
Even though her sons and the
Comanche community was maybe

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.150
100, 150 miles away, that could
have been the other side

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.590
of the moon, because
they were at war.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.630
At one point, the family gets
a translator to come by or

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.570
someone, a scout, who
knows Comanche.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:30.280
And Cynthia Ann just goes
crazy, because she has

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.570
somebody to talk to.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:35.290
But all she wants from this guy,
Coho Smith, is begging--

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:39.980
she begs him to take her back
to Comancheria, to her home.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.230
She'll give them anything.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.200
They will.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:43.780
She assures him, the
village will give

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.620
him anything he wants.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:45.820
They'll give him horses.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.910
They'll give him women.

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.340
Anything, because her husband
will pay for her ransom.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:56.190
And Smith basically says to
her, if I take you, your

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:57.530
people will kill me.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.140
And she assures him
they won't.

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.630
And he says, and if they don't
kill me, once I get back here,

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:05.720
these folks will kill me.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.510
Because you're just not
allowed to do it.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:11.100
There's no passport you can have
that allows you to cross

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.410
this border.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.510
And so she never gets back.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.210
She dies in obscurity.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.290
And what she doesn't know, and
really the only saving grace

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.250
of all this, is that one of her
Comanche sons, the only

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:27.780
one who survives to adulthood,
whose name is Quanah, becomes

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.730
a rather noteworthy and
important person in Native

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:33.510
American history.

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:37.630
He spent the first half of his
life being a nomadic warrior

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.110
on the High Plains in Texas.

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.950
But then when Comanche power
is really finally crushed

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.740
around 1875, and the last
Comanche straggle in to the

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.340
Indian agency in what's now
Oklahoma, he comes in.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.020
But unlike many of the others,
he gets a pretty good sense of

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:55.910
what the situation is.

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:01.130
And he becomes kind of a
middleman conciliator, part

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:06.589
politician, part businessman,
and becomes their spokesman.

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:08.619
They're only down to-- the
Comanches were down to less

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:10.790
than 3,000 people by then.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:12.390
And they were doomed, really.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.020
It was much more dangerous in
a way to be a ward of the

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.380
American government than it had
been to be an enemy of the

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.240
American government
on the Plains.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.470
Because they were out not to
kill you, but to destroy your

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.240
culture, and to make you into
little white people.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:27.130
That was the way that the
progressives, who were the

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:29.780
Indians' best friends,
thought was the only

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.450
path to survival then.

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.550
Get rid of their language.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:33.490
Cut off their braids.

00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:35.710
Put them in little white
people's clothes.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.110
Send them off to schools, where
they would be taught

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.840
those things.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.150
And get this whole Comanche
thing out of their system.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.260
Make them Christians.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.340
Forget their own religion.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:49.010
All of it.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.410
Monogamy, land.

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:53.120
Eventually, they were
given land.

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.070
They'd never farmed.

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:55.000
They didn't know how to farm.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.460
They didn't want to farm.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.990
But all this went on.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.310
Well, Quanah eventually took
his mother's last name--

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.030
Parker-- took the family name
and made contact with the

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:04.715
Texan Parkers.

00:18:04.715 --> 00:18:07.820
And remember, all this time,
Cynthia Ann's basically got

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.050
two families now, right?

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.700
She's got these Comanches
family, but the original Texan

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.420
family exists also.

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.410
And Quanah makes efforts to
contact them and eventually is

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:20.480
successful.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:23.090
So he's a very interesting
figure over a

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.040
long period of time.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.150
He befriends Teddy Roosevelt
and also some wealthy white

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.740
ranchers in Texas, who
are taking their

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.010
cattle through Oklahoma.

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:35.190
And they lease to these wealthy
guys grasslands while

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.920
they're going through.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.860
So the Comanches do
reasonably well.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.910
Quanah builds a big house
called the Star House.

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.990
He put 12 stars on the roof so
he could outrank any general

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:45.225
who showed up.

00:18:45.225 --> 00:18:47.890
He had Teddy Roosevelt
to dinner.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.010
Teddy Roosevelt promises him one
night that he's going to

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:53.030
bring buffalo back
to Oklahoma.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:55.660
And sure enough, like a couple
years later, a train pulls up

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:58.960
with 15 bison from
the Bronx Zoo.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.910
And they unload them.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.290
And they take them up north of
where Quanah's house is.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:02.980
And those bison--

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.650
there are now more than 600 of
them in the Wichita Mountains

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:07.830
game reserve.

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:11.290
So that's kind of like Quanah's
legacy, that kind of

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.490
thing, keeping his
people alive.

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.550
Some of them didn't love him,
because they thought he was

00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:20.130
like a sell-out and a white guy,
because he's half white.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.970
As for the white folks, they
admired him because he was

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.210
half-white.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.340
He's very smart.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.280
That's because he's
half-white, right?

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.580
So he's the "noble
savage" for them.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.660
He's the good Indian,
not the barbarian.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.530
But the reason he's a good
Indian is because he's

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.220
actually half-white.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.390
And he goes along with this
to a great extent.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.470
And he cites his mother and
who she was and her being

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:52.500
white as the reason why he is
this great conciliator.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.960
So he's a storyteller.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.710
He doesn't write a book
or anything like that.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.580
But Quanah is telling the
story of his mother to

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.400
explain who he is.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.630
So it's a very rich kind
of mythic thing

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:03.680
building up over the years.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:06.310
He dies in 1911.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:08.720
The story takes a bit of a rest
here and there, but the

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.070
two sides of the family
begin to get together.

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:15.720
And in 1936, the hundredth
celebration of Texas

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.710
independence and also of this
raid, the two sides of the

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.510
family get together at the site
of the original raid.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.930
The State of Texas builds
a new replica of

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:26.410
the original fort.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.170
And they reenact the raid.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.160
The Comanche Parkers play the
Comanches, and the white

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.310
Parkers play the
white settlers.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.940
And there they are.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.760
So it's 100 years, and they
sell-- and incidentally, it

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:40.830
was in Groesbeck, Texas.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.460
There was an ice cream
parlor there.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:45.340
And they name the ice cream
after Cynthia Ann.

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:49.150
So it's already Americans
reinventing this stuff, having

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.140
a good time with it, but using
it to explain who they are.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:58.540
And then it drifts on, in many
ways, told, and the families

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.240
begin to have reunions
and get together.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.980
Meanwhile, I pick it up again
in the early 1950s, when a

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:09.200
Hollywood screenwriter and
western novelist named Alan

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.580
LeMay comes along.

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.540
And Alan's in his late 40s,
and he's been working in

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:15.490
Hollywood for a while.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.210
He's written a bunch
of western novels

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:18.340
that did pretty well.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:20.830
But at one point, Alan needed
more money than he was making

00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:21.550
from the novels.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.950
So he starts doing movies.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.390
And he works for Cecil
B. DeMille.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:29.270
And it's kind of a hand
to mouth existence.

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:32.140
And he's up there in the Texas
panhandle doing a B movie that

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:36.060
he's actually directing, when
he hears about Quanah Parker

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.930
and Cynthia Ann.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.020
And he travels down
to East Texas and

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.640
meets some of the Parkers.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.460
Curiously, they remember that he
talked to them not so much

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.490
about Cynthia Ann, but
about Uncle James.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.970
He was interested in what the
deal was with Uncle James,

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.460
what he tried to do,
how did it work.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.300
And Alan then begins
to work on a novel.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.930
As I say, he's worn out.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:00.620
He's tired of Hollywood.

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:03.030
And he wants to get back to
what he really knows best,

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.200
which is writing westerns.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.310
And he writes "The Searchers."
And "The Searchers"--

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:10.950
he changes some things-- a lot
of things-- from the original

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:14.530
story, including the names of
the central characters.

00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:19.400
He moves the date up from
1836 to 1868, to

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.090
after the Civil War.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.660
That allows him to play off that
a little, but I think he

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:25.440
did a lot because he
liked the munitions

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.340
better after the war.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.320
There were repeating rifles
and things like that.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.600
Alan knew a lot about horses.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:33.375
He knew a lot about cattle.

00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:34.890
He knew a lot about munitions.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:37.010
And he just kind of did
what he wanted to do.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:38.580
And he took about 60--

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:42.340
in his notes, you find like 65
different captivity narratives

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.805
stories listed.

00:22:43.805 --> 00:22:46.970
And he smushed the parts
together that interested him.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.670
But the basic thing
is Cynthia Ann.

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.150
And he creates two searchers--

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:56.000
the uncle and then
a younger sort of

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.180
nephew, adopted nephew.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:03.270
And they go and search
for seven years.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:07.510
And the book did rather well.

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:13.040
And then some folks came along,
looking for a novel, or

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.790
looking for a story to give
to a man named John Ford.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.630
And they came up with
"The Searchers."

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.200
So let me stop there
and get into John

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.490
Ford just for a minute.

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.890
John Ford's one of
those folks.

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:26.560
He won four Academy Awards for
Best Director, more than

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.240
anyone else has ever won.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.470
He was one of the great
directors of his time.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:35.260
But I don't know, how many folks
here have seen John,

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.600
other than "The Searchers"--

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.210
have seen John Ford films
over the years?

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.500
The older crowd.

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.280
Yeah.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.540
I have too.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.840
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.630
Ford didn't invent
the Western.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:50.800
But his career begins in 1917.

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.270
His first movie he directs
is a silent in 1917.

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.670
It's called "Tornado."
It's a Western.

00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:57.660
And time and time again, through
the course of his

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.330
career, he comes back
to Westerns.

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.400
He never won an Academy
Award for a Western.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.160
They were considered kind of,
you know, popular genre, a

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.190
little cheap.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:07.890
They were entertainment.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:11.160
He won for "Grapes of Wrath"
or "The Informer," really

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.890
very-- which are wonderful
films, incidentally.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:17.310
"How Green Was My Valley,"
"The Quiet Man."

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.670
But he always came
back to Westerns.

00:24:20.670 --> 00:24:23.900
And along the way, he acquired
a sort of stable of people he

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:25.940
would work with, who would
put up with him.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.070
He was a real dictator.

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:28.370
He was a lifelong alcoholic.

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:32.290
He was incredibly abusive to
members of his own family and

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.720
frankly to his cast and crew.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.470
But they were loyal to him in
part because it was steady

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.830
work and in part because they
knew when they were working

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:46.510
with Ford, they were working
on something special.

00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.500
And he makes some Westerns
that really are quite

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.730
enduring. "Stagecoach," which is
the movie that breaks out a

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:54.600
young actor, B movie actor named
John Wayne, and makes

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.590
him a star.

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:59.610
And Wayne becomes part of Ford's
entourage, if you will.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.790
They'd been drinking buddies
before then.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:04.400
But now Ford uses him
again and again.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.850
And Wayne, who's a very loyal
guy, is always there

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.460
when Ford needs him.

00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:12.920
And so by the time we're talking
about "The Searchers,"

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.750
and this is now 1954, Ford is 60
years old, and he's a mess.

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.620
When you're 60 years old in
those days, and you're

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:24.290
drinking and smoking at the
level he was, you're heading

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.990
for the end pretty quickly.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.000
And he just had gallbladder
surgery.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.390
He'd just been working on a film
called "Mr. Roberts," and

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.990
it'd ended poorly.

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.890
There's a scene, actually at
the beginning of the book,

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.020
where he punches his star, Henry
Fonda-- who was another

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.540
dear friend and drinking
buddy--

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.440
punches him in the
face one day.

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.600
Because he's upset, because
Fonda's upset with the way

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.990
Ford's directing the movie.

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.350
Ford's on it too, and
he's drinking.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.820
So things end badly with
"Mr. Roberts" for him.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.500
They take him off the film,
basically, and give it to

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:53.800
Mervyn LeRoy.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.800
He comes out of the hospital.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.840
And, as often happened in Ford's
career, some of his

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.400
loyal friends basically-- they
don't stage an intervention.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.290
Nobody intervenes
with John Ford.

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:09.320
But they do rescue him in the
sense that they come up with

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.750
"The Searchers." they
find this novel.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.490
A guy named Merian C.
Cooper, who was

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.070
Ford's business partner--

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.480
we think all the independent
film companies started today.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.830
But that's not really true.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.520
The indies started long ago.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.210
And Ford and Cooper had
one called Argosy.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:25.780
And Cooper reads this
book, and thinks

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:29.000
it's perfect for Ford.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.080
And Ford agrees.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.660
And Cooper not only does that,
he lines up a money man named

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:36.810
Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney.

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:39.700
So that's Vanderbilt
and Whitney, right?

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.810
Two huge American fortunes.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.170
And he wants to get
into the movies.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.790
He wants to make movies.

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.090
He wants to get his name out.

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.382
He's interested in Hollywood
starlets.

00:26:51.382 --> 00:26:53.390
He puts up the money.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:57.080
They get Warner Brothers to put
up about a third and to

00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.530
agree to distribute it.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:26:59.610
And off they go.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:01.370
And Ford takes his crew--

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:05.050
the wranglers, the stuntmen, the
camera people, all these

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.210
folks who work in the John Ford
stock company, if you

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.520
will, as they were called.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.340
And he goes back to his favorite
location, which is

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.820
Monument Valley.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.752
All right, who's been there?

00:27:16.752 --> 00:27:20.274
Have you been to Texas?

00:27:20.274 --> 00:27:24.394
Does Monument Valley look
a lot like Texas?

00:27:24.394 --> 00:27:25.644
Nah.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.290
Monument Valley looks like
we think, growing up in

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:34.490
Rochester, New York, how you
might think Texas should look.

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:37.800
It's big and tall and vertical
and dry and relentless and

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.810
very dramatic.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.270
Texas doesn't look like that.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:45.180
But the opening scene of "The
Searchers" says "Texas 1868."

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.280
The panel goes away.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.225
The door opens.

00:27:47.225 --> 00:27:49.830
And you're in Monument Valley.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:51.920
Because that's where Ford liked
to film his Westerns.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.060
He liked to film them, because
it was visually such a

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:56.700
stunning place.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:58.850
It was such a dramatic
setting.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:02.210
So you had all this literally
monumental

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:04.505
geography as the backdrop.

00:28:04.505 --> 00:28:07.520
Its a little like Shakespeare,
going to the Globe Theatre and

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.720
telling you he's doing a Danish
prince there, that

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.570
you're in Denmark, or you're
in Italy with star-crossed

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:14.810
lovers or something.

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.830
Shakespeare did them all at the
Globe Theatre and set them

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:19.930
in different places, but they're
all taking place in

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.160
the same place.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.250
And Ford did about, in the
end, about seven films in

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.610
Monument Valley.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.650
This one is the most beautiful
in many ways.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.230
He's got VistaVision, this
technique that they

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.010
used for a few years.

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.520
So they're filming
with two cameras.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.740
And the colors are wonderful.

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.780
And the whole drama
of it is great.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:40.810
And he sets to work.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.810
And remember, as I say,
he's 60 years old.

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.450
He's made many Westerns over
the years, but Ford's the

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.350
great myth maker.

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:50.670
You know Westerns are just
good stories, right?

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:55.590
I mean, cowboys and Indians
or good guys and bad guys.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.110
There are shoot-em-ups.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:57.060
There's horses.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:00.870
Ford himself once said that
filming a man on a horse is

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:04.800
the most cinematic thing I can
think of, just riding along a

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.130
beautiful spot of land.

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:09.310
That's movie making.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.505
So we had that going.

00:29:10.505 --> 00:29:12.670
And Ford, as I say, had
become the master of

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:13.480
that over the years.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.940
So this gave him the opportunity
really to

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.060
rehabilitate himself and
to prove himself again.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.770
And they go out there
to Monument Valley.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:24.150
The other advantage of it is
it's 650 miles from Hollywood.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:27.330
It's very hard for the studio
suits from Warner Brothers to

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.210
get out there and keep
an eye on things.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.400
And Ford goes to work.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.980
And he makes a classic American
movie, starring John

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.420
Wayne, the classic American
Western icon.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:42.090
So we've had the Man Who Knows
Indians before, and we've had

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:43.600
the fate worse than death.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.650
Now we have the great Indian
fighter, the great laconic

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:49.630
lone gunman.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.520
And John Wayne embodies that.

00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:55.830
He's very charismatic in "The
Searchers." He's a very

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:57.480
powerful figure.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.900
But what's so interesting, I
think, is that at the same

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:05.070
time Ford's giving us the
Western in all of its iconic,

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:11.010
mythic glory, he's undermining
it a little here and there.

00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:15.350
And especially with Wayne,
because here we have the hero,

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:20.450
yet as the movie goes on, the
hero is a complex figure.

00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:22.910
I'm not going to go into too
many details about the plot,

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.470
of course, for those of you
who haven't seen it.

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:26.440
But there's a raid.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:27.620
People are killed.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:30.540
And the uncle and a nephew--

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:35.650
a fiction-- go out and try
to retrieve, rescue, this

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.290
nine-year-old girl.

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:41.030
But as time goes on, just
as with Cynthia Ann, the

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:45.170
nine-year-old girl becomes a
16-year-old woman and becomes

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.950
the wife of a Comanche brave--

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:50.380
in fact, the warrior who
had led the raid.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.890
And so for the uncle, this
morphs from an effort to

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:58.770
rescue his little niece into
something much darker.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.870
He's planning to kill her.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.340
He's planning to kill her
because she's had sex with

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.050
Indians, voluntarily or not.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:09.170
She's been polluted somehow.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.170
She's unclean.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.060
But at the same time, and this
is where I think the artistry

00:31:14.060 --> 00:31:17.440
of Wayne comes in, he's
not happy about this.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:21.090
It's not like oh, well, I guess
I'll kill her, and just

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.000
rides off to go find
her to do that.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.420
He's troubled by it.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.930
It's not easy for him.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.990
He can't process all the
things going on.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:32.410
That versus finding Debbie--

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:33.790
the little girl.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.900
It's a mess with him.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:40.030
And Wayne, I think most of us
who remember John Wayne think

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.990
of him as that sort of clunky
guy with the toupee making the

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:47.560
same movie over and over again
in the late '60s and

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:53.340
pro-Vietnam and just kind
of that right wing guy.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.630
And to go back and to see
"Searchers" or to see, for

00:31:56.630 --> 00:32:02.510
that matter, "Stagecoach" in
1939 or "Red River" in 1948,

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.110
that's a different actor.

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:06.420
That's a real actor.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:07.470
That's a movie actor.

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.830
John Wayne invented a character
named John Wayne.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.970
He didn't write his own parts,
but he invented the guy who

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:18.350
played them, the way he walks,
the slow talking, that sense

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.200
of being charming but
also menacing.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:25.090
All that is built out of
watching other actors, out of

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:28.490
watching a stuntman here and a
little bit there, from Harry

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.300
Carey, Sr., who had worked with
Ford and Wayne had seen

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.600
all his films.

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.350
This was an invention.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:37.420
And in many ways, "Searchers"
is, I would argue,

00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:38.700
the epitome of this.

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:40.580
It's his greatest role.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.860
He certainly thought it was
one of the greatest ones.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.440
He named his last son Ethan
after the character he plays.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.630
The uncle is called
Ethan Edwards.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.330
So Wayne's doing this.

00:32:51.330 --> 00:32:54.580
The role is complex.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.670
Ford's giving us, as I say, this
great character who we

00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:58.880
identify with.

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.140
And we want him to
succeed, right?

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:02.120
He's John Wayne!

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.670
But at the same time,
he's a psychopath.

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:08.620
And he's an Indian hater.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.740
And he's a racist.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.550
And he's trying--

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:15.770
and it's all going on within
this one character.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:22.080
And the fictional adopted nephew
who's with him stays on

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.650
the search for all seven years--
and it goes on for

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:25.700
seven years--

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.480
to stop him.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.570
Martin is his name.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.380
And Martin is there specifically
to save his

00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.750
little adopted sister
from the uncle.

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.360
And Martin becomes sort of the
moral center of the film.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.070
And he comments on the uncle and
the increasing psychosis

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:43.390
and crazy things the
uncle's doing.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:45.100
And so it's a very rich mix.

00:33:45.100 --> 00:33:47.130
It's not simple.

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:51.040
I got to tell you in researching
the film--

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.570
the film, the book--

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.880
it was easier to research
Cynthia Ann Parker and Quanah

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.790
Parker and all that in the 19th
century than it was to

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.940
get a lot of material about
John Ford making "The

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.120
Searchers."

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.610
His papers are at Indiana
University, but Ford didn't

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:05.960
write a lot of stuff down.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.310
He pretended that his Westerns
were like just a piece of work

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:11.010
that he did, very workmanlike.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.370
If you asked him questions about
the kind of things we're

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.850
talking about now,
he'd just laugh.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.070
When I think about who I'd like
to interview, if I could

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.179
bring back someone, I'd love
to interview John Wayne.

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:21.969
He was such a generous,
nice guy.

00:34:21.969 --> 00:34:23.760
And we'd have a good time.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.380
Ford, I don't know.

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.880
He would just like abuse you.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.060
And he wouldn't answer any
questions, not in a

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:31.820
straightforward way.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:34.530
Even Peter Bogdanovich, who
interviewed him and who he

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.060
liked a lot, nah.

00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.350
You don't get much out of him.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.330
He did say to Bogdanovich
at one point about "The

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.719
Searchers," it's a psychological
epic.

00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:45.010
So figure out what that
means for yourself.

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.830
It's very clear what
he's talking about.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:50.469
So the movie ends-- as I
say, I'm not going to

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.170
tell you how it ends--

00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:55.429
but one of the things I
discovered in trying to figure

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.950
out if Ford doesn't leave me a
lot of notes, how do I know

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.950
why he made the decisions he
made during the movie?

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.500
And the one way you can figure
it out is to take the final

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.100
shooting script, by a guy
named Frank Nugent--

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.170
who incidentally, earlier in
his life, was a "New York

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:12.330
Times" film reviewer, who went
out to Hollywood and failed at

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:12.950
a few things.

00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:16.550
And then Ford hired him to
be his pet screenwriter.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:18.400
Look at Nugent's final shooting
script, which is

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.170
very, very good.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.690
But then look at what's
actually in the movie.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:26.230
And you find that repeatedly,
Ford takes out dialogue,

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:28.850
exposition, anything where
characters are explaining

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.900
themselves.

00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.500
And he just leaves you the
sort of visual narrative.

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.890
You have to figure out.

00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:38.180
We have to decide how the
uncle's feeling, what the

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:39.970
uncle's really going to do.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:42.760
We have to decide all these
things in the course of the

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.950
film, because they don't
explain them.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:48.410
In the script, some of them are
explained very thoroughly.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:50.070
And Ford takes it out.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.220
And I would argue that that's
one of the reasons "The

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:56.700
Searchers" is such a great
movie, that kind of ambiguity,

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.100
that kind of visual
storytelling,

00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.780
leaving it to you.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.790
So many people know the movie so
well that sometimes when I

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:09.720
do these talks, they'll ask
very, very detailed questions.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.160
You know, well, do you think
that Debbie, the little girl

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.940
who the uncle was searching
for could be his

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:17.100
illegitimate daughter?

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:17.680
Maybe.

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:23.750
All these things that were
clear or clearer in the

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.850
written script are gone,
and you have

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.380
to decide for yourself.

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:27.750
Yeah?

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.684
AUDIENCE: Sort of a
quick question.

00:36:28.684 --> 00:36:32.420
How closely does the script
mirror the book?

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:37.260
GLENN FRANKEL: The book is the
source of a lot of things, and

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.700
some of the dialogue, because
Alan LeMay was a screenwriter.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.390
And he wrote good dialogue.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:46.300
And he couldn't help
but write.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:51.200
But some things are changed
pretty dramatically.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:54.960
For one thing, Martin, the
nephew, is the sort of central

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.920
character in the book.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.560
And his development, his
evolution from being a callow

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:02.600
youth to being a very
experienced back woodsman, and

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.080
again his quest, his moral quest
to find and save his

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:08.620
sister, that's the center
of the movie.

00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:10.000
The uncle is there.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.320
He's important.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.490
The interplay between them
is very important.

00:37:13.490 --> 00:37:14.680
But it's a different thing.

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:16.360
And the reason is quite
clear for that.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.160
Ford had John Wayne.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.770
And so Nugent, who'd written
for Wayne before, writes a

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.300
screenplay where John Wayne's
the central figure.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.960
The book begins with the
Comanche raid on the family.

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.790
That's the opening scene
of the book.

00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:33.010
That's a great opening scene
for a movie, right?

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.530
But that's not how they
open the movie.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:38.140
They open the movie with the
uncle riding up to the family

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.190
home before the raid.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:44.020
And you're introducing this
somewhat mysterious dark

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:46.980
character, both charming, but
we don't know what he's been

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:50.190
doing since the Civil War ended
three years earlier.

00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:54.220
Clearly he's been doing things
that are illegal.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.320
He's got a lot of money.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:56.780
He's mysterious.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.820
He won't talk about what was
happening, that sort of thing.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.880
He's got a medal that seems
to have come from Mexico.

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.050
We don't know what this
guy's been up.

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:09.610
That's all different from-- as
I say, the raid scene is in

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.500
there later, but it doesn't
open that way.

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:14.900
The uncle is a much
heavier figure.

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:19.010
And in the book, all these
psychosexual things are there,

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:20.410
but not quite as strongly.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.330
The uncle is not determined
to kill her.

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:25.190
He doesn't care that
much about her.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:29.350
He's out seeking vengeance
for the death of

00:38:29.350 --> 00:38:31.240
members of his family.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.400
But he doesn't decide
to kill her.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.640
He never resolves to do that.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.250
He doesn't care.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.500
And Martin is there to find
her and bring her back.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:43.340
But what Ford and Nugent do is
they take that, and they just

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:46.440
jack it right up, because the
uncle is-- it is an honor

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.970
killing that he's on, just as
bad as anything in the Middle

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:51.170
East that you can imagine.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:53.200
He's going to kill
this little girl,

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.440
because she's been violated.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.680
And this is his notion
of justice.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.060
That's Ford and Nugent.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.950
It's not in the novel.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:05.460
So it is a very good
novel incidentally.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.270
And it's fun to read, if
you haven't read it.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:08.350
It's very grim though.

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.460
That's the other thing.

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.650
There's no humor.

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.660
There's no humor in the novel.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.430
And Ford puts in a lot of his
sort of corn ball humor and

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:19.460
community scenes, because that's
what Ford always did.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.460
He loved that.

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.930
But also he had to leaven the
grim relentlessness of this

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:26.540
seven-year search.

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:28.420
So it feels very different.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.200
LeMay himself, having worked
with Cecil B. DeMille and some

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:35.430
other maniacs in Hollywood, knew
he didn't want to work

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.470
with John Ford.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:38.100
Not that Ford would've
asked him to write

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.020
the screenplay anyway.

00:39:39.020 --> 00:39:40.330
Ford always used Nugent.

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:44.010
He used his own sort of tame
scriptwriter guy he had

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:44.610
control over.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.290
But LeMay walked away from it.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.610
I met LeMay's son, Dan, and he
said my dad said he didn't

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.260
want to have anything
to do with it.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.360
And I would really love to know
what LeMay thought of the

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.080
movie, but I don't know.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.020
He never wrote about it.

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:57.890
He never said a word.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:58.550
He took the money.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.910
He got a really good pay-out
for the book from Warners.

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:03.380
And that was it.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.390
They bought his silence.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.690
So "The Searchers," as you know,
when "The Searchers"

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:10.890
came out, it was considered like
another pretty good John

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:12.060
Wayne cowboy and Indian movie.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.570
It got decent reviews,
made some

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.952
money, and then it vanished.

00:40:16.952 --> 00:40:19.740
Ford and Wayne were
disappointed.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.640
It didn't get nominated
for anything.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.480
But they moved on.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.540
And it really took another
generation to come along and

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.790
begin to see the subtleties
and the layers of what was

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:35.130
going on in "The Searchers."
And it took Spielberg and

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:38.260
Lucas and these guys not only
to quote from the movie in

00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.950
their own films, but also to
talk about the movie as to how

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:42.740
important it was.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.550
And movies like "Taxi Driver"
basically, I think, are a

00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:48.970
modern New York version of
"Searchers" in a way,

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:53.770
searching for this young woman
in the "other" world, that

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:54.850
sort of thing.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:57.810
So the movie begins to take
on a new life, if

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.380
you will, over time.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:02.590
And it's uncanny.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:06.320
One critic said that just in the
same way that all modern

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.850
American literature flows from
Huckleberry Finn, one way or

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:15.710
another, all modern cinema of
this generation of Spielberg,

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.850
et cetera, flows from
"The Searchers."

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.380
It's still an unsettling
movie to see it today.

00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:25.030
The great quote I love from a
critic named David Thompson,

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:27.110
who doesn't love Ford generally,
but he loves "The

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:30.320
Searchers." And he said, "Every
time I see it, I don't

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.080
know how it's going to end."

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.830
Because there's just
a lot going on.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:38.340
And we don't really know what
the uncle's going to do, or

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.070
how Martin's going
to stop him.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.600
Or if Martin's going to
be able to stop him.

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.290
And I think I'll leave
it there, in terms of

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:46.810
talking about it.

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:48.050
But that's how I feel about it.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:48.680
I feel--

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.820
and gosh knows how many times
I've seen it now.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:54.810
But it's always thrilling, and
it's always unsettling,

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:57.000
because it's about all these
complicated themes.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.160
And it's about race and sex.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.190
And my book, the only other
thing I'd say--

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:02.960
my book turned out to be--

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.180
the subtitle is "The Making of
an American Legend." It's how

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:10.040
a story, a simple story, gets
told and retold by every

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.820
generation and reimagined.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.580
And as I said earlier, they
embroider some parts, and they

00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:17.410
take out some stuff they don't
like, depending on their own

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:19.640
needs and their own
sensibility.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.880
And so in a way, that's
what's happened.

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:26.680
"Searchers," the movie, is
another manifestation of that.

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.770
And in its own humble
way, my book is too.

00:42:29.770 --> 00:42:32.980
This isn't the last word on the
movie or Cynthia Ann or

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.740
any of that.

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.890
It's just my version in 2013.

00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:39.100
But as you can imagine, it was
an enormously satisfying thing

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:39.910
to work on.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.140
I stumbled into it basically.

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:47.020
And I'm awfully glad I did,
because this film and the

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:50.670
story behind it is still a
very important American

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:54.080
foundational myth about how we
live and what we draw-- the

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.020
meaning we draw from
these things.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.310
So thanks for listening.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:58.560
Let's talk a little bit.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.040
Questions?

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:09.590
Comments?

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:09.880
Yes.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:13.809
AUDIENCE: We talked about the
abduction narrative being so

00:43:13.809 --> 00:43:16.613
central to American literature
and history.

00:43:16.613 --> 00:43:20.320
When did those types of
stories-- how late into the

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.520
later 1800s, early 1900s
did that-- or early

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.506
20th century go?

00:43:26.506 --> 00:43:29.130
What's the latest example?

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.200
GLENN FRANKEL: The captivity
narrative kind of reinvents

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:35.750
itself every generation
or two, also.

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:39.090
Generally what happens is, in
New England, for example,

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:43.060
after New England was settled,
and the Native Americans were

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.280
no longer a threat.

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.130
They were either wiped
out or tamed.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.810
So first you get a few like Mary
Rowlandson that are about

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:55.450
these evil savages
and horrifying.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.460
Then you get the sort of noble
savage version of it later,

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.550
when they basically have been
neutered, and they're no

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:02.280
longer a threat.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.090
And so you get a whole new range
of literature coming out

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:06.150
in New England.

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:10.950
But then when you get down to
Texas, and you get another

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:14.530
round of heavy duty
war, the narrative

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:16.220
becomes dark and grim.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.700
And for the most part, we're
talking true stories.

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.300
James Fenimore Cooper's
writing novels.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.880
There are dime novels,
dime Westerns.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.410
So you have all this fiction.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:28.620
But it's based on
real stories.

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.950
And you get another genre.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:33.970
So Rachel Plummer, who I haven't
mentioned, but who was

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:36.830
one of the five people kidnapped
with Cynthia Ann.

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:38.870
She writes a narrative
of her time.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.250
It's a short one.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:42.170
She's Uncle James's daughter.

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:45.220
And she dies soon after
she's returned.

00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:46.160
She writes one.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.310
And Sarah Ann Horn, an English
woman who comes over, she

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:49.760
writes one.

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.810
And there's like 5, 10, 20.

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:52.620
They go on and on.

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.790
And so it gets another cycle.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:45:00.070
And then of course as the
Western emerges as a literary

00:45:00.070 --> 00:45:04.760
genre, and then as stage plays
and Buffalo Bill and all that,

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.070
and then the movies
come along.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.560
And remember, the movies come
along right when the real West

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.450
is kind of finished, just
around the same time.

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:17.960
So already, even the first
Western movies are depicting a

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.760
place that doesn't
exist anymore.

00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.060
They're depicting
the fantastical

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.020
version of that place.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:29.160
And they use the captivity
narrative.

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.210
They reverse it sometimes.

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:36.580
There's the classic Indian young
woman who rescues the

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.210
white guy, and she turns out
to be the most adept with

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:41.810
horses and all this stuff.

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:45.480
Ah, but it turns out she's
actually a white girl who was

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.040
captured as a little girl and
made into an Indian, and she's

00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.070
the greatest Indian of all.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:52.570
You have all those kinds of
themes going back and forth.

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:55.780
And so, right up to now, I mean
"Dances with Wolves" is a

00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:56.850
captivity narrative.

00:45:56.850 --> 00:46:00.900
And in fact, in the original,
it's Comanches, not Sioux.

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:05.410
But Kevin Costner changed it, I
think, for cinematic reasons

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:06.610
or where he wanted to shoot.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.890
So you have this thing going
on, just like the Western

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:15.050
itself has lost a lot of
momentum in the last couple of

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:17.940
generations, really starting
with Vietnam, the captivity

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:19.460
narrative has lost some of it.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.970
Or it's had to morph.

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:23.940
You can do captivity narratives
and quests in any

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.610
genre, really, in the end.

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:30.900
It's a theme that goes back
to the "Iliad." That's a

00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:31.790
captivity narrative.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:33.750
They go to get Helen.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.190
So it's from the beginning
and it's still there.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:37.905
AUDIENCE: I can think
of at least two

00:46:37.905 --> 00:46:39.350
Newbery prize winners.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:42.530
And there's a captivity novel
in the middle of one of the

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:44.770
"Star Wars," right?

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:46.600
The mother is captured by
the Tusken raiders.

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.130
GLENN FRANKEL: Right.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:47.700
Right.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:51.110
Well, Lucas, he's all over it.

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:56.710
When Luke Skywalker's family's
house is burning in that scene

00:46:56.710 --> 00:46:59.650
in the first "Star Wars," in the
first one that came out,

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:02.460
that's a direct quote from the
scene, the burning farmhouse

00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:04.050
in "The Searchers," too.

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:07.820
Yeah, these themes have been
with us long before the

00:47:07.820 --> 00:47:10.270
settlement of the American
West, in a sense.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:14.580
But they become foundational
for us.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:18.970
And again, especially because
they give us a reason to

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:21.565
justify conquest.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.970
These folks are going to
kill our families.

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:28.800
We have to get them.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.020
If they're going to take our
kids, we have to defeat them.

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:36.340
So it's like the imperial
justification

00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:38.210
for the whole thing.

00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:44.210
And we'll see, I can't think
of a book right now that

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:48.205
really sums it up, but
there'll be one.

00:47:48.205 --> 00:47:48.670
Yeah?

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:49.490
Hey, John.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:50.424
AUDIENCE: What kind of movies
did Ford make after this?

00:47:50.424 --> 00:47:53.226
Did this affect the
way he looked at

00:47:53.226 --> 00:47:56.030
things going forward?

00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:58.610
GLENN FRANKEL: Ford was, as I
say, he was 60, 62, when he

00:47:58.610 --> 00:47:59.580
was done with this.

00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:00.170
He moved on.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.900
He kept working.

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:04.840
Merian Cooper retired after
this, but Ford wouldn't and

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.430
couldn't retire.

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:08.930
He didn't know what else
he would do really.

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:10.310
So he hangs in there.

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:14.210
But I think he begins to
hit the downside of it.

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:16.670
He's not well.

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:19.250
He makes one more great Western,
I think, which is

00:48:19.250 --> 00:48:21.400
"The Man Who Shot Liberty
Valance." And that's six or

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.100
seven years later.

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.340
He makes "The Last Hurrah,"
which is a pretty good movie,

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.950
a political movie,
about Boston.

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:30.800
And so, yeah, Ford's Irish, and
it's full of blarney, but

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:31.550
it's pretty good.

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:34.620
But things begin to fade a
little here and there.

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:38.110
He makes one more extraordinary
Western, I don't

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:39.950
really think it's a great
Western, but interesting, in

00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:43.420
"Cheyenne Autumn." And that's
set in Monument Valley.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.270
And it's about the Cheyenne
who try to escape from the

00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:49.660
agencies in Oklahoma and get
back to their homeland.

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.160
It's a very sad movie.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:55.660
It's his mea culpa, in a way,
because it's so warm and

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.260
emotional about Native Americans
in ways that none of

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:03.450
the previous movies had been,
including "Searchers."

00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:06.250
So he makes another
10, 12, 15 movies.

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.420
Boy, he makes a horrible Western
called "Two Rode

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:12.250
Together" which has a Quanah
Parker character in it.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:14.020
And it too is about captivity
narratives.

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.100
It's about bringing some
children, some young people,

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:18.740
back, but it doesn't go well.

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:21.480
He tells you after Cynthia Ann
comes back, what happens to

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:24.500
her, basically, in that movie,
and it's not good.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:28.250
But the movie's slack, and it
uses some of the same scenes.

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:31.690
I don't know how you feel about
"Godfather 3." But I

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:33.990
always thought it wasn't
very good.

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:36.580
And in a way, "Two Rode
Together" is like John Ford's

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.120
"Godfather 3." It's got the
same kinds of things as

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.020
"Searchers," but it's
slack and bleagh.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.290
It just doesn't work at all.

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:44.900
So that's it.

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.140
His last film is in the
late '60s, and he dies

00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:52.670
of cancer in 1973.

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:54.320
And he had a heyday.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.250
I mean, he had years.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:50:00.850
He won those four Oscars
between 1935 and '52.

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:03.450
He also won two Oscars for
documentaries he filmed during

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:05.130
World War II.

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:06.600
So this guy is just--

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:11.900
he is a master, especially
of visual storytelling.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:15.740
But he runs out of gas.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:16.970
Well, look, thank
you very much.

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:19.100
It's a small group, but it
was fun talking to you.
