JASON SILVA: You know, if I
had to verbalize what I believe

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.380
accounts for the failure of most
of my romantic relationships

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.400
is the fact that I can
not bear love's aging.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.150
I cannot stand the dissolution
of the honeymoon phase, right.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.220
As soon as the vacation,
the electrifying vitality,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.540
the rapture of
meeting someone new

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.810
fades it's a kind
of death practice.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.170
You die a little.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.440
When enthralment
dissipates you kind of

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.620
have a moment of profound
tragic realization

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.380
that everything passes, that our
greatest ecstasies are imbued,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.090
are cast upon by a shadow of
dread, of knowing that this

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
will pass, that this will end.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.220
So what do we do when we look
into the iris of a lover's eye,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.080
right?

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.000
When being seen
by the person you

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.930
love so much gives
you goose bumps,

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.950
makes you cry, touches your
core, touches your soul,

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.170
titillates everything
inside of you.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.480
Makes you think of that
Roland Barthes books,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.790
"Lover's Discourse," about
how the cradling that

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.930
takes place between two
people when they finally

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.970
feel safe, like Adam and
Eve in the garden of Eden

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.546
before the tree of knowledge,
before knowledge of death,

00:01:44.546 --> 00:01:45.712
and of transience was known.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.840
See, I want to live in
that garden of Eden.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.110
I fantasize about it.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.660
I watch movies about it.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.815
I listen to beautiful
songs about it.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.965
Curiosity killed the cat.

00:02:03.965 --> 00:02:05.560
I ate from the
tree of knowledge.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.300
I learned about death, and
mortality, and endings,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.750
and entropy.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.470
And I think that
that has haunted

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.320
all of my relationships,
this terror

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.570
of the inevitable ending,
and I'm still dealing

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.846
with finding a hack for that.

00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:29.290
That's the truth.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.840
