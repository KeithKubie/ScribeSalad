Speaker 1:          00:00          It's what a lot of people think is wrong about the trash talk of this era because there's, this is, there's an error right now, right? Is this, we're in the trash talk era. Absolutely. Some people are really good at it and some people are terrible at it, but it seems like everybody's trying Mazda doll. Um, recently when he just beat Darren till it was very interesting because you know his take on it before the fight was, why am I, why, why trash talk? Like what are we doing? What do you know why we're going to fight? Like what is all this bullshit about? Like he doesn't like it. He was like, I don't like where this is going. I don't like where the sport is going. Yeah. I mean it was, it's one of those things that I had to adjust to because I wasn't brought on those principles.

Speaker 1:          00:42          I don't, I'm not, you know, cause I'm not here. Yeah. I wasn't here for a salesman. Like people ask me all the time, why do you do this? And I chose to do this, like I'm college educated, I can get a fucking job. And him sitting in an office and punch numbers and all that. But I chose to do this because of my burning desire to compete. That's when I, even now when I compete with guys, I'm not competing angry. I only to kill this guy. I'm not Robert. I run all that shit. No, it's competition for me. My mind is I'm going to beat you. And which is partially, which goes to test with the, how I fight and how I compete. I'm not like that. This is not the only thing that I can do. And so this Eric came about where now everybody, you gotta Talk Shit, you gotta sell, you gotta do this and do that.

Speaker 1:          01:29          And so do you feel any pressure to do that? Initially, at some point I did because it was, um, I was fighting the way I was fighting. I was dominating guys and I was getting nowhere. It was like no notoriety. They were kind of like just kind of putting you on the wayside. They would always tell him, oh, you get a top 10 guy, you'll get a top thing. Yeah. But they wouldn't happen. He was like, Oh, you, you fight this guy and you can't really argue with them because this promotion has given you the opportunity to even really make money at all for the career path that you chose. So for I, for a while I just felt like, man, this is not, I guess I just got to do this because you saw it. The other clown Covington it, he had to do that.

Speaker 1:          02:10          He actually had, nothing has changed with the way that he fights. He's done the exact same day since he'd been in the UFC, but after the first couple of fight, no one gave a shit. So he felt, you know what? No, I'm just going to have to start doing this. Everyone knows it's fake. Right. Because he just one day woke up and started doing it. And that's, that's the thing now you have to do, people try to say you have to do that, but for me is when I'm not going to do is I'm not going to just sell my soul just to, Oh yeah, I'm just trying to earn a couple of bucks because I'm not going to do that. I'm going to do it the right way. George did it the right way and, and, and I, I'm a firm believer that when you do it the right way, you will earn what you deserve.

Speaker 1:          02:50          It will come to you at some point. I don't think that you have to, I really don't. He had something, I mean, Colby Covington does because I do freaking sot he, he show, look, you got to give it to him. He did beat those on Joe's. That was a big victory. He did beat Damien Maia. That was a big victory. Those are, those are two legit victories over to very dangerous guys. He did beat those kinds of, and he's got skill on top of the trash talking, but the trash talking bumped him ahead of you in line and a lot of us were surprised. I was surprised. I was surprised that he had to, he had to do it. And I mean it's gotten them where he has and I mean look what he did like two weeks ago when I fought his whole, his whole deal with, for me to create an uproar to get my name back in the picture.

Speaker 1:          03:36          And he did a wonderful job. This is one thing that I will, I will, I would say is that he has done a wonderful job at having people talk about him, whether you hate him, which, and even the bosses have said the exact same thing is no one has done what he's done. No one has ever created the persona that is unanimously hated worldwide. Like unanimously, there's not even heal. Like literally it, like those guys, they still had fans, you know, that wanted to see him succeed. Like nobody likes it. He's not safe anywhere. No. You know, you don't even have to be, there's flyweights that want to hurt this guy. So if you, Nana Nestle has, he's done a good job of creating that, which I love and I appreciate that it's going to sell a lot of paper views, but I'm not, yeah, I'm not a hater.

Speaker 1:          04:28          I'm not a hater. Like I give credit where credit is due. I appreciate the fact that he has done that. And that's one day net Rashad taught me over the years is that you have to appreciate certain things like that. And I, and I do, I always wanted this moment, I always wanted that Connor and could be that, that, that adversary, that Rashad and rampage, that Hughes and, and George St Pierre, like I always wanted that. And, and he's done a good job of creating that. So you're not just an adversary in terms of like a legitimate worthy opponent, but uh, do that you want to fuck up. Absolutely. I mean, I haven't, I haven't been in a fight yet where it was like a malicious, like I was maliciously trying to hurt someone. I haven't been in that fight yet. Yes, I don't. That's the thing, my amazing with my mind.

Speaker 1:          05:14          My mind is strong. I don't compete. Oh yeah, I'm trying to kill this guy and then you swing five punches. You Miss. Now you're dead tired. I don't compete like that. This one I'm still going to compete as myself but there's going to be a little extra on behind these, these elbows. Now I'm going to fillet your face with the little longer cuts. I'm trying to, this one is going to be one that I, I really enjoy. Well there was the same with could be even Connor when he said I want to change your face. Yes. When he said that I was like damn, that's deep. I want to change your face. And you saw that even with when could be was like that is um, because he was never out of character and it can be never was like, oh yeah, I'm just going to go out there and try to kill this guy.

Speaker 1:          05:52          Right. There's a certain level, there's a certain mentality then certain fighters have to add. It could be was a another guy that I've seen that competes similarly to the way that I do as far as his mind, where it's at. Like I don't give a shit what you do, talk about me, do all this. Try to distract me like they tried me. This will come leading up to the tire and fight. They did everything. What are you going to do? And then you had his, his little psychic that looked like sideshow Bob that was was talking and doing this, trying to distract me and this and then Colby popped up trying to distract me. Dad didn't change anything. That's not going to do nothing to me like my mind is own competing. I'm going to compete to the best of my abilities and I'm going to embarrass you and then this guy is going to be even more worse.

Speaker 2:          06:38          Big Change in your skillset from your first fight in the UFC to now as you're striking, you're wrestling has always been outstanding. Your cardio has always been excellent, but your striking is much more fluid and much looser. You're you, you're much more efficient now. You was, you were always powerful, but it seems like now everything's phone together. Like you don't have any holes in your game anymore. It's a different thing.
