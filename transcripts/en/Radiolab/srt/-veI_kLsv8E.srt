00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,890
Hey, this is Emily Valani and
I'm calling from Austin, Texas.

org slash radio lab now

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,223
[inaudible]

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,190
no. Okay. No,

8
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,710
I listen to radio

9
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,293
[inaudible]

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,100
[inaudible] I'll continue with here.

11
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:45,820
Report the first large scale study
comparing the prevalence of absolute pitch

12
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,930
into normal populations by
means of professor Diana
Deutsch. Deutsch, why? Yeah,

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,390
I'm going to turn down my head phone.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,320
[inaudible] I'm a professor psychology
at the University of California San

15
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:59,320
Diego. Can you still hear
me dying? Okay. Hello.

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,570
Diana. Studies sound how humans
perceive sound. She's a scientist.

17
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:09,160
She has a lab, but every so often
she will also release cds, right?

18
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,870
These a cds of audio demonstrations that
she uses in her research and that's why

19
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:17,980
we called because it was in the production
of her second CD that she stumbled

20
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:19,600
onto the weirdest phenomenon. Well,

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,050
oh, I'll tell you what happened. Does
that, um, when you do post production is,

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,460
as you know of of speech,
you look things, look things.

23
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:33,570
Look things so that you
can zero in on piece. Cool.

24
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,030
That sound too loud. Nita, unpopular
ss, that sounds two shops and so on.

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,060
So you put things on loops in order to
fine tune the way the speech sounds.

26
00:01:44,531 --> 00:01:49,390
So I had this particular phrase
on a loop and forgot about it.

27
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,081
What phrase was,

28
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:55,081
this is a phrase that occurs at the
beginning of the CD in which I say the

29
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,210
sounds as they appear to you and not
only different from those that are really

30
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:00,044
present,

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,760
but they sometimes behave so
strangely as to seem quite impossible,

32
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:05,720
quite impossible.

33
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,380
Now I had sometimes behave so strangely
looped the sounds as they appear to you

34
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,090
are not only different from
those that are really present,

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,720
but they sometimes behave so strangely
sometimes behave so strangely.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,470
Just those few words sometimes behave
so strangely and forgot about sometimes

37
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:29,580
behave so strangely,
sometimes behave so strange.

38
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:32,660
So here's what happened. Diana leaves
her studio, she closes the door,

39
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,250
it goes into the kitchen to
make some tea. All the wild.

40
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:37,490
This loop is worrying
away in the background

41
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:38,660
as she's sipping her tea.

42
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:42,380
She thinks sometimes is someone
singing strangely who's singing?

43
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,940
I heard what sounded like song
in the background. Wait a second,

44
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,390
that's not singing.

45
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:52,450
That's me talking that
very phrase strangely.

46
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,000
But at this point sometimes
behave so straight.

47
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,480
Appear to be sung rather
than spoken strangely.

48
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,480
Sometimes behave so strangely.

49
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,020
This is sometimes behave
so strangely, right?

50
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,780
You still hear the words but there are
some words rather than spoken words.

51
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,330
It's weird like it just
switches it a certain point,

52
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:15,550
three or four repetitions
in, right? It's going,

53
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:19,200
it's going and then pow
becomes music and then now,

54
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,820
now none of us can get it out of our head.

55
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:25,720
Like the whole office is like
sometimes VA. So strange sometimes VA.

56
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:26,880
So strangely

57
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:31,510
and you know what if you do this demo
and then you go back to the original

58
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:36,200
sentence, it sounds like you
know speech to begin with.

59
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:40,430
And when you come to that very phrase
as seem to be bursting into song,

60
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:44,240
the sounds as they appear to you are
not only different from those that are

61
00:03:44,241 --> 00:03:45,200
really present,

62
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,300
but they sometimes behave so
strangely as to seem quite impossible.

63
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:53,620
I have to say this can
continue for months and months.

64
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,630
I sort of sort of like your brain gets
altered for that particular phrase and it

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,830
continues to sound like
singing for a very,

66
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:06,530
very long time. [inaudible]

67
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,100
alright, so here we have just one
small indication that music is crazy.

68
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,750
Will it behaves very strangely,
right? I mean think about this.

69
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:18,750
We started with some basic
speech repeated a few times.

70
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:23,060
Somewhere along the way it
leaped into song strangely.

71
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:28,500
How did it change like that and if that's
all it takes to turn something into

72
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,430
music. And what exactly is music really?

73
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,750
Sometimes we hate. So same
thing. This is Radiolab.

74
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,450
Today's program is about answering
that question or trying to,

75
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,880
in any case some chat
up. I'm rod here with me.

76
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,880
[inaudible] Robert Krulwich my partner.

77
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,970
I think it a little hard to get out of
your head. I know. It is really cool.

78
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,240
I know. Yeah. Okay. So this
hour, what are we doing?

79
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,260
We are going to try and we will probably
fail. You will ask. We will fail,

80
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,160
but we will make an earnest effort to
try to find the ingredients of music.

81
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,780
Both its basis in languages basis in
physics is basis in your brain will look

82
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,810
everywhere we can software trying to
find out what music is made of and why it

83
00:05:14,061 --> 00:05:15,380
touches us so intimately,

84
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,130
so strange, so strange and touches
us sometimes. Not In a good way.

85
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,790
If you've ever had this
experience of going to a concert,

86
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,950
hearing some music and it just
made you upset for some reason,

87
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,680
like irrationally upset, right? Almost
like you wanted to hurt someone.

88
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,380
If that rings a bell, there's
a segment later in the show,

89
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:33,650
you will not want to miss [inaudible].

90
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:39,430
[inaudible]

91
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,080
this is Radiolab. Stick around.

92
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,883
[inaudible]

93
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,240
Eh,

94
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,480
a pretty messed up.

95
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,140
Shall we start?

96
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,590
Sure. Well first, thanks to the LaGuardia
High School Chorus and Robert Apostle,

97
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,000
they were the voices you just heard.

98
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,820
Hi Baby. Hey, we're
here. More of them later.

99
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,310
So let's explore a little bit more closely
this connection between language and

100
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,080
music. You think of them as separate.

101
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,670
The thing is they're really closely
related, says neuroscientists, mark,

102
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,160
Jude tremble when we speak. We Sing,

103
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,750
you'd know how to use the pitch of your
voice to convey emotion and meaning

104
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,610
like, um,

105
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,170
I went to the store just
because I raised the pitch.

106
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,970
The note, if you will, you
interpret that as an interrogative,

107
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,250
a monotonic speech, you know,

108
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:47,270
talking at the same rate and rhythm
in the same pitch and loudness.

109
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,800
I mean that is not how humans talk,

110
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,420
but humans talking to all kinds of
different ways in different languages.

111
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:56,090
Each language has its
own musical personality.

112
00:06:56,091 --> 00:07:00,200
German is different than French is
different than Swahili and if you look at

113
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,550
those differences closely,

114
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:06,510
there are all kinds of things we can
learn about music. Tick Diana Deutsch.

115
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,540
Okay. She's recently been
looking at tone languages,

116
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,680
just published her results and
the results are startling. Diana,

117
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:16,570
before we start, what
exactly is it? Tone language.

118
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:19,300
Okay. In 10 languages,

119
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,660
words take on different meanings
depending upon the tone in which they are

120
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:28,220
enunciated. For example,

121
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:33,221
Mandarin has four tones and the word mar
in Mandarin means mother in the first

122
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:34,964
tone,

123
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,090
hemp in the second tone horse in the
third tone and a reproach in the fourth

124
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:45,240
tone. Could you say the name?
Would you like me to? Yeah.

125
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,650
Could you just say you were,
I thought you were well up.

126
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:52,730
You know I had them on CD, but I'd
rather hear you say them well. Um, okay.

127
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:55,640
So excuse my bad
pronunciation without trying.

128
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,860
[inaudible] means Martha Ma means hemp.

129
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,370
Ma means horse and Ma is a reproach.

130
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,753
Huh? [inaudible]

131
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,350
so conceivably if you screwed up the
tones you could call your mom a horse.

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,860
Yes, indeed. In fact,

133
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:20,390
there are quite a lot of jokes where
westerners who don't speak the tones,

134
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:22,490
right? Say terrible things.

135
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,930
[inaudible] you have to be
very careful. [inaudible]

136
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,700
see this is a basic difference in English.
We don't really worry about pitch.

137
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:37,701
We can see our words up here or down here
or glycerin up or bended down and it's

138
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:44,170
all the same. Not so with
tone languages. In any case,

139
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,190
this is where it gets interesting.

140
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,360
One day Diana is working
with some mandarin speakers
and she notices something.

141
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,920
There were these words,

142
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:56,280
these words that they would say where
they would all hit precisely the same note

143
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,570
with their voices, not just close
to one another either. Exactly,

144
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,870
precisely and consistently the
same pitch even on different days.

145
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,043
In fact,

146
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:13,370
would you like me to play for you one
person reciting a list of 12 mandarin

147
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,360
tones on two different
days? Yeah, definitely. Um,

148
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,330
first you have the first
word spoken on. Yeah,

149
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,190
day one followed by the same
word spoken and teachers yell.

150
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,110
Then you have the second word spoken on
Day one, jaw followed by the same word,

151
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,260
spoken day two [inaudible]

152
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,300
way here you can see the consistency is
going to appear as though the words are

153
00:09:40,161 --> 00:09:41,690
being repeated immediately.

154
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:46,700
Like in fact the repetitions are
coming entirely different days.

155
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,530
So each of those word pairs came out
of the mouth of one person separated by

156
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:55,870
like 24 hours. Oh, much more than
that. Something like a week. Really.

157
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,940
And it was a remarkable
consistency Jean gene.

158
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,430
Well that'd be like a sane, the word
mom always at this note right here, mom,

159
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,280
mom, mom.

160
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,310
I concluded that basically this
was a form of perfect pair.

161
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,213
Sure.

162
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,550
[inaudible] she should be [inaudible]

163
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,100
I've never quite understood what
perfect pitch is to be honest.

164
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,360
You don't know what that is.

165
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,450
No. Should I, and I know I should,

166
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,330
but whisper it to me as a musician
growing up. Perfect pitches like that.

167
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,070
It's like the thing,

168
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:35,820
it's like the thing you wish you
had and none of us have basically.

169
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,720
It's like having a tuning
fork in your brain here.

170
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:44,590
I'll give you an analogy. Yeah. Okay. You
see this Coffee Cup I'm holding? Yeah.

171
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:50,170
What color is it? Brown. And you
knew that how? Through my eyes.

172
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,850
Right. You didn't need me to put this
Brown Coffee Cup next to my blue jeans.

173
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,510
No, I didn't have to see the Brown. I
mean it's absolute brown. Absolute Brown.

174
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,060
Perfect pitch. People have that
with pitch. They hear a pitch.

175
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,620
They knew exactly what note it is.

176
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,600
The rest of us have to run to the piano.

177
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,490
So if the hero from an elevator,
can they name the note?

178
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,430
Yeah, that's exactly it. Anything
with a pitch like a horn honk,

179
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,390
they could tell you that horn is
enough. Or those church bells,

180
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:20,860
they're alternating between B flat
and B and if the faucet were dripping,

181
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,310
they could see that faucet
is dripping in. It's d sharp.

182
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,350
They don't even have to think about
it. They just know it used to be the,

183
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,690
the note names would jump out at me.

184
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,860
Diana Deutsch is actually one of these
lucky people to the extent that it would

185
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,650
even be a nuisance. And
why? Why is that good?

186
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,340
Well, it's really rare.

187
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,280
It only happens like once every 10,000
people here in America. Europe. Yeah.

188
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,490
And so it is turning your tongue to
a poem and of the people who have it.

189
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,100
Yeah. Well, let's see how
many, how should I say this?

190
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,940
If you look in your
music history textbook,

191
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,250
so you will see that every famous
composer like the really big ones, right?

192
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,190
[inaudible] Beethoven,

193
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,120
[inaudible],

194
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,990
they all had it when really
Mendelsohn, the list goes on and on.

195
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,160
So if you have perfect
pitch on some level, you are

196
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,650
[inaudible]

197
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,170
closer to them.

198
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,400
[inaudible]

199
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,450
he's got the gift.

200
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,693
[inaudible] Danielle,

201
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,540
let's get back to Diana
Deutsch. Okay. Okay.

202
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:39,720
Let's talk about your latest experiment.
That's the one really interested in.

203
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:40,191
Okay. You see,

204
00:12:40,191 --> 00:12:44,910
you compare Chinese kids to American
kids to see who has perfect pitch.

205
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:49,890
More so the, explain how this works. You
had a group of Chinese music students,

206
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:53,400
Air Group of American music students at
the Eastman School of music here in New

207
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,670
York.

208
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,240
You played them a bunch of notes I imagine
in a room and ask them to guess what

209
00:12:57,241 --> 00:12:58,910
those notes were right now.

210
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,550
Well, the test consisted of piano tones,

211
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,670
which began on the c below middle c,

212
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,800
this note and extended up three up
gives all the way to the that note.

213
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,750
That's a big range. Yeah. 36 notes.
Can you demonstrate you sure. Yes.

214
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,890
Here is six chones. Yeah.

215
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,610
Hmm. Hmm. Such as where given in the test.

216
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:31,170
So you would have played those notes to
both sets of kids and asked them to name

217
00:13:31,171 --> 00:13:34,620
the notes without going to the
piano. What were the notes? Really

218
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,220
what these notes were? D e g sharp,

219
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,220
c sharp, d sharp and g.

220
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,803
Um, what were the results?

221
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,261
Well,

222
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:49,261
it turns out the Chinese group far
outperformed the small group of those

223
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,720
students who started musical training
ages four and five 74% of the Chinese

224
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:56,500
group show. Perfect pitch.

225
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:01,530
But 14% of the US non-tariff 74% the
Beijing group was nine times roughly more

226
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:08,420
likely to show perfect pitch
than the American Jesus.

227
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,580
That's the [inaudible] group daggering
difference. It's a staggering difference.

228
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,400
Mm.

229
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,830
And it's your hunch that the difference
is because they speak a tone language.

230
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,340
That's my hat. I mean
the, it's, it's known that

231
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,830
the first year of life

232
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,450
saved for made six months up to, you know,

233
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:36,451
a little a year infants learn
features of their native language.

234
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,110
This is a very, very important stage.

235
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,760
Let's suppose that tone and the absolute
pitch of tones is a feature which is

236
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:49,870
potentially available to anyone.

237
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,290
Babies who are exposed only
to an international language
such as English are not

238
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:58,870
given the opportunity to acquire, chose,

239
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:05,110
then they're going to be
at a real disadvantage when
they come later on to learn

240
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:06,890
to take Whittick lessons.

241
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,230
So you think that as there, Huh?
[inaudible] let me ask we this,

242
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:20,250
as they're learning their language,
which includes inherently music, right?

243
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,930
To some degree, they are essentially
learning two languages as they learn one.

244
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,400
Is that right? It's a matter of fact,

245
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:29,390
if you take the first tone
[inaudible] it's a flat tone.

246
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:33,770
It's really sung compared
with English speech.

247
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,780
It's really more like song that's,

248
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,290
that's always been sort of the
stereotype of the Chinese languages.

249
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:43,550
It's very sort of sing Sony. Yes.
Tony soil mean Guido home bow share,

250
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,680
Lambeau Shirley bow shoe for example,
the third child in Mandarin Ma.

251
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,320
It's sort of like a j type pattern. The
second term, which is a gentle output,

252
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,740
bless Ma, the fourth child, which
is a rapid downward place ma.

253
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,940
I mean these are all kinds of
musical relationships. Yeah.

254
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:05,680
Given the evidence on absolute pitch,
one could speculate further said,

255
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,710
well maybe other features of music are
also enhanced for individuals who start

256
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:16,180
off learning tone language. So,
so the, here's my big question.

257
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,710
Could this explain the
experience that I had?

258
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:23,020
And I think a lot of people have this
experience when they're taking music

259
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:27,420
lessons and we were playing little
piddly pieces like [inaudible]

260
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,800
and here are these Chinese girls
right here playing rough monarch.

261
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,460
Brilliant. Yeah. Is this why? Well,

262
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,120
I think it's a viable hypothesis. I mean,

263
00:16:43,121 --> 00:16:46,900
evidently it could be something else.
It could be something else going on.

264
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,070
Like what? I mean, one could argue that
instead it might be genetic and so on,

265
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:53,260
but they're seen as such a,
it's such a boring theory,

266
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,610
like always a boring
theory. And furthermore,

267
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,660
we don't have to assume that knowing what
we do about exposure to tone language

268
00:17:00,971 --> 00:17:03,850
in very early childhood as
a as a, it's just not fair.

269
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,170
And I think we can look
at it another way around

270
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:10,981
here.

271
00:17:10,981 --> 00:17:15,981
We have a faculty that had been fought
to be confined to a few rare individuals

272
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,240
who are just extraordinarily
gifted, right?

273
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,660
That might in fact be available to any
individual provided they're given the

274
00:17:27,001 --> 00:17:30,570
right exposure at a critical period.

275
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,190
And that raises the question of what
other sorts of abilities could be brought

276
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,770
out if we only knew just what to do.

277
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,300
There may be much more human
potential than we had realized.

278
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,013
[inaudible]

279
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,880
Diana Deutsch is a professor of music
psychology at the University of San Diego,

280
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,610
music psychology, music psychology.
And as I mentioned earlier,

281
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:13,380
she's also the releaser of
two cds. She has two cds,

282
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,630
one's called musical
illusions and paradoxes.

283
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,220
And the other one is called Phantom
words and other curiosities.

284
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,390
What w what would you
put on a CD? Exactly.

285
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,800
She puts these little audio pieces
that she uses in her research.

286
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,250
The stuff I guess that she will play to
subjects as she tests them and she puts

287
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:31,110
these on cities cause they're
kind of fun to listen to.

288
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,290
This is like an ear
test or, yeah, sort of.

289
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,020
We've actually put a couple on our
website. Well what do they sound like?

290
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,790
We just get that little sample. All
right. I'll give you some samples. A,

291
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:41,700
there is the chromatic illusion.

292
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,360
Ken has a carnival feel to
it. There's also the, uh,

293
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,500
Biana Ellucian. Oh, the can be up illusion

294
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,080
and of course the phantom word
experiments. Whoa, Whoa, Whoa,

295
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,770
whoa, Whoa, whoa.

296
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,430
None of those pieces are gonna make
any kind of sense unless you visit our

297
00:19:03,431 --> 00:19:08,120
