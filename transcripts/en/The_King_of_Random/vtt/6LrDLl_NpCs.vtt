00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.049
In a previous project we made some homemade
fuses, that can double as improvised sparklers

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.849
for holiday celebrations. In this project
we're up-cycling these fuses into super simple,

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.760
fuse propelled, bottle rockets.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.780
To make a little rocket like this, we'll first
need to gather up some simple materials, like

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.590
wooden skewers, electrical tape, aluminum
foil, scissors, and a batch of our homemade

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.120
fuses. Let's get to work cutting up the aluminum
foil into pieces about 2 inches tall, and

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.880
3 inches wide. Now make sure the shiny side
is facing up, and set it flat down on the

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.440
table. Let's go ahead and grab a piece of
fuse cord, and cut 3 pieces off the end so

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.129
we end up with 2 pieces about 1 inch long,
and 1 piece right around the 2 inch mark.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.489
Now carefully place these three pieces, about
an eighth of an inch from the bottom edge

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.820
of the foil, but allow the longer fuse to
stick out the end. Now let's fold the side

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.960
over, and press it down to hold the pieces
in place, then crimp the foil down around

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.090
the center fuse as tightly and neatly as possible.
Now the top of our foil can be folded down

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.610
and pressed flat, so we can continue rolling
it all the way to the end. At this point,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.850
just pinch the foil around the fuse, and begin
to roll it so it forms a tight seal at the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.619
base. Now it's time to bring out the electrical
tape. This will hold it altogether, and we

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.259
can start by folding one small piece of tape
over the top, and then back on itself, to

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.619
seal off the tip. Now let's go ahead, and
cut another piece about 3 inches long, to

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.650
wrap around the rocket nozzle. You can do
this by lining the edge of the tape flush

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.579
with the base, then wrapping the entire length
of tape as tightly as you can. The result

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.950
should be a tightly reinforced, propelling
nozzle. Our simple rocket motor is done, so

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.650
now we can attach a wooden skewer, to give
it some stability and direction. These little

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.710
rockets seem to work best with a skewer length
around 6.5 - 7 inches. Now simply tape the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.189
rocket motor firmly to the top of the skewer,
and with that, our little fuse powered rocket

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.579
is finished. You can tell if it's ready by
laying it sideways over your finger, just

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:15.069
below the rocket nozzle. If it balances, that
means you're good to go. The skewers are naturally

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.849
sharp on the bottom, which makes them fairly
easy to stand upright. And when you're ready

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.749
for launch, go ahead and light the fuse. You
can see when the fuse works its way, up into

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:28.519
the rocket motor, the extra fuel catches fire,
and builds up so much pressure that it shoots

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.040
the rocket skyward. As small and simple as
they are, these little rockets take off with

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.359
surprising power, and can blast over 100 ft
away. Of course, once you know how to make

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:43.159
one, it's easy to make a whole bunch, and
all, for just a few cents each. I got into

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.930
my wife's scrapbooking supplies and made some
little rocket skins, that slide on overtop,

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.480
just to see how they'd look. Then I went ahead
a made a whole bunch more. I tried lighting

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.859
a few of these rockets at the same time, and
was excited to see, they were all fairly consistent.

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:01.510
Now, if you don't want to make a customized
case, don't worry. These rockets fly higher

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.499
and further without one anyway. Well now you
know how to turn some dirt cheap, homemade

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:11.489
fuses, into customized bottle rockets. Just
try to keep track of where they go. That's

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.459
it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps
you'll like some of my others. Check them
