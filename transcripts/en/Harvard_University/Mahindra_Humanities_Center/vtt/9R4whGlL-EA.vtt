00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.870
Good evening, and welcome to
Tales of Sweet Grass and Trees.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.010
I'm Robin Kelsey, and I'm
Dean of Arts and Humanities

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.550
here at Harvard and
co-convener with my colleague,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.640
Ian Miller of the Environment
Forum at the Mahindra

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.260
Humanities Center.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.070
And it is my distinct
pleasure to welcome you all

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.430
and to introduce
tonight's event--

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.250
which, by the way, we would have
put into Sanders Theatre had we

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.060
known what the demand would be.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.730
So lucky you, to have a seat.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.110
I'm going to begin by
giving some thanks.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.600
This event is
co-sponsored by the Center

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.660
for the Study of World Religions
at the Harvard Divinity

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.990
School and the Mahindra
Humanities Center.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.260
And I want to thank
Charlie Stang, the director

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.010
of the Center for the Study of
World Religions, and his staff

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.700
for doing so much to
pull this event together.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.600
I want to thank Homi Bhabha,
the director of the Mahindra

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.910
Humanities Center, his
executive director, Steve Biel,

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.040
and their staff for all
their support of this event.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.280
And I want to thank Ned
Friedman of the Arnold Arboretum

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.340
and his staff,
especially Pam Thompson,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.080
as well as the emeritus,
but still quite vigorous,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.800
professor Larry Buell, without
whom this gathering would not

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.700
have come about.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.340
There are moments that one
wants to hold in suspension,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.840
not because one doesn't
want to see them unfold,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.580
but one simply wants to
acknowledge how marvelous it is

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.490
that this moment has arrived.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.350
And for me, this evening
is such a moment.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.460
And I know the same is
true for Ian and Charlie.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.560
To have these three
incandescent writers--

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.510
Robin Wall Kimmerer,
Richard Powers,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.430
and Terry Tempest
Williams-- together

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:16.480
for a conversation about giving
voice and agency to entities

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.170
beyond the human is a
miraculous, tingling boon

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.340
for this community.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.310
And I want to thank them
and to thank you all

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.950
for making this moment happen.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.400
I'm going to offer brief
introductions of our visitors,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.980
radically truncating
the prodigious extent

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.230
of their achievements.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.450
May I say "truncating"
at this event?

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.440
I'm in trouble already.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.600
I'm just getting started.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.830
With each introduction, I will
offer a snippet of their prose.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.370
And then I will
get out of the way.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.227
Robin Wall Kimmerer makes
me proud to be a Robin.

00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:08.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.390
A plant ecologist, she is
SUNY Distinguished Teaching

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.190
Professor of
Environmental Biology,

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.240
a member of the Citizen
Potawatomi Nation.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.560
She is founder and director of
the Center for Native Peoples

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.840
and the Environment.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.980
Her first book, Gathering Moss,
won the John Burroughs Medal

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.890
for Outstanding Nature Writing.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.220
Her recent book,
Braiding Sweetgrass,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.250
on the teaching of plants, has
been widely read and beloved--

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.910
I'm sure by many in this room.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.540
If you are feeling blue, sit
and read some of the 519 reviews

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.100
on Amazon.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.660
And the testimonials of
inspiration will give you hope.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.390
Better yet-- read the
book, or read it again.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.770
All we Robins may tweet.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.564
But this bird has wings.

00:04:03.564 --> 00:04:07.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.120
Sorry.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.820
I don't know if it's
getting any better or not.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:11.810
But all right.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.089
In the chapter "Burning Cascade
Head" of Braiding Sweetgrass

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.240
Robin writes of the now
fragmentary accounts

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.310
of the venerable Nechesne
ceremony welcoming the salmon,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.310
a ceremony marked by
caretaking and gratitude.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.020
She writes about her own
walks on Cascade Head.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.340
Thinking about this
ceremony, remembering it,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.870
she writes, I drop to
my knees in the grass.

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.450
And I can hear
the sadness, as if

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.170
the land itself was
crying for its people--

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.850
come home, come home.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.610
There are often
other walkers here.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.000
I suppose that's what it means
when they put down the camera

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.370
and stand on the
headland, straining

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.690
to hear above the wind with
that wistful look, the gaze out

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.340
to sea.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.400
They look like they're trying
to remember what it would

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.410
be like to love the world.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.400
Richard Powers is one of the
great novelists of our time.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.240
He has written 12 novels on an
astonishing array of subjects,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.030
garnering innumerable
fans around the world

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.590
and many prizes.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.800
To pluck just one
from his stash,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.950
The Echo Maker,
his 2006 novel that

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.280
unravels from a car
accident in Nebraska

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.590
and mingles with
sandhill cranes,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.900
won the National Book Award.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.210
His most recent
novel, The Overstory,

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.340
is about the strange
powers of trees

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.680
and their entwinement
with humans.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.800
It was shortlisted for
the Man Booker Prize.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.650
Ann Patchett has called it
the best novel ever written

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.400
about trees and, really, just
one of the best novels, period.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.710
In The Overstory Richard
writes, at the start

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.410
of the section entitled "The
Crown," about a man lying

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.395
on the ground at dawn
in the boreal north.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.900
The man, with head sticking
out of the tent, asks himself,

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.420
what are those treetops like?

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.240
They're like that
cog-tooth drawing toy,

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.420
spinning out surprise
patterns from the simplest

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.840
nested cycles.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.220
They're like the tip
of a Ouija planchette,

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.250
taking dictation from beyond.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.950
They are, in fact, like
nothing but themselves.

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:42.730
They are the crowns of five
white spruces laden with cones,

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.260
bending in the wind as they do
every day of their existence.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.770
Likeness is the
sole problem of men.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:54.200
But the spruces put
out messages in media

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.740
of their own invention.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.610
They speak through their
needles, trunks, and roots.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.000
They record in their own bodies
the history of every crisis

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.090
they've lived through.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.620
The man in the tent lies bathed
in signals hundreds of millions

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.680
of years older than
his crude senses.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.060
And still, he can read them.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.650
Terry Tempest Williams
is writer in residence

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.640
at the Harvard Divinity School.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.090
Her many books include
the now canonical work

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.890
of environmental
literature, Refuge--

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.790
An Unnatural History
of Family and Place.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.010
She has won the
Robert Marshall award

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.300
from the Wilderness Society
and the Wallace Stegner Prize.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.760
Last month the Los
Angeles Times announced

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.560
that Terry would receive
the Robert Kirsch

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.690
Award for lifetime
achievement by a writer

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:46.260
with a substantial connection
to the American West.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.550
Having Terry at Harvard
with us the past two years

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:57.900
has been splendid,
invigorating, catalytic.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.040
In Refuge, she writes
of times sitting

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.540
on the shore of the
Great Salt Lake,

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.240
soon after learning that her
mother's chemotherapy has not

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.280
eradicated her cancer.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.290
I love to watch gulls
soar over the Great Basin.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.250
It is another trick of the
lake to lure gulls inland.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:18.160
On days such as this, when
my soul has been wrenched,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.620
the simplicity of flight
and form above the lake

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.030
untangles my grief.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.070
Glide, the gulls
write in the sky.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.660
And for brief moments, I do.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.600
Hoping to glide and circle
this evening with these three

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.000
great writers, I ask
you to please join me

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.880
in welcoming Robin Wall
Kimmerer, Richard Powers,

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.542
and Terry Tempest Williams.

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:43.486
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.080
Yikes.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.759
I feel sorry for all of you.

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:24.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.930
Deep breath.

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:28.130
Thank you, Robin.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:29.500
What a tweet introduction.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.500
Thank you, always, for your
eloquence and leadership--

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.350
merging of the humanities
and the sciences,

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.020
the social sciences,
arts, and religion.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.780
Bless you and Ian
Miller for your vision

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.540
of the Environmental
Forum, an open door

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.430
to the environmental
humanities at Harvard.

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.130
And my deepest gratitude
to Charlie Stang,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:57.100
director of the Center for
the Study of World Religions.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.430
Without a vision of the
Earth as sacred text,

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:02.900
we are not being
responsible to the past,

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:08.710
to the future,
this present moment

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.860
on this beautiful blue
planet we call home.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.220
Ned, thank you for
the work you're doing,

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.880
and for the conversation
you had last night

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.540
with Robin and with Richard.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:24.910
I hope this is an
extension of that.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.340
And my deepest respects
to Larry Buell.

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:30.040
Thank you so much for
walking point for us.

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:40.970
Two extraordinary guests--
they are my literary mentors.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.310
They are teachers.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.790
And the thought that I can
be here with both of you

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.615
is one of the most humbling
moments of my life.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:59.390
Both of you shatter the violent
myth of human exceptionalism,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:02.510
that we are the only species
that lives and breathes

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:06.230
and loves on this
planet here, now.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.190
What you remind us over and over
again, every sentence, is we

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.330
are not alone.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.000
The philosopher
Mary Midgley writes,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.610
the ultimate act
of anthropocentrism

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:24.440
is to assume that other species
do not feel, do not suffer, are

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.020
not sentient beings.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.050
If the taboo against
anthropocentrism

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:33.830
is being lifted, slowly, Robin
Wall Kimmerer and Richard

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:38.360
Powers are writing our way
toward a more inclusive future,

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.790
where community can be
viewed as all life forms--

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:48.190
plants, animals, rocks,
rivers, and human beings.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.200
I see the work that
you do on the page

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.200
and in the world as a
redistribution of power.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.190
As we learn to sharpen, through
you, our capacity to listen,

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.330
to see, to pay attention
to the living world,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:05.050
to those we live among in the
plant and animal kingdoms,

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.820
we are beginning-- just barely--

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:10.150
to understand what native
people have remembered.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.960
As Henry Beston has written,
these are not underlings.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.810
These are other nations.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:17.830
Welcome.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.720
It is an honor to
be in conversation

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.330
with the two of you.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:28.120
I'd like to dedicate tonight to
William Merwin, who passed away

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.350
on the Ides of March--

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.830
he would have loved that;
maybe he planned it--

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:34.990
one of our greatest poets.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.620
I remember Mark Strand,
when he was living in Utah,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.570
teaching at the
University of Utah.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.620
We were at one of those
awkward gatherings socially.

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.260
And we were talking
about Merwin.

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.200
And he said, oh, Merwin.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.420
He was probably our
generation's-- no,

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.180
he was our generation's
greatest poet,

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.720
until he started
writing about trees.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.050
When I told William
that, he said, oh,

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.116
and if Mark had
only come to visit.

00:13:05.116 --> 00:13:05.616
Ha.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:14.670
Outsider art,
outsider literature--

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:19.440
we belong to this
tradition, too often viewed

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.450
within the academy as soft,
sentimental, and at times

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:26.830
nostalgic.

00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:32.160
For those of us within the
Harvard Divinity School

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.220
community, we are especially
grateful to have you

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.770
here at this moment.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:40.170
And many of us
view your presence

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.970
as fortuitous, as
auspicious, a blessing--

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:47.210
pick your word.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.950
We need your wisdom.

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:52.310
And it would not be
honest if we did not

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.390
bring to the table
what we are facing.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:03.630
As a frame for this
conversation, on Friday

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.170
the tree at the center
of the Divinity School,

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.291
the Divinity Tree,
is being cut--

00:14:09.291 --> 00:14:19.700
a 150- to 200-year-old red
oak, deemed on the downturn,

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.230
with hollow limbs.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:29.420
So says the particular
report from an arborist.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:31.925
The question now is, what
do we do with this moment?

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.360
What is the nature of ceremony?

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.400
How do we bear witness?

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.720
And what comes afterward?

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.010
So here's my questions to
begin our conversation.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.290
What are we afraid of?

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.735
How shall we live?

00:14:52.735 --> 00:14:56.860
And as Dean Kelsey coined last
night in our conversation,

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.660
what is the politics
of the unseen?

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:04.250
Richard, you write, trees
stand at the heart of ecology.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.340
And they must come to stand at
the heart of human politics.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.380
So this is where we are--

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.140
a collision, a
collusion of values.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:13.920
They are economic.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.280
They are ecological
and spiritual at once.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.500
I hear your voice--

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.860
why didn't you do something,
you who were there?

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.350
We tried.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.110
We tried.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:29.450
Restoring land,
you write, Robin,

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.580
land without
restoring relationship

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.340
is an empty exercise.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.250
How do we restore this
relationship, here, now,

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:40.000
at this place?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.690
W.S. Merwin writes,
quote, I want

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:47.330
to tell what the
forests were like.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.980
I have to speak in a
forgotten language.

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.020
So the question I would
like you both to address

00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:55.555
is, what is the
forgotten language?

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.200
I think we should
start by acknowledging

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.700
whatever the right word
for the wrong word--

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.430
which is coincidence--
should be,

00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:15.950
that Robin, I am just back
from Hawaii, and a visit

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:19.670
to Merwin's palm forest.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.800
And Robin's on her
way there next week,

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.843
or two weeks from now.

00:16:23.843 --> 00:16:24.600
Yeah.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.100
Wow.

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.982
So, yeah.

00:16:25.982 --> 00:16:28.580
Mm-hmm.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.196
I went out-- can you
hear in the back?

00:16:33.196 --> 00:16:33.696
No.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.964
Taking technology into
my own hands here.

00:16:38.964 --> 00:16:40.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:43.560
I feel empowered.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.840
Better?

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.810
In the back?

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:47.310
Yeah?

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:49.470
Good.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.470
So I said that I am
just back from Hawaii

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:55.170
as a guest of the
Merwin Conservancy,

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:57.750
and have just visited the
extraordinary palm forest

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.930
that he left us as
one of his legacies.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:05.215
And Robin is on her way there
in a matter of one or two weeks.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:15.109
I had the pleasure of spending
remarkable time with him

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:17.210
when I was younger.

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:20.720
And I had hoped to
see him on this visit.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:22.520
And he was in his last days.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.900
And company was not possible.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:32.750
But I did visit the 11 acres
of world that he transformed.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:38.990
He took spent farmland
on the island of Maui.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:44.690
And over the course
of 40 years, 45 years,

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:49.010
he transformed it
into what may be,

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.470
by many measures, the most
extraordinary collection

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:54.920
of palms in the
world, or certainly

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:57.440
one of the most extraordinary.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:01.010
And he did that more or
less single-handedly--

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:07.490
not to make it, but
simply to be planting.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.700
He just did it every other day.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.580
He just brought something
out and planted it.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:22.110
As a result, they've ended up
with several thousand palms,

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:29.930
450-plus species from
all over the world,

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.330
just because a man
thought this would

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.140
be an interesting practice,
just to have something

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:42.230
to order his week and to make
him present to where he was.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.460
The land was spent--

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.440
whatever that meant,
whatever that means.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:56.250
And now it's like walking
through the world's palm

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.340
forests in the
course of 11 acres--

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.910
not unlike walking through
the Arnold Arboretum

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.990
and seeing these creatures
brought from all terrains

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:10.360
and all climes together
into a single place.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.540
It's absolutely extraordinary.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.730
And you'll see it soon.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:22.330
But what interests me,
again, is this idea that--

00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:24.080
this isn't science.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.490
In fact, when the Conservancy
brought the scientists

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:33.858
in to look at the palms and tell
them, what is the value here,

00:19:33.858 --> 00:19:35.650
they said, well, since
he wasn't especially

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.400
careful about provenance
and accession records,

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:44.058
we can't really use it
as a scientific tool.

00:19:44.058 --> 00:19:45.360
Yeah.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.810
It was never his point.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:52.010
And it's simply one of the
most extraordinary spots

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.760
for being present to place
that I've ever stood in.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:03.750
I'm eager to stand
in that place,

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:06.750
and to feel that
power of presence

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:12.220
and the power of a restoration
of healing spent lands,

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:12.990
and that presence.

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.970
I also would like to respond
to your question, that

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.440
brought tears to my eyes that
you should ask, what are we

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.840
afraid of?

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.480
What are we afraid of
that Merwin was not

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:35.450
afraid of, not afraid of in that
act of replanting that place?

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:39.390
And I worry that
we are, at root,

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.020
afraid of acknowledging
the grave mistakes

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:47.690
that we have made, the
grave underestimates

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.440
of the sentient beings
who are around us,

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:58.940
of imagining feeling that
wound of knowing that we are

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.070
surrounded by intelligences.

00:21:04.718 --> 00:21:07.016
Let me see if I can--

00:21:07.016 --> 00:21:08.560
let me just do this.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.860
Is that OK?

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.490
Yeah.

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.210
That we are surrounded
by intelligences

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:21.170
other than our own that we
have dismissed, harvested

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:26.720
as if they were commodities,
as if they were just stuff--

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.450
I think that we're
afraid of the pain that

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:34.640
will come from that and a
pain of the humbling that

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.940
comes from that, of
acknowledging the mistake

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.750
that we've made.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:43.340
To not realize that we are
surrounded by our relatives who

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:49.100
have cared for us all along,
and that we have reciprocated

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:55.050
their generosity and
their care with blindness,

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:58.910
I think that's one of the things
that we're deeply afraid of.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:03.680
And so we maintain this posture
of human exceptionalism.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.770
We create arguments
and rationales

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:12.350
for why these others need
to be under our control,

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.110
that these others
are our property.

00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:18.110
And I think that's
what we're afraid of,

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:22.310
is the pain of acknowledgment.

00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:24.590
And with the advances
in science that

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:29.420
are coming fast and furious, I
can't think of a single study

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.470
where anyone has proven that the
world is dumber than we think.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:34.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.400
Right?

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:41.150
And we are approaching
that time of reckoning.

00:22:41.150 --> 00:22:43.820
And it's deeply
interesting to me, how will

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.720
we react when we all
come to recognize

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.870
the intelligences
that are around us,

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:56.450
and the disrespectful,
dishonorable ways that we

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.840
have interacted with them.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.560
Robin, you mentioned that
we're afraid of the grief.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.360
We're afraid of
feeling something.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:16.370
I remember one of the last times
I was with Merwin and Paula,

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:18.620
my brother had just passed away.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.710
And when we met--

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:24.300
I've known William for 30 years.

00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:27.730
And he looked at me and
he said, what's wrong?

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:29.680
And I told him.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.890
And I started to weep.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:39.850
And he just held me and
said, I know where to go.

00:23:39.850 --> 00:23:45.730
And he took Brooke and I to
this particular precipice.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:49.750
It was a beautiful
ledge, one of the folded

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.130
cliffs he writes about.

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:54.970
And we just looked
out over the water.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.590
And he never said anything.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:03.280
We just watched the water-- the
waves, the erosion, the birds.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.880
We just immersed
ourselves in this place.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.650
We went back to their house.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.740
And Paula and Brooke were
talking in the living room.

00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:14.440
And William said, come
to my study, which

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.330
was this inner sanctum.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.990
And I walked in and
he shut the door.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.180
And I just sobbed.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:26.130
And he just stood
there and let me.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.090
And then he looked at me with
those steel-blue eyes and he

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.640
said, this--

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:37.250
this is the place we write from.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:41.960
Never forget, this is
the place we write from.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.322
Is it?

00:24:47.322 --> 00:24:53.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.490
So we are afraid of dying.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.920
And I think consequently,
we're afraid of creatures

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.600
that are so much larger
and older than us.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:15.630
And to think about a tree, an
individual bristlecone pine,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.050
that's older than writing--

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.680
it's a terrifying thing.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.560
To think, like
Frank Kermode says,

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.595
that we were born in
the middle of things;

00:25:27.595 --> 00:25:29.220
we live in the middle
of things; and we

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.860
die in the middle of things--
that's not a good story.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:39.380
So there's this impulse to make
sure that no one else gets out

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:40.610
of here alive.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.520
To some extent, we take
revenge on creatures

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.590
that seem to have a much more
integrated and continuous

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.070
existence than we do.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:55.730
And I think that's a
small instance of being--

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.630
if you grow up in a
culture that tells you

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:03.680
that there is no meaning
except the meaning

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:08.970
that you make for yourself,
it's terrifying at first

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.040
to think that there might
be meaning out there.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:18.020
And I think the impulse
toward mastery and the impulse

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:21.980
to control starts
in that sense that--

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.720
I'm going to die, and all of
this is going to keep going.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.180
But I've been told
that the only meaning,

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:34.290
the only access to meaning
that I have is my own life.

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:36.690
I want revenge on
everything out there.

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.540
I think there's an
element of that in the way

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.630
that we've reduced
other sentient

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:46.520
beings and other moral
agents to resources.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.060
And I think that that's
coupled with our great desire

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.240
to continue to see
ourselves as in control,

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.690
on the top of everything.

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:00.640
And it's kind of an
immortality project, I think.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.860
I think you're exactly right.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:08.200
And what is that place that
we write from, and tell

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.160
those stories?

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:17.500
Because that place that holds
that really deep well of grief

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:23.740
is, for me, the same
place that holds the joy,

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.800
and that they are partners.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:33.580
And so yes, we write from
the tension of that place.

00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:37.240
And I think, to tie these
threads together, that notion

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:42.100
of being afraid to become
part of the Earth again,

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:46.270
that ultimate
reciprocity, that--

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:49.160
for me in the worldview
that I inhabit--

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.210
there is that
sacred time when you

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:56.560
get to become the humus, the
root of that wonderful word

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:02.020
of humility, of human and soil.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.530
To me, that is a place that I
want to live in and write from,

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.160
too, that place of humus,
and the willingness

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.570
to be part of that, to feel
my whole self interdigitated

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.680
with all those lives
that came before, like--

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.560
I'm sorry, I'm a botanist--
like root hairs penetrating

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.980
those air spaces, you know?

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.300
Yeah.

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:32.410
So in saying that, it
reminds me that we either

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:37.090
think that the world is a source
of belongings, all for us,

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:40.930
or it is a most profound
sense of belonging,

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.345
where we came from
and would return to.

00:28:43.345 --> 00:28:47.830
I love in your chapter
"The Three Sisters"

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:51.400
how you say they should
be writing the story.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.540
It should be them
who tell this story.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:59.630
And then in another chapter
you talk about, it's

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.060
all about the pronouns.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.740
Could you talk about
those two things,

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.750
and weave them together?

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:07.250
Yes.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:14.320
If there are scientists in the
room-- and I know there are--

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:18.050
and heck, any just speaker
of English, the notion that--

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:22.430
especially in our scientific,
technical writing--

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:27.050
that we must "it" the world,
that these beloved teachers,

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:30.110
these sources of
knowledge for us,

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:35.450
we can refer to only with great
distances, is to be objective

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.668
and to call them "it."

00:29:36.668 --> 00:29:38.210
Whether we're doing
technical writing

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.280
or whether we're
speaking English,

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.680
we have to "it" the world.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.620
And just to bring that
home, I would never

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:50.624
say of my dear friend, it is
sitting at the table right now.

00:29:50.624 --> 00:29:51.830
Right.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.750
Right?

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:54.260
I'm sorry.

00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.420
I mean, that's rude.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.310
I've taken something
away from you

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:01.820
and made you no different
than this table.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:05.480
And that is, in English,
how we are constrained,

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:09.810
aren't we, to speak of the
living world, that we "it"

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:10.310
nature?

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:12.500
We have no other way to do it.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:16.850
And it strikes me as the
perfect language for capitalism.

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:19.160
Oh, yeah.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.470
There's a moment
in my story where

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:26.110
two people are doing a tree-sit
200 feet above the Earth,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:29.780
in a giant redwood
that's slated to be cut.

00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.680
And they're holding
a perpetual banter

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.930
with the cutters,
who show up every day

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:39.320
to see if these folks are
still sitting up in the tree.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:47.480
And at one point the
cutter says, come on down.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.010
We can talk about it.

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.270
We won't hurt Mimus.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:54.170
And there's this instant when
the people up in the tree say,

00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:54.860
ah--

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.450
we got them to call
it by its name.

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:00.830
Step one.

00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:02.630
Yes.

00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:07.190
Richard, in your
characters, we see

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:11.420
where they begin, where
you start these profiles.

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:13.280
And we see the
transformation and how

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.180
they're all drawn to trees--

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:15.860
Right.

00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.030
By the end.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:23.530
And they are transformed.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:26.980
We as readers are transformed.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.060
I'm wondering, as the
writer, were you transformed?

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.590
Oh, my God, yeah.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:39.040
I mean, the reason I wrote these
nine road-to-Damascus stories

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.410
is because I couldn't
get mine out of my head.

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:52.600
I went from being absolutely,
ridiculously tree blind at 55

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.850
to the worst kind of convert.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:55.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:55.420 --> 00:32:00.840
And you know there's nothing
worse than a recent convert.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:01.910
No, it was pathetic.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:02.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.743
And I mentioned this last night.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.130
I couldn't tell an
ash from an elm.

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:14.040
Forgive me.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:18.310
Robin's heard this, and
Terry's heard this already.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:21.580
I knew what a maple
looked like, you know.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:27.040
But I also put sweet gum and
sycamore into that category.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.440
They were just
strange-looking maples.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:33.400
And I would see a tulip
poplar and say, wow,

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.100
what happened to the
top of that maple leaf?

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.460
It was just a blur.

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.800
There was a frilly
green blur out there,

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.370
that was occasionally
aesthetically pleasing

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:49.000
but purely functional.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.320
To this moment of a-ha, which
happened to me because I

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:57.792
happened to be standing
in front of an escapee,

00:32:57.792 --> 00:33:03.880
up on Skyline Road above
Silicon Valley in the Central

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:10.850
Peninsula, that was 30 feet
across and 300 feet tall,

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.240
and almost as old as Jesus.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.450
I'm not proud of the fact that
it took something that size

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.990
to effect this conversion.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.690
But once the conversion
was underway,

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:27.800
everything, everything,
everything changed.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:33.290
And I went back out east,
to the forests and the trees

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:38.960
that I had grown up
near and thought I knew.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:49.670
And the most banal thing was
now a mystery, and painful.

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:52.482
You say, what are we afraid of?

00:33:52.482 --> 00:33:53.690
We're afraid of deep feeling.

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.990
We're afraid of being vulnerable
in the face of something

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:02.010
so magnificent.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:06.130
And I kept reading, if you
want to see what an eastern--

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:08.010
I was immersed in this research.

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:12.270
I read over 100 books on trees.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:16.380
And the sudden
realization that meaning

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:20.332
was out there changed
everything that I read.

00:34:20.332 --> 00:34:21.790
And I kept reading
that if you want

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.922
to see what an eastern
forest looked like,

00:34:23.922 --> 00:34:25.380
an eastern broad-leaf
forest looked

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.010
like before the
crazies got here,

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.469
you had to go to the Smokies,
because there's still

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:36.960
120,000 acres of uncut forest
in Great Smoky Mountain National

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.699
Park.

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:45.810
And I went down there four years
ago as part of my research.

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:50.790
And you don't have to be
capable of seeing too much--

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:53.070
as you walk up from a
second-growth forest

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.460
into an uncut forest,
into a primary forest,

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.480
into a forest that looks very
much like it probably would

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.590
have looked like
10,000 years ago--

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.790
to see the difference.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.650
I mean, the quality of
the light is different.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:09.660
The sound is different.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:13.860
The smell is different,
species count is different.

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.950
And here I was for the
first time, thinking,

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:18.660
this is what my forest--

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:23.310
this is what a functioning,
intact forest looked

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.220
like everywhere in my country.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.340
And I'd never seen it before.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:34.680
And eight months later, I was
still thinking about that.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.385
And I went back.

00:35:36.385 --> 00:35:37.260
And I bought a house.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:40.140
And I've been living there
ever since, full time.

00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:45.600
And you say, how does that
road to Damascus change you?

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.170
It used to be that my
sense of worth in the world

00:35:50.170 --> 00:35:54.160
was contingent upon my writing
a thousand words every day.

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.670
If I didn't do it, I would
start that slight sense

00:35:57.670 --> 00:35:58.930
of existential panic.

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:00.430
Am I going to
remember how to do it?

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:02.500
Is it going to be there
day after tomorrow?

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.570
Am I a decent person?

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:11.920
Have I paid my rent today?

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:17.590
Now, if I don't walk four
miles, if I don't get out there

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:22.200
under these trees,
it's not a good day.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:28.100
My sense of what I see
and how I want to see it

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:33.280
and what constitutes
time well spent

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:37.040
is entirely different now.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:37.960
Thank you.

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:41.730
You know, Robin, I'm reminded--

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:44.220
you talk about the
redwoods, these big trees.

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:50.130
And I'm reminded of the story
you tell about moss, seeing

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:51.750
this moss on the stone.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:56.640
And you were so excited and
impassioned, both braiding in--

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.260
as you do so eloquently--

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.770
what it means to be
a Potawatomi woman,

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:06.210
indigenous roots, in
place, also a scientist.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:08.170
And one of your students said--

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:10.530
and I'm going to
paraphrase this poorly--

00:37:10.530 --> 00:37:14.250
but, is this your religion?

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:18.210
And you stop, and you
think, where do I go?

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.030
Can you share that with us?

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:25.550
And maybe, where do you
see your transformation?

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:28.530
Or how do you respond
to it, and that notion

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.050
that you were sharing
about kinship, kin, key?

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.210
Yeah.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.010
I remember so
clearly that moment.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.330
And it was in the Smokies.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:37.050
Oh, wow.

00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.780
It was above your home.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:43.290
And my students and I
were both transfixed.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.540
We were there in spring.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.750
And Copeland got it right,
about Appalachian Spring.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.570
Oh my God, yeah.

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:52.770
Only these two could
have gotten me out

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.476
of this place in the spring.

00:37:54.476 --> 00:37:55.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:57.480
Two days before leaving
I was on the trail.

00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:01.255
And there were two dozen species
of ephemerals on the trail.

00:38:01.255 --> 00:38:03.210
I know, I want to follow you.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:03.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.230
We should have held
this talk there.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.670
We still have snow
on the ground.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.180
No, but in that moment when--

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.330
I was teaching at a small
college in the Bible Belt.

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:15.990
And so when a student asked
me, is this my religion,

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.810
knowing that there was a
huge gulf between our ways

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:25.620
of understanding that, I
just really hemmed and hawed,

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.000
as you might imagine.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.050
It was also my first job.

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:29.603
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:29.603 --> 00:38:32.190
So I thought, I probably ought
to be a little careful here.

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:39.680
But is it?

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.490
Yes, in the broadest
sense of that word,

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.130
of the sense of
belonging and meaning.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.050
I'm glad-- I'm always glad when
anybody asks me about moss.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.838
Ha.

00:38:54.838 --> 00:38:57.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:02.000
But you could say, about moss,
what you just beautifully said

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.340
about your forests, of that
sense of unending mystery

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:13.380
and curiosity that is present
in a tiny little moss forest,

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:19.010
and the spiritual practice
of being on your knees

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:24.830
to see these beings, the
fact that you don't see them

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:26.720
if you're not paying attention.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.400
You don't see them if
you're walking too fast.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.660
You don't see them if you're
in your head all the time,

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:36.320
and always looking up for
things that are bigger

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.150
and more powerful than you.

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:44.270
But when you take the time, it
is that same rush, euphoria.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:47.090
I've been doing
this for decades.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:50.030
And I still get that
same rush of mystery,

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.970
of entering into a
world that isn't mine

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:56.780
but is so fully inhabited
by these beings who know all

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.900
about what it is to be a moss.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:03.410
They are fully present
and being in place.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:08.180
They are little
sovereign green beings.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.900
And it is always humbling
just to be in their presence.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.260
It's a kind of awe
that we usually

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.430
associate with the
grand, but is, in fact,

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:22.940
present at the
miniature as well.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:30.020
You talk about mushrooms
and the Pottawatomie word.

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:31.490
Can you talk about that?

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.290
Oh, I'd love to.

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:37.320
And the Pottawatomie language,
of which I am a very beginning

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:42.140
student, has some, for
me, words for things

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.600
that we do not have in English.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.470
And for me, one of the most
powerful of those words

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:51.440
is associated with that
little bed of moss.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.290
Be on your knees, come
into that little forest.

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:57.320
And you look, and there's going
to be a little mushroom pushing

00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.640
up from there.

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.240
And [INAUDIBLE],, a
wonderful ethnobotanist--

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:08.240
Ojibwe woman elder-- she
gave the word for that.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.640
The word is [NON-ENGLISH].

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:15.260
And it means the force that
causes mushrooms to push up

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.870
from the Earth overnight.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.580
And as I've written, that
that is the moment that I knew

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:25.770
I had to learn my
language, because

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:29.220
of that power of observation.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:33.060
Not only of-- the word isn't
for the mushroom, is it?

00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.810
It's the word for a
force and an energy

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:39.510
and an agency that
animates the world.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:41.940
And since then, I've
learned that there

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:46.110
are other words for these forces
that Western science does not

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:47.580
even have language for.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:51.270
We might explain the
mechanism by which it works.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:52.740
And oftentimes,
as scientists, we

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:57.090
confuse knowing the mechanism
with knowing the meaning.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.320
But our ancestors did
not make that mistake.

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.470
They named the
forces separately.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.720
There is a force for sap rising.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:06.090
There is a force for
that which propels

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:12.900
the opening of buds into leaves,
for all of these mysteries.

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.240
You know, back to
this word "religion,"

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:20.160
I'm not sure what it would
have meant to your student.

00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:22.530
But it means something
for me to remember

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:28.270
that the etymology of that word
means tying back together--

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.140
re-ligio.

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.090
Yes.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.930
Like to ligate back together.

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:36.070
So insofar as being
on your knees in front

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:40.000
of the moss forest
is a reuniting of you

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.630
and something else, then
it is a religious act.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.200
Amen.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.440
And I love that tying--

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.760
Brother.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.490
That tying together, it makes
me think of the mycelium--

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:50.020
Yeah.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.510
In the forest floor, when
you see that white connective

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:54.460
tissue, almost like lace.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.070
And when I read your
piece, that word,

00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:00.340
I really experienced it
almost like a fist coming up

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:02.680
with that fruiting
body of the mushroom,

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.230
knowing different
people have moments

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:06.970
with the gifts that are theirs.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:12.730
And this force, this resistance
insistence, all of a sudden I

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:15.640
started thinking about
community differently.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.300
I started thinking about how
we're connected differently.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.720
And in your book,
Richard, for me,

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:23.660
one of the most powerful parts--
and I think about, again,

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.190
this politics of the
unseen and the seen--

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:31.740
is this resistance insistence
that your characters emerge in.

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:36.300
And what do we do with that?

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:41.040
There's that haunting
scene with Patricia,

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.320
where she's asked
the question, what's

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.450
the most important thing
we can do for the Earth?

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:50.740
Can you talk to us about--

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:56.165
and I have to be honest, this
is a difficult one for me.

00:43:56.165 --> 00:43:56.915
And we're friends.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:07.490
My brother hung himself in July.

00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:11.660
And we had a very candid
conversation in April.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:15.380
And what he said
was, I have the rope.

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:21.410
And when someone you love says
that, you take that seriously.

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:23.600
And we did.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.410
We talked about it.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:32.690
And he just said, Terry,
the world is fucked.

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:33.890
I'm fucked.

00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:36.080
And you're in denial.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.870
And you've got to let go.

00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.400
You've got to let
go of the Earth.

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.680
You have to let go of me.

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.970
It's over.

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:47.930
And I remember saying to him,
I will never give up on you.

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:51.830
I will never give up on the
Earth, because of that force,

00:44:51.830 --> 00:44:55.280
because of the mycelium
that holds us together.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:59.690
And in your book, here is
this powerful character

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:02.960
who brought forward the
notion that trees communicate.

00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:07.970
And then she was chastised,
thrown out of the academy.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:12.470
And in this moment, in another
lecture out of another time,

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:14.990
can you talk to us
about un-suicide?

00:45:18.434 --> 00:45:21.400
This is the question, as your
reader, I want to ask you.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.290
And unfortunately,
we're doing it publicly.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:28.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:32.150
Well, everything is
done publicly, right,

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:36.750
because there's always
something listening, right?

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:49.580
The story of Mimi Ma's father,
and the inexplicable suicide, I

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.678
got from a dear friend.

00:45:51.678 --> 00:45:59.140
And her father also told
her, I have the gun.

00:46:03.970 --> 00:46:09.800
And I think the bewilderment--
and again, the etymology

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.290
of that word is crucial.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:18.710
The return of our state to a
wild state, the bewilderment

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:25.440
that we feel in the presence
of someone else's hopelessness

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.870
is unanswerable.

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:33.120
And if I did not now
believe that meaning

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:38.550
was out there, and not
simply living and dying

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:47.220
with us each individually,
I would be your brother.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:55.420
But you reference the work
that Patricia is involved in,

00:46:55.420 --> 00:47:01.510
the recent discovery
that trees in a forest

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:06.070
are richly and robustly
connected underground

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:10.870
by fungal intermediaries,
and sharing both sugars

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:13.450
and hydrocarbons and
secondary metabolites

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:17.290
in a kind of massive
Medicare for all--

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:21.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:25.820
That you cannot undo.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.090
It becomes much more
astonishing when

00:47:29.090 --> 00:47:32.270
you realize, as Suzanne
Simard then demonstrated,

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:37.462
that Douglas firs are doing
resource sharing with birches.

00:47:37.462 --> 00:47:39.545
And as we learned from
Paul [INAUDIBLE] yesterday,

00:47:39.545 --> 00:47:41.750
the oaks are doing
it with pines.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.490
Any sense that we have that
it's every individual for itself

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:55.610
out there, that it's a
competition among ruthless

00:47:55.610 --> 00:48:00.740
individual forces, is
completely laid waste to

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:05.220
by this vision of
massive interconnection.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.000
That notion of "we"--

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.270
that we are not alone and we
are nurtured by each other,

00:48:18.270 --> 00:48:21.100
is a powerful
sense of resilience

00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:22.400
in the face of stress.

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.880
And we know that these networks
have evolved and been created

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:32.680
in response to, how do we deal
with shortage, with stress,

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.040
with those things
that propel undoing.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:39.470
And the answer is that
we rely on each other.

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:40.870
We share.

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:45.220
In thinking about the
evolution of mutualisms,

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.020
it has been shown
for some organisms--

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.530
lichens are the ones
I can speak to--

00:48:50.530 --> 00:48:55.870
that when you put together
those two symbionts of a lichen,

00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:00.040
and you put them together in
a laboratory atmosphere which

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.020
has everything that
they need, when

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:05.600
things are abundant they give
each other the cold shoulder.

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:09.880
They have no interest
in symbiosis.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:14.260
When you stress them, when you
start to take everything away,

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:16.240
something happens to them.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:19.150
And they know that
they need to team up.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.160
And that's when lichens form.

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.480
That's when lichens form.

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.710
And to me, that's a powerful
lesson of the resilience that

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:30.850
comes, and a lesson for a time
of climate change and resource

00:49:30.850 --> 00:49:33.610
shortage of our own
making, that what

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:37.300
does the world say that we
should be doing in this time?

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.250
Isolating one another?

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:42.880
Reveling in individualism
and cutting off our ties

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.340
to one another and
to the natural world?

00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:46.100
Of course not.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:47.260
It says, come together.

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:47.890
Come together.

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:50.740
And both of you have
to bring your gifts

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.340
to the table in a just way.

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:54.220
That's right.

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:59.810
And I take that as a
lesson for our time.

00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:01.940
There is no environmental
issue that's

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:04.803
separate from issues of justice.

00:50:04.803 --> 00:50:05.790
No.

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:09.850
And that's un-suicide, right?

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:15.080
That's someone saying-- the
ultimate source of power,

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:21.200
of narrative is that
word "nevertheless."

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.810
That's where all our
stories come down to.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.610
It all ends.

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:30.690
It all changes.

00:50:30.690 --> 00:50:32.880
It's all lost.

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.320
Nevertheless, for a
moment, we are here.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.490
And for a moment, we are part of
a community that we can't even

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.096
see to understand.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.820
I love that line--

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:56.130
be still and feel.

00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:01.550
We don't do that enough,
be still and feel.

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:05.360
Well, and we're back to
Robin's act of attention,

00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.950
which requires getting
down on your knees.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:12.220
And I said this yesterday, too.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:20.775
Robin's books profoundly changed
me as I was writing mine.

00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:30.890
And in particular, it
was this realization

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:34.760
that the power of
stillness is also

00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.400
the power of magnification.

00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.670
And Robin points out
this astonishing thing

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:48.530
in Gathering Moss, where the
relative sizes of mosses--

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:53.900
if you go from the ones that
are closest to their fundament

00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:58.760
to like a shining clubmoss or
something that towers inches

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:03.680
high above the
base, that ratio is

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:09.360
the same as the ratio between
a blueberry bush and a redwood.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:18.210
So if I wanted my redwood, I
could stop, magnify, and see it

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:20.480
in the clubmoss.

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.470
And I have a trail
near the house--

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.660
it's one of the closest
to my house, Chestnut Top

00:52:24.660 --> 00:52:27.480
on the north side of the park.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.640
I call it the Robin
Wall Kimmerer trail,

00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:32.300
because the first
300 yards of it

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:39.780
is just a magnificent treasure
trove of non-vasculars.

00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:43.120
It's just the perfect
breeding ground for it.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:49.400
And sometimes I feel driven to
get up to the top of the ridge,

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.640
and get up into the pine oaks,
and keep moving and seeing

00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.210
the world from up above,
and getting that big view

00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:58.250
across the ridges.

00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:01.580
Sometimes I never make it
out of that first 300 yards

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:08.810
because there, in a
patch 18 inches across,

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:10.385
is a whole forest
within a forest.

00:53:13.286 --> 00:53:17.430
But that requires stillness.

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:20.710
The audience-- you
have been still.

00:53:20.710 --> 00:53:23.870
And let's open it up for
questions for the next 30

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:24.370
minutes.

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:31.250
So it just flashed into
my mind that the stillness

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:35.600
that you were advocating, and
the nevertheless-ness that I

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.410
was advocating are both
in that word "still."

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:42.500
We hold still, but still.

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:44.975
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:44.975 --> 00:53:47.950
Yes.

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:49.390
Questions?

00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:53.228
Yes, and we have someone
that's helping us.

00:53:53.228 --> 00:53:54.520
There's a question in the back.

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:01.690
Thank you so much.

00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:09.400
I've noticed an immense
amount of kindness

00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:11.500
that you share when
you speak to each other

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.910
and when you share your stories.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:21.280
I've also noticed that when you
describe the plants and trees,

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:26.740
you have this kindness with
which you use the words.

00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:30.160
And I've also noticed
there is a shift when

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.300
you speak about people.

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.120
And there are two questions.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:43.550
One is, what kind of
self-kindness practice

00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:46.130
do you have in your life?

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:53.450
And second is, I'm wondering
if to be able to see kindness

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.870
in trees and in
nature, one needs

00:54:56.870 --> 00:55:05.770
to cultivate self-kindness
first to be able to share it,

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:15.410
to be able to see the
same beauty in people,

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:18.740
with the same magnifying
glass and with the same kind

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:22.088
of silence and pause.

00:55:22.088 --> 00:55:23.042
Thank you.

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.910
Thank you for that
question, which

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:35.590
just has my mind reeling
about kindness and the way we

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:40.150
experience it and give it away.

00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:45.100
First, to your question
about self-kindness,

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:49.310
I'm reminded that in
our creation story,

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:53.410
sweetgrass is the
bearer of kindness.

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:58.480
It's always the one who is
there to come in, to fill

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.960
in empty places with kindness.

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:07.240
And so in our teachings, it
is a property of those plants

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.640
to bring that to us.

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.760
I think in reflecting
on what feels

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.480
like almost an implicit
question, of speaking of plants

00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:22.930
with kindness and maybe
of people less so,

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:24.470
is for me the notion--

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:27.760
and again, it's held
in our language.

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:34.450
The same word for berry, of
berry plants, of which there

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.690
are many, the word is min.

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:42.020
And it's the same word as gift.

00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:45.880
And so we understand the plant
world as a bearer of gifts,

00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.000
one of those gifts
being kindness,

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.530
the other gifts of
food and medicine

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:54.810
and beauty and teachings,
and all of those.

00:56:54.810 --> 00:57:00.550
And in a sense, plants
give their bodies away

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:04.930
in these acts of generosity,
reciprocity, and kindness.

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:09.340
But those of us who live
in an animal body, who

00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:15.070
can't photosynthesize, we
can't give our bodies away

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:17.780
in that same gifting sense.

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:22.780
So the kindness, the gifts that
we have to give are different.

00:57:22.780 --> 00:57:25.030
They might be the
gifts of stories.

00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:28.990
They might be the
gifts of creativity,

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:33.870
of restoring the Earth,
of science, of art.

00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:38.980
And so I think that notion of
kindness, and self-kindness,

00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:42.240
is to remind ourselves
of what our gifts are

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:46.990
that we have to give
as well, and to nurture

00:57:46.990 --> 00:57:50.900
those gifts the way that
plants nurture berries.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.946
That's, I guess,
what I'd like to say.

00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:06.350
I have to say that the
biggest gift that I received

00:58:06.350 --> 00:58:12.700
while writing this book was
a kind of honorary membership

00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:20.830
into the world of plant people,
because they are remarkably

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:28.510
generous and gentle, in a
way that I was not before I

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:29.290
wrote this book.

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:41.430
The other capacity that your
question asks about, that is,

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:47.050
demonstrating that also to
large mammalian bipeds, that's

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:49.660
been trickier.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:54.082
I went to the woods
to live deliberately.

00:58:54.082 --> 00:58:54.608
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:54.608 --> 00:58:55.900
Somehow, I knew you'd say that.

00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:57.785
Have to say it.

00:58:57.785 --> 00:59:00.580
I've heard that.

00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:03.520
But also to get away.

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.940
I mean, I was in a rough spot.

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:11.530
And having 800 square miles
of wilderness in my backyard

00:59:11.530 --> 00:59:13.300
was very attractive.

00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:20.170
And I would pick the trails
based on how little chance I

00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:21.550
had for seeing other people.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:31.190
And I gradually did get my
feet back on the ground.

00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:34.310
And it's a lovely figure
of speech, right--

00:59:34.310 --> 00:59:36.860
so that the ground
could come up into me.

00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.610
But my friends and
family would say,

00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:45.060
aren't you afraid, being
out 9, 10, 11 miles down

00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:47.660
a trail without
having seen anybody?

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.070
What if you run into a bear?

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:51.890
There are two bears per
square mile in the Smokies.

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:54.930
And I always wanted to say,
it's not the quadrupeds

00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:55.730
I'm worried about.

00:59:55.730 --> 00:59:58.310
It's the guy in the
camo who's coming down

00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:00.110
the trail in the
other direction.

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:08.340
But enough conversations with
enough of my own kind out there

01:00:08.340 --> 01:00:12.360
really did open my eyes
to a lot of things.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:16.170
People want something that
they're not getting now.

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:18.610
And if we are mean to each
other, if we're angry,

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:22.170
and if we do exceptionally
cruel things,

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:24.820
it's often because of
species loneliness.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.690
It's often because
of solastalgia.

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:32.250
It's often because we
are just so homeless now.

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:38.280
And that's why, in my book, one
of the characters is called--

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:40.020
it's too difficult to set up.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:45.090
But she begins to hear voices.

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:50.220
And the voices are telling her
the most remarkable creations,

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:55.150
the most remarkable
creatures need your help.

01:00:55.150 --> 01:01:00.730
And she pursues this
as a defense of trees,

01:01:00.730 --> 01:01:06.160
these often 1,000-year-old
creatures that are operating

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.880
on these unfathomable scales,
with infinitely complicated

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:11.770
behaviors.

01:01:11.770 --> 01:01:13.960
And it's only through
a series of reverses

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.050
and reveals that she
realizes it's actually

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:20.670
the humans that need our help.

01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:23.040
That's not giving too
much away, for people

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.840
who haven't read the book.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.420
But that's been my
journey, as well.

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.690
And full disclosure--

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:32.550
I'm really angry.

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:35.310
And with a name like "Tempest"--

01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:37.680
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:40.710
I'm going to move now.

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:42.990
So I may look kind.

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:44.498
But I'm really not.

01:01:44.498 --> 01:01:51.150
And the way I
rationalize that is,

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:55.740
I hope that I can take my anger
and turn it into sacred rage.

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:58.530
And I think that's why I write.

01:01:58.530 --> 01:02:00.120
And I'll never forget--

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.400
I have a dear friend,
Willie Grayeyes,

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.070
who's a Navajo elder, Dine.

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:11.040
And after Bears Ears was
gutted by Donald Trump, 85%--

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.970
these are lands sacred to the
Hopi, the Navajo, the Zuni,

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:16.620
the Ute Mountain Ute--

01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:18.960
I went down to where he lives.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:24.620
And I said, Willie, what
do I do with my anger?

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:27.650
And he said Terry, this
is not the time for anger.

01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:30.110
This is a time for healing.

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:31.870
And I'm really struggling.

01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:35.030
I'm angry about
the Divinity Tree.

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:38.000
I'm angry that I
couldn't do something.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.772
I'm angry that
it's being killed.

01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:46.720
And I don't know where
kindness comes in.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.250
I'm trying to be gracious.

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:49.840
I don't want to
lose another job.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:53.350
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:54.730
I've only been here two years.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:02.740
Can sacred rage also be a gift?

01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.920
You're trying to
give us something.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.370
I think we have to come to
grips with who we are and who we

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:10.450
aren't.

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:16.720
And as a Westerner, I am seeing
my home ground raped, razed,

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.340
whatever metaphor
you want to use.

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:23.790
And it's hurting the people.

01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:25.170
And it's hurting the animals.

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:26.700
And it's hurting the plants.

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:29.100
It's destroying community.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:32.430
And I have to gather my energy.

01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:40.200
And to me, the kindness comes
in the form of a fierceness,

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.800
that we can be fierce and
compassionate at once.

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.090
And we can't do it alone.

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:48.747
But here, and this, and this--

01:03:48.747 --> 01:03:49.580
things are shifting.

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:57.138
And we can change our pronouns,
in both the human world

01:03:57.138 --> 01:03:57.680
and the wild.

01:04:00.596 --> 01:04:01.096
Question?

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:11.920
OK, I want to thank
you all for this,

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:15.940
and for acknowledging all of
these really profound thoughts,

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:19.180
and for acknowledging
the anger that many of us

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:21.775
feel about the Divinity Tree.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.130
And I don't know how
to ask this question.

01:04:26.130 --> 01:04:30.593
But how do we forgive
ourselves for not doing more,

01:04:30.593 --> 01:04:32.010
and for not being
able to do more?

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:33.840
This collision of
values is really

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:37.650
sticking with me, because I'm
in the political life here.

01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:43.280
And my days and nights are
one long collision of values--

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.900
human, human exceptionalism.

01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:52.210
How do we forgive ourselves for
letting these things happen?

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:53.170
Can we?

01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:57.320
I have to say--

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:58.820
and then to my friends.

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:07.900
I love that the dean of the
Divinity School, the first act

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:12.140
he and Louanne,
his wife, did were

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:17.060
take acorns to the arboretum
and propagate them.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.330
That, to me, is a
gesture of forgiveness.

01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:21.890
That, to me, was
a gesture saying,

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:24.770
there is going to
be another future,

01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:28.580
given where we find ourselves
here at Harvard University.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:32.245
And to me, those
seeds, those acorns

01:05:32.245 --> 01:05:33.620
are the beginning
of forgiveness.

01:05:33.620 --> 01:05:36.840
And can we have enough faith
at the Divinity School to give

01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:41.390
them the ground they need to
propagate, and not replace it--

01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:42.800
as Ned, you were saying--

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.560
with a big tree that
then fills the space?

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.530
Can we live with that open
space we have created,

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:50.750
and believe that 200
years from now, there

01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:52.503
will be other people
that follow us

01:05:52.503 --> 01:05:54.920
that can put their hands on
that tree and close their eyes

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.320
and feel the power of this tree?

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.990
To me, that is an
act of forgiveness,

01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:01.850
and as a community to
come together and say,

01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:02.960
it's not over.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.210
When the tree is cut,
when the Divinity

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:09.290
Tree is in the chipper,
as Rosetta has said,

01:06:09.290 --> 01:06:11.270
we need to face this.

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:16.285
That's just the beginning
of who we really can become.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:25.240
And in that forgiveness, in the
planting of the acorns, to me,

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.810
the word "restoration,"
the healing,

01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:34.210
the way that we as human people
can participate in healing

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:36.310
in the physical landscape.

01:06:36.310 --> 01:06:41.680
But I'm reminded of our friend
Gary Nabhan's wonderful words,

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.980
that when we do ecological
restoration, which

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.650
might be the
beginning of healing,

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:52.090
we must also do re-story-ation.

01:06:52.090 --> 01:06:57.500
And in my brief
visit to the tree,

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.290
and to stand in the
circle of people

01:06:59.290 --> 01:07:02.820
who care so much about
this, and to feel

01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:08.020
the reciprocity of
emotion between the tree

01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.570
and those people,
I think a wound

01:07:10.570 --> 01:07:14.200
that was very palpable
for me is the lie that's

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:20.570
told, the story about that
tree, that it has to come down,

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:21.680
et cetera, et cetera.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:26.260
But what I mean is
that it's the story,

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:29.860
the re-story-ation
where the healing lies--

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.410
not only in the
physical restoration,

01:07:32.410 --> 01:07:34.870
but of telling the story.

01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:39.370
We have so many monuments around
this country to what we uphold

01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:41.380
as the great and the good.

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:45.070
I think that we need
monuments to wounds.

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:47.620
We need monuments to stupidity.

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:51.130
We need monuments to arrogance.

01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:55.270
And that's a re-story-ation,
to say we were wrong.

01:07:55.270 --> 01:07:58.810
It's back to we're afraid
that we're doing wrong.

01:07:58.810 --> 01:08:00.010
And we are.

01:08:00.010 --> 01:08:01.630
And we should commemorate that.

01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:05.860
We should remember this,
and then plant the oaks.

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:10.700
But I think we need to tell the
truth about that story first.

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:16.100
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.430
Yeah.

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:22.180
Nothing to add to truth as
a necessary prerequisite

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.640
for anything to
happen, except to say

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.580
that I've been on the
road now for almost

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.490
a year for this book.

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:33.490
And everywhere I go,
there's a Divinity Tree,

01:08:33.490 --> 01:08:35.770
every town that I stop in.

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:38.890
And the people who
come up afterwards--

01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:40.960
they don't really want
their book signed.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:46.620
They want to say, this
is what happened here.

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:52.060
And I've completely surrendered
to listening to those stories,

01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:55.540
for as long as it
takes in every venue.

01:08:55.540 --> 01:09:00.790
Whether it's Sheffield,
England, or Los Angeles,

01:09:00.790 --> 01:09:06.160
somebody has got something to
say about a crime that's still

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.300
underway, a crime caused by
anger and pain that hasn't

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.510
been acknowledged or named.

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:16.720
And that's why I
think naming it has

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:21.790
to happen first, before
there can be any healing.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:25.993
Is there a student
that we can hear from?

01:09:25.993 --> 01:09:26.493
Yes?

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:41.300
Merwin, in one of his poems,
"For a Coming Extinction,"

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:47.240
writes, tell him that we who
follow you invented forgiveness

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.760
and forgive nothing.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.750
And he goes on to
write, the bewilderment

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:57.030
will diminish like an echo.

01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:01.490
And I wonder, following
Merwin, whether questions

01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:06.650
of forgiveness or healing
are already too late,

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:10.925
and whether we have the tools
to recognize that lateness.

01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:17.480
The short question
being, do we have

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:20.620
the analytics to realize that
perhaps it's already too late?

01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:27.825
I think we certainly don't
have the analytics to calculate

01:10:27.825 --> 01:10:29.200
"too late," because
we don't even

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.310
know what we'd be too late for.

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:39.070
In other words, the
history of life on Earth

01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:42.790
is the history of one thing
becoming another thing--

01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:45.480
transformation, endless,
endless transformation.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.600
And whatever happens
to us, it's not

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.280
going to be too late
for what becomes.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:03.510
We can never make a calculation
on the effects of anything

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:05.340
that we do.

01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:10.620
And so we're thrown back on that
fundamental ethical requirement

01:11:10.620 --> 01:11:13.233
of simply being present
and being engaged.

01:11:21.089 --> 01:11:22.570
Yes?

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:24.985
We have some questions
over here, as well.

01:11:24.985 --> 01:11:27.260
Yeah?

01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:28.630
Thanks.

01:11:28.630 --> 01:11:30.610
All three of you
are operating from

01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:33.040
and coming from a really
beautiful paradigm

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.270
of belonging.

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:37.270
And you talked about the
other paradigm of belongings

01:11:37.270 --> 01:11:38.740
as a shorthand.

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.980
And I often wonder about--

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:43.330
it's kind of a teaching
and learning question.

01:11:43.330 --> 01:11:44.680
What is the fastest route?

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:49.270
You're all writing, which is
a beautiful teaching for each

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:50.200
of us as individuals.

01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:52.420
But I wonder, what
do you think is

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:56.950
one of the faster routes
for helping us as humans

01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:59.710
change paradigms?

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:01.080
How do we teach that?

01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:08.770
And maybe we don't
need speed, right?

01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:13.281
I mean, recovering slowness
may be essential, too.

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:25.520
Yes, because when I think
about slowness and stillness

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:32.190
of trees, and all the plants,
one of the things that strikes

01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:35.610
me about that-- in
response to your question--

01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:41.610
is that the stillness of
trees honors relationship,

01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:45.810
that if you're going to stand
in one place for centuries,

01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:50.190
you have to be really good at
connection and relationship.

01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:51.930
You can't run away.

01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:53.460
You can't flee.

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:56.640
You can't say, oh well, I
used this whole place up.

01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.410
So now I'll go
wreck another one.

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:08.220
So that notion of stillness and
the investment in relationship,

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:12.810
of making a home, I think,
is an important way.

01:13:12.810 --> 01:13:15.480
I also want to say
that of course,

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:19.830
we all wrestle with
exactly that question.

01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:25.350
And one of the things that
I try to think about a lot,

01:13:25.350 --> 01:13:29.490
because when I feel my own
powerlessness against Monsanto,

01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:34.530
when I feel my own powerlessness
against these forces that

01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:39.660
are arrayed against us, you
can go to despair, right,

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.210
and feel, how could we do this?

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:47.370
But I think that the one thing
that I do have in my power

01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:52.290
to change is how I think and--

01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:57.900
I was going to say what; I will
say, who I love in the world.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:14:01.470
And that change in
one's own being, to say,

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.280
this is what I stand for.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.040
This is how I see the world.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.350
I see the world as kin.

01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:09.870
I see the world as belonging.

01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:13.620
But if I only say that to
myself, if I only feel that,

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:18.030
and feel alone and isolated in
a world which is falling apart--

01:14:18.030 --> 01:14:20.660
the medicine is to
share those thoughts.

01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:23.970
The medicine is the story.

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:27.630
And we all are story makers
around our own dinner tables,

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:30.240
with our neighbors,
and with our students.

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.330
When we give each other
a vocabulary and a name

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:37.560
for the world that
we love, we create

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:41.670
something which
has the potential

01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:45.660
to be magnetically beautiful
that people will migrate

01:14:45.660 --> 01:14:49.950
to that way of thinking because
it's so deeply satisfying

01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:52.504
and cultivates a
sense of belonging.

01:15:00.715 --> 01:15:02.340
Since we're sitting
next to each other,

01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.430
we'll maybe just
ask both questions.

01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:09.480
Thank you, each of
you, for your sharing

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.060
and your vulnerability
in public.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:19.830
Richard, you said once the
conversion was underway,

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:21.840
everything changed.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.010
And my favorite part
of Braiding Sweetgrass

01:15:26.010 --> 01:15:30.420
is about the storying of the
throwing out of the coffee

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.560
grounds.

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.000
Ah.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.400
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:38.100
From which, when I read
the book for the first time

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:41.870
a couple of years ago, I
developed my own daily ritual

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:45.390
of sharing my first water
of the day with the Earth.

01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:52.080
And this discovery-- oh well,
there was no meaning, there

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:56.190
wasn't any special
meaning behind it.

01:15:56.190 --> 01:16:01.410
But the wondering is
about how to get ourselves

01:16:01.410 --> 01:16:07.690
in the way of these initiatory
moments of conversion.

01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:10.110
How do we get our
babies in the way

01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:13.680
of these moments of
conversion, at which point

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:15.630
everything changes?

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:19.620
Because if we can do that
for hundreds of thousands

01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:24.840
of millions of people for
whom everything has changed,

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:27.310
that's part of the answer.

01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:29.160
And so wondering about,
what are the ways

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:32.400
that you see to
make that happen.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.270
I'm going to take
literally, how do

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:43.250
we get our babies into
ritual and into process

01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:48.140
and into attention, and
say maybe the question

01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:53.820
is, how do we make
sure not to stop them?

01:16:53.820 --> 01:17:01.310
I mean, every child
is a naturalist,

01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:04.160
and feels that animism,
and feels that connection,

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:07.400
and believes that they're
a part of these processes,

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.810
and looks at them intently.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.930
It's the gradual accretion
of this other message--

01:17:16.930 --> 01:17:18.700
that no, just take
care of yourself--

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.140
that breaks that down.

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:24.360
So it's really a
preservation issue,

01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.800
how to keep them going
for as long as possible.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.170
Yes.

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:35.020
And part of that
is, for me, also the

01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:37.660
where, where does it happen?

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:42.160
And to be in the
presence of the teacher,

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.820
and to me that is in the
presence of other beings.

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:49.990
It's being in the woods, on
the prairie, by the water.

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:53.890
And I don't in any
way mean that that

01:17:53.890 --> 01:17:55.465
has to be nature out there.

01:17:58.030 --> 01:18:01.180
How many conversions
happen in the backyard

01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:04.510
with a tree who you love?

01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:08.620
How many conversions happen with
the moss in a sidewalk crack,

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:13.870
when you realize that there are
creative, courageous beings all

01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:15.760
around you who are
living with you.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.000
I think it's to be
in the presence.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.385
But you also have to know
that you're in the presence.

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:28.440
Great, thank you.

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:30.840
I feel really moved
by the kindness

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:34.560
you're showing each other, and
the discussion of spirituality

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:37.530
in science and how that's
all woven together.

01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:41.615
And I'm wondering how you
manage to survive academia.

01:18:41.615 --> 01:18:43.469
[LAUGHTER]

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:44.966
Did we?

01:18:44.966 --> 01:18:45.964
Did we?

01:18:52.451 --> 01:18:54.760
Because I'm
considering academia,

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.670
but having some questions.

01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:01.808
They're all looking at me.

01:19:01.808 --> 01:19:04.190
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:04.190 --> 01:19:04.690
I haven't.

01:19:04.690 --> 01:19:06.330
I am now [INAUDIBLE]

01:19:06.330 --> 01:19:12.150
But I love-- my greatest
joy, my deepest joy

01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:14.142
is being with students.

01:19:14.142 --> 01:19:15.830
Yeah.

01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:21.020
I mean, yesterday-- was
it yesterday, Monday?

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:27.230
We had four of the most powerful
stories I have ever heard.

01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:32.020
And as we sat there around
the table, 18 of us--

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:35.050
what do you do with that energy?

01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:40.790
And the only thing we
could do was to go outside

01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:49.790
and to breathe, and to
howl, and to say I love you.

01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:53.195
That's how we
survive the academy.

01:19:53.195 --> 01:19:54.590
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:58.490
And what I love is that
we have an arboretum.

01:19:58.490 --> 01:19:59.930
We have a divinity school.

01:19:59.930 --> 01:20:01.130
We have the humanities.

01:20:01.130 --> 01:20:02.690
We have the sciences.

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:05.510
We have scientists who are
coming to the Divinity School

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:09.440
saying, we know how
to handle the data.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.780
We're really good at what we do.

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:17.960
What we don't know is how
to deal with our emotions.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:21.080
What are the tools that
we need to handle our joy?

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:24.330
What are the tools we
need to handle our grief?

01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:25.205
Where's the mycelium?

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:32.850
That's how we
thrive in academia.

01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:33.630
We make things.

01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:35.670
We make things together.

01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:38.550
My brother died
because he was alone.

01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:40.990
I have to live with it.

01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:43.330
But he's still here
because, as you've

01:20:43.330 --> 01:20:45.580
heard from both
Robin and Richard,

01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:48.280
we just keep changing form.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:50.080
Peter, I look at your art.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.870
It's the fabrics creating
collage, creating landscape.

01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:56.870
We just keep
creating, each of us

01:20:56.870 --> 01:21:01.070
in our own time with
the gifts that are ours.

01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:02.180
That is the academy.

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:05.000
We can have these conversations
here in this Environmental

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:10.100
Forum, and go out and be
enlivened, enspirited together.

01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:15.266
I want to go to your university.

01:21:15.266 --> 01:21:19.640
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.842
Is there someone in
admissions I can bribe?

01:21:22.842 --> 01:21:26.690
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:35.520
I think that's a
really good way to end.

01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:38.950
[LAUGHTER]

01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:40.540
Thank you so much.

01:21:40.540 --> 01:21:41.740
[APPLAUSE]

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:43.590
Thank you.
