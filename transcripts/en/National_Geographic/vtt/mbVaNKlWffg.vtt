00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
NARRATOR: OK, there's this Argentinian guy

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:03.667
named Adolfo Cambiaso.

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:05.667
Many call him "The
G.O.A.T of polo."

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.066
You know, the sport with
the horses and the sticks

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.467
and the ball and all
the money, like the logo

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:12.667
on your collared shirt.

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.800
Adolfo has been ranked among
the world's best polo players

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.166
for 22 years straight.

00:00:18.166 --> 00:00:20.200
So random question.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.900
What is this G.O.A.T of polo
have to do with a businessman

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.166
named Alan and his pancreas?

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.033
That actually leads
to a pretty crazy

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.700
story about how clones
are transforming

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.600
sports and your life.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600
Well, maybe not yet, but soon.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.967
So let's take a deeper look
at how the polo G.O.A.T

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:41.166
and the pancreas are linked.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.867
Let's start from the beginning.

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:44.433
Meet Alan Meeker.

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:46.867
He's a businessman-- Texas
through and through--

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:48.767
and he loves horses.

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:51.800
But like 30 million
Americans, he's got diabetes.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.667
Clearly, being a
financier and all,

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:55.967
Meeker had a few
extra and unusual

00:00:55.967 --> 00:00:57.734
resources at his disposal.

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:00.600
And he started researching
whether cloning his pancreas

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.800
could cure his diabetes, and
it could have change lives.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.100
But alas, the cloned
pancreas was a no-go.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.166
But Meeker learned
a lot, and he became

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:10.533
an amateur cloning
expert fascinated

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:12.233
by what it could do for polo.

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:14.767
So he set up a cloning
company in Texas.

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:16.967
Meeker licensed the technology
that had been cloning

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:19.867
all kinds of mammals
since 1996 including

00:01:19.867 --> 00:01:21.867
a famous sheep named Dolly.

00:01:21.867 --> 00:01:23.967
So Meeker figured it
wouldn't be much of a stretch

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:25.333
to clone horses, too.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:28.700
But he wanted to work
with the best DNA.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.667
So he flew all the way to
Argentina-- the mecca of polo.

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:34.000
When he got there, Meeker
met with that Argentinean guy

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.266
we talked about earlier.

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:37.967
You know, The G.O.A.T, Adolfo?

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:39.700
Adolfo's prized
horse died almost

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.367
10 years earlier after an
injury in a championship match.

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:45.433
Ever the
forward-thinking G.O.A.T,

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:50.033
Adolfo saved his horse's DNA,
and Meeker had to have it.

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:56.233
Together, the two set out to
clone and breed a horse army.

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:57.033
Just kidding.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.800
Scratch that.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.567
Together, the two set out to
clone and breed the best herd

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:05.600
of polo horses on Planet
Earth and revolutionize

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.667
the game of polo--

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:08.767
#squadgoals.

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:10.100
And clone they did.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.433
Meeker and The
G.O.A.T have created

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:14.266
more than 25 clones of
Cambiaso's champion polo

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.667
horses.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.000
And their company, Crestview,
has cloned more than 200 horses

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.300
since 2009.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.867
Some are even breeding.

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:25.100
And miraculously, in 2017, a
polo championship was won using

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.667
the DNA of those prized horses.

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.066
You heard that right.

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:33.500
The G.O.A.T won the Argentine
Open riding only cloned horses.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.467
So thanks to Alan Meeker's
pancreatic problems

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:38.467
and visionary
thinking, you can now

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:40.934
own a cloned horse of
your own for upwards

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:44.600
of a cool $100,000 US dollars.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.100
But that's not the whole story.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.567

episodes of Explorer

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:49.400
