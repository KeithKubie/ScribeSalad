00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.550
Welcome to the third in this
series of age word problems.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.070
And I just wanted to start
off where I left off

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.210
in the second one.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.340
I got myself confused.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.370
You guys make me very nervous
while you just sit there

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.180
listening and I have
to perform for you.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.180
But, it turns out we did get
the right answer, if you say

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.430
Arman is 153 and Tarush is 765,
then 85 years ago Arman would

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.990
have been 68 and Tarush
would have been 680.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.720
And notice that's 10 times.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.040
So it worked out.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.380
So we're ready to tackle
another problem.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.540
One more problem.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.210
Let's see.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:58.790
This problem says, Zack is
4 times as old as Salman.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.590
What a coincidence.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.560
Salman really shows up
in a lot of problems.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.340
So Zack is 4 times
as old as Salman.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:15.470
Zack is also 3 years
older then Salman.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.490
How old is Zack?

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.960
Well, actually this one
actually seems fairly

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.620
straightforward.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.830
We're not dealing with the
present and the future.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:26.170
We're just dealing
with the present.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.320
So let's see if we
can figure this out.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.530
So we're trying to figure
out how old is Zack.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.600
Let's say, z for Zack.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.125
z equals Zack.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.390
It says Zack is 4 times
as old as Salman.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.990
So, Salman, if Zack is
z, this first sentence,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.130
let me circle it.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.170
Zack is 4 times as
old as Salman.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.740
So, if Zack is 4 times as old
as Salman, that means that Sal

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:19.020
is equal to Zack divided by 4,
But then it also says here that

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.940
Zack is also 3 years
older than Salman.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.600
Well, if Zack is also 3
years older than Salman, so

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:35.310
that means that also Sal
would be Zack minus 3.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.510
The first sentence says Zack
is 4 times as old as Salman.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.150
So that means if you take
Zack's age and divide it

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.110
by 4, you get Sal's age.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.290
The second sentence says
Zack is also 3 years

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.640
older than Salman.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.890
So that means if you take
Zack's age and you subtract

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.360
3 from it, you get
Sal's age again.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.720
Well, we have our
equation set up.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.190
And, actually, instead of
writing Zack, I should

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.440
have just written z.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.660
But the equation is
all set up for us.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.500
We get z over 4 is
equal to z minus 3.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.780
We can multiply both sides of
this equation times 4 and we'll

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.690
get z is equal to 4z, remember
to distribute, minus 12.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.290
And then, we'll skip
a couple of steps.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.030
And I get 3z is equal to 12.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.820
And I get Zack is
equal to 4 years old.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.980
Let's see if that makes sense.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.460
If Zack is 4 years old, then
this first sentence says Zack

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.030
is 4 times as old as Salman.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.390
So that means Sal
is 1 year old.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.700
It also says Zack is 3
years older than Salman.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.570
Well, that's consistent.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.580
4 is 3 more than 1.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.350
So we were right.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.400
Zack is exactly four years old.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.610
Hope that helps.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.090
Have fun.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.900
I think you're ready.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.820
You've now seen, at
least, every type of

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.000
the age word problems.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.485
If you're still a little
confused, you might just want

00:03:56.485 --> 00:03:59.790
to re-watch the videos and
maybe pause it right after I

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.060
give you the problem, and see
if you can solve it yourself.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.030
And remember, you had a lot of
practice problems that you

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.330
can do on the actual
modules themselves.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.930
Have fun.
