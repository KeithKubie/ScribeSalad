they're bad ideas often their ideas are
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.700
they're bad ideas often their ideas are
much better than my ideas and then they

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
much better than my ideas and then they
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.900
much better than my ideas and then they
say to me what if you think they're bad

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910

know how I'm wrong and then you stick
 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.310
know how I'm wrong and then you stick
with your own idea and you'd be right ah

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320
with your own idea and you'd be right ah
