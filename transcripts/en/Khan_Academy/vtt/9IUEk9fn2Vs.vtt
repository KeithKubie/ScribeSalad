00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.280
Welcome to the presentation on
level four linear equations.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.540
So, let's start doing
some problems.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:06.710
So.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.580
Let's say I had the situation--
let me give me a couple of

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:20.110
problems-- if I said 3 over x
is equal to, let's just say 5.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.180
So, what we want to do -- this
problem's a little unusual from

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.260
everything we've ever seen.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.950
Because here, instead of having
x in the numerator, we actually

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.150
have x in the denominator.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.270
So, I personally don't like
having x's in my denominators,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.190
so we want to get it outside of
the denominator into a

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.140
numerator or at least not in
the denominator as

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.920
soon as possible.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.780
So, one way to get a number out
of the denominator is, if we

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.560
were to multiply both sides of
this equation by x, you see

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.460
that on the left-hand side of
the equation these two

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.900
x's will cancel out.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.160
And in the right side,
you'll just get 5 times x.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.920
So this equals -- the
two x's cancel out.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.890
And you get 3 is equal to 5x.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.420
Now, we could also write
that as 5x is equal to 3.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.810
And then we can think
about this two ways.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.210
We either just multiply both
sides by 1/5, or you could just

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.230
do that as dividing by 5.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.490
If you multiply
both sides by 1/5.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.680
The left-hand side becomes x.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.740
And the right-hand side, 3
times 1/5, is equal to 3/5.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.640
So what did we do here?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.860
This is just like, this
actually turned into a level

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.670
two problem, or actually a
level one problem,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.480
very quickly.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.990
All we had to do is multiply
both sides of this

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.260
equation by x.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.460
And we got the x's out
of the denominator.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.360
Let's do another problem.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:53.530
Let's have -- let me say,
x plus 2 over x plus 1 is

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.800
equal to, let's say, 7.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.790
So, here, instead of having
just an x in the denominator,

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.920
we have a whole x plus
1 in the denominator.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.000
But we're going to
do it the same way.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.170
To get that x plus 1 out of the
denominator, we multiply both

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.450
sides of this equation times x
plus 1 over 1 times this side.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.010
Since we did it on the
left-hand side we also have

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.640
to do it on the right-hand
side, and this is just 7/1,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.420
times x plus 1 over 1.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.720
On the left-hand side, the
x plus 1's cancel out.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.110
And you're just left
with x plus 2.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.300
It's over 1, but we can
just ignore the 1.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.260
And that equals 7
times x plus 1.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.930
And that's the same
thing as x plus 2.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.720
And, remember, it's 7 times
the whole thing, x plus 1.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.790
So we actually have to use
the distributive property.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.400
And that equals 7x plus 7.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.200
So now it's turned into a,
I think this is a level

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.790
three linear equation.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.050
And now all we do is, we say
well let's get all the x's on

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.965
one side of the equation.

00:03:02.965 --> 00:03:05.570
And let's get all the constant
terms, like the 2 and the 7, on

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.100
the other side of the equation.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.890
So I'm going to choose to
get the x's on the left.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.990
So let's bring that
7x onto the left.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.450
And we can do that by
subtracting 7x from both sides.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.440
Minus 7x, plus,
it's a minus 7x.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.800
The right-hand side, these
two 7x's will cancel out.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.410
And on the left-hand side
we have minus 7x plus x.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:32.840
Well, that's minus 6x plus
2 is equal to, and on the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.080
right all we have left is 7.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.470
Now we just have to
get rid of this 2.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.360
And we can just do that by
subtracting 2 from both sides.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:48.000
And we're left with minus
6x packs is equal to 6.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.220
Now it's a level one problem.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.410
We just have to multiply both
sides times the reciprocal

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.200
of the coefficient on
the left-hand side.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.150
And the coefficient's
negative 6.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.620
So we multiply both sides of
the equation by negative 1/6.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.610
Negative 1/6.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.890
The left-hand side, negative
1 over 6 times negative 6.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.190
Well that just equals 1.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.130
So we just get x is equal
to 5 times negative 1/6.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.250
Well, that's negative 5/6.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.210
And we're done.

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.710
And if you wanted to check it,
you could just take that x

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.950
equals negative 5/6 and put it
back in the original question

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.580
to confirm that it worked.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.340
Let's do another one.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.940
I'm making these up on
the fly, so I apologize.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.020
Let me think.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:51.010
3 times x plus 5 is equal
to 8 times x plus 2.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.740
Well, we do the
same thing here.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.950
Although now we have two
expressions we want to get

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.680
out of the denominators.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.870
We want to get x plus 5
out and we want to get

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.010
this x plus 2 out.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.670
So let's do the x plus 5 first.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.640
Well, just like we did before,
we multiply both sides of

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.570
this equation by x plus 5.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.630
You can say x plus 5 over 1.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.680
Times x plus 5 over 1.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.080
On the left-hand side,
they get canceled out.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:24.230
So we're left with 3 is equal
to 8 times x plus five.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.770
All of that over x plus 2.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.820
Now, on the top, just to
simplify, we once again

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.420
just multiply the 8 times
the whole expression.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:41.860
So it's 8x plus 40
over x plus 2.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.500
Now, we want to get
rid of this x plus 2.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.510
So we can do it the same way.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.505
We can multiply both sides
of this equation by

00:05:46.505 --> 00:05:50.904
x plus 2 over 1.

00:05:50.904 --> 00:05:52.580
x plus 2.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.690
We could just say we're
multiplying both

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:54.420
sides by x plus 2.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.630
The 1 is little unnecessary.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.910
So the left-hand side
becomes 3x plus 6.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.070
Remember, always distribute
3 times, because you're

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.030
multiplying it times
the whole expression.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.540
x plus 2.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.860
And on the right-hand side.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.620
Well, this x plus 2 and this
x plus 2 will cancel out.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.380
And we're left with 8x plus 40.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.340
And this is now a
level three problem.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.380
Well, if we subtract 8x from
both sides, minus 8x, plus-- I

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:26.970
think I'm running out of space.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.470
Minus 8x.

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.290
Well, on the right-hand
side the 8x's cancel out.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:38.620
On the left-hand side we have
minus 5x plus 6 is equal

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.320
to, on the right-hand side
all we have left is 40.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.380
Now we can subtract 6 from
both sides of this equation.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.380
Let me just write out here.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.510
Minus 6 plus minus 6.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.470
Now I'm going to, hope I
don't lose you guys by

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:53.160
trying to go up here.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.410
But if we subtract minus 6 from
both sides, on the left-hand

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:05.280
side we're just left with
minus 5x equals, and on the

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.780
right-hand side we have 34.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.880
Now it's a level one problem.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.780
We just multiply both
sides times negative 1/5.

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.360
Negative 1/5.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.130
On the left-hand
side we have x.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:27.130
And on the right-hand side
we have negative 34/5.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.640
Unless I made some careless
mistakes, I think that's right.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.190
And I think if you understood
what we just did here, you're

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:36.780
ready to tackle some level
four linear equations.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.290
Have fun.
