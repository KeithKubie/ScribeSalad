00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.030
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.040
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for mon-.
day.

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.310
October 16th,

4
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.140
2070 what's going on?
How are you?
Oh,

5
00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:20.920
freckles is in a good mood.
He is in a great mood.
What a,

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.090
what a fucking great win.
Gadee great.

7
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.800
When by the New England patriots.

8
00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:30.340
Noncontroversial nothing to complain about.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.340
I don't understand what the jets eco.
It was clearly,
hey,

10
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.510
did the guy look like a,

11
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.110
you ever see when people join the mafia and they got a hold that little candle

12
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.150
like he was doing that for one hand to another?
Clearly not a catch.
I mean,

13
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.640
oh he caught it and then it was a fumble.
I'm fucking with you.
Your Green Card.

14
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.650
I don't get it either.

15
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:56.200
That looked like a touchdown to me and you know what sucks.

16
00:00:56.201 --> 00:01:00.760
I wish that they called it a touchdown cause then it would have been tied up and

17
00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:04.030
I could have watched Tom Brady go right down the field and break your fucking

18
00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:05.620
green hearts once again,

19
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.700
the fucking nerve or you jet fans to act like you got fucked out of a victory.

20
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.690
What you got fucked.
Would you know what you've got the end of the,

21
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.270
the refs gave you mercy.
They gave you some mercy.

22
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:18.940
Let's just put them out of their fucking misery.

23
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.360
C'Mon man,
the guy,
how many you fucking fair with the best.

24
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:25.330
It's because of that call.

25
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.990
We'll able to go down there and get to your fucking green and white.
Hi Yan Day.

26
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.790
Whatever the fuck it is you're driving right.

27
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.410
And left the stadium early because of that wonderful accurate call.

28
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.890
Um,
I'm fucking with you guys.
I'm just being a Douche.
I don't,

29
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.440
I don't get it either.
I don't,
I,

30
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.070
I wish I was at Cole.
I wish it was called a touchdown.

31
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.790
They don't have been tied up.
Would've been exciting game music,
cited gay,

32
00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:54.680
but you know,
add to the drama tie score.
Who's gonna win the jet,

33
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.330
who the Patriots have used as a fucking blow up doll for the last 15 years.

34
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.780
This sick of this sick allusion to the circle losing to these New England

35
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:05.840
patriots,
these patriots of the Lakeland.
Um,

36
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.340
this is what I love.
You know,

37
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.150
what was my favorite part of that game was when the jet scored the first

38
00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.330
touchdown to go up seven enough.
And if you can look at the highlight,

39
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.140
look in the crowd,
that dude,
the jet fan with the,
he's got the Jersey on,

40
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.800
he's holding his smart phone and he's given double fingers at like one of the

41
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:25.640
New England patriots,
a defensive bad,
like,
fuck you.

42
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.770
I got to MIT as a sports fan.
I know what that feeling is like,
you know,

43
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.910
I haven't known it for a good 15 years,
16,
17 years.
But I,
I,
I,
you know,

44
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:40.430
the first 32 years of my life,

45
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.190
34 years I'll,
you know,
depending on the sport was,
that's what it was.

46
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.580
We just did not win that.
I,

47
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.650
I saw myself back when the Patriots would always lose to the dolphins,

48
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.880
Dan Marino,
like we'd,
we'd finally sack them,
somehow,

49
00:02:57.881 --> 00:03:01.000
finally sack them.
He'd be on the ground and be like,
fuck you.

50
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:05.830
Like we finally got him.
So,
um,
I took that as a,

51
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.790
uh,
a not of respect to the patriots as much as the plus the guy,

52
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.540
he's a real fan man,
if he's,
if he gives a shit that much.
Um,

53
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.190
so anyways,
I,
uh,
I'm out here.
I am,
uh,

54
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.420
I am manic right now because I am in a mild depression.

55
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.790
I missed my family so much and we'll try to get them to fly out here this week.

56
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.340
This is fucking ridiculous.
Um,

57
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.910
I gotta I gotta see my kid one way or another.
I got to see my kids.
So,
um,

58
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.760
I've just been,
I've just been fucking watching sports,
everybody,

59
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:39.460
that's all I've been doing.
I mean,
I know I always do it,

60
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:44.290
but like I literally was like,
what am I going to do on Saturday?
You know,

61
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.600
they don't shoot on weekends.
What am I going to do out here?

62
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.700
I don't know what the fuck to do with myself.

63
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.700
So I drove three hours up in three hours back.

64
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.420
I went to that Tennessee volunteer game against the,
um,

65
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.310
the South Carolina Gamecocks a messy,
she accident

66
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.110
[inaudible] paint.
I went up there and it was,
it was fucking awesome.

67
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.710
It was a great drive.
Um,
you know,

68
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.211
if you're a comedian,

69
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:13.570
you got to love driving after a while and he also got to love driving by

70
00:04:13.571 --> 00:04:18.190
yourself.
You know,
if you're a,
if you're a comedian you don't like doing that,

71
00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:20.940
you usually end up getting an acting career,

72
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.290
writing career or are you just fucking quit the business?

73
00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:24.940
I don't know what it is,
but I've always enjoyed it.

74
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.130
So I had a great time driving up there.

75
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:31.000
I never drove from Atlanta and the Chattanooga up to fucking Knoxville.

76
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:33.670
I want to see what it looks like.
Um,

77
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.450
and I was driving up there,
it was a 12 noon games,

78
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:41.110
so I'd leave it like fucking quarter to eight in the morning.
Um,

79
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.810
but this is good cause it couldn't go all the way up there.

80
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.010
It's going to be three hours for the game in three hours to drive back.

81
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:46.210
By the time I get back,

82
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.320
I can still do a spot down the street at the club.

83
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.270
Ian Edwards is going to be down there.

84
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:56.950
One of the best fucking comedians in the country that nobody,

85
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.180
not enough people know about.
All right.
Like I looked up the other day,

86
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:05.890
I looked up this guitarists,
I found this guitar that you know,
was for the while,

87
00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:09.340
was known as the greatest guitarist.
Nobody ever heard of like Danny,
uh,

88
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.890
gotten or something like that.
I got to get his fucking name right.

89
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.650
The guy's unbelievable.
And he's,
I mean,
unfortunately he's dead,

90
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.750
but uh,
you know,
guy was,
she was like a fucking jet.
Danny Gatton,

91
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.460
G A,
t.
T.
O.
N.

92
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.600
Look that guy up and there's this thing when he plays Austin city limits where

93
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:31.960
I'm going to be next week,
I'm at the new one,
not the one he was at.

94
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:35.260
They say he plays a song where they say with a beer can,

95
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:36.480
he actually does it with a beer bottle.

96
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.400
I've seen people do with the slide and all that,
but um,

97
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.960
watch what happens because the beer gets all over night starts,
you know,

98
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.840
there's beer in there.
So it starts fizzing up,
it gets all over his fretboard.

99
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.800
And then he puts a towel over the fretboard to dry it off while continuing to

100
00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:57.980
play.
Um,
I've never seen,
I mean,
I've seen

101
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.150
<v 3>a lot of tricks.
Uh,
it was fucking amazing.</v>

102
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:05.750
So I'm Ian Edwards,
I'm telling you,
you gotta see,
you gotta see that guy.

103
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:10.520
It's just there's something wrong with our fucking business that more people

104
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:12.320
does it.
Don't know who that guy is.
So I was like,

105
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:15.110
I got to go down and go see him do a set.
And plus not only that,

106
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.150
that'll take up my whole fucking Saturday,

107
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.640
then I'll stay out late enough to come home,
fall asleep,
boom.
Done.
Right.

108
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.940
So anyways,
so I'm dry.

109
00:06:23.941 --> 00:06:27.770
I'm driving up to northern fucking Georgia into sudden Tanner say,

110
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.930
and there's all this fucking traffic.

111
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.160
So the robot lady and my phone starts talking to me,
creeping me out,

112
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:36.800
telling me there's a quicker way.
It's just like,
Whoa,

113
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.430
how do you have time to pay attention to me?
Who are you?
But thank you.

114
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:46.450
So I get off the fucking road and I'm driving up north there and uh,

115
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.750
I went by this fucking house.
You know those houses where they,

116
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.510
somebody just has like 20 old cars sit in the front yard.

117
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:57.410
This fucking lunatic had like 30 not cars.

118
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:01.640
He had riding mowers.
Now like the landscape level ones,

119
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:04.820
like the ones like your dad had,
you know,
and you,

120
00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:08.030
you try to fucking steal the keys to take it out or whatever.

121
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.360
You'd run over a friend of yours and he'd lose a foot or whatever,
you know,

122
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:13.550
that type of shit.
Jesus,
what's going on out here?

123
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.830
Oh Christ is the gay pride parade still going on?

124
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.050
Is Anything on Flyer?
Um,

125
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.410
they had the gay pride parade out here,
went right by the hotel yesterday and uh,

126
00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.900
you know,
it's fucking funny.
There's always one guy who has to just ruin it,

127
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.333
you know what I mean?

128
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.120
There's always one guy that just ruins it for everybody else.
Like,
you know,

129
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:39.350
sports fans of cool.

130
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.500
And then just one douchebag at a panthers game has to turn around and blast a 63

131
00:07:45.051 --> 00:07:47.870
year old guy in the face.
Not once,
not twice,

132
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.650
not three times a lady,
four fucking times.

133
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:54.740
At least they caught the guy.
Dude,
that guy is looking,

134
00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:59.430
I think at some serious jail time.
Serious fucking jail time.
Uh,

135
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.470
you know,
the first two maybe get some fucking,
you know,
Andy Griffith,

136
00:08:03.471 --> 00:08:06.800
lower Gamal,
you know,
emotions were running and had an act guy.

137
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:11.590
He shared allowed names,
calling him,
going back and forth.
You know,
we just go,

138
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.230
y'all got a little bit hold on Carol.
Right?
Maybe he could,
I don't know what,

139
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.620
just get him a couple like a month in jail or something.

140
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:22.790
It's the fact that they broke it up and he came back for those last two brutal.

141
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:28.270
Once Jesus Christ and help old people learned something out there.

142
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:31.040
Okay.
You know,
as much as it hurts your lower back,

143
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.270
you got to keep that head moving.
Can't,
you can't just be a stationary target.

144
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.800
Um,
he's God damn old people.
You know,
it's like you,

145
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.230
if you want to talk shit,
you gotta move your fucking head.

146
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.600
Um,
I'm sorry.
Anyways,
this fucking guy,

147
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:54.350
he had like 30 riding lawn mower sitting in his front yard.

148
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.980
I was doing like 70 miles an hour and I

149
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.800
<v 1>drove past it and I wasn't going to stop because I was worried I wasn't going to</v>

150
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:01.350
get to the game and time.
And it was fucking hilarious.

151
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:04.830
The ironic part was like the grass had all grown up around them.

152
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:06.810
Like th these front yard needed to be mowed,

153
00:09:06.811 --> 00:09:10.290
but he couldn't mow it because he had snapped in all the fucking tractors.

154
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.150
You get people that there's a joke in there somewhere.
I just don't know where.

155
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.940
Um,
anyways,
I,
uh,
ended up getting up to,

156
00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:24.690
into the stadium of the Tennessee game place.
I always wanted to go to,
um,

157
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:27.930
and it was fucking awesome.
And not only that,

158
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:32.040
as a freckled borderline albino con,
I picked the perfect row.

159
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.210
I called up stubhub and I told him,
I said,
I'm an old man who gets sunburned.

160
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:40.370
I want to be in the lower deck right above the roof of the,
Oh,
you know,

161
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.240
of the upper deck.
And The lady's like,
okay,

162
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:46.350
well you didn't think anything actually for once.
I looked at the,
the uh,

163
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:50.670
the stadium map,
you know,
and uh,

164
00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:56.220
you know,
suddenly he's like,
is,
I know you don't give a fuck.
You just,

165
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.800
you just sold a ticket to a fucking World Cup game.
Now I'm,
I'm,
and I,

166
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.160
I brought you into Tennessee,
you know,
you don't even know where you're at.

167
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.050
So I went with row 57 and it was the perfect row.

168
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:10.080
It was the last fucking road at the sun.

169
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:13.320
Didn't touch cause I was on the visitors side.
Do you ever go to the stadium?

170
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:18.330
The Sun creeps up the visitor's side.
It goes down on the home side,

171
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.560
so it creeps all the way up to row 56 and at the end of the game it was,

172
00:10:22.561 --> 00:10:27.120
it was on like from like mid calf down.
I fuck it.
I nailed it.

173
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:31.530
I mean actually if I did 58,
it would've been perfect.
But um,
it was just,

174
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:32.550
it was an awesome time.

175
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.390
One of the biggest stadiums I believe is the fifth largest stadium as far as the

176
00:10:36.391 --> 00:10:40.530
amount of people that it holds.
And it's an old school stadium.
Fuck,

177
00:10:40.531 --> 00:10:42.330
I didn't even have the nerve to go in the bathroom.

178
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:46.320
I just saw this door that looked like a fucking closet door and I was like,

179
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:47.340
there's a bathroom in there.

180
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:50.910
There's no way that's not pissed troughs in there and I am not peeing in a

181
00:10:50.911 --> 00:10:54.390
fucking piss trough.
I'm not doing it.
And um,

182
00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.050
I gotta tell you when you're on the lower level and you're walking through there

183
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.400
,
you feel like you're in a bunker.
If your cluster phobic,
I wouldn't do it.
Um,

184
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.430
I've got all these great pictures.
I,
I got a post a man,
they just like,

185
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.930
the stadium is so fucking cool and I have to go there.

186
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:13.690
You know,
they have a decent team.
I want to go there when,
uh,

187
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.850
to an sec game at night under the lights when it fucking matters.

188
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.700
Um,
underrated city,
Knoxville,
underrated Chattanooga,
Tennessee is the shit.
Um,

189
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.100
you go to Nashville,
Nashville is like Austin,

190
00:11:26.101 --> 00:11:28.530
Texas where it is just everybody's moving or Atlanta,

191
00:11:28.531 --> 00:11:32.970
everybody's just that just fucking overcrowded.
And um,
the two great cities.

192
00:11:32.971 --> 00:11:37.890
So I went there,
you know,
the fucking bands playing.
You know,

193
00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:39.540
there wasn't a bunch of screaming and yelling.

194
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:44.010
They didn't have giant flat screen fucking TVs and explosions and shit.

195
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:46.500
It was just,
it was like the old school just go into a game.

196
00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.700
There was a hilarious guy in my section,
which there always is.

197
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.160
You just can't hear him.
Now when you go to a game,

198
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.630
there was this fucking big fat dude too.

199
00:11:55.631 --> 00:11:59.410
There was a lot of fatties at the gay Tennessee.
What's going on up there?

200
00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.570
Lay off the fucking barbecue.
Jesus Christ.
I could tell why you guys love those.

201
00:12:04.571 --> 00:12:08.920
Fucking checkered overalls holds you fucking beer belly really nicely.

202
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.440
Um,
this guy was fucking hilarious.

203
00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:14.800
He looked like he was dressed like herb Tarlek.
Um,

204
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:18.700
except it was all Tennessee gear and he was so fucking amped up for the game and

205
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:21.700
he was getting the section going and he would always get right up to the

206
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:24.490
borderline is,
is this guy fucking nuts.
And then he'd look at him,

207
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.400
he'd have this shit eating grin on his face,
like laughing at himself,

208
00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:31.420
knowing that he was nuts,
that he was getting this amped up for the game.
But,
um,

209
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.420
it was a great game and I stayed till the end,

210
00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:38.850
like my mother taught me and it came right down to the last play.
I fucking,

211
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:42.730
you know,
I video taped it while I looked over so I could watch it,
you know,

212
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.610
live and not look at it.
So my screen,

213
00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:46.890
<v 4>mmm.</v>

214
00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.300
<v 1>And it looks like the guy had a chance.</v>

215
00:12:48.301 --> 00:12:51.680
I wouldn't let it look like it went right to his,
his,
uh,
his fingers in it.

216
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.020
It didn't work,
whatever.
And then I drove fucking back.
I came down here,

217
00:12:55.021 --> 00:12:59.850
I went down to the laughing skull and I got to watch the Great Ian Edwards just

218
00:12:59.851 --> 00:13:01.710
fucking blew me away.
I'm telling you right now,

219
00:13:01.711 --> 00:13:03.900
if you get a chance to see that guy live,
you got to do it.

220
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.610
You've got to do it before it blows up.
Uh,
hung out with him.

221
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:12.120
Some of his friends got a grilled cheese sandwich and some French fries late

222
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.200
night out.
Jesus just eating like a fat chick on Prom night.

223
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.420
<v 4>MMM.</v>

224
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.070
<v 5>I'm depressed.
All right.
Fucking</v>

225
00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:21.480
<v 4>okay.</v>

226
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.830
<v 1>Dealing with this shit.
Um,
so anyways,
so that was that day.</v>

227
00:13:25.831 --> 00:13:28.660
So then Sunday comes along like,
well,
how am I going to kill this day?

228
00:13:28.661 --> 00:13:33.570
A loneliness.
And it's like,
oh shit.
The Atlanta Falcons are home.

229
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:35.280
They got a fucking home game.

230
00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.780
<v 5>Shit.
They playing the dolphins.
Fucking Jake Cutler,</v>

231
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:43.550
I'm going to go see,
I've already saw them play against the rams is she know the,

232
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:48.700
the charges this year I'll go down and go checkup and evidently the,
uh,

233
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.010
the fucking falcons have this new dome stadium that's going to be unbelievable.

234
00:13:53.011 --> 00:13:54.810
So I was like,
all right,
I'll go to this fucking game.

235
00:13:54.811 --> 00:13:59.040
Last time I was here was in fucking
2004.

236
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.560
I saw,
uh,

237
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.480
Michael Vick back when he was drowning the dogs and nobody knew the most

238
00:14:06.481 --> 00:14:09.510
electrifying fucking football player I ever saw.

239
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.550
Every time you went out of the pocket,

240
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.600
the whole stadium stood up like it was the last play of the championship game in

241
00:14:15.601 --> 00:14:20.430
a Hail Mary was coming.
Um,
place would go crazy,
right?

242
00:14:20.431 --> 00:14:22.390
So I'm a guy,
I'm going to go all the,
I don't have a ticket.
I'll be like,

243
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:25.080
all right,
I'm just,
I'll scalp a ticket.
I'll sit at the top of the stadium.

244
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.250
Who gives a fuck?

245
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.870
So I get over there and there's like no scalpers and I'm like,
what the fuck?

246
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.600
Oh No,
no,
I didn't.
The Gay Pride Parade and walked through the Gay Pride Parade.

247
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:35.280
I got to get back to the,
the one guy who ruins it.

248
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.840
So it's typical gay pride parade,
much people fucking rainbows on the faces.

249
00:14:39.841 --> 00:14:43.050
You know,
a couple guys walk around and high heel shoes,
gay pride parade.

250
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.160
Everybody's having a good time.
What's not the fucking like,
right?

251
00:14:47.370 --> 00:14:52.190
There's always the one dude who has to ruin it.
This fucking jerk off

252
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.680
<v 1>is standing there on the side of the road.</v>

253
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:59.390
He has like a fucking giant Dick and balls like balloon animal.

254
00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.810
That was his like three quarters to sides of his body.

255
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:07.850
This giant pink erect fucking Dick with balls.
And it's just like,

256
00:15:07.851 --> 00:15:12.680
dude,
this kid's here,
this fuck.
What is wrong with you?

257
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:15.430
This is what blows my mind is you're,

258
00:15:15.431 --> 00:15:17.570
you're able to do that at the gay pride parade.

259
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.650
I'm trying to think of a parade that I could go to with a giant inflated vagina

260
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.330
with kids around and just in public.
I just don't think he could do it.

261
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.350
But anyways,
hey,

262
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.760
I'm trying to be progressive.

263
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.120
God bless this guy with this giant Dick and balls like fucking twisted up

264
00:15:37.551 --> 00:15:38.181
balloon in them.

265
00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:42.380
I actually had to wonder if that was like a plant from the religious right to

266
00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:45.770
show all gay people represent them as like that there's just see sexually

267
00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:47.780
deviant fucking people,
you know,

268
00:15:47.781 --> 00:15:50.360
like you always see those conspiracy theories that they have.
You know,

269
00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:52.310
whenever there's a peaceful demonstration,

270
00:15:52.311 --> 00:15:54.860
they sent somebody down there to throw a rock through a window just to get

271
00:15:54.861 --> 00:15:57.260
everybody going to start writing.
So they,
you know,

272
00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:02.780
all the people protesting get to be lumped in with that one dose.
Um,
so whatever.

273
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:06.620
So I totally judged this guy with this giant fucking balloon twisted Dick and

274
00:16:06.621 --> 00:16:09.390
balls going,
what are fucking,
what the fuck is wrong with?

275
00:16:09.391 --> 00:16:13.580
How the fuck was this guy raised?
Blahblahblahblahblah smash cut to me.

276
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:18.790
Not even 20 minutes later when I find this no scalpers and I go up to the

277
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:22.820
fucking Wilke one of the ticket windows,
they say they're sold out.

278
00:16:22.821 --> 00:16:27.821
And the only way to get a ticket is I have to go on my phone to Ticketmaster and

279
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.980
I have no idea how to do this.
I've avoided computers.
I don't know.
I don't,

280
00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.180
I just,
I'm bad with the shit.
You know what I mean?
You know,
like,

281
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:41.930
like me trying to figure out this shit is like to ask somebody like somebody

282
00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:46.700
tone deaf to sing a fucking song,
you know,

283
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.870
it's just,
you can't do it.
Right.
So,
uh,

284
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:53.600
could you tell I got a text message in the middle of that.

285
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.940
I didn't even finish off whatever funny thought it was trying to have,

286
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:59.030
they're mildly amusing thought I was trying to have.
So anyways,

287
00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:02.210
I fucking get over the stadium and now I've got to figure out this tick

288
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:04.280
Ticketmaster thing.
So I walk away like,

289
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.780
and just like cursing my fucking brains out.
Fucking God.

290
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:12.140
Damn fucking cock sucking buck Rogers fucking cut the bullshit walking by kids

291
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:16.040
and shit.
And I see parents looking at me like,
dude,
what the fuck?
And in the way,

292
00:17:16.041 --> 00:17:18.830
in the back of my head is that voice of reason.
Hey Bill.

293
00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:22.880
Now there's no reason to get this,
to get this crazy.
Come on,

294
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:27.310
really it in this children here.
And I just did the fucking demon in me,

295
00:17:27.311 --> 00:17:29.860
just fucking country.

296
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.650
So I sit down like a little fucking boy,

297
00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.490
like a little like the little fucking baby than I am Jesus Christ built,

298
00:17:37.491 --> 00:17:39.260
download the fucking APP and figure it out.

299
00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.100
Trying to figure out it's not working.
I'm,
I'm just,
every time it wouldn't work,

300
00:17:43.101 --> 00:17:44.120
I'm like,
dude,
what the fuck?

301
00:17:44.121 --> 00:17:47.930
I would literally yell that loud people walking by looking like,

302
00:17:47.931 --> 00:17:49.470
what the fuck is wrong with that guy?
Right?

303
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.260
<v 5>And finally,
uh,</v>

304
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.620
some twentysomething security kid came walking by with his yellow coat.

305
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.900
I was just like,
dude,
I'm an old bastard.
I don't know how to do this.

306
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:00.930
Can you help me out with this?
And it was just like,
yeah,
just click on this.

307
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:05.160
Click on this,
click on that again.
All right,
there it is.
There's a ticket.

308
00:18:05.161 --> 00:18:07.530
And I'm just sitting there looking at it saying,
I'm like,
this is a ticket.

309
00:18:07.531 --> 00:18:10.920
He's like,
yeah,
it's a ticket.
I go,
what do I do?
And he just laughed and he goes,

310
00:18:10.921 --> 00:18:14.220
just bring your phone.
And then they scan it.
I'm like,
this is going to work.

311
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:15.120
And he's like,
yeah.

312
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.310
<v 1>So now I'm standing in line.
I have so little faith that technology is,</v>

313
00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.390
is gonna.
It's gonna work for me.

314
00:18:23.391 --> 00:18:26.780
All I could think of was midnight express in the beginning of the movie when the

315
00:18:26.781 --> 00:18:30.080
dude has the drugs tape to them like,
I'm going to get,
this isn't going to work.

316
00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.420
They're going to,
they're going to get like,

317
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.600
they're going to toss me out of the fucking stadium and I'm going to be out this

318
00:18:35.601 --> 00:18:39.490
whatever,
a hundred bucks or whatever.
I paid for this ticket and I went up,
I,

319
00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:44.180
they scanned it and it worked and I was like,
wow,
I'll have to fuck it worked.

320
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.320
Then I was just like,
well,
well was what the f how do I add this to my,

321
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:53.180
all my stack of tickets?
Do I got to fucking put my phone in there now?

322
00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.430
Do I take a picture of it and then print it out on my printer and then that's

323
00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:02.500
the ticket.
I don't get it.

324
00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.660
<v 5>So anyways,
I go into this stadium and Jesus Christ,
I'm telling you,</v>

325
00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:11.440
you got to fucking go to this stadium.
This is the best NFL stadium out there.

326
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.590
It is like,
I mean my,

327
00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.220
my top of the new ones before that,

328
00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:22.180
I mean you've got to go cowboys stadium even though that TV is just so fucking

329
00:19:22.181 --> 00:19:26.350
big and obnoxious.
It's actually stu,
they took the TV out of there.
The cowboys,

330
00:19:26.351 --> 00:19:29.320
I think they would like,
you know what I mean?

331
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.550
The cowboys stadium is like,
I dunno.

332
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.220
Do you ever see like a beautiful woman that's just absolutely shit faced and

333
00:19:36.221 --> 00:19:40.230
she's got like fucking lipstick on her teeth and red wine breath and you just

334
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:43.360
like,
oh my God,
she's,
you know,
and she's a 10,
but you're like,

335
00:19:43.361 --> 00:19:46.180
get the fuck away from me.
Right.
That's what the cowboys stayed.

336
00:19:46.181 --> 00:19:50.800
That's what that TV is just fucks up the whole stadium and the Seahawks have a

337
00:19:50.801 --> 00:19:54.160
great stadium.
Um,
even though they're cheating,

338
00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:58.110
<v 1>making the crowd sound louder than it is.
But anyways,
um,</v>

339
00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.710
speaking of cheaters to fucking Atlanta Falcons who got caught pumping a crowd

340
00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:05.190
noise in,
so I'm at the this cheaters,
right?
Um,

341
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.990
I mean,
this stadium dude,
it's fucking breathtaking.

342
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.450
It's one of the cleanest design.

343
00:20:12.451 --> 00:20:17.300
Sickest fucking on like Jerry Jones is going to be upset if,
yeah,

344
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.830
I'm sure you see God on his private plane.
You know,

345
00:20:19.831 --> 00:20:21.900
getting botox injections on the way over there.

346
00:20:21.901 --> 00:20:24.750
I'm sure when he walked in now these God damn motherfuckers,
right?

347
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.160
These God damn motherfuckers need probably fucking,
I dunno,

348
00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:32.280
God help the woman that he's banging that weekend.
Jerry,

349
00:20:32.281 --> 00:20:35.550
I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
Oh,
shut the fuck up.
Bitch

350
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:38.890
<v 4>is</v>

351
00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:43.060
<v 5>taken out.
Everything on her.
Dude,
that stadium is fucking,</v>

352
00:20:43.061 --> 00:20:47.770
I felt like I was in a spaceship.
It was fucking awesome.
I'm like,
you know,

353
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:50.470
and it was great.
I'm missing my family.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm down there.
I'm just like,

354
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:52.140
oh good,
good.
Now I'm in a good mood

355
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.980
<v 1>and dude,
I am sitting at the top of the stadium and it's still fucking awesome.</v>

356
00:20:55.981 --> 00:20:58.410
Maybe I was so fucking high up on the place,
what happened?

357
00:20:58.411 --> 00:21:02.340
And he could kind of just,
just watch the whole defense.
You know?

358
00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.830
I love doing that.
When you go to a game,
when you sit up high,

359
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.420
just watching the defense,

360
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.260
he kind of have like in your peripheral where the ball's going and just trying

361
00:21:10.261 --> 00:21:11.010
to see it.
All the linemen,

362
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.770
if they come down and try to like pick up a linebacker or something like that,

363
00:21:13.771 --> 00:21:18.570
or like a,
you know,
try to figure out which receivers open.
I'm a nerd.

364
00:21:18.571 --> 00:21:21.120
I love doing that shit.
However,
I got to tell you something,

365
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:26.310
that the experience of going into that game,
I get that the NFL cares,

366
00:21:26.311 --> 00:21:27.990
but Jesus Christ,

367
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.500
I think the NFL has kind of forgot that sports is like an escape.

368
00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:35.050
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

369
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.360
<v 1>You know what I mean?
Especially now with social media and all that shit.</v>

370
00:21:37.361 --> 00:21:39.380
You just can't get away with all the fucking,
yeah.

371
00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.070
<v 4>Uh Huh.</v>

372
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.580
<v 1>Just all the fucking shit that's going,
my God,
this,</v>

373
00:21:43.581 --> 00:21:46.890
this city just got hit by a fucking hurricane.
This made when we got Puerto Rico.

374
00:21:46.891 --> 00:21:50.820
Then why?
Why is it,
why aren't they getting help out there?
You know what I mean?

375
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.910
All these veterans that come back,
they commit suicide,
blah,
blah,
blah.

376
00:21:53.911 --> 00:21:57.760
All this fucking shit.
It's just,
it's fucking brutal.
So what do you do?

377
00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.400
You need to shut it off for a,
you go to a fucking game.
But there's,

378
00:22:00.401 --> 00:22:03.090
this was the experience at the Atlanta game.
First of all,
dude,

379
00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.650
it was so fucking loud in there.
And to just take all this with a grain of salt,

380
00:22:07.651 --> 00:22:11.150
because I'm a,
I'm an old cut.
All right.
I get in.

381
00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.640
It was so fucking loud.

382
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.933
<v 4>MMM.</v>

383
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:21.020
<v 5>They have these giant flat screens up at the top,
all going around in a circle.</v>

384
00:22:21.021 --> 00:22:21.950
And they were amazing.

385
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.770
I don't think that they're too big and they're not hanging down in your face,

386
00:22:24.771 --> 00:22:26.870
so they're not really that distracting or anything.

387
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:32.180
But it was like the cheerleaders came out and they fucking were playing this

388
00:22:32.181 --> 00:22:35.840
music.
I felt like I was at an ACDC concert.
It was that fucking loud

389
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:38.260
<v 4>and [inaudible]</v>

390
00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:41.940
<v 5>all of a sudden like Sam Jackson,
no,
no,
no.
Wait before that,</v>

391
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.980
way before that little John and another,
uh,
Atlanta rapper,
I don't,

392
00:22:46.981 --> 00:22:50.450
I mean I'm white.
You Shit.
I don't know who the fuck this guy is.
Um,

393
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.680
I'm sure he's great.
Whatever they did,

394
00:22:52.681 --> 00:22:56.970
like a public service announcement on fan behavior.
All right.

395
00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.380
Which I'm sure is based off the one client who fucking punched the 62 year old

396
00:23:01.381 --> 00:23:02.330
guy four times in the [inaudible]

397
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:06.100
<v 1>face.
So now we got to get a lecture on how to be human beings and they just sit</v>

398
00:23:06.101 --> 00:23:09.700
there,
go like,
ah,
you know,
don't,
uh,
don't,
you know,

399
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:14.290
don't be discourteous to the people next to you.
It was funny.

400
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:17.650
It was really bland copy and watch a little John trying to like add something to

401
00:23:17.651 --> 00:23:20.440
it was hilarious.
Uh,

402
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.420
Eddie fight at one point they say,
don't say anything racial.

403
00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.490
I believe that's what they was saying.
It was so loud.

404
00:23:27.491 --> 00:23:28.900
It was echoing and I couldn't hear it.

405
00:23:28.901 --> 00:23:32.020
And then there was something about not saying anything politically charged.

406
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:38.650
Now it's just like,
where the fuck am I right now?
Who the fuck gives them up?

407
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:43.270
Gives a shit about politics.
I'm at a football game.
Who gives a fuck?

408
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.140
I'm trying to think back

409
00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:49.770
<v 4>when I was a kid,
when I went to a Bruins patriots game or something like that,</v>

410
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.510
you know,
in the late eighties,

411
00:23:51.511 --> 00:23:56.511
I don't ever remember anybody yelling out shit about Mike Dukakis versus George

412
00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.100
Bush Sr.
MMM.

413
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.750
<v 1>Anyways,
let me get back to this guy real quick.</v>

414
00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.940
Um,
yeah,
so they sent to the,

415
00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:12.450
this whole fucking thing happens and then the fucking cheerleaders come out and

416
00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:16.840
they're playing some fucking crazy loud ag ag,
ag ag.
Well,

417
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.330
pappy bleed fucking Dj Shit.
They're out there dancing,

418
00:24:21.331 --> 00:24:25.110
shaking their ass.
I literally had my fingers in my ears like Jesus Christ,

419
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:28.350
I should have brought earplugs to this fucking thing.
And then out of nowhere,

420
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:33.470
Sam Jackson starts fucking screaming at everybody to get up something about the

421
00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:37.410
heartbeat.
You know,
we've got to fucking do this.
First of all,

422
00:24:37.411 --> 00:24:39.120
it's like Sam Jackson,
you're from New York.

423
00:24:39.121 --> 00:24:42.930
When did you start giving a shit about the falcons?
You know what I mean?

424
00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:45.121
I mean,

425
00:24:45.121 --> 00:24:48.390
you would think he had enough capital one money to take a fucking weekend.

426
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.450
All the guys in star wars,
he is like capital one.

427
00:24:52.451 --> 00:24:54.370
He's every way you want to be.
Right?

428
00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:57.640
It's fucking guy's screaming and he's doing the whole fucking like it was

429
00:24:57.641 --> 00:25:00.070
something about a heartbeat.
He yelled some shit,

430
00:25:00.071 --> 00:25:03.400
we gotta fucking got out data and then this giant heartbeat would go,

431
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.150
go God deafening.
And then they'd cut to like,
you know,
and when,

432
00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:09.870
when it was like beating that we cut to like an allowed Atlanta Falcon,

433
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.590
like thumping his chest mean mugging you.
And I'm just like,
dude,

434
00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.453
I'm not playing.

435
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.350
I don't need to get this amped up screaming and fucking yelling.

436
00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:25.480
That was so loud and so fucking distracting that I didn't even notice that the

437
00:25:25.481 --> 00:25:27.280
fucking players had taken the field.

438
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.990
And what alerted me that the players had taken the field was after capital one,

439
00:25:31.991 --> 00:25:35.920
Sam Jackson had stopped screaming.
And the heartbeat,
it ended,

440
00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.610
all of a sudden I hear a locomotive train horn,

441
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:43.810
it just goes [inaudible] loud as shit.

442
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.580
And they kicked the ball off.
So it was the cheerleader,
Dat Yang,

443
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.680
can't get Sam Jackson,
get the fuck up your mother fuckers,
you know?

444
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.130
And then [inaudible] and after all of that shit,

445
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:59.930
the fucking ball just goes out to the back of the end zone and then they

446
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.300
announced it just goes touch back Atlanta.

447
00:26:08.180 --> 00:26:08.300
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

448
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:12.800
<v 5>So I burst out laughing and the lady next to me starts laughing and I,</v>

449
00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:17.240
and I looked at her like she saw what I saw and thought it was funny and she was

450
00:26:17.241 --> 00:26:20.090
just laughing because I made her uncomfortable because I was at the game by

451
00:26:20.091 --> 00:26:22.310
myself and I just burst out laughing.

452
00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:27.170
So I think I came off as like a crazy person.
All right.
And then,

453
00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.393
uh,

454
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.550
<v 1>then I,
and then,
and then all this shit starts happening.
Okay.</v>

455
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:36.440
And intertwined with all of this is like the trail of tears that for some reason

456
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.770
the NFL,
I don't know what they're trying to do.

457
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:41.960
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

458
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.660
<v 1>I understand that there's a lot of people suffering in the world.
I get it.</v>

459
00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:50.430
I do benefits.
I give to charities,
you know,
I,

460
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:55.080
I,
I try to do my fucking part.
I don't know what the solution is.

461
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:56.850
I don't know why we can't get along.

462
00:26:56.851 --> 00:26:59.150
I don't know why there's disease and all that,
but we,

463
00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:03.030
but what we do have is we have music and we have sports,

464
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:06.150
and it's a way to kind of get away from it.
Right.
This is what

465
00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.700
<v 5>the fuck I saw at the game.
Okay.
The game starts</v>

466
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:11.143
<v 4>okay.</v>

467
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.140
<v 5>And they have a veteran who's missing a leg runs out with the flag.
Okay.</v>

468
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:20.910
Which is uplifting,
but also depressing.
He lost his leg.
I'm like,
ah,

469
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:22.110
fuck these fucking kids,
man.

470
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.720
This whole fucking generation generations at this point,

471
00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:26.100
we gotta be in the second generation.
That's all.

472
00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:28.110
<v 1>Were they fighting fucking wars?
Why?
Why?
Why,</v>

473
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.980
why do we try to solve things this way?
It's poor fucking guy,
man.

474
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.770
He's losing all the Mr is lost the leg.

475
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.413
<v 4>All right,</v>

476
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:40.850
<v 1>so I'm thinking about people losing limbs in the war.
The lady goes out,</v>

477
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:44.090
the lay goes out to sing the national anthem.

478
00:27:44.091 --> 00:27:47.870
That was so fucking loud when they announced,
I forget where to cause was.

479
00:27:47.871 --> 00:27:50.480
There was some sort of ribbon and it was cancer related.

480
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.460
So we've got the one legged vet and then I'm like,
God,

481
00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:56.870
fuck the veterans are cheeses.
Christ got,
how do we get out of this fucking war?

482
00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.240
Right?
I'm thinking about that.

483
00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.300
Then I'm thinking about people with cancer and then the coin toss.

484
00:28:02.301 --> 00:28:03.770
They bring this cute little boy out,

485
00:28:03.771 --> 00:28:06.740
nine year old kid or something who survived bone marrow cancer,

486
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:10.430
and then I start thinking,
oh my God,
what if my,
that's horrible.

487
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:14.090
What if my kid ever got cancer?
How would I handle that or would I do?

488
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.820
Oh my God,
if my kid died,
I'd fucking kill myself.
I stopped.

489
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.900
I'm thinking suicidal fucking thoughts here.

490
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:21.783
<v 4>All right.</v>

491
00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:26.710
<v 5>Then the fucking game starts.
Wow.
Thought about the blender,
right?</v>

492
00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.650
They're playing all this shit loud is fucking Shit,

493
00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:31.030
<v 4>Eh,</v>

494
00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.960
<v 5>I'm trying to shake off all the misery of the world that I've been reminded of</v>

495
00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.780
like five different examples.
And then out of nowhere

496
00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.110
this,
they show this one,

497
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:45.310
they show this guy on the screen and then they showed this woman who's married

498
00:28:45.311 --> 00:28:49.900
to the guy and she's now a widow because the dude died in Afghanistan.

499
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.400
And I'm like,
oh my God,
she lost her husband.
Oh,
that poor woman,

500
00:28:54.401 --> 00:28:55.780
that's fucking terrible.

501
00:28:56.170 --> 00:29:00.880
And then they cut to her wearing an Atlantic Falcons Jersey with their two kids

502
00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:05.830
who are now fatherless wearing the Jersey smiling and waving at this giant

503
00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:09.850
fucking flat screen.
And all I'm thinking is like,

504
00:29:09.851 --> 00:29:12.490
those fucking kids are gonna grow up without a father.

505
00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.640
Second doubted three Atlanta.
Right?
I'm just like,

506
00:29:15.641 --> 00:29:17.440
what the f what is going on here?

507
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.900
It was one of the most depressing do.

508
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.960
There was like nine minutes left in the first quarter.

509
00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:27.420
And in case you missed the veteran running out with one leg,

510
00:29:27.421 --> 00:29:28.770
they fucking showed that again.

511
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:30.850
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

512
00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:32.440
<v 1>And,
uh,
all I can think at that point.</v>

513
00:29:32.441 --> 00:29:34.330
It's like what does the halftime show going to be?

514
00:29:34.331 --> 00:29:36.790
Am I going to watch somebody die in an iron lung?

515
00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:44.550
Well,
their family members holding hands crying and then the PA announcer,

516
00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:47.530
it'd be like,
yeah,
that's right.
Look at it and look at that misery.

517
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.790
Do you pay more?
I realize how lucky you are.

518
00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:53.640
<v 0>Okay.</v>

519
00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.510
<v 1>You don't have to spend your life for your own personal separate.</v>

520
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:59.790
I only got an ax.
Halan,

521
00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:03.330
<v 3>my Jesus Christ NFL.
Why?
Why stop there?</v>

522
00:30:03.331 --> 00:30:05.880
How about every time they fucking throw the ball,

523
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.240
you show me that cow that was slaughtered so they could have this skin.

524
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.910
Any time they shoot tee shirts into the crowd,

525
00:30:11.911 --> 00:30:14.850
why don't you just show me the fucking sweatshop labor that,

526
00:30:14.851 --> 00:30:15.900
that put it together.

527
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:21.850
<v 1>You know what it is?
Caring is a great fucking thing.</v>

528
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:25.200
But how about you pick a cause rather than they,

529
00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:29.710
<v 3>I mean what did they show in the,
I mean I left,</v>

530
00:30:29.711 --> 00:30:32.410
I left with like five minutes left in the second quarter.
It was just like,

531
00:30:32.411 --> 00:30:35.600
you know what?
This is a great stadium.
I want to be here with a friends and shit.

532
00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:36.430
Yeah.

533
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:37.360
<v 1>And uh,</v>

534
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.990
<v 3>I'm already depressed that I'm on the fucking road.
I'm missing my family.</v>

535
00:30:40.991 --> 00:30:44.530
I came here to get away from that sadness and I've been reminded that I'm kind

536
00:30:44.531 --> 00:30:48.880
of being selfish because these people have way bigger sadness than I do.

537
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.060
And somewhere in all of that I saw

538
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.500
<v 1>balloon fucking Dick and balls,</v>

539
00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:59.690
twisted fucking balloon animals while kids were walking by.

540
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.560
I'll tell you it was a hell of a day,
you know.
So I actually,

541
00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:06.740
and I saw that the jets were fucking coming at the pats and I was like,

542
00:31:06.741 --> 00:31:11.180
why don't I just go sit in a fucking bar and,
and watch this thing.

543
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:15.350
This is the other thing too.
Like
I,
I just,

544
00:31:15.351 --> 00:31:18.530
I just don't 100% by

545
00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:24.920
that.
The fucking NFL truly cares that much.

546
00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:26.240
You know what I mean?

547
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.060
Cause you know they got busted whenever they show a veteran in the crowd.

548
00:31:29.061 --> 00:31:31.400
We had one of our heroes here,
but Baba Baba,
Baba,

549
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.090
the whatever branch of the service they're showing,
they have to pay the NFL.

550
00:31:35.091 --> 00:31:38.000
They considered a recruitment video like,
like a commercial.

551
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.930
And I heard they recently adjusted it.
I don't know,
but what the fuck?

552
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:43.583
<v 0>Right.</v>

553
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.210
<v 1>And how much fucking money do you have to make?</v>

554
00:31:47.211 --> 00:31:49.130
So I believe the owners individually,

555
00:31:49.131 --> 00:31:52.640
I believe that they all care about these causes.
I'm sure all of them have had,

556
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.660
you know,
friends or whatever,
fighting in wars had been touched.
You know,

557
00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:01.280
unfortunately you had a family or a family member or a friend that got cancer or

558
00:32:01.281 --> 00:32:02.091
something like that.

559
00:32:02.091 --> 00:32:06.650
But I really have to believe that just because it is a corporation and that the

560
00:32:06.651 --> 00:32:10.100
way that they handled in the way that they've handled their players,

561
00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:12.133
you know what I mean?

562
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.570
But all the brain damage and shit and they just fucking ignored it allegedly

563
00:32:17.571 --> 00:32:18.650
after they knew about it.

564
00:32:18.651 --> 00:32:21.320
And then when they did the class action suit against the NFL,

565
00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:26.530
they basically gave every player like 800 or a thousand bucks.
Um,

566
00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.580
it just comes off like a PR move like that.

567
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.890
They feel that they can grow their brand.
This is my conspiracy theory.

568
00:32:33.891 --> 00:32:34.581
I'm not saying I'm right.

569
00:32:34.581 --> 00:32:39.020
I think the NFL resents soccer that it's,

570
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.400
and the UFC that started well after them that also went global.

571
00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:47.150
I think they want to go global and I think they've reached the maximum amount of

572
00:32:47.151 --> 00:32:51.200
sports fans.
So now they're trying to grow their brand through carrying,

573
00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:56.360
everybody's trying to show how much they care or maybe it's a symptom of this

574
00:32:56.361 --> 00:32:58.820
fucking social media craziness

575
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.520
where everybody's like,
I dunno just going nuts,
screaming and yelling at people.

576
00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.250
<v 4>MMM.</v>

577
00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.670
<v 1>That they try to get out in front of it and care about every cause that's out</v>

578
00:33:11.671 --> 00:33:15.870
there.
I have no fucking idea,
but all I know is I went to that game,
you know,

579
00:33:15.871 --> 00:33:17.740
going,
all right,
let me kill a day here and forget that.

580
00:33:17.741 --> 00:33:22.170
How much I'm missing my wife and my kid.
And I went there and it's just like,

581
00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:26.550
wow.
I guess the good thing was I realized I don't have a lot,
I don't have,

582
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.340
my troubles aren't as big as other people's troubles,

583
00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:34.530
but Jesus fucking Christ and it fell.
How about you just pick one,

584
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:39.480
pick one.
I like,
you know,
the Fred socks always had the Jimmy Fund.
You know,

585
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.590
they had that and it was,
that was it.
That was,
I mean Jesus,

586
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.920
it was fucking unreal.
So,
um,

587
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.750
anyways,
having said that,
you got to go to the store,

588
00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:56.340
it's got to go to the steady.
All right.
Um,
but I would,

589
00:33:56.341 --> 00:33:58.050
before you go to the Falcon Stadium,

590
00:33:58.051 --> 00:34:02.700
I would recommend you watch raising Arizona Watch something really funny.

591
00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.000
Get yourself in a,

592
00:34:04.001 --> 00:34:08.730
in a really elevated mood because they are going to bring you down.

593
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:13.290
They are going to bring you fucking down Jesus Christ.

594
00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.960
You know,
I'm the only thing that they will,
you know,

595
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.630
and plus it's also like what they choose to care about is really fucking like

596
00:34:21.631 --> 00:34:22.800
planned out too.

597
00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:27.180
Like I'm waiting for one of those NFL teams to bring out a bunch of fucking

598
00:34:27.181 --> 00:34:30.810
recovered heroin addicts that got addicted to pain pills that they got to the

599
00:34:30.811 --> 00:34:35.811
pharmaceutical industry that is allegedly basically synthetic heroin dealers.

600
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.460
Why don't they show that?
Oh that's right.

601
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:40.710
Cause pharmaceutical companies advertise

602
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.130
on those network and they're not going to show that shit.

603
00:34:44.131 --> 00:34:46.230
They're not going to bite the hand that feeds.
They're not going to go on.

604
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:49.320
Why do people keep getting cancer?
Why is cancer through the fucking roof?

605
00:34:49.321 --> 00:34:50.490
Let's look at pesticides.

606
00:34:50.491 --> 00:34:53.790
Let's look at what we're doing to our food supply has stay away from that.

607
00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:57.840
Stay away from that.
I'm big on the military,

608
00:34:57.870 --> 00:35:00.450
big on the military to the point literally of like,

609
00:35:00.451 --> 00:35:04.490
I felt in a way that I was sort of in like a clockwork orange and they should

610
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:08.040
have just had my eyes taped open as they're selling me,
you know,

611
00:35:08.041 --> 00:35:11.970
our foreign policy like squirting tears into my eyes.
It's just like,

612
00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.150
you know,
it's like guys,

613
00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.380
what's your getting involved with is way more complex than a football game.
Okay.

614
00:35:19.381 --> 00:35:23.520
So just keep it simple,
stupid.
It's,
people have always told me.
So anyways,

615
00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:27.060
that was my experience.
Um,
overall it was a great experience.

616
00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:28.710
I feel bad that I left the fucking game.

617
00:35:28.711 --> 00:35:31.350
My mother always taught me never to leave the game and I left and the dolphins

618
00:35:31.351 --> 00:35:35.190
came back and won.
And um,
oh,
by the way,
he was another loud thing.

619
00:35:35.191 --> 00:35:37.050
Anytime it was third down,
this is fucking,

620
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.160
anytime we started down this fucking lunatic would just go,

621
00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:45.730
<v 0>uh,</v>

622
00:35:45.730 --> 00:35:46.563
<v 3>sorry</v>

623
00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.660
<v 1>to get the crowd like amped up.
And it's just like,
dude,</v>

624
00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:55.040
I have a flat screen TV in front of me that is easily two and a half times the

625
00:35:55.041 --> 00:35:58.460
size of my fucking house.
And it says third and two.
I can see it.

626
00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.293
<v 4>MMM.</v>

627
00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.890
<v 1>I Dunno.
But having said all that,
um,</v>

628
00:36:04.330 --> 00:36:06.700
I'm going to give a shout out here to the,

629
00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.500
whoever the fuck designed that fucking stadium.
It is unbelievable.
It's gorgeous.

630
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:14.500
And the college Superbowl is there this year.

631
00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:18.790
She wants to blow some fucking money and the Superbowl's going to be there next

632
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:23.410
year.
It's fucking amazing.
Um,
it's amazing.
And the NFL cares,

633
00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.460
you know,
it's another great one is Ford Ford Motor Company.

634
00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:34.060
They got a tie out there where they go 100% of the proceeds go to fight cancer,

635
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.060
which is great cause a lot of times it's a portion of the proceeds and they keep

636
00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:40.190
a lot of it.
So I will commend Ford for that.
But what's hilarious is,

637
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.740
is their website is suddenly like Ford cares.com.
It's like,
well it's glad.

638
00:36:44.741 --> 00:36:46.060
I'm glad you care about that.

639
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.090
Cause you certainly didn't give a fuck where you put the gas tank and the Pinto

640
00:36:49.091 --> 00:36:53.590
and the crown Vic.
Did Ya?
Um,
anyways.
All right.
That's it.

641
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.770
I'm done with my sports rants here.
But uh,

642
00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:00.010
thank you to the NFL and thank you to the world of college sports.

643
00:37:00.011 --> 00:37:03.460
You guys got me through this fucking weekend.
The loneliness.
Uh,

644
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.500
thank you to the new punchline in Atlanta.

645
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.163
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

646
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.050
<v 1>Um,
I got to do a spot there last night and the laughing skull down the street.</v>

647
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:15.051
I've been having a great time trying to stay sharp with my act and uh,

648
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:17.670
I guys,
I can't tell you the name of them.
I don't,
I don't know what I can,

649
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:19.650
I can't talk about the movie that I'm in,
but I think,

650
00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:21.900
I think this one's going to be a fucking good one,
dude.

651
00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:26.130
I am like really excited looking at all of like,

652
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.560
<v 4>mmm.</v>

653
00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:30.300
<v 1>The shots that the direct,</v>

654
00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:32.730
I want to say the director's name cause I never know what the fuck you can't see

655
00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:36.660
and can't see it.
But the fucking shots that I've been seeing,

656
00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:40.230
it's literally I'm sitting like,
dude,
I'm going to be fucking in this thing now.

657
00:37:40.231 --> 00:37:42.540
Watch.
They're going to cut my,
cut my part out.

658
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.400
What am I going to learn to keep my fucking mouth shut?
All right.
You know what?

659
00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:53.880
Let's uh,
let's do a little advertising here.

660
00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.540
<v 3>All right.
What do we got here?
Um,
me undies.
Everybody.
Me On ds.
All me undies.</v>

661
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:05.040
Stop showing people die in the new dude beyond these me on days.

662
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:08.250
I'm at a football game.
Why am I crying?
I get dead.

663
00:38:08.251 --> 00:38:10.080
People have fucking cancer.

664
00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.340
People die in wars.

665
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:18.600
Don't wear from can I just watch this fucking game?
You NFL,
greedy con.

666
00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:22.110
Stop acting like your care.
All right,

667
00:38:22.111 --> 00:38:27.111
me undies makes Andries de your butt will be proud to wear and check this out.

668
00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:29.670
I'm not the only one who loves me undies.

669
00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.410
Listen to what my long time listener in me undies enthusiasts.

670
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:37.570
George has to say a note from George N,

671
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.550
a bill burr listener in me undies fan.
What fucking big brother's shit is this.

672
00:38:42.551 --> 00:38:47.230
I've never met this guy.
Anyways,
this guy said,
and there's no last name,

673
00:38:47.231 --> 00:38:51.820
how do we know this person exists?
George and George?
Nonexistent.

674
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.780
I decided to try out me undies because I love Bill Burns me undies,
jingles.

675
00:38:55.810 --> 00:39:00.490
I smile every time he sings it.
Somehow I feel like the cleaned this up.

676
00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:01.980
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

677
00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:06.270
<v 3>I smile.
I bet he really said Dad,</v>

678
00:39:06.271 --> 00:39:10.470
I liked the way he sings to fucking songs.
Dude,
I fucking laugh my balls off.

679
00:39:10.471 --> 00:39:14.040
Then they clean it all up.
I smile every time he thinks it.

680
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.670
Second of three.
Atlanta.
Uh,

681
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:20.880
although it's so easy to skip ads in a podcast,

682
00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:25.410
I always listened to bill's reads and I'm so glad me undies has stuck with them.

683
00:39:25.411 --> 00:39:26.160
I've been,

684
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.120
it's been probably two years since I first bought a pair of me undies and now I

685
00:39:30.121 --> 00:39:33.630
have a monthly subscription because they are that comfortable.
I swear to God,

686
00:39:33.631 --> 00:39:37.070
this is their copy.
This isn't me doing the like the Atlantic Falcons,

687
00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:41.400
the Atlanta Falcons,
things like,
look at me hooking up a widow.

688
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.600
Look at me.
Look how much my listeners love my reads.
Anyways,
before me undies,

689
00:39:45.601 --> 00:39:50.580
I used to buy the three pack of underwear at retail stores.
Do this as so edited.

690
00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:54.480
There's no way this was written this perfectly until I realized that I wanted to

691
00:39:54.481 --> 00:39:56.220
treat my junk on.
There you go.

692
00:39:56.221 --> 00:40:00.390
Maybe it's shrimp to something more comfortable and that starts with a great

693
00:40:00.391 --> 00:40:04.290
pair of me undies,
cradling my family jewels.
Yeah,

All right.
Hey,
guess what?

747
00:43:25.711 --> 00:43:30.390
I started watching yesterday on Netflix.
I watched,

748
00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:35.070
I watched the first episode of Narcos and uh,
I was funny,

749
00:43:35.071 --> 00:43:38.970
I tried to watch it the first time and I don't know,
but I think the subtitles,

750
00:43:38.971 --> 00:43:43.020
I got intimidated because in the beginning there's this,

751
00:43:43.021 --> 00:43:46.830
they have this whole fucking thing about magical mysticism or some bullshit like

752
00:43:46.831 --> 00:43:49.890
that and it's on the screen,
whatever the paragraph is before that,

753
00:43:49.891 --> 00:43:53.700
it goes by too fucking quick.
I can't read it.
And then I'm just like,
okay,

754
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:55.230
this is going to be the pace of the reading.

755
00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:58.710
I'm not going to be able to keep up with it.
Well anyways,
I'm lonely on the road.

756
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.460
I finally figured out my Netflix account.
It's fucking hilarious.

757
00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.800
I've got a show on Netflix and I never watch it because I,
I just,
I dunno,

758
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.330
I just,
I don't interact well with computers in all of this shit.

759
00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.590
And then once it's passwords,

760
00:44:13.591 --> 00:44:16.140
I'm going to forget the password and then I'm going to say,

761
00:44:16.141 --> 00:44:19.290
email me my password and then somehow it's going to end up in my junk folder and

762
00:44:19.291 --> 00:44:21.510
I won't be able to find it.
I just figured,
you know what?
Fuck it.

763
00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:25.830
I'll just put on my TV and watch the Rockford files,
right.
Well,

764
00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:30.300
I finally figured it out and I watched the first episode of Narcos and I'm 100%

765
00:44:30.301 --> 00:44:34.770
in what a goddamn show.
Also,
by the way,
uh,

766
00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.190
the producers of the show,
whatever the production company,

767
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:40.830
whenever you say is gold mine,
which also does theF is for family,

768
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.750
I'll fucking great today.
Um,
so anyways,
uh,

769
00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.190
when I watched that first fucking episode,

770
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:55.120
when he's sitting there talking to those army guys and starts naming their

771
00:44:55.521 --> 00:44:56.354
names,

772
00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:58.773
<v 4>mmm.</v>

773
00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:01.920
<v 3>When Pablo Escobar is doing that and he starts,
you know,</v>

774
00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.300
just letting them know that he knows all of their families members and like

775
00:45:06.301 --> 00:45:09.240
basically,
you know,
without saying that something bad's going to happen to them,

776
00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:13.650
I still don't understand why they just didn't take a gun and blow his fucking

777
00:45:13.651 --> 00:45:17.040
brains out.
There's no loyalty

778
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:22.750
in,
uh,
in that world.
Once you fucking killed him,
then,

779
00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:27.620
then they would
cut the head off the snake.
I'm,

780
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:30.340
I know I'm over simplifying this,
but I'm just saying,

781
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:33.190
if there's any DAA agents that are listening here,

782
00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.390
if he just blew his fucking brains out right then and there wouldn't all the

783
00:45:37.391 --> 00:45:38.980
other gangsters underneath them,

784
00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.970
one to then be the next Pablo Escobar's and then they would start fighting with

785
00:45:42.971 --> 00:45:45.740
each other,
wouldn't that happen?

786
00:45:45.741 --> 00:45:48.110
And then they would have to establish than they would have to pay out.

787
00:45:48.111 --> 00:45:51.860
They'd have to start all over again.
Like,
Hey,
we had to deal with Pablo.

788
00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:53.810
He paid us off.
You didn't,
you know,

789
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:56.270
when it start all over again and then they wouldn't have time to come after your

790
00:45:56.271 --> 00:45:59.120
family.
I know.
I know.

791
00:45:59.121 --> 00:46:02.480
I probably totally fucking over simplified that fucking thing that night.
Um,

792
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.520
all right,
well,
how much time do we have left here?
Oh,
Bill,

793
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:12.050
he's got to hit the fucking treadmill.
All right.
Keep his little fucking,

794
00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:16.700
you know,
Evan Been Busan.
I've been doing all right.

795
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:19.040
I haven't been doing the greatest,
I've been fucking,
I'm not gonna lie to you.

796
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:23.930
I'm a,
I'm in a fucking mild depression right now.
And,
uh,
but I'm going to see my,

797
00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:27.590
uh,
my wife and my daughter this week,
hopefully.
Um,

798
00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.313
<v 4>okay.</v>

799
00:46:29.390 --> 00:46:32.240
<v 3>I mean,
if someone I'm going to,
I'm going to get them out here.
All right.
Uh,
okay.</v>

800
00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:34.970
Let's,
let's read some of the fucking,
oh,
wait a minute.

801
00:46:34.971 --> 00:46:37.460
Get an all things comedy festival podcast read.
That's right.

802
00:46:37.490 --> 00:46:39.950
I'm doing my first live Monday morning podcast.

803
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:43.640
This could be a total fucking train wreck no matter what.

804
00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.050
It's going to be exciting.
Uh,

805
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.070
we're having our first all things comedy festival at the end of the month.

806
00:46:49.071 --> 00:46:54.020

Arizona.

807
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:59.450
I'll be there recording my first ever live Monday morning podcast.

808
00:47:00.140 --> 00:47:05.140
The great legendary Doug Stan hope is doing his podcast at the Orpheum theater.

809
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:07.220
Um,

810
00:47:07.220 --> 00:47:12.220
Bert Kreischer are reshift fear and the crab feast are also on the lineup.

811
00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:19.720
We're taking over downtown Phoenix with the pop up podcast studio and the whole

812
00:47:19.791 --> 00:47:22.310
network is going to be there.

kissing babies,

815
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:32.223
right?

816
00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:38.100
Doing public service announcements on a giant flat screen TV reminding you that

817
00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:40.360
people still get to Berkeley or losis.

818
00:47:40.361 --> 00:47:43.150
Anything I can do to depress you at our podcast and I'm not gonna,

819
00:47:43.151 --> 00:47:45.280
I'm not going to do that.
Um,

820
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:49.930
afterwards I'll do a meet and greet at the end of the fucking,
uh,
you know,

821
00:47:49.931 --> 00:47:53.030
at the end of the,
uh,
the man podcast,
uh,

822
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:57.650
whatever the live fucking thing,
you know,
I'll do all of that bullshit.
Um,

823
00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:01.900
unless I have a really bad show and then I'll just go in the back and cry.
Um,

824
00:48:01.901 --> 00:48:04.090
all right,
let's get to the questions here.
All right,
Bill,

825
00:48:04.091 --> 00:48:08.770
did everyone know about Harvey Weinstein and then parentheses from a lady?

826
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:12.460
All right.
I don't know why I had to let me know it was from a woman.
Okay.
Hey,

827
00:48:12.461 --> 00:48:12.790
bill,

828
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:17.740
I'm a big fan of your podcast and your show I saw in Montreal earlier this year

829
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:22.510
was epic.
Seeing a master at work is a beautiful thing.
Ah,
yeah.
Buttered me up.

830
00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:28.070
You buttered me up.
I have a lot of respect for you as a straight forward guy.
Oh,

831
00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:30.640
it looks out.
This person's brilliant.
She's gone.
You know,

832
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:34.480
you're a fucking brilliant away.
You do.
I know that.
You never lie.

833
00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.510
This is great.
This is the way you ask a question.

834
00:48:37.511 --> 00:48:40.360
If you want to get an understand,
sir.
Uh,
you're one of the few,

835
00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:42.790
I'll believe unequivocally on this subject.

836
00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:47.200
Do you think everyone in Hollywood knew about Harvey Weinstein?

837
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:50.620
I can totally understand how no one spoke out until now.

838
00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:54.100
He was fucking scary and clearly had the precedents pocket.

839
00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:57.010
I'd like to think I would have spoken out,
but honestly,

840
00:48:57.011 --> 00:49:01.000
I probably would have put my fucking life in career on the line with little

841
00:49:01.001 --> 00:49:02.440
chance of taking him down.

842
00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:06.790
I just wish all this stars feigning shock would just be honest and admit they

843
00:49:06.791 --> 00:49:11.380
knew they didn't have the balls,
parentheses or were too smart to step up.

844
00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:15.640
We'd love to hear neos thoughts on this.
So,
and I,
she's not here.

845
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.220
Congratulations on your amazing Tada.

846
00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:22.600
Love hearing about you being in dead.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Um,

847
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:24.161
all right.
First of all,

848
00:49:24.161 --> 00:49:28.660
thank you for talking to me as if I'm on the big star level and I know it all of

849
00:49:28.661 --> 00:49:32.760
them think,
um,
I gotta be honest with you.

850
00:49:32.761 --> 00:49:35.820
I didn't know a fucking thing about that guy other than he had a lot of hit

851
00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:36.713
movies.

852
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:39.303
<v 4>MMM.</v>

853
00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:45.850
<v 3>I came up as a standup comedian and have risen to the having a vulgar animated</v>

854
00:49:48.201 --> 00:49:52.100
show on Netflix.
That's,
that's the level I got to.

855
00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.360
So I've done some movies

856
00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:57.510
<v 4>okay.</v>

857
00:49:57.510 --> 00:50:01.260
<v 3>With some pretty big people,
but his name never came up,</v>

858
00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:02.820
so,

859
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.940
<v 4>okay.</v>

860
00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.170
<v 3>If I had a guest,</v>

861
00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:08.560
I imagine a lot of people knew that he fucked around in his wife.

862
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.080
This is all speculation.

863
00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:13.293
<v 4>MMM.</v>

864
00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:16.680
<v 3>I have no idea,
but I don't know.</v>

865
00:50:17.670 --> 00:50:18.180
<v 4>Okay.</v>

866
00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.090
<v 3>I think the women that he did it too,
obviously,
you know,</v>

867
00:50:21.091 --> 00:50:24.840
allegedly you got to say a legend.
Now I'm trying to get sued here.

868
00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:28.130
It's still all allegedly has not been convicted of the

869
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:31.550
<v 1>58 people that came out with the same fucking story.
It's all allegedly,</v>

870
00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.093
um,

871
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:40.790
I'd have to think that they knew and then their friends would know.

872
00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:48.610
But how far it goes from that.
It's,
it's,
it's a,
I don't know.

873
00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:50.650
I have no idea.
I ain't go to be honest with you.

874
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:55.630
We were in between takes and,
uh,

875
00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:01.000
on the movie and we were shooting in this fucking really cool fucking motel man.

876
00:51:01.001 --> 00:51:02.410
I felt like I was in a Coen brothers movie,

877
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:06.280
so one of the rooms we had was like the little green room and they will,
they,

878
00:51:06.281 --> 00:51:09.670
the story was on and these women were coming forward and like

879
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:16.980
my mouth was literally a gape listening to it.
I,

880
00:51:16.981 --> 00:51:19.430
I can't,
I be honest,
I'll,
I'll,
I can straight from me.

881
00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:24.450
I can't fucking believe somebody could do that and get away with it for that

882
00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:26.090
fucking law.
I mean.

883
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:28.120
<v 0>Okay.</v>

884
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.530
<v 1>And did the tape,
that fucking woman</v>

885
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:36.940
and how that isn't enough
I guess.
Cause he never said yes.

886
00:51:36.941 --> 00:51:37.950
I grabbed,

887
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:39.260
<v 0>yeah,</v>

888
00:51:39.260 --> 00:51:42.330
<v 1>your boob.
I think he just keeps going.
Like I understand.
Just come and say,</v>

889
00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:46.100
I just got,
I,
I'm used to this.
I'm used to this.

890
00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:47.720
None of that is an admission.

891
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.610
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

892
00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:52.730
<v 1>All right.
Then one more just because you're used to this,
like,</v>

893
00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:54.120
<v 0>okay,</v>

894
00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:55.320
<v 1>I dunno,
I just got to be on with you.</v>

895
00:51:55.410 --> 00:51:58.080
It's the most disgusting fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.

896
00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:00.330
And if this guy is as guilty as he looks,

897
00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:02.910
I'm worried that he's not going to go to jail

898
00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:08.460
because I don't know what evidence there is.
And,
and the,

899
00:52:08.461 --> 00:52:11.380
this statute of limit limitations.
I,
you know,

900
00:52:11.381 --> 00:52:16.300
you going back decades with the shit,
I don't know how it fucking works.
Uh,

901
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:17.620
but in a perfect world,

902
00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:21.010
they'd take them out to the desert and they put two bind his fucking ear.
I mean,

903
00:52:21.340 --> 00:52:26.200
if he's guilty,
if he's innocent,
and I think I just fucked my whole career.

904
00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:36.730
Um,
I have,
I have no idea.
I don't know who knew what or whatever,

905
00:52:36.731 --> 00:52:39.280
but I will tell you,
I've been enjoying watching Fox News,

906
00:52:39.281 --> 00:52:43.240
having a field day with this trashing Hollywood.

907
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:49.470
Um,
and you know,

908
00:52:49.471 --> 00:52:53.940
given that guy was in the fucking hot tub with a 13 year old girls now hides out

909
00:52:53.941 --> 00:52:58.200
in France,
giving him an award and all that shit.
Uh,

910
00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:03.240
I love watching them called Hollywood out.
I love watching Hannity,

911
00:53:03.241 --> 00:53:08.220
calling out the hypocrisy of Hollywood,
you know,

912
00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:13.050
trashing Donald Trump for what the fuck he's doing while bad shit's going on in

913
00:53:13.051 --> 00:53:13.884
their own town.

914
00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:19.100
And then all the wild Hannity never bringing up below Riley while saying that

915
00:53:20.851 --> 00:53:23.220
the friend,
what the fuck is that guy?
I always forget his name,

916
00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.010
the French dude there,
whatever guy had out in

917
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.720
<v 3>France or whatever saying,</v>

918
00:53:27.721 --> 00:53:30.750
and they gave this guy in a ward afterwards and it's just like,
yeah.

919
00:53:30.751 --> 00:53:34.020
And you had bill O'Reilly on your show afterward.

920
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:39.180
So everybody is like,
I dunno.
It's just such a fucking amazing time

921
00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:44.680
for that shit.
Hillary Clinton complaining about the fucking,

922
00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:47.163
uh,

923
00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:51.760
electorial college while the Democratic Party went to court and admitted that

924
00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:56.880
Bernie Sanders got more votes,
but they colluded with Hillary's,
uh,
you know,

925
00:53:57.070 --> 00:54:00.490
campaign to be like,
no,
you give us the best shot,
so we're going to pick you.

926
00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:03.610
Fuck with the people say,
I don't know.

927
00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:06.370
I don't fucking know.

928
00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.270
And then me saying that I fucking hate listening to people to talk politics.

929
00:54:10.271 --> 00:54:13.870
And then here I am talking.
Uh,
yeah,

930
00:54:13.871 --> 00:54:18.340
I have no idea who knew what.
But I would definitely say that,
you know,

931
00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.990
uh,
the same way like Fox News,
there's no fucking way.

932
00:54:22.991 --> 00:54:26.440
They didn't know that Bill O'reilly was settling out of court in these fucking

933
00:54:26.441 --> 00:54:28.480
things.
You know,

934
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:32.080
this same way that there's no way at the Weinstein company,

935
00:54:32.081 --> 00:54:34.570
they didn't know something was amiss.

936
00:54:36.450 --> 00:54:37.283
<v 4>MMM.</v>

937
00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:42.340
<v 3>I just don't,
I don't,
I'd be honest with you.
I am as shocked as anybody else.</v>

938
00:54:42.341 --> 00:54:46.790
I just don't fucking get it.
I,
I don't,
uh,

939
00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:51.050
I don't understand.
It's just one of the worst fucking things.

940
00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:55.150
It's,
I,
you know,
I have no,
I don't have any jokes.

941
00:54:55.151 --> 00:54:58.000
It's just one of the most disgusting fucking things I've ever heard.
And,
uh,

942
00:54:58.150 --> 00:55:02.080
I don't want to pay attention to the story because I don't think he's going to

943
00:55:02.081 --> 00:55:05.440
go to jail and listening to his comments.

944
00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:08.920
He's the typical piece of shit that does stuff like that where he actually feels

945
00:55:08.921 --> 00:55:12.980
like the victim,
you know what I mean?
Um,

946
00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:17.650
he's making it about himself and how bad he feels,
you know,
fuck the victims,

947
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:20.710
you know,
whatever the alleged victims,
what,
and I don't fucking know.

948
00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:21.670
I don't know what people knew,

949
00:55:22.090 --> 00:55:26.560
but somebody knew something and they should have fucking said something.
Um,

950
00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.340
anyways.
All right,
asshole neighbor threatening our dogs.

951
00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:32.113
<v 4>Okay.</v>

952
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:35.150
<v 3>Uh,
Jesus Christ.
All right,
dear Billy butter tits.
Hey,</v>

953
00:55:35.151 --> 00:55:36.980
I'm in good shape right now.
By the way,

954
00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:40.250
could you guys just insult me in a little more?
You know,

955
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:47.400
Billy,
how about Billy chiseled,
uh,
Albino Chester,
you know,
something like that.

956
00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:51.990
I'm not chiseled,
whatever.
I'm a lady lady,

957
00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:56.430
you wrote into my fucking podcast and I love you.

958
00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:58.710
I'm a lady in my twenties,
late twenties,

959
00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:01.590
here in the southeast United States,

960
00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:06.150
and I have an issue with an older male neighbor.
Okay.
But brave as possible.

961
00:56:06.151 --> 00:56:07.320
Why am I doing this accent,

962
00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:12.530
this asshole caves common on my prop by [inaudible] and letting our dogs out of

963
00:56:13.411 --> 00:56:17.900
the fence?
Oh my God.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I,

964
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:22.440
you need to beat this guy in the bottom of his feet.
Don't do that by the way.

965
00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:25.700
I don't condone that.
Violence is never an answer.
Uh,

966
00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:29.380
we live next door to a busy road and I hate to think what would happen if

967
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:32.860
someone came speeding down and hit one of my dogs.
I have a big yard,

968
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:36.520
so he has to come over into our property to open the gate.

969
00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:40.910
He waits until we lead to do it.
It's easy to go down to the spy shop,

970
00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:43.810
get some cameras,
because some of our neighbors snitched on him.

971
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:47.500
He's an old white trash dude that sits on his porch smoking all day.

972
00:56:47.501 --> 00:56:51.160
And he claims that our dogs bark 24,
seven,
they don't,

973
00:56:51.161 --> 00:56:54.760
and the rest of the neighbors have said they don't hear the barking or when they

974
00:56:54.761 --> 00:56:57.910
do,
it's minimal.
All right.
This is what I would do.
I would get,

975
00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:02.920
I would get a lock on my fence,
okay.
That he can't get past.

976
00:57:02.921 --> 00:57:06.280
And then I would,
uh,
go down to the spy shop and get some cameras.

977
00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:11.290
And then what I would also do is let them know I would write a letter and say

978
00:57:11.291 --> 00:57:14.680
that that's what you've done.
Okay.
Just so,

979
00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.670
because God forbid he jumps over the fence,
throws your dogs over,

980
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:21.060
and then they get hit and died,
you know,

981
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.830
then I'll die and you're going to be like,
all right,
well I caught the guy,

982
00:57:23.831 --> 00:57:27.670
but what are your dogs had to die?
What you really want to do is just make,

983
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:31.330
prevent this guy from doing it.
So let them know that you know what he's doing,

984
00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:35.140
that you've taken these measures and then maybe he will fuck off because you

985
00:57:35.141 --> 00:57:38.740
know,
who wants to see a dog die and then an old guy go to jail or whatever,

986
00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:43.690
um,
to stay on your porch revealed.
All right buddy,

987
00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:49.120
get him a pair of fucking,
uh,
wireless headphones,

988
00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:52.420
you know,
so we can listen to Bobbito boop,
boop,
boop,

989
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:55.720
[inaudible] Adobo but when he's fucking headphones.
Anyways,
he goes,

990
00:57:55.721 --> 00:57:58.270
my question is what the hell do I,
that's what she says.
My question is,

991
00:57:58.271 --> 00:58:01.540
what the hell do I do?
I've started locking the gates,

992
00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:03.190
so that shouldn't be a problem anymore.

993
00:58:03.191 --> 00:58:06.070
But one of this asshole tries to poison them or something and that's where the

994
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:09.310
cameras come in.
I'm probably being paranoid,
but I'm pissed off.

995
00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:12.830
I also have a temper,
which doesn't help.
What do I do,
Bill?

996
00:58:12.831 --> 00:58:14.200
How you're asking a guy who has a temper,

997
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:18.870
a pool immediately suggest you beat the bottom of the guy's feet.
Um,

998
00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.310
I've heard you talk about dealing with old people,
neighbors,

999
00:58:21.311 --> 00:58:24.250
and I'd really like your advice.
Thank you.
Go Fuck Yourself.
Yeah,
he's an old guy,

1000
00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:28.390
you know,
you know,
I would just,

1001
00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.240
I would send a letter over there and say,

1002
00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:33.890
I apologize if you find my dog's annoying.
Uh,

1003
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:35.830
other neighbors say they don't bark that bed.

1004
00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:40.900
Here's a pair of fucking earplugs and some old man fucking,

1005
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:43.420
I dunno what you give them,
give them some broncs or some shit.

1006
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.320
We're now locking the fence so you can no longer go in there.

1007
00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:51.280
And I also have a camera set up.
Okay.
I don't want to,
you know,

1008
00:58:51.281 --> 00:58:54.070
I would just do that.
Whatever the fuck I said earlier,
I would do that.

1009
00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:57.550
And then every time you see him,
even if he tells you to go fuck yourself,

1010
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:01.600
just smile and wave and just tell him,
uh,
it's nice to see you.

1011
00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:04.900
I hope you have a wonderful day.
I would just do that.
All right.

1012
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:06.670
And then if you ever have a hard house party,

1013
00:59:06.671 --> 00:59:11.410
I would invite them over and just tried to kill them with kindness rather than

1014
00:59:11.411 --> 00:59:16.060
beating the bottom of his feet.
All right.
Dating and Asia.
Asia,
Asia.

1015
00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:18.370
Well this is interesting.
I never even,

1016
00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:22.640
I never heard about any of this dear Billy me on stains that I like that one.

1017
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:23.570
Good for you.
All right.

1018
00:59:23.571 --> 00:59:28.010
I been living in Asia for the last four years and dating has been tricky.

1019
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:32.300
Asian girls are beautiful kind and much more giving in bed than their white

1020
00:59:32.301 --> 00:59:36.290
counterparts.
I don't know what the fuck that means.

1021
00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:42.350
I'm certainly punching above my weight class here.
All right.

1022
00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.300
You Punch in these women.
Um,

1023
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:48.860
I think the better thing is saying that you out kicked your coverage and having

1024
00:59:48.861 --> 00:59:52.730
relationships slash one night stands with a much higher quality of girl.

1025
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:57.320
Uh,
then I,
when I was back in the u s three,
this is the deal.

1026
00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:01.430
You're over there and you have an accent.
Okay.

1027
01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.500
That said,
same way if you come over here,
if you have a fucking accident,

1028
01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:09.470
the women like it.
Does that work with Asian guys?

1029
01:00:09.471 --> 01:00:12.110
If you come over here and you have an accent with Asian women,

1030
01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.600
I have no fucking idea anyways.
However,

1031
01:00:14.601 --> 01:00:17.360
the biggest problem is they are boring.

1032
01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:23.200
Most spend their whole life studying until they are 26 then they work insane

1033
01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:28.301
hours at work and they live with their parents until they get married.

1034
01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:32.960
Not to mention that my sense of humor can be totally lost on someone who speaks

1035
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:35.330
English as a second or third language.
Shamble Dude,

1036
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.430
you're on the other side of the world.
Things are going to be different here.

1037
01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:39.710
I seem to be stuck between beautiful,

1038
01:00:39.711 --> 01:00:43.460
boring Asian girls and the typical basic white girl.

1039
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:48.380
I'd apologize for this sweeping generalizations,
but you do it all the time.

1040
01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:53.690
Uh,
do I do it like that?
What a fucking cunt can you do?

1041
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.690
Can you own your continuous and not fucking get yet?

1042
01:00:56.810 --> 01:01:01.550
You had fucking twats stench on me.
Uh,
I know I'm a fucking moron.

1043
01:01:01.551 --> 01:01:03.170
I don't know.
You don't point it out.

1044
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:07.370
Oh boohoo I'm on the other side of the world.
Fucking a bunch of hot Asian girls.

1045
01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.990
Uh,
you got a girl that was way too good for you,

1046
01:01:11.991 --> 01:01:15.290
so I'd love to hear what you think.
All right.
I agree with that.
Thanks.

1047
01:01:15.291 --> 01:01:19.190
And Go have a wonderful day.
I live in Korea and I love it.

1048
01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:24.440
Didn't want to talk shit.
Um,
well dude,

1049
01:01:24.441 --> 01:01:27.590
you're either going to have to accept that those are your options or move out of

1050
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:30.710
there.
I don't know what to tell you.
Um,

1051
01:01:31.490 --> 01:01:35.810
do you want the entire country to change because you're there?

1052
01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:36.863
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1053
01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:42.290
<v 3>It sounds like there's a bunch of smart women over there that they sound like</v>

1054
01:01:42.291 --> 01:01:43.124
they're perfect,

1055
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:45.943
<v 0>right?</v>

1056
01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:50.940
<v 3>They're educated,
they're working their asses off the fucking there,</v>

1057
01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:55.360
the bunch of animals in the rack.
Well,
what is the problem?

1058
01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.660
Um,
I dunno.
I Dunno.

1059
01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:03.510
I would start dating a prostitute over there if you want a little more

1060
01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:07.440
excitement.
Um,
sounds like you live in the dream over there,
buddy.

1061
01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.660
I,
if I was you,
I would try to appreciate what you have.
I mean,
I don't,

1062
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.261
I mean,

1063
01:02:16.261 --> 01:02:20.100
that's kind of perfect when she fucking blows your mind in bed and goes off and

1064
01:02:20.101 --> 01:02:22.370
goes studies and then you can sit down and watch the game.

1065
01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.473
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1066
01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:29.100
<v 3>I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know exactly what else you want from a butter.</v>

1067
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:31.050
All the problems to have in the world.

1068
01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.620
Certainly after all the problems that I learned in the world in the first

1069
01:02:34.621 --> 01:02:37.650
fucking seven minutes of that Falcons game.
I don't,

1070
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:40.670
I really don't have any fucking sympathy for you.
Alright.

1071
01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:45.150
Heckled by veteran comedian is fucking hilarious.
Hello,
Billy.

1072
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:48.830
Bald for skin.
Um,
hey,

1073
01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:50.700
after about two months ago,

1074
01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:53.670
I don't know if they make it fun of my Dick there or what am I head looks like,

1075
01:02:53.671 --> 01:02:54.990
but uh,
either way.
It's funny,

1076
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:59.610
about two months ago I gave the open mic night a try.
Oh,

1077
01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:02.180
he heckled you was an open miker that's,
that's fucking not good.

1078
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:06.150
I prepared for it for awhile and finally worked up the nerve to do it.

1079
01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:11.040
Had material,
add some semblance,
semblance of a plan to attempt.

1080
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:14.850
I get about four minutes into it and I'm getting labs.

1081
01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:20.700
Not a lot,
but some and a bunch of smiles.
All right,
good for you.
Plus seeing the,

1082
01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.170
even the beginning of all,
it's about,

1083
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.510
it's just having the balls to go up there when they call your name.

1084
01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:27.540
It has nothing to do with how well you do anyways,

1085
01:03:27.541 --> 01:03:31.620
so I was confident and busted out a joke that was a little racy,

1086
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:35.490
but nothing means spirited.
Knowing laughed.
Oh well I moved on.

1087
01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:40.760
A few days go by and I'm getting hate on Facebook for the joke from a comedian

1088
01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:46.280
that has been working the scene for longer than I've been alive.
Oh,

1089
01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.890
Jesus.
Jesus.
Really?

1090
01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:51.870
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1091
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:55.210
<v 3>Comic con comic violence.
Ah,
yeah.
Hate to see it.</v>

1092
01:03:56.890 --> 01:03:58.660
I take what he says,
his wisdom.

1093
01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.040
Benny tells me that you shouldn't ever say anything on stage.

1094
01:04:03.370 --> 01:04:04.630
You don't believe in,

1095
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:10.600
uh,
wait a minute.
Wait.
Now wait a minute.

1096
01:04:10.601 --> 01:04:12.160
You're saying you're getting hate on Facebook.

1097
01:04:12.161 --> 01:04:14.560
This guy is basically given you advice

1098
01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:21.800
and being heckled.
Heckled is your,
it's interrupting a live performance.

1099
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:24.110
You don't get heckled on Facebook.

1100
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:25.763
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1101
01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.290
<v 3>I hate when they see the comedian heckled the crowd.</v>

1102
01:04:28.291 --> 01:04:32.950
The crowd is not giving a performance.
Uh,
I,

1103
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.520
I call bullshit on that and always thought as a comedian,

1104
01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:41.260
you get to push the envelope some because when it's all said and done,

1105
01:04:41.530 --> 01:04:46.000
as long as you weren't hateful for the sake of,
hey,
you're good anyways.

1106
01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:49.750
I've haven't had the nerve to go back on stage out of the fear of getting

1107
01:04:49.751 --> 01:04:54.550
trashed on Facebook anyways.
Love the podcast.
Hope you come to Memphis soon

1108
01:04:56.090 --> 01:04:59.360
and go make love to yourself.
Also.
I can't get hard.

1109
01:04:59.361 --> 01:05:03.080
Please fix this with magic.
Um,

1110
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:08.600
all right.
Uh,
first of all,
I don't know what you said.

1111
01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:13.010
I'd have to know the joke that you said.
I know how you feel about the joke.

1112
01:05:13.011 --> 01:05:15.020
I know all the other comic feels about the joke,

1113
01:05:15.170 --> 01:05:17.890
but it just seems like the comic has given you advice there.

1114
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:22.200
I don't know how hard the person went.
Um,

1115
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:24.340
personally I wouldn't do that.

1116
01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:28.580
<v 4>MMM.</v>

1117
01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:32.210
<v 3>But you sound way more seasoned than someone who just did it for the first time.</v>

1118
01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:33.600
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1119
01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.620
<v 3>Wait a minute.
I opened my,
I gave up my could try appeared.</v>

1120
01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.160
I prepared for it for awhile,
Yada,
Yada,
Yada.

1121
01:05:40.161 --> 01:05:42.110
I get my phone four minutes into it

1122
01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.020
getting laughs and then he did the joke that didn't go well.
I mean,

1123
01:05:48.021 --> 01:05:52.860
I don't know dude.
I don't,
I don't know.
I,
I mean,

1124
01:05:52.861 --> 01:05:54.060
I wouldn't say that to a,

1125
01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:58.590
to an open miker I also don't know what you said and it doesn't sound,

1126
01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:03.600
it just sounds like he's giving you a device.
Uh,
I can tell you this right now.

1127
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:07.590
If you're going to let one fucking person in some bullshit on Facebook,

1128
01:06:10.030 --> 01:06:12.490
um,
make you not go back on stage then,

1129
01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:17.830
then this guy did you a favor because you gotta be weights.

1130
01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:21.970
You gotta be way tougher than that because if you think this is the first

1131
01:06:21.971 --> 01:06:24.190
fucking time,
like it's just,
you know,

1132
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:28.660
when I was sitting in that motel when we were shooting the other day,

1133
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:32.050
I walked in and I just laughed.
I was like,
all these places smelled the same.

1134
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:33.630
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1135
01:06:33.630 --> 01:06:38.280
<v 3>And what are the actors asked me?
He goes,
what's the worst Gig you've ever had?</v>

1136
01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:41.550
And I thought about it for a second and then I just laughed and I was just like,

1137
01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:44.280
that is just too big a subject

1138
01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.710
for me to pick any one gig.
I mean,

1139
01:06:49.711 --> 01:06:51.870
you literally have to go like,

1140
01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:54.230
<v 4>mmm,</v>

1141
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:56.150
<v 3>worst gig without a microphone.</v>

1142
01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.770
Worst Gig in a cafeteria where they didn't know that there was a show were some

1143
01:07:01.140 --> 01:07:06.100
nooner.
Yeah,
worse.
Uh,
you know,

1144
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:10.000
am I going to get the shit kicked out of me?
Worst Gig or I didn't get paid.

1145
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.680
Worst gig where the fucking middle lap was a former headliner and he did 45 to

1146
01:07:14.681 --> 01:07:17.170
an hour in front of me and tried to burn out the crowd.

1147
01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:22.750
You got white crowds,
you got black crowds,
you got college crowds,

1148
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:26.260
cruise ships.
I mean,
it's just,

1149
01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:28.610
<v 4>it's just,</v>

1150
01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:33.040
<v 3>and I,
you know what's funny is I haven't forgot any of them,</v>

1151
01:07:33.041 --> 01:07:35.110
but I can't remember any of them either.

1152
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:40.420
They just all are this giant ball of any,

1153
01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:44.910
um,
hate and humiliation
and um,

1154
01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:46.063
<v 0>yeah,</v>

1155
01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:49.820
<v 3>that's what you're signing up for.
And I'm not trying to discourage you here.</v>

1156
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:50.710
And what it is,

1157
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:55.710
is what you need right now rather than writing to me is you need to go to more

1158
01:07:56.441 --> 01:07:59.830
open mikes and what's going to happen is you're going to get comedian friends

1159
01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:04.090
from your graduation class,
right?

1160
01:08:04.900 --> 01:08:09.250
And what you do,
how you get through all of that was I used to call up,

1161
01:08:10.680 --> 01:08:11.513
<v 4>you know</v>

1162
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:14.590
<v 3>the comics that I started out with,
like I [inaudible].</v>

1163
01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:18.860
I remember having some brutal show in front of a bunch of cops when he started

1164
01:08:18.861 --> 01:08:23.120
up any aid his ball so bad that he called me up

1165
01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:26.110
and through talking to me,

1166
01:08:26.111 --> 01:08:31.111
he was able to laugh about it and then I was laughing about it and you know,

1167
01:08:31.780 --> 01:08:36.690
and when I bond all the fucking time,
I would call him up.
You tell the stories.

1168
01:08:36.691 --> 01:08:40.620
Then what becomes is then other comics try to top your story about what the

1169
01:08:40.621 --> 01:08:45.500
worst gig that they ever fucking had.
And that's what it just starts to be.

1170
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:46.830
Kind of as you're going through it,

1171
01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.960
you just get seasoned and then you're just all literally on stage going through

1172
01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:54.750
some of the worst humiliation of your life while thinking,

1173
01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:58.470
I can't wait to tell this to,
uh,
my buddy when I get home or whatever.
I mean,

1174
01:08:58.471 --> 01:09:01.830
just don't let this fucking guy discourage you.

1175
01:09:02.130 --> 01:09:03.480
Fucking shake it off.

1176
01:09:04.650 --> 01:09:04.870
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1177
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:08.050
<v 3>You don't,
you gotta be like a relief pitcher.
You fucking gave up all I'm Ron,</v>

1178
01:09:08.170 --> 01:09:10.180
give me another ball.
I'm going to get,
I'm gonna if I'm coming right back.

1179
01:09:10.181 --> 01:09:13.120
What they hate,
you gotta be like that.
Um,

1180
01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:17.650
I'm not saying that comic is right or wrong.
Um,

1181
01:09:18.670 --> 01:09:19.750
cause I don't know what you said.

1182
01:09:20.230 --> 01:09:23.520
He evidently felt it was serious enough to reach out to you on Facebook,
but,
uh,

1183
01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.180
I,
I,
it's not something I would've done.

1184
01:09:25.660 --> 01:09:30.160
I don't try to be the comedy fucking cop here.
Um,
all right,

1185
01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:35.080
so good luck with you,
sir.
All right.
Just Joe Barton.

1186
01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:39.510
Nick says,
take your balls out of your purse and fucking get back on stage.

1187
01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:44.610
All right.
Good luck to you.
All right.
Caught shoplifting.

1188
01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:50.700
Dear bill
building the Saurus rex.

1189
01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:51.630
Okay.
Uh,

1190
01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:55.860
my wife and I have been together for 13 years and married for about half that

1191
01:09:55.861 --> 01:10:00.600
time.
Basically,
we are best friends with a romantic relationship.
Congratulations.

1192
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:03.390
Things have recently started getting even better for us.

1193
01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:08.520
All of a sudden I've noticed all these extra knickknacks around the house.
Um,

1194
01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:12.840
I got my first job at a as a university professor and she got a job in

1195
01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:17.250
administration at the same university.
Oh my God.
She shoplifting.

1196
01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:21.210
I believe our relationship is as strong as it is because I can trust her with my

1197
01:10:21.211 --> 01:10:22.044
life.

1198
01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:27.300
I think that just changed last night after getting home from the mall,

1199
01:10:27.301 --> 01:10:30.030
I found her taking makeup out of her purse,

1200
01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:35.100
the same makeup that she refused to buy because it was too expensive.

1201
01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:39.240
Hurry,
action told me I wasn't supposed to see that she had it.

1202
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:42.360
I confronted her about the potential shoplifting.

1203
01:10:44.090 --> 01:10:47.390
The conf confrontation resulted in a long argument,

1204
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:52.750
one that swung from denial to anger at me crying and then back to anger.

1205
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:56.690
She could never prove that she paid for it,

1206
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:59.600
giving her reaction and the circumstances.

1207
01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:03.410
I am as confident as one could be that she shoplifted absolutely.

1208
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:05.450
She would have just produced the receipt.

1209
01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:07.540
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1210
01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:12.340
<v 3>Trust me.
Don't trust is important to me.
Bill.
Um,</v>

1211
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:16.170
my wife is beautiful and she's constantly approached by men.

1212
01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:20.340
I need to trust that she will stay loyal to our relationship,
her shoplifting.

1213
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:25.610
And then so brazenly lying to me about it puts everything into doubt for me.

1214
01:11:26.490 --> 01:11:28.110
How is this risk worth

1215
01:11:30.490 --> 01:11:35.410
her career or our relationship is shoplifting,
not that big a deal.

1216
01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:40.330
Could this also increase the likelihood that she is dishonest and other areas of

1217
01:11:40.331 --> 01:11:45.280
our relationship?
Am I crazy?
I will be listening to your advice by the way.

1218
01:11:45.281 --> 01:11:49.810
You killed it in Toronto.
Thank you.
Um,

1219
01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:55.860
ah dude.
I mean I don't know her.
I think it's all of those things.
I think it

1220
01:11:57.460 --> 01:12:00.820
might not be that big a deal or it could be the tip of an iceberg.

1221
01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:03.910
I have no idea.
I have no idea.

1222
01:12:03.911 --> 01:12:07.780
But this is like the beginning of a great movie and I'm sorry that you're

1223
01:12:07.781 --> 01:12:12.460
starring in it.
Like,

1224
01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:16.300
this is like some Alfred Hitchcock Shit like rear window,

1225
01:12:16.301 --> 01:12:21.301
except you're in the apartment with the murderer potentially or

1226
01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:22.990
<v 0>okay.</v>

1227
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:27.790
<v 3>You know,
it just sort of ends like that war of the worlds anticlimactic.</v>

1228
01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:33.500
<v 4>Um,
I don't know.
But</v>

1229
01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:40.330
<v 3>yeah,
like do you pursue it?
Do you pursue it?</v>

1230
01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:43.780
Because I'm always about like when you feel shit like that,

1231
01:12:43.781 --> 01:12:48.100
sit down with them and just say,
look,
I'm not saying you're a bad person.

1232
01:12:48.101 --> 01:12:51.310
I'm just saying how what you did make makes me feel

1233
01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:56.970
all right.
And then tell her everything that you just said to me.

1234
01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:03.260
<v 4>Um,
however,</v>

1235
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:09.220
<v 3>you could also be pulling some threads here and the whole thing comes crashing.</v>

1236
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:12.270
I don't fuck,
you know what do you know what I would do?
Dude?
Fuck this.

1237
01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.093
You know something.

1238
01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:18.960
This is what women do when they're feeling something.
They fucking,

1239
01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:23.580
they sit you down.
Fuck her tears,

1240
01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:27.510
fucker,
anger.
Fuck this.
You've got to validate what you're feeling.

1241
01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:32.090
You see all like,
this is what men do when they get a relationship.
He had tea.

1242
01:13:32.091 --> 01:13:36.970
You treat your wife,
your,
your,
your girlfriend,
like a ticking time bomb

1243
01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:42.840
because they so much.
This guy's right.

1244
01:13:42.841 --> 01:13:46.140
I do generalize a lot on the fucking podcast on it.
They fucking,

1245
01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:52.850
they control the relationship with their emotions and then it's all subtly tied

1246
01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:59.440
to special teams,
which is your fucking,
you know,

1247
01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:04.770
sex life.
And if they're in a fucking bad mood about you,

1248
01:14:04.771 --> 01:14:07.410
you're not gonna have any fucking sex.
It's fucking ridiculous.

1249
01:14:07.411 --> 01:14:10.650
But that's how it works.
So,
but fuck that dude.

1250
01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.330
Like this is what you're feeling and all of that shit.

1251
01:14:13.470 --> 01:14:17.770
You're supposed to sit on it.
Fuck that.
What do you think your wife would do?

1252
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:19.450
You don't think she would do that?

1253
01:14:19.451 --> 01:14:22.180
You don't think she would start snooping on your Facebook?
I don't know.

1254
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:25.780
I'm not saying don't fucking snoop on the Facebook.
What I'm saying is,

1255
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:28.510
is what you should do is you should tell her,

1256
01:14:29.530 --> 01:14:29.810
<v 0>okay.</v>

1257
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:32.990
<v 3>I Dunno what the what to do here.
If you fucking do a stakeout,</v>

1258
01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:36.590
if you start fucking,
oh man,
that's creepy.

1259
01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:38.490
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1260
01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:41.670
<v 3>Because then if you're fucking wrong,
no,
don't do that.</v>

1261
01:14:41.850 --> 01:14:44.340
Cause then if you fucking wrong and she catches you spying on her,

1262
01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:48.660
then then she has the upper and then you become wrong because you caught her

1263
01:14:48.661 --> 01:14:52.980
shoplifting.
Yeah,
I would sit her down and just say,
listen,

1264
01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:57.940
okay,
I'm not saying you're,
you're a bad person or anything.

1265
01:14:57.970 --> 01:15:02.770
I'm just telling you how I feel
seeing you

1266
01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:09.270
shoplift and then lie to me about it and do it.
If she starts crying,

1267
01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:11.820
she gets angry.
Fuck that.

1268
01:15:11.850 --> 01:15:16.620
She's being a fucking baby and she's manipulating it and then I would also sit

1269
01:15:16.621 --> 01:15:21.360
there and I,
if she does that again,
I would say and now your inability.

1270
01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.410
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1271
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:27.740
<v 3>In a mature way to handle what it is that I'm saying to you</v>

1272
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:35.290
and the letter get his fucking angry she wants to get and it's like be like

1273
01:15:36.081 --> 01:15:40.680
you're getting angry at me.
I didn't steal anything.
I didn't lie about it.

1274
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:44.550
Okay.
I'm just letting you know what the,

1275
01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:47.700
how this is making me feel and we can totally get past this.

1276
01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.150
If you're going to be an adult about this and sit down,

1277
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:54.830
own up to what you did and talk me through this all,

1278
01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:59.400
is she going to get fucking mad at you?
And you know what?
Fuck her.
Okay.

1279
01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.790
Because this is what they'll,
this is exact fucking thing that she do to you.

1280
01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:07.020
And I by no means fucking,
uh,

1281
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:11.700
super imposing all the fucking issues I have with women on you in your

1282
01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:14.910
relationship.
I absolutely am,
but that's what the fuck I would do.

1283
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:17.190
And you know something.
What else do you want from me?

1284
01:16:17.191 --> 01:16:19.650
That's all I can do is tell you what the fuck I would do that.

1285
01:16:19.651 --> 01:16:22.530
That is what I would do.
All right?

1286
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:26.670
It wasn't fair for her to put you in that position.

1287
01:16:27.570 --> 01:16:30.780
And now for you to sit there walking around carrying this fucking stress.

1288
01:16:31.230 --> 01:16:34.890
So I would address it with her.
All right,
there you go.

1289
01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:39.990
That is the podcast and hour and 20 minutes.
Jesus,
you know,

1290
01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:41.880
I should do these once a month.

1291
01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.410
the Billy red rag podcast,
you know,
once a month.

1292
01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.540
I'm just going through my cycle.

1293
01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:52.880
There was a lot of fucking bitch moaning and complaining on this one.
But,
uh,

1294
01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:58.020
I just feel like for me.
All right,
go fuck yourselves.

1295
01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:02.820
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
Alrighty.
That's it.

1297
01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:07.590

1298
01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.450
I saw sue bond was in fucking net play and God damn grade,

1299
01:17:11.451 --> 01:17:16.160
He was in our farm system as pks brother.

And the fans are going crazy.
It's so awesome.

1301
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:25.370
Vegas is going to be a huge goddamn head and I can't wait to go to a game out

1302
01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:29.240
there and their colors in or about their colors,
but I actually like that logo.

1303
01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.240
I didn't notice that.
Uh,
you know,

1304
01:17:32.241 --> 01:17:34.970

I think that's kind of cool.

1305
01:17:36.190 --> 01:17:37.280
Fay Gus night helmet.

1306
01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:40.420
