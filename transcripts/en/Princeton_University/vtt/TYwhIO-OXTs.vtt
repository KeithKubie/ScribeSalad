00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:11.200
(music)

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.620
Jeff Bezos:
My name is Jeff Bezos.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.244 position:84%
Jeff Bezos:
I studied electrical engineering and computer science,

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:23.270 position:83%
Jeff Bezos:
graduated in 1986 from Princeton, and my current job,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.300 position:59%
Jeff Bezos:
I'm the founder and CEO of Amazon.com.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.190 position:67%
Jeff Bezos:
The Kindle is a wireless electronic reader.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.242 position:86%
Jeff Bezos:
We started working on it more than three years ago now,

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:35.900 position:73%
Jeff Bezos:
more than, probably, almost five years ago now.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.780 position:88%
Jeff Bezos:
The idea is to take the key features of a physical book,

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.330 position:59%
Jeff Bezos:
capture those and then go beyond that.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.407 position:81%
Jeff Bezos:
The number one feature of a physical book is that it

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:49.640
Jeff Bezos:
disappears while you're reading it.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.202 position:84%
Jeff Bezos:
You're not thinking about the ink and the glue and the

00:00:52.202 --> 00:00:53.460
Jeff Bezos:
stitching and the paper.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.118 position:91%
Jeff Bezos:
You're entering the author's world and the physical object

00:00:57.118 --> 00:01:00.060 position:69%
Jeff Bezos:
just goes away. And that's what we wanted to

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.433 position:81%
Jeff Bezos:
achieve with Kindle, to have a device so simple that

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:07.000 position:94%
Jeff Bezos:
it too would disappear and let you enter the author's world.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.164 position:80%
Jeff Bezos:
Failure is an essential component of innovation and

00:01:12.164 --> 00:01:15.135 position:66%
Jeff Bezos:
invention. If you know it's going to work,

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:16.590
Jeff Bezos:
it's not an experiment.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.104 position:84%
Jeff Bezos:
And so if you want to invent, if you want to innovate,

00:01:20.104 --> 00:01:22.689 position:58%
Jeff Bezos:
failure is part and parcel with that.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.000
Jeff Bezos:
There is no escape from that.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.929 position:89%
Jeff Bezos:
If I were to go back in time and give myself one piece of

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:38.676 position:91%
Jeff Bezos:
advice as an undergraduate it would be: Take pride in your

00:01:38.676 --> 00:01:45.140 position:73%
Jeff Bezos:
decisions and hard work, but not in your gifts.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.170
Jeff Bezos:
Celebrate your gifts.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.569
Jeff Bezos:
Enjoy them.

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.599
Jeff Bezos:
But don't take pride in them.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:57.290 position:67%
Jeff Bezos:
Take pride in your decisions and hard work.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.896 position:88%
Jeff Bezos:
My best memory of Princeton is finishing problem sets in

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:04.659
Jeff Bezos:
partial differential equations.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.872 position:94%
Jeff Bezos:
And my worst memory of Princeton is starting my problem sets

00:02:09.872 --> 00:02:13.830 position:70%
Jeff Bezos:
in partial differential equations. (laughter)

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.938 position:67%
Jeff Bezos:
For anybody who is starting -- for anybody,

00:02:15.938 --> 00:02:18.670 position:98%
Jeff Bezos:
it's their freshman week, and they are starting at Princeton --

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.258 position:92%
Jeff Bezos:
I think the advice as to what to focus on is pretty simple,

00:02:22.258 --> 00:02:25.316 position:89%
Jeff Bezos:
which is to figure out -- which is not always easy -- but

00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:28.169 position:84%
Jeff Bezos:
try to figure out what you're genuinely interested in.

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.808 position:95%
Jeff Bezos:
And then pursue those things. Alternative techniques might be

00:02:30.808 --> 00:02:33.751 position:86%
Jeff Bezos:
to try to figure out what you think is going to be most

00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:36.413 position:69%
Jeff Bezos:
lucrative. And I think those techniques tend

00:02:36.413 --> 00:02:41.250 position:95%
Jeff Bezos:
not to work. It's very, very difficult to chase after a wave.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.152 position:80%
Jeff Bezos:
What's better is to plant yourself in the middle of

00:02:45.152 --> 00:02:49.759 position:94%
Jeff Bezos:
something that you genuinely love and then wait for the wave

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:51.400
Jeff Bezos:
to come find you.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:05.000
(music)

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.200 position:67%
Jeff Bezos:
That just makes the video better, you guys.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.300 position:97%
Jeff Bezos:
You realize that, right, if there's a little bit of laugther that you can't quite cut out.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.400 position:98%
Jeff Bezos:
It's like the "Today Show," and the cameramen can't help but laugh.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.000 position:58%
Mike Wood:
And then the boom drops in the frame.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Jeff Bezos:
(laughter)
