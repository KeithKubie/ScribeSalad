00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.299
Some of you guys don't know this about me,
but I'm fluent in Spanish, obviously English,

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.900
and now even whale!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.540
We’ve long known that whales talk to each
other.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.010
They relay messages to one another through
acoustic signals that come in the form of

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.270
clicks, whistles, and calls.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.790
And the variations of these communicate different
messages - much like in human language we

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.790
use different words to make up sentences.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.700
But, new research shows that some whale talk
may be even more complex than we originally

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.700
thought.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.000
First off, whales exhibit vocal learning-
something found in only a small number of

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.340
species like
birds, bats, elephants, dolphins, and some

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.329
primates . Nope, sorry.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.420
Your dog doesn’t fall in this category.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.000
While dogs may bark to communicate, the reason
this is not considered vocal learning is because

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.399
dogs cannot manipulate their bark sounds or
learn new barks via imitation and modification.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.670
But whales can.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.980
They can learn and replicate new sounds they
encounter from other whales... basically,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.470
whales can learn new words.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.389
This ability to manipulate sound and learn
from others has actually made whale language

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:10.729
differ in different parts of the world . Like
regional dialects . The dialects are made

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.170
up of codas, which are specific sets of clicks
with varying pauses in between- that communicate

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.200
messages.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.229
And these codas vary based on where the whales
are from and who they hang out with - which

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.689
researchers suggest marks cultural acquisition
. These codas seem to be passed down in communities

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.029
and altogether make up a specific form of
language.

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:35.609
In a recent study published in Royal Society
Open Science, researchers recorded the vocalizations

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:41.139
of nine different Caribbean sperm whale groups
over the course of six years . By analyzing

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:45.070
thousandsof coda recordings, the researchers
identified 21 unique codas.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.540
One of these - the 1+1+3 coda - was produced
in exactly the same way by all nine groups

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.540
in the Caribbean.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.380
But, this is not the case for other sperm
whales.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.540
Sperm whales outside of the Caribbean produce
different codas.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.139
So, the researchers suggest that this 1+1+3
coda acts as a regional dialect.

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:09.069
Orcas, are another whale species with similarly
rich vocalizations.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.599
As reported in an article published in Animal
Behavior, when researchers studied four different

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.730
populations of orcas across the North Pacific
Ocean, they found that each community within

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.829
a specific geographic region produced a set
of matched vocalizations.

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.239
But, these sets were slightly different from
one another.

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.200
Though they had the same general structure,
the variations in how these sets were produced

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.370
could differentiate whales from different
families and regions.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.519
If we’re talking people terms - this would
be close to what we consider an accent.

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:44.349
Similar to how humans can sort of tell if
a person is from the U.K. versus the US when

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.120
they both speak English.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.500
And one study even found that orcas can learn
to speak dophin!

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.909
In a study published in the Journal of Acoustical
America, when ten orcas in captivity were

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.049
split up to be housed either with other orcas
or with bottlenose dolphins, researchers noted

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.819
that the three whales that were with dolphins
began to vocalize using more whistles and

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.780
clicks, just like their new friends.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.810
But the seven other whales who were housed
with their same kind did not.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.750
That they can pick out and imitate other cetaceans’
patterns is incredible!

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.159
But we’re just beginning to understand the
complexity of whales’ vocal learning, and

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.209
a lot of our current knowledge on dialects
and accents relies on recent studies with

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.810
sperm whales and orcas.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.329
So more research is needed to really get how
and what these guys are saying.

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.540
But if you wanna know more about their dolphin
friends, and how they give each other names

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:33.519
get the scoop here
