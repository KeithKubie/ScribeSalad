Perfect, thanks Dan. 
Since he's turned you

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:05.169
into a UI expert now, 
where should we define

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:09.039
this list item layout? 
If you're thinking the layout folder,

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.481
under the resources directory, 
then you are correct.

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.115
Here you can create 
a new layout resource file

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:19.803
called list item forecast. 
Inside that file, define a text view

00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:24.657
as the root view, then assign it 
an ID list item forecast text view.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.815
Give it a minimum height, 
so that the list item isn't too short

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:31.692
for tapping on and vertically center 
the text within that item.

00:00:31.692 --> 00:00:35.421
Go ahead and try it yourself now. 
And check the box when you're done.
