00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:01.780
 From the table here we see that for given values ​​of n, 

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.580
 when n is 1, f of n is 12, 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.482
 when n is 2, f of n is 5, 

00:00:06.482 --> 00:00:08.812
 and when n is 3, f of n is minus 2, 

00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:10.476
 when n is 4, f of n is minus 9. 

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:12.681
 One way to look at this is, 

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:15.445
 that this function f defines a given sequence, 

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:19.392
 where the first member of the row is 12. 

00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:22.712
 The second article in this row is 5. 

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:25.939
 The third member of the row is minus 2. 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.097
 The fourth item in the row is minus 9. 

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:30.514
 As she goes on. 

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:33.834
 And you may notice that this is an arithmetic progression. 

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.411
 We start with 12 and then the next member ... 

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.942
 What did we do to get it? We took out 7. 

00:00:38.942 --> 00:00:41.860
 Now, to get from the second third member ... 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.915
 What are we doing? We remove 7. 

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:47.185
 Each member is smaller with 7 of the previous one. 

00:00:47.185 --> 00:00:50.440
 Having this in mind, see if you can define this function from n. 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.358
 Whether you can define it by a formula. 

00:00:55.358 --> 00:00:57.958
 Find Function Definition. 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.720
 You have to find out how equal f is from n, so 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.620
 if you enter here n, give you the corresponding f of n. 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.180
 Let's think a little. 

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.679
 We can get it starting with ... 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.815
 The first member will be 12. 

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:21.115
 Then we'll get 7. 

00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:25.287
 How many times will we get 7? 

00:01:25.287 --> 00:01:28.608
 For the first member we draw 7 zero times. 

00:01:28.608 --> 00:01:29.745
 And that's how we get only 12. 

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:32.996
 For the second member we subtract 7 once. 

00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:37.925
 For the third member, we take out seven times. One, twice. 

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:41.657
 For the fourth article we subtract 7 times three times. 

00:01:41.657 --> 00:01:44.373
 It seems that no matter who we are, 

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:47.345
 subtract 7 n minus 1 times, 

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:52.520
 we subtract 7 as many times as the member's number minus 1. 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.509
 So this is n minus 1. 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.028
 Let's check whether this is true. 

00:01:57.028 --> 00:02:00.905
 So, f of 1 will be 12 minus 7, 

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:02.461
 1 minus 1, this is 0. 

00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:04.365
 All this will be just 12. 

00:02:04.365 --> 00:02:08.637
 f of 2 will be 12 minus 7 by 2 minus 1. 

00:02:08.637 --> 00:02:12.236
 We will have 12 minus 7 by 1. 

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:15.556
 We will only pull out 7 once, which is exactly the case. 

00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:17.785
 We started at 12 and took out 7 once. 

00:02:17.785 --> 00:02:20.641
 f of 3, you can continue to check. 

00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.660
 12 minus, here we have to pull out 7 twice. 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.841
 We see that 3 minus 1 is 2 times. 

00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.000
 So we'll pull out seven times. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.369
 So it seems right. 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.412
 We have set the feature open. 

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:37.150
 We have determined f for this arithmetic progression. 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.170
 Let's figure out another example. 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.579
 In this case, we already have some definitions of the function here. 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.643
 You have the row, it is shown in this table. 

00:02:48.643 --> 00:02:51.592
 You can view it so that the first member is minus 100. 

00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:54.541
 The next article is minus 50, the next member is 0, 

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.143
 the next article is 50. 

00:02:56.143 --> 00:02:59.022
 It is quite clear that this is also an arithmetical progression. 

00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:04.022
 We start at minus 100 and then we add 50. 

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:07.747
 Then we add another 50, 

00:03:07.747 --> 00:03:10.437
 and then add 50 more. 

00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:12.118
 So every member is 50 more than the previous one. 

00:03:12.118 --> 00:03:14.200
 Now pause the video and think 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.619
 which of these definitions for the f function are true. 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:20.012
 There may be more than one true. 

00:03:21.862 --> 00:03:23.542
 Okay, let's think. 

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:26.212
 This definition here, 

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:27.232
 one way to look at it, 

00:03:27.232 --> 00:03:30.186
 is to say that I start from minus 100. 

00:03:30.186 --> 00:03:33.109
 And I will add 50, n minus 1 times. 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.814
 Does that make sense? 

00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:38.542
 For the first article, if we start from minus 100, 

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:40.260
 we will not add 50, 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.884
 we will add 50 zero times and that's right. 

00:03:42.884 --> 00:03:45.925
 Because 1 minus 1 will be 0. 

00:03:45.925 --> 00:03:48.154
 So this is true for n equal to 1. 

00:03:48.154 --> 00:03:50.755
 Let's see, for n n equal to 2 we start from minus 100, 

00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:55.144
 we need to add 50 once. 

00:03:56.464 --> 00:03:59.880
 this here will be 1 because 2 minus 1 is 1! 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.692
 Add 50. 

00:04:00.692 --> 00:04:02.520
 No matter what number we have, no matter how many n, 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.310
 we add 50 as many times as the member's number minus 1. 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.539
 So here we add 50 twice. 

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.372
 When n is 4, we add 50 three times. 

00:04:12.372 --> 00:04:14.253
 So that's true. 

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:16.830
 When n is 4, we add 50 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.989
 4 minus 1, three times. 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.844
 Minus 100 plus 50 at 3. 

00:04:22.844 --> 00:04:24.655
 Add 50 times three times, add 50 

00:04:24.655 --> 00:04:26.860
 1, 2, 3 times. 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.413
 Well that gives us 50. So I choose this answer. 

00:04:30.413 --> 00:04:32.038
 Now let's look at this one here. 

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:34.964
 Minus 150 plus 50n. 

00:04:35.994 --> 00:04:37.982
 Okay, that's one way to say, 

00:04:37.982 --> 00:04:41.233
 if n equals 1, we will have a minus ... 

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:43.392
 Actually let me draw a table for this answer. 

00:04:43.392 --> 00:04:46.736
 If we have n and we have f of n. 

00:04:47.816 --> 00:04:49.336
 This will be for this definition here. 

00:04:49.336 --> 00:04:54.336
 If n is 1, we will have minus 150 plus 50. 

00:04:54.886 --> 00:04:59.493
 Which is minus 100, yes, and that's the answer. 

00:04:59.493 --> 00:05:02.548
 When n is 2, we get minus 150 

00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:07.354
 plus 50 in 2, which will be ... 

00:05:07.354 --> 00:05:10.451
 This is 100 and has a minus of 150, 

00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:12.138
 it will be minus 50. 

00:05:12.138 --> 00:05:15.179
 When n is 3, this is true of course. 

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:18.792
 When n is 3, you get minus 150 

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:21.959
 plus 50 by 3, which is equal to 0. 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:22.911
 This is the answer. 

00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:24.513
 This answer here will be correct. 

00:05:24.513 --> 00:05:27.160
 But you can say, "Hey, these formulas look different." 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.041
 You can algebraically rework them 

00:05:29.041 --> 00:05:33.100
 and see that they are the same thing. 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.405
 If you take this first, 

00:05:34.405 --> 00:05:38.189
 we have minus 100 plus, let's reveal the brackets and multiply by 50, 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.926
 plus 50n minus 50. 

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:49.966
 Okay, minus 100, minus 50, that's minus 150. 

00:05:50.844 --> 00:05:52.399
 And then you have plus 50n. 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:56.717
 So these two are algebraically the same definition of the function. 

00:05:56.717 --> 00:05:58.018
 Now, what about this here? 

00:05:58.018 --> 00:06:01.060
 Minus 100 plus 50n, will this happen? 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.475
 Let's see when n equals 1, 

00:06:03.475 --> 00:06:08.304
 this would be minus 100 plus 50, which is minus 50. 

00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:09.744
 Well, it does not answer. 

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.230
 Here we have to get minus 100. 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.527
 So that's not true.
