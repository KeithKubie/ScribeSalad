00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:05,730
You are listening to
radiolab radio from W N Y s e

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,380
n p r gave this a Jad
Abumrad. This is radio lab,

3
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:17,730
the podcast. Robert is out of
town today. He's actually um,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,070
his son is getting
married. So it's just me.

5
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,120
I thought in this podcast
a and wander a little bit

6
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,360
[inaudible] generally and that should
be in front of your mouth. Okay.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,000
So I'm gonna Start with a conversation
that uh, Brooke Gladstone and I,

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,020
this is Brooke from on the media that
she and I had with my brother in law

9
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,070
Eugene. I am Eugene Thacker.

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,600
I am an author and professor at
the new school in New York City.

11
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:51,370
We talked about this very weird thing
that happened to Eugene and I asked Brooke

12
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:53,500
to join me cause I just
felt like her kind of story.

13
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,600
I've been wearing black since I was 13.

14
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,530
I just want to point out that the two of
you are head to toe in black right now.

15
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,510
Any case to set it up.

16
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:06,900
Eugene is a hard core
scholar of philosophy and he
writes these books that um,

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,330
sometimes can be a little dense. I mean,

18
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,960
he'll use words like
exegesis and radio sunation.

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,910
And so the family joke is that
he writes books for no one.

20
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,230
I think the joke started out, I
write books that nobody reads.

21
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:28,390
And then after a slow, long period
of acceptance, I started to think,

22
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:31,750
well, maybe I should write
books for no one to read.

23
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,020
And just sort of embrace that
meaning at a certain point,

24
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:37,120
if you do this kind of work, you
kind of have to ask yourself,

25
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,090
if you knew that this would not be
published, would you still write it?

26
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,790
How committed are you? And
he decided he was committed.

27
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,760
He would write it no matter what. So
the story begins a couple of years ago,

28
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,410
and I'm 2011 Eugene writes this book
called in the dust of this planet,

29
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,190
in the dust of this planet. It's
kind of a hard book to describe,

30
00:01:54,191 --> 00:01:57,640
but if you had to sum it up in a sentence,
it's a about the end of the world,

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,350
but not in the Hollywood
sense. It's darker than that.

32
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:07,750
Your hypothesis is the greatest horror
is that nothing exists and nothing

33
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,214
matters.

34
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,250
And the world that we live in that we
define in terms of humanity doesn't care

35
00:02:18,311 --> 00:02:19,144
about us.

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,250
What in philosophy is often referred
to as nihilism or pessimism that there

37
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:28,540
might not be a purpose to things or to
your life or to our existence or to the

38
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:31,300
cosmos. There might not
be an order to things.

39
00:02:31,301 --> 00:02:32,860
We might not be here for a reason.

40
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,880
This all might be purely arbitrary and
an accident that there's no inherent

41
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:38,830
meaning to anything, but
it just doesn't matter.

42
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,660
This is what Nietzsche called most
difficult thought and in the book,

43
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:46,360
Eugene traces this idea
through all of these different

44
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,250
horror movies from slasher films to sort
of more supernatural horror and also

45
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,391
music. I mean,

46
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:58,690
at one point he goes into
this deconstruction of how
different types of black

47
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:03,220
metal with this thought. I Dunno, it's,
it's something, it's a way of thinking.

48
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:07,720
I've always found really intriguing
and ironically kind of inspiring.

49
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,640
Are you a pessimist on my
better days? Are you a nihilist?

50
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,170
Not as much as I should be. Okay,

51
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:21,490
so Eugene writes this book in
2011 it is dark, it is dense.

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,550
He writes it as he says,
for no one. And as expected,

53
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,260
beyond a few philosophy types,
no one really pays attention.

54
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,300
So he keeps his head down
teaching, writing, but then

55
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,330
some things happen.

56
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,160
Hmm. 2014 ghettos in the world.

57
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,620
I saw on get, Oh man,

58
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,780
Jack Gutter and outer space to
show true detective comes along.

59
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,050
It comes to big head. And at the center
of the show is this character Russ Cole,

60
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,940
this Louisiana detective who
is one dark dude. I think human

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,480
consciousness is the tragic
misstep and evolution.

62
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,390
He goes on these rants about how
there's no order in the world,

63
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,820
how humans are just this accident.
And we have to deal with that.

64
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,460
I'd consider myself Hurria last time,

65
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,490
but in philosophical terms
on what's called a pessimist.

66
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,830
And I just remember watching it and
being like, wow, that's Eugene's wife,

67
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,170
Prima Murphy, my
sister-in-law. I was like,

68
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:24,640
this replicates so many conversations
that we've had in the car. She's like,

69
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,330
were they listening in on us? Yeah,
it was eerie. So prayma goes online,

70
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:33,040
clicks around and all of a
sudden I see this article about,

71
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,900
um, the true detective director.

72
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,480
It was an article where
actually the writer of the show,

73
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:42,800
nick a lotto was asked how did you create
that character of the nihilist police

74
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:45,920
detective? And he lists a bunch of
things he was reading at the time.

75
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,060
And included in that list was
Eugene to which I was like,

76
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,353
cool.

77
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,720
At least one person is reading the book.

78
00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,730
But I really just try to keep my head
to the ground and just keep writing,

79
00:05:00,731 --> 00:05:03,250
just doing what I'm doing. But then

80
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,840
things got weird. Okay, so
now let's pull up the um,

81
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,020
the Lucky magazine and see if I
can find it. Short time later,

82
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,620
prima is flipping through this
fashion magazine, Lucky magazine.

83
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:18,640
And there was a spread with
this actress Lily Collins,

84
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:21,130
25 year old actress I'd
never heard of. Pretty big.

85
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:25,330
Right now she's standing on a street
corner dressed up and all of this sort of

86
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,720
goth makeup and clothing.
And in the photo she is

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
wearing Eugene's book on her chest she
had on and one of the shots of sweatshirt

88
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,000
that had the cover of the book
in the dust of this planet.

89
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,710
Big letters right on her chest. And
I was just like, no way. You know,

90
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,553
it was definitely,

91
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,670
this is crazy. Like what?

92
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:51,060
She's just casually wearing
my husband's book cover.

93
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,580
I Dunno. Again, I didn't react
to you, but it was just strange.

94
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,680
Turns out a Norwegian artists
had made a painting of the book.

95
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,460
That image had gotten picked up by a
fashion label and turned into some very

96
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,620
expensive clothes. You know, I
write books for no underwriting,

97
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,990
so obviously I'm not pulling
in a lot of royalties on these,

98
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,690
but you know, Eugene says
he's not going to sue.

99
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:16,780
I'm not going to see her take any legal
action or really do anything about it

100
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,560
because he says that's not why he
writes. Okay. So that happened,

101
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,470
but then it gets weird are still

102
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:27,980
[inaudible].

103
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,450
So one day my wife Carla Murthy is online.

104
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,900
This is the day that Jay z and Beyonce
announced they're going to do this big

105
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:34,980
international tour.

106
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,270
Carla's watching the video that they
released to promote that to a sort of a

107
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:40,104
fake movie. Right?

108
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,420
This is all, I'm the one
that's all flashy guns.

109
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,940
Fire occurs.

110
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,170
Here's smart guy. It doesn't really
make a whole lot of sense. I mean,

111
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:54,260
it's some kind of Bonnie and
Clyde thing, I think. I mean,

112
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,310
they're running from someone,

113
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:59,810
you're not quite sure who Beyonce is in
a wedding dress. She's got a veil on,

114
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,500
but she shooting semiautomatic weapons
in her wedding dress, cut tech,

115
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,920
car chases, cut their money
flying everywhere, but it exactly,

116
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:11,420
37 seconds in chorus, go
back, go back, go back.

117
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,090
It's like you're making me think too fast.

118
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,310
You see Jay z turn stick a giant gun out
to his right and he is wearing Eugene's

119
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,650
book. Hey, my life

120
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,990
right there on his back in the dust
of this planet. Uh, a sound as well,

121
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,330
and make them smile. Yeah.

122
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:36,650
This is the point at which I was like,
okay, what do we make of this? I mean,

123
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,400
could it be that Eugene is no
longer writing books for no one,

124
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:45,401
that somehow he has become a conduit
for this idea that we all in that

125
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,940
subterranean way that pop music operates,
that we all are channeling right now?

126
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,680
That was my thought. Yeah.
No, I think that's, uh,

127
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:59,430
that's the question is whether this is
something particular to the moment we're

128
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:03,760
living in and Eugene, his
knee jerk reaction is,

129
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,660
I think it could have been this
cover or a million other covers. No,

130
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,850
this is just meaningless appropriation.

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,690
I don't think there's anything more
than that to me then it's just,

132
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:18,160
it looks like a cool phrase to go on a
tee shirt to put on a golf Carla in some

133
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:20,890
photo shoots. And why is it cool? Right?

134
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,680
Cause my hunch is you might be right,

135
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,520
but you also might be wrong because of
the answer that you're about to give to

136
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,700
Brooks question. It's cool
because some publicists,

137
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,960
and this was sort of the conversation I
wanted to have, and so I called Brooke,

138
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:38,980
like, what is behind all of
this nihilistic entertainment
that's everywhere.

139
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,600
Now, Brooke, for her part,

140
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,870
agreed that Eugene probably is
tapping into something, yes,

141
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,790
but is this unique to this moment?
And to that I would say, no,

142
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,630
really?

143
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,860
You don't think this says anything about
now I think there are cycles in which

144
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,850
the sense of meaninglessness

145
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,330
comes out in sharper
relief than other times,

146
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,890
but you can identify
them over and over again.

147
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,910
Yeah, nihilism goes all the way back.

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,260
Brooke actually turned us onto this
guy, Simon Critchley and the hands,

149
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,620
yon as professor at the new
school for social research.

150
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,980
Simon wrote an article that, uh,

151
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,570
basically made the argument that nihilism
is the basic credo of cool because

152
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,840
it's, it's sexy. It's interesting
and it's been that way forever. Oh,

153
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:29,130
I have to go. I've got, I've got the
best thing for you. You love this.

154
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,200
It's a Russian word, right? He said
the word really got its pop in 1862.

155
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,580
This is 150 years ago.

156
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,870
There's a novel by two you have called
fathers and songs and in the novel,

157
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:44,250
the son who's the nihilist turns to
his conservative dad and he says,

158
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,880
we base our conduct on what we
recognize as useful in these days.

159
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,650
The most useful thing we can do is to
repudiate. And so we repudiate everything.

160
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,690
The father says, everything,

161
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,790
everything with indescribable composure.

162
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,210
So that's the gnarliest
moment everything goes.

163
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,230
And Simon says, roughly
from that point on,

164
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:11,231
you see a young people glom on to
this idea again and again as a way to,

165
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:12,560
you know,

166
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,010
say no to the older generation or to
just what's happening in the world.

167
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,760
For example, after World War One you
had tens of millions of people dead.

168
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,170
This lost generation that was confused
and disgusted at what had just happened.

169
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,720
And out of that says,
Brooke, you get Dadada.

170
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,520
I want to pull up here on the computer,

171
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,660
the manifesto of Tristan Saara. He was
one of the founders of the data movement.

172
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,110
You says, Dada means nothing.

173
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,550
Everything one looks at
is false. I do not die.

174
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:46,020
That abolition of memory,
Dada abolition of archeology,

175
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,970
Dadada abolition of profits.
Dada abolition of the future.

176
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,140
And after World War II,

177
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,280
she and Simon say he had similar movements
in the 70s and 80s with the threat of

178
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:02,160
nuclear annihilation. You get
punk rock. It just keeps going.

179
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,530
Pop Culture, at least since I was a
kid, has always been deeply nihilistic,

180
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,460
you know. All right. So it's nothing new.

181
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:14,260
But when I ran Simon through the Eugene
jacket situation and then I asked him

182
00:11:14,261 --> 00:11:14,710
like,

183
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,710
is there something different about today's
nihilism versus nihilism of the past?

184
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,180
Like is there something more potent
about it? Without hesitation, he said,

185
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:28,880
I see, I see. Yes. Huh?

186
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,960
Based on one that's producer Andy Mills
who was with me during the interview.

187
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,460
Well, you know, you can,
you can get, Simon says,

188
00:11:37,461 --> 00:11:39,330
it was more of a gut feeling, uh,

189
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,820
based on this class that he taught
last year with Eugene. Oddly enough,

190
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:45,470
I didn't actually know
that they knew each other,

191
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,030
but they had taught this class together.

192
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:49,550
So the seminar that we
did in the fall last year,

193
00:11:49,551 --> 00:11:52,970
it was one of those rare seminars.
We're teaching mysticism.

194
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,460
Nobody teaches mysticism, really
obscure stockwood in desert fathers,

195
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,900
medieval female mystics.

196
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,750
This is early Christianity.
Neither of us are religious.

197
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,700
He says they started the seminar not
really expecting much by talking about how

198
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:11,110
in the fourth century, a d there was this
sissy Alexandria, this is near Egypt.

199
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,180
My Alexandra was a lot like Manhattan.
There was an offshore island.

200
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,720
It was a colony of a full
Moan Power Roman empire.

201
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,600
But it's the cease of old culture and
all learning in the ancient world.

202
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,840
A certain point in a full
century, people start to leave.

203
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,560
They start to leave
and go into the desert.

204
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,890
People wander off and they
seem to want something else.

205
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,930
The city doesn't just
doesn't do it anymore.

206
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,430
Why? It's corrupt. It's
broken. It's a, it's sinful.

207
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,590
He said crime was rampant pollution.

208
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,280
And so people just started to wander
off into the desert and live in these

209
00:12:46,281 --> 00:12:47,570
caves. And uh,

210
00:12:47,571 --> 00:12:52,040
these intense forms of ascetic practice
begin like you had these women who were

211
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,500
not educated because women
couldn't be educated,

212
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,940
who is so enraptured with Christ
that they began hosting themselves,

213
00:12:58,941 --> 00:13:01,910
throwing themselves into icy
rivers, jumping into ovens.

214
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,800
The body is something which is you're
trying to strip away in order that you can

215
00:13:06,801 --> 00:13:09,320
free the capacity for love.

216
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,910
Like that's a classic mystic idea, right?
The body is just getting in the way.

217
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,270
I want to go soul to
soul with God. Exactly,

218
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,170
but the premise of that again is that the,

219
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,990
the world is a kind of field of ruins,

220
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,760
but he says what really struck him is
that as he was talking about all this,

221
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:31,761
he would glance out at the students and
he would notice this look in their eyes.

222
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,000
I just felt that in the
room there was this,

223
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,590
this deep need was being fulfilled
by these strange mystics.

224
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,640
He said the students were just in it
in a way that almost never happens when

225
00:13:42,641 --> 00:13:45,430
you're teaching. We weren't
not saving souls, but it was,

226
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:49,360
it was hissing something really,
really deep. What exactly,

227
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,650
I mean do you think they were starting
to form the thought of wandering into the

228
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:57,190
desert so to speak? Yeah, I think there's
a sense of wishy you, you know what?

229
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:01,810
You do a succeed, walk away. You know?
That's where a lot of people are are.

230
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,830
As for what's behind it all he
says, just turn on the news.

231
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,560
A video showing the beheading of a
second American journalist has now been

232
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:11,090
verified as these experts say,

233
00:14:11,091 --> 00:14:14,370
this is turning into one of the
longest deadliest outbreaks ever.

234
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,970
The girls were gang raped
on strangled. Once again,

235
00:14:16,971 --> 00:14:19,740
it is mostly children we are
seeing brought into this hospital.

236
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,160
The world I grew up, in my
sense it was completely crazy,

237
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,550
mutually assured destruction, but it
made sense and you could understand it.

238
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,380
Simple terms that he states
was the Soviet Union.

239
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,150
We were going to be eviscerated.
That was clear, but it, you know,

240
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,150
you knew what the balance
of power was. You're,

241
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,820
you're a nostalgic for
mutually assured destruction.

242
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,400
Is that what's happening now? It
seems a much simpler world. Well,

243
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,820
you at least knew who to blame for
it. Right? Right. That's Andy. Again,

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,721
I'd be like, that's the thing.

245
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:50,721
Like you look at the Cold War and you
could see like specifically like the

246
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,600
you Americans. Yeah, the nukes. That's
right. Right. That's right. And now,

247
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,500
yeah. Who am I supposed to say? You
too. I'm saying you to everybody.

248
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,420
Carbon emissions.

249
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,100
Speaking of which today,

250
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:07,670
the world's leading climate scientists
warn it will get worse, no doubt.

251
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,940
One of the reasons for the current
gloom is that we are in the middle of an

252
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:14,180
uncomfortable shift in how
we talk about climate change.

253
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,830
Waves will be more frequent
and last longer. This is
made official when the IPC,

254
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:22,970
the intergovernmental panel on climate
change released a report where for the

255
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:27,470
first time they stopped using the
language of prevention and shifted to the

256
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:31,790
language of adaptation. In other words,
hundreds of scientists and policymakers.

257
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,820
This is the world's top organization
for assessing climate change.

258
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,600
We're now saying we can't
stop it. It's inevitable.

259
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,720
And so now we need to talk about
dealing with the mass that is now on our

260
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:43,400
doorstep. That's David Victor,

261
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:47,000
professor of international relations at
a University of California at San Diego,

262
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,650
and he is one of the
authors of the report.

263
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,680
When the IPC first began back in the
late 1980s you could imagine that people

264
00:15:54,741 --> 00:15:57,290
would take the climate
change problem seriously.

265
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,740
They would start to control emissions
and then over a period of decades,

266
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,600
climate would stop changing.

267
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,050
And instead of what's happened is people
have talked a lot about climate change,

268
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:08,510
but they haven't actually done
much to control emissions.

269
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,201
And now he says,

270
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:12,920
we're all in this strange middle ground
where we're trying to find the language

271
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,910
to say why it's important to keep
working at this while at the same time

272
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,310
admitting some degree of failure.

273
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,260
That's the kind of inevitability
that I think you see in the new, uh,

274
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:27,310
the new reports and the
reports are bending over
backwards to try and find ways

275
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,870
to be optimistic. You know,

276
00:16:28,871 --> 00:16:32,950
the report says if you put into place
all these technologies and international

277
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:36,640
agreements, we could, we could
still stop warming at two degrees.

278
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,440
My own assessment is that the kinds of
actions you'd need to do that are so

279
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:44,350
heroic that we're not going
to see them on this planet.

280
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,420
Olive, which reminded me of that
true detective moment. Okay.

281
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,680
I'd consider myself a real last time,

282
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,360
but in philosophical terms on
what's called a pessimist. Okay.

283
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,530
What's that mean? Well, a pessimists
like nihilist agree. There's no meaning,

284
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,630
they're just a little more mopey about it.

285
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,590
Less likely to do something
means I'm bad at parties. I mean,

286
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:09,130
is that where we're all headed? You know,
in a recent Wall Street Journal poll,

287
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:14,131
76% of people 18 and over weren't
confident that the future is going to be

288
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:18,640
brighter than the past. Which brings me
back to Brooks question. Why is it cool?

289
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,150
Call it nihilism, pessimism,
whatever. Shouldn't it be depressing?

290
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,930
Why would you want to put a phrase
like in the dust of this planet,

291
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,540
a phrase that deliberately
negates the person wearing it?

292
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,260
Why would you want to put it on your
chest or on your back? Yeah, yeah,

293
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,430
that's fine. Yeah,

294
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,230
and since it was Jay z jacket,

295
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,990
which was in a way the catalyst
for this whole podcast,

296
00:17:43,991 --> 00:17:47,410
we decided to talk to him for
he sorta that's coming up.

Hey, this is jazz. This is radio lab.

331
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,020
So we ended up in the flow of things, you
know, as we were trying to figure out,

332
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:56,910
like in the dust of this
planet. Why isn't that cool?

333
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,830
Why isn't it just scary and depressing?

334
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,730
We ended up like they want to talk
to me. Why? That's a good question.

335
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,000
Talking to this lady who it turns out
was the person who made the decision to

336
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:08,600
put it on Jay z's back. I
should say my name, I guess. Uh,

337
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,820
my name is June Ambrose. I've been
a costume designer for 22 years.

338
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:14,670
2023 this year, and I've
worked with everyone from

339
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:22,230
Luther Vandross to puck to Sean
tomorrow. Carey, Busta rhymes.

340
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:27,720
Mary's your blush. Alicia
keys. Dave Matthews,

341
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:31,710
pat backstreet boys. Kelly
Ripa can control do this,

342
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:36,030
but a r Kelly, go hit on Jamie Fox.

343
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,730
Please do for missy Elliot. Did
you do the missy with the balloons?

344
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,510
Yeah. That was you. Yeah.
Oh my God. And of course

345
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:51,940
Jay Z and Beyonce. That's
like culture basically. Yeah.

346
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,520
I was responsible for
something. That Nazi stuff.

347
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,410
It occurred to Andy and I
during the interview that
June has probably influenced

348
00:20:59,411 --> 00:21:03,580
the fashion sense of a significant portion
of the human beings on this planet.

349
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:07,150
And she was very clear that a
costume is more than just a costume.

350
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,640
It's like a conversation

351
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,100
without words. They
really, what she's doing,

352
00:21:13,101 --> 00:21:17,930
when she styles someone is whispering to
all the people that are gonna watch the

353
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:20,960
videos, come in contact with the
billboards, go to the concerts.

354
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,390
I don't have to talk to you,

355
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,830
but I can create this conversation with
a pair of pants and how they fall and

356
00:21:26,831 --> 00:21:28,600
how they fit in the texture
and the color. Yeah.

357
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,460
The field. He says with
Jay Z for that video,

358
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,160
she knew she needed something epic but
like effortless. I knew I wanted a bike,

359
00:21:38,161 --> 00:21:40,320
a jacket, cause there
was a motorcycle scene,

360
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:42,710
but I knew that I just couldn't give
him a black vote. I needed it to,

361
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,790
I need it to say some feel like
something. We were on the hunt,

362
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,060
her and her assistant went to
dozens of places, Tillys studios,

363
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,980
the showrooms looking at
all these leather jackets.

364
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:55,350
It's like finding a needle in
a haystack. Nothing was right,

365
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:58,950
but then they sound true into this
one place, black denim, this place,

366
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:02,280
it does sort of high end grunge.
They're flipping through the racks when

367
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:08,940
she sees it, the jacket, those
words, and that was it. I knew it.

368
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,580
I said, I need, this is what I need.
It just felt, I mean it was just

369
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,093
perfect.

370
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,290
The question was why this point? I hadn't
really told her the whole backstory,

371
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,860
so I pulled out a screen
capture from the video.

372
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,100
This is one where you see Jay z
sort of standing in the desert,

373
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,620
shot from behind in the
dust of this planet.

374
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:32,090
On his back and he's kind of pointing
this really long dirty Harry gun off to

375
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:34,910
his right. Sorta up like he's
about to shoot the sun here.

376
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,410
You think he's about to shoot the fence?

377
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,360
I printed it out cause it's just got
this like billboard quality to it right

378
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,910
here it is. I have a really cool
one in my phone too, isn't it?

379
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,960
Okay. So let's just look
at this for a second. Yeah.

380
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,510
So like why did you choose
that jacket? Um, you know,

381
00:22:51,511 --> 00:22:56,220
it's something very menacing
about it. It's almost like

382
00:22:58,670 --> 00:22:59,503
the aftermath

383
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,100
that there was something
going on that was periling.

384
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,200
It'd be end of an era. The
beginning of something new.

385
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,200
She says in the back of her head,

386
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:13,570
she was thinking about how the
music industry might be dying.

387
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,210
It's definitely in a place
where it's like, what? Now?

388
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,630
You can hear it in the music and you
know if this is the biggest tour in

389
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:23,530
history, really what now you know, and
these are the whispers that you hear,

390
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:28,760
but she says one of the loudest whispers
with super simple, just here's a guy,

391
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,340
massive pop star pack, a sovereign, he's
in the desert. It's about to go down.

392
00:23:34,341 --> 00:23:36,610
The end of the world is
literally on his back foot.

393
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,200
It was almost as if he didn't
even know that was on his back.

394
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,370
You know what I mean? It's like that
was the afterthought. Like, Oh yeah,

395
00:23:44,371 --> 00:23:45,980
the world's ending. Oops, I don't care.

396
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,850
Go on out and stuff. In other words,
he wasn't afraid. He wasn't afraid,

397
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,860
wasn't afraid. That's what, that's
what we talk about whispers.

398
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,090
That's what I get from it. Now, now
that you said that, it's not so much,

399
00:23:58,091 --> 00:24:02,260
I don't give it. I'm not afraid. Yeah.
I mean we all have to lead the planet.

400
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,510
You know? Everybody has their day.

401
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:08,140
What you work on is not being
afraid when you have to leave.

402
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,300
Okay, that'd be cool.
Thank you. This is, um,

403
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,820
this was after refreshing
walking out of that interview.

404
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,210
Thank you. This was by the way, after
we had told her that phrase on Jay,

405
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,340
his back was lifted from him.

406
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,560
A book written by my brother
in law Eugene. Oh Wow. No,

407
00:24:31,561 --> 00:24:33,240
I need to get the book and
I need to get it to Jay,

408
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,450
which he was very interested to know.
Can we do that? Yeah, let's do that.

409
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,030
And we did send him the book. You
haven't heard back. Oh my God. Anyhow,

410
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,450
walking out of there, I kept thinking,
is that what this is all about?

411
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:48,590
That all this pop nihilism around us is
not about tearing down power structures

412
00:24:48,591 --> 00:24:53,060
or embracing nothingness. It's just
look at me, look how brave I am.

413
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,900
That I can wear it on a tee shirt. Yeah.
I would go with that. And this is why,

414
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:59,630
as you pointed out, you
know, from data to punk,

415
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,050
this isn't a recurring motif of how,

416
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,330
how bad ass you are in facing
mortality. Pluto. Badass.

417
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,740
That's what I was thinking. I think that
that is nothing more than a posture.

418
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,620
I mean it's all fine when you're
18 to wear that tee shirt,

419
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,180
but when you're like in your fifties
dealing with cancer, like okay, you know,

420
00:25:22,181 --> 00:25:26,500
maybe, maybe then is when you really
have to confront those things. So I just,

421
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:31,150
it's a, it's simply a posture and
that's why it's in pop culture.

422
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,143
Quite cynical.

423
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:34,830
Sponsored pizza.

424
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:38,490
Say you know why we love nihilism in pop
culture is that it saves us having to

425
00:25:38,491 --> 00:25:40,470
be burdened with it.
Simon Critchley again,

426
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,920
it saves us from feeling
it all right, we can,

427
00:25:43,921 --> 00:25:48,150
we can enjoy it in our rooms. We can
get off on it and then we let it go

428
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:51,000
and we got, we got back to work.

429
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,710
But Simon says, you don't
have to be cynical about
this if you don't want to be.

430
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,300
I mean these are meeting Nietzsche,

431
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,050
Mr dark pessimists himself
had this idea about nihilism,

432
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:01,800
that it was just the beginning,

433
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,400
that if you really dealt
with it and took it in,

434
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,300
accelerated it to its logical end,
you could get to the other side,

435
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,910
which he called a reevaluation of values,

436
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,110
some new way of thinking about who we
are as moral creatures. And that's,

437
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,740
that's kind of where I am and love
love is that capacity which can see it

438
00:26:24,431 --> 00:26:25,264
through that.

439
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,240
And that he suspects is why his students
were so interested in those mystics

440
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,500
cause they had found a way through

441
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,301
these people,

442
00:26:31,301 --> 00:26:36,301
these mystics have got the
own compromising commitment
to something like love

443
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:42,390
the fact that they were ready to go all
the way to negate even their own bodies

444
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,070
for that love.

445
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,810
Right. So in a world where, where love
has been reduced to Tinder exchanges,

446
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,470
if that's the hell that you're living
in as a 25 year old, then yeah,

447
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,500
you got to read these mystics and
think I want what she's having.

448
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,230
I'll say, I'll say, I'll take
what she's having earned my flesh.

449
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,870
That's right by my friends.
And you could argue, I mean,

450
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,350
why not that Jay Z and Beyonce, you've
got a little bit of that going on.

451
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,180
I mean, part of what's made this tour,

452
00:27:08,181 --> 00:27:13,181
so big biggest tour ever actually is
that it's like this grand love story and

453
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:18,020
with the love of my life. So it's,
it's like it worked. I have a fantasy,

454
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,560
I have a fantasy that Beyonce and Jay z
will do this tour and they will go off

455
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:30,251
into the desert and they'll live in
a little like this monastic existence

456
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,180
together in love in a new and
new sort of age of Aquarius.

457
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,390
We'll begin starting with the
two of them. That's beautiful.

458
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,410
The loudest Mike Trap.
Oh, any chance of that?

459
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,860
Are you gonna really hear me slip,
right? Yeah. That was your answer.

460
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,243
Finical out on the beach.

461
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,980
Maybe a perfect response
to Jan's question. Yeah.

462
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,553
[inaudible] [inaudible]

463
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,670
[inaudible]

464
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,211
so Jen,

465
00:28:56,211 --> 00:28:59,990
I can hear that you're going to take a
lot of this stuff and you're going to

466
00:28:59,991 --> 00:29:04,991
look at the current moment and [inaudible]
and see how this idea is expressing

467
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:10,301
itself in this made me want to work to
go back and see when and where and how it

468
00:29:11,601 --> 00:29:15,590
was x. It's been expressed
all along. Okay. So, uh,

469
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,950
I'm delighted to be on this. Yeah.

470
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,030
And I'm going to be delighted to have
you on our show in a couple of weeks.

471
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:27,130
Really? Yeah. We want you to come
on after after I've put it together.

472
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:32,220
Love that. We're pulling you in.
Oh, beautiful. I'm game. Okay.

473
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,130
Thank you for being game for this. Um,

474
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,860
you look for on the media's take
on nihilism in a couple of weeks.

475
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,070
Big thanks to produce Randy Mills,

476
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,080
who the process of helping me, uh,

477
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,870
put together this podcast began
to say things like other day.

478
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:49,840
I thought of it in the sense of I
saw this lady bug, my friends and I,

479
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:53,950
we were watching this lady
bug crawl around my shoe
and then it started to crawl

480
00:29:53,951 --> 00:29:58,060
up my leg. It got caught in my leg,
hair fell back down to the shoe,

481
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:01,950
and we were all like, oh,
that's life. That's it, man.

482
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,830
We're all just bugs crawling
around on a God damn shoe.

483
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,460
And he was totally serious and special
thanks to the Murthy tribe and in two

484
00:30:09,461 --> 00:30:11,770
zero books and of course to Eugene Vacher,

485
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,520
who even though we harbors no
redemptive fantasies about human beings

486
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:17,980
whatsoever, isn't awesome dude.

487
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:20,800
And this piece is an homage to him.

488
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:25,180
One of the most committed writers I know
also happens to be my brother-in-law.

489
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,730
If you would like to read
in the dust of this planet,

490
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:30,400
and I actually do highly recommend
