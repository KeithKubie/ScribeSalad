00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.720
We've spent the past few
months talking about animals

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.160
here on Crash Course, specifically
human animals, because...

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.680
well, because humans...
we love talking about ourselves,

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.250
and also because animals
are just really interesting.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.220
But it's high time that we talked
about the rest of the living world.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.859
Because I hate to break it to ya,
but most of the alive things on

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.490
Earth are single-celled organisms.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.970
And by "most of the alive things"
I mean that these organisms

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.239
make up two of the three
taxonomic domains of all life,

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.099
plus one of the four kingdoms.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.719
I'm talking about archaea,
bacteria and protists.

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.030
With the exception of a few
protists, they're all unicellular,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.370
and they are, by far,
the most abundant

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.769
and diverse organisms on Earth.

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.399
More important, they lay
claim to the world's oldest

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.010
and earliest living lineages,
dating back to the very first

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.280
twinkle of life on this planet.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.309
So by understanding
these three groups,

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.539
you begin to truly understand
life on earth, its origins,

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:59.649
and how everything that came after
them, including us, came to be.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.859
What's more, because
their heritage is so ancient,

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.500
these organisms often
take weird, cool forms

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.240
that don't look like life
as we think about it,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.750
and they do amazing things.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.540
Some not only live but thrive
in environments that would kill you,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630
me, and everything we hold dear.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.610
And others make their
living by invading organisms,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.320
including us, and causing disease.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.210
Then there are those that do the
opposite, making life possible by,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.590
fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere
and helping animals digest food.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.920
Members of these groups have
names like Sailor's Eyeballs

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.799
and Dog Vomit Slime Mold,
and they can take the shape

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.850
of rods, blobs, corkscrews or coils.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.310
Kinda like the doddering,
eccentric relatives

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.100
you're forced to spend some holiday
with once a year, the archaea,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.850
bacteria and protists are
our oldest, oddest relatives.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.850
And it's about time
you got to know them.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.030
There's no denying it:
Every multicellular organism

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.149
on this planet, whether it be
a mushroom or a vampire bat,

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.079
evolved from a
single celled organism.

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.780
And while some of these single
celled organisms evolved to populate

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.700
the world as rhinos and strangler
figs, others found happiness

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.200
in the unicellular lifestyle,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.099
and they haven't changed much
in the past few billion years.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.069
Today, nearly all unicellular
organisms are either archaea,

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.489
bacteria or protists.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.769
Protists, you'll recall,
are eukaryotic organisms

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.000
that make up the kingdom
Protista under the domain Eukarya.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.879
Bacteria and Archaea, meanwhile,
are their own prokaryotic domains.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.030
And I hope you haven't
forgotten this, the big difference

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.260
between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
is that eukaryotic organisms,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.750
including you and the plants, and
fungi and animals that you know,

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.200
have cells with a nucleus that
hold their genetic information,

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.190
while prokaryotic cells don't have

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.629
a nucleus or any
organelles to speak of.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.870
These two groups do have some
important things in common,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.569
like having plasma membranes
that are filled with cytoplasm,

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.900
and ribosomes that contain
RNA and synthesize proteins.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.090
And they both have DNA that
carries the instructions

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.280
for operating the cell.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.640
But eukaryotic DNA comes in
strands in the form of chromosomes,

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.420
while prokaryotic DNA is
found in rings called plasmids.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.200
So, again, and this
time with feeling:

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.680
Protists are mostly single-celled
eukaryotic organisms.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.060
Archaea and bacteria are
single-celled prokaryotic organisms.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.599
The word "prokaryote" actually
means before the nucleus,

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.049
which is a clue that prokaryotes
are an older form of life.

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.060
And we literally cannot find
anything older than Archaea.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.700
The first Archaea fossils
date back 3.5 billion years ago

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.010
I'm talking just a billion
years after the Earth formed

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.590
and was still bombarded
by comets and meteors,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.510
not to mention fried
by UV radiation.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.980
But in the midst of all that,
archaea were just chillaxing.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.640
Earth's climate has calmed
down since then, so today

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.099
archaea are found in some of the
world's most extreme environments:

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:53.230
In underwater hydrothermal vents,
oil wells, volcanic hot springs,

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.959
even acidic mine drainage.

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.310
Archaea were probably
the earliest living things,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.700
and their adaptability is
probably what allowed them

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.530
to take root in Earth's early,
kind of grody environment.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.239
One key group of the
archaea are the methanogens.

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.030
These guys prefer more
moderate environments, like mud,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.579
swamps and your intestines,
but they derive their energy

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.879
from hydrogen gas and carbon
dioxide, which is pretty cool

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.580
and they emit methane
as their waste product.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.160
Methanogens, methane generators.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.820
We know that waste as swamp gas,
and also, other kinds of gas.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.560
The other groups are extremophiles,
which not only tolerate

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.050
but prefer really
wicked surroundings.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.660
The most famous of
these are the thermophiles,

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.000
which live in temperatures
that would melt your face off.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.910
I mean, serious: Pyrolobus
fumarii, a species of archaea

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.630
discovered in the late
1990's in a hydrothermal vent,

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.730
live at temperatures
around 113 degrees celsius.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.220
Not fahrenheit, celsius!

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.700
Significantly above the
boiling point of water!

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.390
Most organisms can't
take heat like that,

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.530
because it causes their DNA to
unwind and their proteins to denature

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.360
or permanently change shape.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.280
But thermophiles have evolved
adaptations that keep them stable

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.730
at these screamin' hot temperatures.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.720
There are also halophiles, or salt
lovers, which live in places

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.440
like the Dead Sea or
the Great Salt Lake,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.130
and probably Daniel Tosh's mouth.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.260
Most halophiles breathe
oxygen and are heterotrophic,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.970
but there are some bizarro outliers,
like species that use sunlight

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.330
to make energy,
but not like plants do

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.290
they have light-harvesting
pigments in their membranes

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.360
that react with light and enable
the cell to make ATP for energy.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.880
I know, it's crazy!

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.200
But despite their
alien-sounding ways of life,

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.680
archaea really aren't
all that different from bacteria,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.330
which are also prokaryotes.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.750
In fact, archaea and bacteria
were classified together

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.040
for much of the 20th century.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.280
It was only when scientists realized
that they had some important

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.660
genetic differences, like, in the
sequence of their ribosomal DNA

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.130
and the makeup of their RNA,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.560
that they were separated
into two domains.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.660
Bacteria are nearly as
ancient as archaea.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.870
Fossils show that they were
widespread about 1.5 billion

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.270
years ago, but there's evidence
that they've been around

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.200
for more than 3 billion years.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.970
Today, they make up the vast
majority of prokaryotes on Earth,

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.850
and they're super slick when
it comes to adapting quickly.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.920
Many bacteria are parasitic.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.280
Think strep throat,
your staph infection,

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.940
anything you've ever
taken an antibiotic for.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.870
But bacteria can
fend off antibiotics,

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.910
and the ninjas in
your immune system,

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.910
by garbling up their DNA from
one generation to another.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.140
They can randomly turn
genes on and off,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.530
creating unique genetic combination
as its population multiplies,

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.350
keeping its host's immune system,
and drug-makers, on their toes.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.080
Like archaea, bacteria don't
reproduce sexually,

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.990
but bacteria have devised a way
to pass their genetic material

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.250
to their buddies, a little trick
called horizontal gene transfer.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.150
For example: you've heard
of antibiotic resistance, right?

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.240
Well, horizontal gene transfer
is one reason for it.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.300
A strain of bacteria that has
genetic resistance to an antibiotic

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.440
can pass some of its DNA,
and that drug resistance,

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.910
to another strain, which
is why we're always in

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:46.480
kind of an arms race with
the bacteria of the world.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.070
And of course bacteria
are incredibly diverse,

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.340
with too many phyla to name,
more than two dozen.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.370
But one way of classifying them
is by their different kinds

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.230
of cell membranes, which react
differently to a staining technique

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.480
scientists use called Gram staining.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.260
Gram positive bacteria
have thick cell membranes,

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.740
and they're a huge group
that includes species

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.350
that live individually like
staphlococcus and streptococcus,

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.130
as well as some colonial
bacteria that are responsible

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.080
for diseases like
leprosy and tuberculosis.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.950
There are lots of groups of
Gram-negative bacteria too,

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.360
which have thinner membranes.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.050
The biggest group
here are Proteobacteria,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:22.250
named after Proteus because
they take so many forms.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.390
These include bacteria that
make our lives possible

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.250
by converting nitrogen in the
atmosphere into compounds available

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.090
to plants, as well as
others that cause stuff

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.490
like food poisoning and
Legionnaire's disease.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:33.790
Cyanobacteria, meanwhile,
are the only prokaryotes

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.430
that use photosynthesis
to make their food,

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.650
and they're some of the most
important members of aquatic

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.160
food webs, providing microscopic
forage for all kinds

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.940
of freshwater and marine ecosystems.

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.320
Spirochetes are the
corkscrew-shaped bacteria

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.970
that you've no doubt heard of

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:49.860
most are harmless, but a
couple of parasitic species

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.960
are the culprits behind illnesses
like Lyme disease and syphilis.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.770
And speaking of sexually
transmitted diseases,

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.660
the last major group of bacteria
worth mentioning are Chlamydias,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.200
which are strictly parasitic and
live only in animal cells.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.020
They're scumbags, obviously, and
are the leading infectious cause

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.930
of blindness in the world,
as well as that eponymous infection

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.710
of the urethra that makes
me kind of want to,

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.660
cross my legs,
just thinking about it.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.780
So, Archaea have managed
to make a nice,

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:17.860
multi-billion-year living
by surviving in weird,

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.660
out of the way places, and
bacteria have developed ways

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.620
to pass their DNA
without sexual reproduction.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.330
But you know who's a hot
freakin' mess? Protists.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.350
Evolutionarily, they're the
youngest of the three,

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.030
having evolved from bacteria
around 1.7 billion years ago,

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.870
and in a lot of ways
they're more sophisticated.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:40.030
For starters, they're eukaryotic,
but also, some are multicellular,

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.430
and a few kinds can
even reproduce sexually.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:46.110
But their domain is a big crap
circus, because some protists

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.930
seem to be more closely
related to plants or animals

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.930
or fungi than other protists.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.090
So scientists tend
to talk about them

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.200
based on what else they resemble.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.280
There are Protozoa,
which are kinda animal-like,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.690
Algae, which are kinda plant-like,

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.380
and fungus-like ones, including
the tastefully-named Slime Molds.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:05.370
The one thing all
of these have in common

00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:07.230
is they need to live somewhere wet:

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:10.730
in a bog, or in your body,
or in a snow bank, wherever.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.660
Protozoa are actually really cool
because they're like tiny animals.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.990
Like us, they're heterotrophs,

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:17.910
so they have to eat other
stuff in order to live.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.230
And because they need to eat,
they've got mouthparts,

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.990
or at least mouth-part sorts
of things, and they can

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.800
move around by using all kinds
of really cool structures.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.940
Some have flagella, the whip-like
tails, to propel them

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.610
through the water, or cilia,
little hair-like structures

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.150
that work like oars,
and some move around

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.760
with a kind of blobby
amoeba-like motion.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.030
I say amoeba-like
because the protozoans

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.950
that move this way are amoebas.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.160
And speaking of amoebas, some
protozoans are parasitic.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.770
You've probably heard of amoebic
dysentery: that's caused by amoebas.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.580
Malaria is caused
by this little guy,

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.910
a protozoan called
Plasmodium vivax.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:54.590
While African Sleeping Sickness
is caused by Trypanosoma brucei,

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:55.440
this guy here.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.870
Moving on to the plant-like
protists, which are algae.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.810
All algae photosynthesize
like plants,

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.520
even though they're not plants,

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.800
because they use different
kinds of chlorophyll molecules.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.680
Some are unicellular,
like tiny diatoms,

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.190
which have a hard
shell made of of silica.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.130
But the amazing thing
about single-celled algae

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.100
is that they can get
really honkin' huge.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.500
For example, ladies and
gentlemen, cast your gaze

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.450
upon the Sailor's Eyeball,
thought to be the biggest

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.620
single-celled
organism on the planet.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.490
Also known as "bubble algae,"
it lives on the sea floor

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:28.240
in tropical oceans and can
grow up to 5 centimeters across.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.910
How is that thing one cell?

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.310
Anyway, you already know
multicellular types of algae,

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.410
aka seaweed. They're closely
related to land plants,

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.720
as you can tell by looking at them,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.790
and they're generally grouped in
to red, green and brown varieties,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.440
although these all have their
unicellular forms as well.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.560
The green algae are
probably what gave rise to

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.510
land plants about
475 million years ago.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.860
They're the most
abundant and diverse,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.110
and they have chloroplasts
very much like land plants,

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.610
so they can only
live in shallow water

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.030
because they need
a lot of sunlight.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.970
Red algae is able to
live at greater depths

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.040
and has an extra pigment
in it called phycoerythrin,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.820
which gives its chlorophyll
a boost in deeper waters.

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.670
And brown algae is what most of the
seaweed you see in the ocean is.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:10.910
Kelp is an example.

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.670
They're the largest and most
complex of the multicellular algae.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.310
Finally, we have our
fungus-like protists,

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.680
which include the
delightful slime molds.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.350
They absorb nutrients
from their environment

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.470
and produce fruiting
bodies like fungi,

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:25.490
but even though they
look like piles of barf,

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.420
they can actually move
around like an amoeba

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.670
and eat bacteria by phagocytosis.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:30.910
Slime molds can be
pretty easy to spot

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:32.390
because they're
often brightly-colored,

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.170
like this charming species
which, in all seriousness,

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:37.110
is known as Dog Vomit Slime Mold.

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:39.100
You heard me.
These organisms are so freakin'

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.300
screwed up that scientists
couldn't think of a better name

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:43.360
for it than Dog Vomit Slime Mold.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:47.190
Like I said. They're old.
They're odd. Get used to it.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.660
