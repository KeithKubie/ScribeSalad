00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.790
- Hey everyone, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.040
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Karachi, Pakistan.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.410
And the last time I was in
Pakistan, we visited Karachi.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.810
We made a few videos but we
didn't have a lot of time here

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.080
so there was a lot of food that we missed

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.820
and I'm excited to be back.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.654
Today we're gonna go on a Karachi

00:00:16.654 --> 00:00:19.220
Pakistani food tour of Karachi.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.020
We're gonna eat some of the
foods that I really wanted

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.510
to eat and we didn't have
a chance to eat them.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.050
So today is gonna be a lot of fun.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.500
I'm going to share all the
food with you in this video.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.333
Let's go.

00:00:30.712 --> 00:00:33.295
(upbeat music)

00:00:51.473 --> 00:00:53.560
(knock on door)

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.500
- I decided to change into

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.580
something a little more
comfortable. (laughs)

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.900
- Awesome.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.169
Back in one minute.

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:01.002
(laughs)

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:01.835
- Nice move.

00:01:03.887 --> 00:01:06.470
(upbeat music)

00:01:08.326 --> 00:01:09.526
- [Mark] I decided to...

00:01:11.907 --> 00:01:13.990
(laughs)

00:01:15.707 --> 00:01:17.230
- Just let me sleep.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.313
(laughs)

00:01:20.226 --> 00:01:22.809
(upbeat music)

00:01:32.973 --> 00:01:36.000
- We have made it to location number one.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.450
The last time I was in Karachi,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.350
we ate that biriyani right there.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.920
When we were here he was actually under

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.850
the tree but now he's
over, I can see he's over

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.550
between the buildings that side right now.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.240
The service, the friendliness,
the delicious biriyani.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.800
I still remember the dried
lemon in his biriyani.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.460
But then there's another
restaurant which is

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.450
actually literally right,

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.380
he sells his biriyani

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.580
right in front of of this restaurant,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.380
which is called Kaiser Restaurant.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.230
Which is very famous for mutton.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.710
Grilled, whole mutton legs.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.407
And that was something we
wanted to eat last time

00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:16.050
but we just didn't have
time, so we are back.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.540
- [Ali] Ordering one
plate of the same biriyani

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.402
- [Mark] Yes

00:02:18.402 --> 00:02:20.303
(indistinct chatter)

00:02:20.303 --> 00:02:21.136
- [Ali] He remembered us.

00:02:21.136 --> 00:02:22.380
- [Man With Glasses] He came
walking by and he's like, hey!

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.983
- [Mark] Yes, awesome.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.400
What's up?

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.693
How are you? How are you, man?

00:02:28.693 --> 00:02:29.880
- [Man With Glasses] Dig's up, dude.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.503
- [Mark] Aw yes, that
was a great decision.

00:02:33.734 --> 00:02:37.401
(spoon hitting against pot)

00:02:38.384 --> 00:02:41.364
(crowd speaks in foreign language)

00:02:41.364 --> 00:02:44.823
- Good to see you. Good to see you again.

00:02:44.823 --> 00:02:47.740
(crowd chattering)

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:55.692
(man speaking foreign language)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.590
- [Ali] The leg is
going to take some time.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.896
I'm having biriyani as the appetizer.

00:03:05.896 --> 00:03:07.420
(Mark laughing)

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.863
- It's so good to be back.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.130
- [Mark] This is a completely impromptu,

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.360
and I couldn't be more excited

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.070
in my entire life for this.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.710
That was a great call, Ali.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.610
- [Ali] Thank you.

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:25.130
- [Mark] Look at the oiliness
and the richness of that rice.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.330
Every grain is individual

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.783
but it's just coated in
the masala, the spices.

00:03:31.152 --> 00:03:34.760
(crowd speaking foreign language)

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.593
- Oh wow.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.396
It is just as good as
the last time we had it.

00:03:40.396 --> 00:03:42.825
That's just a whole peppercorn in there.

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:44.230
- [Ali] It feels even better.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.942
The mutton leg is going to take some time,

00:03:45.942 --> 00:03:47.742
so biriyani is the appetizer for us.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.930
- [Mark] It's so flavorful,
the pepper in there,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.620
the dried lemon is what I
remember from last time.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.877
Oh, thank you. (laughs)

00:03:58.783 --> 00:04:01.700
(speaks inaudibly)

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.670
Okay, they gave us Pepsi's.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.670
Thank you very much.

00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:09.413
(laughing)

00:04:09.413 --> 00:04:11.089
Okay, that's too funny.

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:12.246
That is too funny to even...

00:04:12.246 --> 00:04:13.520
(laughing)

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.681
- I didn't do that.

00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:17.473
(laughing)

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:19.293
- [Mark] I'm going to
try some of that chicken.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.041
It's like, it's just so comforting.

00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:32.874
It's the most comforting biriyani.

00:04:32.874 --> 00:04:34.123
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.208
- Thanks for coming.

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:37.400
- [Man With Glasses] This is like,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.288
Karachi in a perfect setting.

00:04:40.288 --> 00:04:41.864
So awesome.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:42.900
- [Man] How's the biriyani?

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.753
- Very good.

00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:47.161
Basically the rice, using this
biriyani is of high quality.

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:50.160
Very nice and tastefully, exactly.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.300
- This man is an absolute legend.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.072
A legend of biriyani.

00:04:54.072 --> 00:04:57.340
(speaking in foreign language)

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.220
Oh man. What a legend
of biriyani in Karachi

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.899
Whoa, I just walked
into a string. (laughs)

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:05.483
It's okay.

00:05:05.483 --> 00:05:07.226
What a legend, what an amazing guy.

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:10.660
Again, just like last
time he refused to take,

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.133
We insisted we paid, and he
refused to accept payment.

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:17.650
When you are in Karachi,
this is at the corner,

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.130
I'll have it on the map,
but it's like literally

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.270
right outside of Kaiser Restaurant.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.320
He is absolutely an amazing, amazing man.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.476
His hospitality, his
generosity, it just represents.

00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:33.080
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.510
- [Mark] The main thing to eat here

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.690
is their whole mutton legs.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.611
In this case, the mutton
is goat rather than sheep.

00:05:39.611 --> 00:05:42.490
But the mutton legs,
they're fully marinated.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.000
You can just see, they're
caked in spice and a rub

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.230
and then he's getting
ready, we're going to order

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.680
I think we might go for three. Three legs.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.070
And they have a big indoor dining room

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.230
But the light is not so
good so we asked them

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.650
if they would put a table outside

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:56.590
Which they were very kind,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.500
they set us a table
outside on the sidewalk.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.229
We're going to be dining street side.

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.980
And he's getting ready to put
those goat legs on the grill.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.813
- [Zaid] How are you, Mark?

00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:06.646
- [Mark] Good to see you, man.

00:06:06.646 --> 00:06:08.200
- [Zaid] Good to see you as
well, man. How's it going?

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.600
- [Mark] Welcome. Very good.

00:06:11.862 --> 00:06:15.779
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.230
- Wow, that's a seriously hot fire.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.360
I've been putting my fingers over it.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.500
Oh man, that is a burning hot fire.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.400
Wow, that looks incredible.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.110
So we got three legs, you
put them on the grill.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.060
They are sizzling away.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.120
Immediately you can see
the masala start to liquefy

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.580
in that goat fat, in
that leg, into that meat.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.000
It's gonna absorb into that meat.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.150
Oh, and he's poking it!

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:49.149
(fire crackling)

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.060
- [Mark] I asked him and he said

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.950
that the legs are pre-steamed.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.800
They steam them first,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.000
Then they marinate it in the masala.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.833
Then it goes on the grill.

00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:00.100
That way, it doesn't take hours to grill.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.693
And also it's extra tender.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.000
- [Mark] Oh that one's for extra spicy.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.620
One leg extra spicy.

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.650
So that just went off the grill.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:12.560
That's going back to the kitchen

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.213
to get some extra masala treatment.

00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:25.721
So good.

00:07:25.827 --> 00:07:26.705
Wow.

00:07:26.705 --> 00:07:29.790
- [Restaurant Owner] This
masala is freshly made.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:31.347
- [Mark] That's extra spicy.

00:07:31.347 --> 00:07:33.390
- [Restaurant Owner] Yeah, extra spicy.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.308
On your request.

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:35.570
(laughs)

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.560
- Be real, we warned you, Mark.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.393
We warned you.

00:07:41.065 --> 00:07:43.648
(upbeat music)

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.060
- [Mark] So ridiculously tender.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:05.957
It's literally just falling off the bone.

00:08:05.957 --> 00:08:09.963
And his pro grilling move as he slices it,

00:08:09.963 --> 00:08:12.833
stabs it with the knife to get the juice,

00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:16.860
Oh! (laughing)

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.695
That's how tender it is,
a bone just fell out.

00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:21.945
(laughing)

00:08:22.973 --> 00:08:25.556
(meat cooking)

00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:34.464
(street noise)

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.750
And they didn't take that long to cook

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.500
because they're already pre-cooked.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.760
So it was only maybe 15
minutes or so on the grill.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.360
So that's convenient.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.730
And we are now sitting down

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.240
with the owner of Kaiser Restaurant.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:54.114
We got two of the regular masala

00:08:54.114 --> 00:08:56.340
and this one is the extra spicy.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.173
- On your demand.

00:08:57.173 --> 00:08:59.750
- On our demand. (laughs)

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.310
So we have to take our own responsibility

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.138
for the effects of the spiciness.

00:09:06.138 --> 00:09:08.970
(laughs)

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.340
Look at this bone, it's like a gearbox.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:13.780
They call it a gearbox, a shifter.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:14.973
You can shift.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.536
- [Mark] This side over here?

00:09:17.536 --> 00:09:18.369
- [Restaurant Owner] This one.

00:09:18.369 --> 00:09:19.202
- [Mark] Ah, that joined area?

00:09:19.202 --> 00:09:20.730
Okay.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.673
Just pull it off.

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.120
Oh wow.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.090
Look at that.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.944
- My fingers can feel how tender it is.

00:09:33.944 --> 00:09:34.947
Look at that!

00:09:34.947 --> 00:09:37.197
(laughing)

00:09:38.534 --> 00:09:39.367
- This is beautiful.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.730
Would you like to join
us in the first bite?

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.703
The fist bite.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.010
Ali, cheers. (laughing)

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:51.843
Cheers.

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.013
- Cheers, Ali, man.

00:09:56.626 --> 00:09:59.626
(everyone laughing)

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.633
- Wow!

00:10:08.681 --> 00:10:11.264
(street noise)

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:14.833
- It is spicy, or you want more spicy?

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.402
- I'm just trying to
process the tenderness.

00:10:18.402 --> 00:10:20.780
(everyone laughs)

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:22.390
It's like, perfect.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.809
It's perfect.

00:10:23.809 --> 00:10:26.640
- [Restaurant Owner] It takes
more than four hours to cook.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.900
- [Mark] And it's so smoky.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.250
Like it's smoky embedded into it.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:32.060
It's so tender.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.703
That masala, yeah, like
the spiciness is wonderful.

00:10:35.703 --> 00:10:38.820
It's so flavorful, and
what I love about it

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.747
is that the spice is all
the way into the meat.

00:10:41.747 --> 00:10:42.949
- [Restaurant Owner] Yeah, exactly.

00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:43.782
- [Mark] It's not just on the outside,

00:10:43.782 --> 00:10:45.340
it's all the way into the meat.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.277
That's like one of the,

00:10:46.277 --> 00:10:49.223
- [Restaurant Owner] Because
it takes four hours to steam.

00:10:51.574 --> 00:10:53.824
- [Mark] Look at that,
it just strings apart.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.533
- Thank you. Thank you.

00:11:00.241 --> 00:11:03.158
(cheerful chatter)

00:11:05.193 --> 00:11:07.860
(Mark laughing)

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:10.283
- For you?

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:12.323
Thank you.

00:11:15.172 --> 00:11:19.112
There's sesame seeds on it and it's very

00:11:19.112 --> 00:11:21.360
slightly thick but feels like dense.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.720
- [Restaurant Owner] This naan has milk,

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.370
yogurt and oil in it.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:28.430
- Wow. Milk, yogurt and oil in the naan.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.263
Wow.

00:11:30.683 --> 00:11:34.713
Alright, and then just grab the meat.

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:45.850
The meat is outstanding,
and then with that naan.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.490
That blanket of naan.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:50.190
You taste a hint of sourness
from the yogurt in there.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.750
It's dense and hearty,
it's perfect for the meat.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:56.027
Cause the meat just like,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.910
It just caresses and blankets the meat.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.038
Is this a yogurt based chutney?

00:12:03.038 --> 00:12:03.871
- [Restaurant Owner] Excuse me?

00:12:03.871 --> 00:12:04.704
- [Mark] A yogurt based chutney?

00:12:04.704 --> 00:12:05.686
- [Restaurant Owner] It's a mint chutney.

00:12:05.686 --> 00:12:06.810
- [Mark] Mint chutney, okay.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.090
Grab a piece of this.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.494
I'll try it with the chutney next.

00:12:10.494 --> 00:12:13.077
(upbeat music)

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.263
It's like beyond delicious.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.600
It's like, just ultra tender supreme.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.290
With that yogurt minty chutney

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.300
that goes well with it as well.

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.849
- I so needed that mutton leg kick

00:12:32.849 --> 00:12:34.300
(everyone laughing)

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.650
to get going the whole day.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:38.353
- [Mark] We've been
waiting since this morning.

00:12:38.353 --> 00:12:40.194
- [Zaid] This really was delicious, man.

00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:41.027
- [Mark] Have you had it before this?

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:41.860
- No, no, it's the first time

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.570
and I think it's the first of many times.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.273
- [Mark] Yes.

00:12:48.737 --> 00:12:50.319
- It's really good.

00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:52.423
Awesome.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.846
- [Mark] I'll take a little meat break.

00:12:56.846 --> 00:12:59.096
(laughing)

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:03.283
No idea how spicy it is.

00:13:04.642 --> 00:13:08.140
It's just not so spicy, it's like crunchy.

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.930
And very very like, yeah, very great.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:11.410
I love the green chilies.

00:13:12.485 --> 00:13:15.068
(upbeat music)

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.580
It's finger licking good.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.980
Time to roll up the sleeves.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.633
We're going in.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:24.660
The joint of the foot.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.020
- If you want to have the bone marrow

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:28.980
then you have to break
from here, from the teeth.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:29.813
- Break?

00:13:29.813 --> 00:13:31.746
- Yeah, tip it off. Then
you suck it from there.

00:13:31.746 --> 00:13:34.810
The bone marrow will come out.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.130
- Awesome. Like a straw.

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.157
Okay, start with the bone
marrow or start with the,

00:13:42.398 --> 00:13:43.231
- Either way.

00:13:43.231 --> 00:13:44.064
- Either way, okay.

00:13:44.064 --> 00:13:45.510
I've had bone marrow many times before,

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.270
but I don't think I've
ever broken the bone

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.460
with my teeth to get the bone marrow.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.560
So just break it here?

00:13:53.937 --> 00:13:56.010
- [Restaurant Owner] Is it hard?

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:57.940
If it's hard, don't do it.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.470
- Okay, it's a bit hard.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:00.713
Maybe we should break it.

00:14:00.713 --> 00:14:04.380
(speaking foreign language)

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.560
Into your mouth. (laughing)

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.550
Directly into your mouth.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.680
It was a little too hard to
chew so we had it broken.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.670
You can see that little
nugget of the marrow.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.490
Oh, I just got a poof of goat-i-ness.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.010
- Yeah, you taste a little oil.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.712
- Yeah, you can taste goat in that.

00:14:19.712 --> 00:14:23.277
- Goat-i-ness. (giggling)

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:27.590
- Wow, that just like
melts in your mouth, yeah.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.833
That is awesome.

00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:41.181
(surprised laughter)

00:14:41.181 --> 00:14:42.981
(everyone laughing)

00:14:42.981 --> 00:14:44.231
- I heard that.

00:14:48.248 --> 00:14:49.437
- [Man] Don't eat it. Don't eat it.

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.900
- It's melting, it's melting.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.240
Dessert is complete.

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.213
Just got to try a bite
of that knuckle, too.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.360
Wow. Yeah, that is awesome.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:03.330
It's like jelly and slightly elastic-y.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.993
But that's pure goat-y
flavor. That's wonderful.

00:15:12.377 --> 00:15:14.033
Oh that masala.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.607
They're also very well known here

00:15:18.607 --> 00:15:21.260
for their hand made, house made kulfi,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.783
which is like a frozen milk ice cream.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.793
Wow, that's sweet but really good.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.220
I like the texture of it,

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.930
It's a little bit sticky,
a little bit gummy,

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:39.830
but then you also taste
the flakes of the ice.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:42.630
Really condensed, milky taste to it.

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.393
And I think there's some
pistachios in there as well.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.490
Great way to end a goat leg meal.

00:15:49.437 --> 00:15:52.597
(upbeat music)

00:15:52.597 --> 00:15:55.847
- [Mark] (laughs) Yes.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.700
We were talking with the owner,

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.490
he was telling us about the
history of his restaurant.

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.930
It's been there since 1953.

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.480
So it's a heritage, it's
a legendary restaurant.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.980
Some of the most important
people from Pakistan

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.780
have eaten there and
he was telling us about

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:13.446
one of the prime ministers of Pakistan

00:16:13.446 --> 00:16:15.066
who over 40 years ago,

00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:18.140
they used to set up that table outside

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:21.050
in that exact same place
that we sat and ate,

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.360
and he used to sit at that table and eat.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.150
That was fun, a lot of fun,

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.260
and that mutton, that goat leg,

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.533
that is a must eat in Karachi.

00:16:30.533 --> 00:16:33.116
(upbeat music)

00:16:48.321 --> 00:16:50.380
We have a little bit
of time this afternoon

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:51.730
because most of the restaurants and food

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.340
that we wanted to eat opens
up later in the evening.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.450
Karachi is a late city in terms of

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.030
food opens up late and
people stay out late.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.940
We just decided to stop by the beach.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.460
I didn't have a chance last time

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.760
I was in Karachi to visit the beach,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.310
so we're just gonna take a little stroll,

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.640
just enjoy the beach.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.270
Definitely not swim
but just to take a look

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:13.103
and enjoy the breeze.

00:17:13.103 --> 00:17:15.690
And the weather is perfect, actually.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:19.190
The beach is huge though,
like a massive sand bank.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.940
(drone whirring)

00:17:22.883 --> 00:17:25.466
(upbeat music)

00:17:39.438 --> 00:17:42.971
(indistinct chatter)

00:17:42.971 --> 00:17:45.340
- Just taking a couple
of photos with uncle.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.830
- That is an award winner.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.130
- Yeah.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.333
- Absolute award winner.

00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:55.004
(speaking foreign language)

00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.123
- And actually he showed us a photo

00:17:59.123 --> 00:18:01.890
on his phone where he was even longer

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.963
and he just trimmed it for the beach.

00:18:05.218 --> 00:18:06.223
It's very nice.

00:18:07.679 --> 00:18:09.230
(speaking foreign language)

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.520
- His name is Sher Khan.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.560
And Sher Kan means the Lion King.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.110
Literally the Lion King in English.

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:18.454
- [Mark] That is awesome.

00:18:18.454 --> 00:18:21.037
(upbeat music)

00:18:31.075 --> 00:18:31.910
- [Mark] What's this area called?

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:32.946
- [Man] Dhojarji.

00:18:32.946 --> 00:18:34.480
- [Mark] Dhojarji? Dhojarji.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.240
And they're famous for gola ganda.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.670
Gola ganda, which is like an ice,

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.720
Actually I've never had the
Pakistani version before.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.680
Ice with syrup.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:45.070
It's a sweet, like,

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.697
Alright, sweet ice.

00:18:46.697 --> 00:18:49.614
(machine churning)

00:18:50.858 --> 00:18:51.908
- [Vendor] Come here.

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.757
(Street Noise)

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.743
This is ice cream soda, raspberry,

00:19:01.422 --> 00:19:03.200
pineapple broken slices,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.033
crystal jelly,

00:19:07.644 --> 00:19:09.160
condensed milk.

00:19:17.038 --> 00:19:17.871
Not ready.

00:19:17.871 --> 00:19:19.130
- [Mark] Not ready? (laughs)

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.153
Never seen, oh, ice cream! (laughs)

00:19:26.861 --> 00:19:29.444
(upbeat music)

00:19:37.257 --> 00:19:41.163
- Wait, he's coming with
a bag of chocolate wafers.

00:19:50.008 --> 00:19:50.841
Oreos.

00:19:53.674 --> 00:19:56.507
This is a Pakistani street sundae.

00:19:59.869 --> 00:20:04.869
Wow.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:06.750
For how many people?

00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.880
- [Vendor] Two.

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.003
- [Mark] Two people? (laughs)

00:20:16.229 --> 00:20:17.613
Wow.

00:20:17.613 --> 00:20:20.113
- [Vendor] This is higher
than Everest. (laughing)

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.788
- [Mark] It's a tougher climb. (laughs)

00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:26.239
- Should be a tougher climb from here

00:20:26.239 --> 00:20:27.072
till there than Everest, I believe.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:32.797
You don't eat this, you gotta
climb this one. (laughs)

00:20:32.797 --> 00:20:34.730
- And you might need
a harness to eat that.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:35.840
It actually even took him like

00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.333
five full minutes to assemble this.

00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:39.350
This is actually a work of art.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.183
- This is.

00:20:40.183 --> 00:20:42.480
- It's not just a dessert,
it's a work of art.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.500
- To me it's like more a mountain of ice.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:46.230
- This could easily be one of the world's

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.540
largest glacial fields. (laughs)

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:53.240
- [Man] It is the world's
largest strawberry glacial field.

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.750
- [Ali] Only second to
the Baltoro Glacier.

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.081
Mighty Baltoro Glacier glacier.

00:20:57.081 --> 00:20:59.580
- [Mark] What's the strategy,
do we get a little bit of ice

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.053
plus a little bit of ice cream all in one?

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.520
You sometimes get some random things that

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:07.353
you don't know what they are.

00:21:07.353 --> 00:21:10.203
- [Ali] I'm already at
count two. (laughing)

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.443
- Ooh

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:21.863
- That's sweet.

00:21:21.863 --> 00:21:24.683
- That's one of the world's
sweetest desserts I think.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:29.460
But I do like the textures.

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:33.603
It's creamy, it's icy, it's
liquid-y, it's all melt-y.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.760
It's refreshing.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.627
But like, yeah, extraordinarily sweet.

00:21:38.627 --> 00:21:39.640
What do you think?

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.890
(laughing)

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.070
- I don't think I can think right now.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.353
But I can definitely eat more.

00:21:48.353 --> 00:21:50.603
(laughing)

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.370
Okay, yeah it is sweet.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.510
It has kind of that
artificially syrup flavor

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:00.913
but it does remind you of childhood.

00:22:02.649 --> 00:22:05.232
(upbeat music)

00:22:08.206 --> 00:22:10.456
(laughing)

00:22:11.449 --> 00:22:14.359
(exhales sharply)

00:22:14.359 --> 00:22:16.609
(laughing)

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:22.712
- [Mark] Okay, thank
you. Thank you very much.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:27.530
That was definitely way too sweet for me

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:28.970
I took two bites and I can still

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:30.810
feel the sweetness on my lips.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:33.520
That being said, it's
well worth coming here

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.560
just to like, especially
if you love sweet,

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.820
but to just watch him
make that creation of art,

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.030
I don't even know how he
remembers the steps in his head,

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:43.910
there's that many steps and ingredients.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:46.220
But that was fun, we're
moving on to eat another snack

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.286
which is, it's one of my favorite, chaat.

00:22:49.286 --> 00:22:52.163
One of my favorite snacks, hands down.

00:22:54.316 --> 00:22:56.899
(upbeat music)

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:00.760
We drove over to an area called Boat Basin

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:03.080
which is a food street and it just goes on

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.210
for like a kilometer,
there's so much food here.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.010
But we're here to eat what
is one of my favorite snacks.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.950
(speaks in foreign language)

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.987
We ordered about five
different types of chaat.

00:23:18.987 --> 00:23:21.370
And chaat is like, they're snacks.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:23.690
You get a lot of chutneys,

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.700
there's yogurt, there's
masala, there's spices,

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:31.250
and then usually like
crunchy things or potatoes,

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:33.050
but it's a very common thing

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.270
throughout the Indian subcontinent.

00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:37.423
So we're gonna stop here,
we're gonna eat some chaat.

00:23:37.423 --> 00:23:38.883
This place is called Cool Inn.

00:23:40.134 --> 00:23:42.717
(upbeat music)

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:54.960
- [Waiter] Special chaat,
samosa chaat, fruit chaat,

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.020
dahi puri, dahi bhalla, pani puri

00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.850
- All of them are different,
all of them are good,

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:01.020
but lots have similar ingredients.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.640
I really wanna try the pani puri

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.230
which is one of my favorite chaats.

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.710
I always love to eat pani puri.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.580
Now little puris are like
little crunchy, hollow chips.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.210
Filled with chickpeas, and
you prepare it yourself

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:15.370
because that way they don't get soggers.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:16.203
- Cheers.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:25.913
- I love pani puri.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:32.410
You would never think to put
liquid into something crunchy

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:35.070
'cause that goes against all soggy rules

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:36.730
you've ever been taught.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:39.530
But that's why you gotta eat
it fast, and it's so good.

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:43.130
Like that crunchiness,
the sour tamarind water,

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:46.240
the chutney, it's so good.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.810
The creaminess of the chickpeas.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.750
There's crunchies, there's tamarind,

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.620
there's chutneys, there are,
there's yogurt in here as well.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.770
And there's chickpeas.
There's onions, too.

00:25:02.393 --> 00:25:03.540
That's fantastic.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:06.210
The sweet and sour
chutney of the tamarind,

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:07.870
the contrast of textures, the crunchiness,

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.470
the creaminess of the chickpeas.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.370
- This is actually very nice.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.173
- Really good

00:25:17.173 --> 00:25:18.006
- And crunchy.

00:25:18.006 --> 00:25:18.839
- Really good.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:24.403
- This one is the samosa chaat.

00:25:24.403 --> 00:25:26.620
A lot of the similar
ingredients as the special chat

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.570
but then he put some samosas on top.

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:33.503
Some straight up, straight
up samosa halves on top.

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.053
It's good, too.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:46.417
Maybe a potato samosa?

00:25:46.417 --> 00:25:47.250
- Yeah.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.660
- Vegetarian. Fully vegetarian.

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:55.660
But yeah, the yogurt, the
tamarind and the minty chutney.

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:59.090
This one is the dahi puri
which is yogurt in a puri

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.713
and then you can see the coriander on top.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.500
This one is a little on the sweeter side.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.400
It's like sweet and savory
all at the same time.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.490
Looks like there's apples,
bananas, strawberries, pineapple.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:17.994
- [Ali] Yeah. And strawberries, too.

00:26:17.994 --> 00:26:20.112
- [Mark] And that's like a,

00:26:20.112 --> 00:26:22.283
- [Ali] To make the matter more colorful.

00:26:22.283 --> 00:26:24.676
- [Mark] (laughing) it's
beautiful with the strawberries.

00:26:24.676 --> 00:26:26.910
- [Ali] To make it a colorful affair.

00:26:26.910 --> 00:26:27.930
- [Mark] I just had a flashback

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:29.860
to the fruit chaat we had in Lahore.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:31.663
With the amazing chutney

00:26:31.663 --> 00:26:33.440
- [Ali] Apricot chutney, yeah.

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.611
- [Mark] And the pomegranate
seeds, and how nice he was.

00:26:36.611 --> 00:26:37.632
- [Ali] That was amazing.

00:26:37.632 --> 00:26:38.760
- [Mark] That was amazing.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.031
- Ah, nostalgia.

00:26:40.031 --> 00:26:42.573
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:49.890
Pretty sweet.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.457
Kinda like, almost like
a whipped cream almost.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:57.253
- Exactly.

00:26:57.253 --> 00:26:59.110
- It's almost like whipped cream.

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:00.670
It is good though.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.700
But, almost like kinda sweet. Very sweet.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.197
- Exactly. And a bit too much
cream I would say, you know.

00:27:07.197 --> 00:27:10.250
- Yeah. For me it's a little sweet,

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:11.908
I prefer the saltier chaats.

00:27:11.908 --> 00:27:14.640
This is the final one we
ordered, this is the dahi bhalla.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.040
So dahi is the yogurt and bhalla,

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:18.400
we had the dahi puri alredy which is,

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.200
the puris are a little
crunchy, hollow chips.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.378
The bhalla is like a
fritter, or like a fried,

00:27:24.378 --> 00:27:25.211
- [Ali] Bhalla is like like the fat guy.

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:27.760
- [Mark] Is it made from dhal flour?

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:28.900
- [Ali] It's made from dhal flour.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:30.213
- [Mark] Dhal flour, right.

00:27:34.803 --> 00:27:36.500
(car horn beeping)

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:39.042
It's good, but not my favorite.

00:27:39.042 --> 00:27:39.930
This one's a little
more on the sweet side.

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.220
- [Ali] Sweet side, yeah, true.

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.293
- [Mark] And then the bhalla
is more like a bread-y,

00:27:46.536 --> 00:27:48.480
It almost feels like
cornbread in your mouth

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.687
and it just kind of soaks up
the chutney and the yogurt.

00:27:51.687 --> 00:27:54.687
(busy street noise)

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:58.840
The final restaurant that we're at tonight

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.200
is called Anwar Baloch and
this is a Karahi restaurant.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.150
Karahi is one of my
favorite Pakastani foods

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.050
where they cook it in a rounded metal pan.

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:12.304
The meat, the spices, the
flames go up, the ginger.

00:28:12.304 --> 00:28:14.140
It's just a beautiful, beautiful dish

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.458
that you can't miss
when you're in Pakistan.

00:28:16.458 --> 00:28:18.630
But we're here to specifically,

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.990
I think we're gonna have a prawns karahi.

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:22.930
And I think that's mainly
what we're gonna eat

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:26.200
but I know they specialize
in lamb, they have chicken

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.310
and there's just like,
it's like a whole square

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.150
of karahis going all at once.

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.770
This is just, this is a production.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.760
Thank you, very nice to meet you.

00:28:37.609 --> 00:28:40.276
(kitchen noise)

00:28:44.169 --> 00:28:47.002
(knives chopping)

00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:58.936
(pots clanking)

00:29:06.877 --> 00:29:09.544
(food sizzling)

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.930
I'm in the square of karahis.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:17.130
Thank you for having us.

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.680
And he's getting ready to
make our prawns karahi.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:24.090
He first sizzles some onions in some oil

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:26.520
and then tossed in a handful of tomatoes,

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.130
then the whole can of fresh prawns go in.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:30.960
That's gonna simmer away.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.600
Oh wow, the clanking of of the karahis,

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.920
the smoke, the fumes,

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:41.000
there's literally 360 around me

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.997
there's just meat going up in flame.

00:29:43.997 --> 00:29:46.664
(pots clanking)

00:30:09.677 --> 00:30:11.730
Just been observing is that
they begin on this side

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:16.280
to the left hand side and they
go down the line of burners

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.900
he keeps moving them,
rotating them down the line

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:20.910
all the way to the end,
where they are finished.

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:22.230
And that's the finishing station.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.960
They can't make a mistake and so they add

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.561
different spices at different burner

00:30:25.561 --> 00:30:28.177
along the way down until the final finish.

00:30:30.248 --> 00:30:32.915
(kitchen noise)

00:30:48.057 --> 00:30:51.140
(indistinct chatter)

00:30:54.713 --> 00:30:57.190
The karahis are ready
in like five minutes.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:00.703
And we're moving to the dining section.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:04.420
Yes, Ali.

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.898
(Ali exhales)

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:07.731
(laughing)

00:31:07.731 --> 00:31:09.667
- Not now, after the food.

00:31:11.003 --> 00:31:11.880
- [Waiter] Here is the karahi.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:12.929
- [Mark] There it is.

00:31:12.929 --> 00:31:14.140
(speaks foreign language)

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.000
- [Mark] Prawns karahi have arrived.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.460
Yeah, you can see that layer
of the desi ghee on top

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.540
you can see the prawns, they
added some cream in there,

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.290
they add chilies, they add the tomatoes,

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:29.280
they add, like, spoonfuls of spices.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:32.800
Then that just flames, engulfs in flame.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.710
The process of making it, is stunning.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:38.220
Karahis are one of my
favorite Pakistani foods

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:40.180
and I really love the prawn karahis,

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.980
so that's what we're having tonight.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.916
(flatbread breaking)

00:31:46.916 --> 00:31:48.659
- [Mark] Okay, I'm going to dip into the,

00:31:48.659 --> 00:31:49.692
you can see that layer.

00:31:49.692 --> 00:31:50.525
- [Man] Yeah, it's beautiful curry.

00:31:50.525 --> 00:31:52.158
Oh my goodness.

00:31:52.158 --> 00:31:54.300
- [Mark] Is that desi ghee though?

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.260
- [Man] Yeah.

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.010
- [Mark] There's so much desi ghee.

00:32:01.868 --> 00:32:04.880
It's almost nutty, there's
so many spices there.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.310
Along with the food, I
just love the atmosphere.

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:09.774
Everybody sitting together outside.

00:32:09.774 --> 00:32:10.774
- Yeah. Hmm.

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.510
Amazing.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.360
- Wow.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.193
- Wow.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:20.223
- It's so good.

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:24.460
That's like, the amount
of spices in there.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:29.140
- Yeah. Lots of spices,
I've never had it before.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.671
This is spicy, you know.

00:32:31.671 --> 00:32:33.046
Amazing.

00:32:33.046 --> 00:32:35.180
- You can taste how much
spices are in there.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:36.277
It's just thick with the dry spice,

00:32:36.277 --> 00:32:39.703
that's like the thickest dry
spice karahi we have had.

00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:45.060
The cumin, the tumeric,
the spices are just caked

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.890
around those prawns and
wrapped up in that desi ghee.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.460
That pool of desi ghee.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.640
And the ginger in there.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.970
That is incredible.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.363
(upbeat music)

00:33:08.145 --> 00:33:12.510
It is so incredibly tasty
and it's one of the spicier,

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:17.470
spicier chili, as well
as spic-ious karahis

00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:19.143
that I've had in Pakistan.

00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:21.483
It is time.

00:33:27.731 --> 00:33:31.120
There's no better position in the world

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.850
after you finish a meal than this position

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.093
on an elevated bench table.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.663
Oh man, the happiness, the satisfaction.

00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:44.610
Check out Ali. (laughing)

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:47.220
How Ali slid into position.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.610
- Yeah. I think you're improving.

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.220
Your position is getting better and better

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.965
with every trip to Pakistan.

00:33:52.965 --> 00:33:53.798
(Mark laughing)

00:33:53.798 --> 00:33:55.160
And when we have to call off the day,

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:57.603
we just don't say it, we
just get into this position.

00:33:57.603 --> 00:34:00.640
(laughing)

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.223
(upbeat music)

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.840
- [Mark] What an incredible meal to end

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.704

00:34:06.704 --> 00:34:09.330

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:13.020

starting with the goat leg,

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.130
everything in between, Pakistan, again,

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:20.880

how the friendliness, the
hospitality, the generosity,

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:27.890
