00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.669
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is a disorder that manifests in both thought and

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:11.259
behavior. An obsession is an unwanted thought, phrase, word or image that

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.774
persistently and repeatedly comes into a person's mind, and causes distress. A

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:22.988
compulsion is a repetitive behavior performed in response to uncontrollable

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:29.970
urges or to a ritualistic set of rules. Interestingly people with OCD are aware

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.050
that their thoughts are irrational and that their compulsive behaviors are also

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.535
irrational and unnecessary. But they simply cannot stop themselves. What are

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:44.630
two types of behaviors that you think are common types, that occur in people

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.230
with OCD? Think about it for a moment, and type your response here.
