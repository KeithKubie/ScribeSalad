out that making the sign in text
 

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:35.119
out that making the sign in text
slightly offset from the center like

of you you prefer to render your buttons
 

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:30.619
of you you prefer to render your buttons
inside your game engine yourself it can

00:08:30.619 --> 00:08:30.629
inside your game engine yourself it can
 

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:32.329
inside your game engine yourself it can
be somewhat problematic I think to take

00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339
be somewhat problematic I think to take
 

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:34.429
be somewhat problematic I think to take
a uibutton or some class of a uibutton

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:34.439
a uibutton or some class of a uibutton
 

00:08:34.439 --> 00:08:36.949
a uibutton or some class of a uibutton
and somehow display it on top of your

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959
and somehow display it on top of your
 

00:08:36.959 --> 00:08:38.990
and somehow display it on top of your
game engine you know a lot of game

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000
game engine you know a lot of game
 

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.299
game engine you know a lot of game
engines just don't work that way and so

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:41.309
engines just don't work that way and so
 

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:42.949
engines just don't work that way and so
my point here really is just to show you

the regular UI button so that you can
 

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.420
the regular UI button so that you can
see the code that would get called in

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:11.430
see the code that would get called in
 

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.980
see the code that would get called in
case you want to render this button

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:12.990
case you want to render this button
 

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.050
case you want to render this button
inside your game object which I imagine

00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060
inside your game object which I imagine
 

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.570
inside your game object which I imagine
many of you will so let's do that first

00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:17.580
many of you will so let's do that first
 

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.630
many of you will so let's do that first
thing I'm going to do is we're going to

let's say well delete this bundle
 

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.180
let's say well delete this bundle
because we're not going to use it

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:23.190
because we're not going to use it
 

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:29.450
because we're not going to use it
goodbye and then we're going to say that

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:29.460
goodbye and then we're going to say that
 

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:33.710

uibutton the next question you might be
 

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.420
uibutton the next question you might be
asking then is ok great so how do i

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:41.430

proper branding guidelines in the offset
text and all that and for me the answer

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.250
text and all that and for me the answer
 

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.980
text and all that and for me the answer
is usually let's just display these as

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:48.990
is usually let's just display these as
 

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.080
is usually let's just display these as
graphic buttons you don't get the

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:51.090
graphic buttons you don't get the
 

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.240
graphic buttons you don't get the
advantage of localizing your text but it

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:53.250
advantage of localizing your text but it
 

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.790
advantage of localizing your text but it
is a little easier so if you go to this

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800
is a little easier so if you go to this
 

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.170
is a little easier so if you go to this
link that is going to magically appear

00:09:57.170 --> 00:09:57.180
link that is going to magically appear
 

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.320
link that is going to magically appear
on your screen right now I have a link

to a zip file that you can download that
contains some of the artwork that you

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:03.990
contains some of the artwork that you
 

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.540
contains some of the artwork that you
would need to display your own Google+

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:05.550
would need to display your own Google+
 

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.850
would need to display your own Google+
sign-in button once you download the zip

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:07.860
sign-in button once you download the zip
 

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.950
sign-in button once you download the zip
file you'll have something that looks a

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:09.960
file you'll have something that looks a
 

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.860
file you'll have something that looks a
little like this we can unzip it and we

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:12.870
little like this we can unzip it and we
 

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.410
little like this we can unzip it and we
got a folder named artwork and let's

00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:15.420
got a folder named artwork and let's
 

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.780
got a folder named artwork and let's
just drag this into our application and

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:17.790
just drag this into our application and
 

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:25.250
just drag this into our application and
yeah let's copy it and at this point I'm

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260
yeah let's copy it and at this point I'm
 

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.260
yeah let's copy it and at this point I'm
just going to take this UI button and

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:27.270
just going to take this UI button and
 

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.940
just going to take this UI button and
I'm going to say it's type is custom and

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:30.950
I'm going to say it's type is custom and
 

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.250
I'm going to say it's type is custom and
let's start changing the images so

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260
let's start changing the images so
 

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.730
let's start changing the images so
normal for when you're signed in

normally change our state to highlighted
 

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.380
normally change our state to highlighted
in that case I'm going to use the sign

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:45.390
in that case I'm going to use the sign
 

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.870
in that case I'm going to use the sign
impressed we'll use the same one for

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880
impressed we'll use the same one for
 

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:55.490
impressed we'll use the same one for
selected and then when you're disabled

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500
selected and then when you're disabled
 

00:10:55.500 --> 00:11:01.520
selected and then when you're disabled
i'm going to use sign and disabled and

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:01.530
i'm going to use sign and disabled and
 

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.450
i'm going to use sign and disabled and
so now our UI button is still a uibutton

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:04.460
so now our UI button is still a uibutton
 

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.550
so now our UI button is still a uibutton
but it has a completely graphic look and

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560
but it has a completely graphic look and
 

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:07.879
but it has a completely graphic look and
so it

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:07.889
so it
 

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:09.889
so it
kind of looks the like the official sign

00:11:09.889 --> 00:11:09.899
kind of looks the like the official sign
 

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:11.749
kind of looks the like the official sign
in button the next thing we're going to

00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:11.759
in button the next thing we're going to
 

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:16.239
in button the next thing we're going to
do is let's hide a few of these things

00:11:16.239 --> 00:11:16.249
do is let's hide a few of these things
 

00:11:16.249 --> 00:11:23.749
do is let's hide a few of these things
bring our helper editor and I'm going to

00:11:23.749 --> 00:11:23.759
bring our helper editor and I'm going to
 

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:26.299
bring our helper editor and I'm going to
just start adding some outlets for my

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:26.309
just start adding some outlets for my
 

00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:28.220
just start adding some outlets for my
button and my label I'm going to drag

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:28.230
button and my label I'm going to drag
 

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.710
button and my label I'm going to drag
this in here and it's an outlet and I

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720
this in here and it's an outlet and I
 

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:37.789
this in here and it's an outlet and I
will call it sign-in button and I'm

00:11:37.789 --> 00:11:37.799
will call it sign-in button and I'm
 

00:11:37.799 --> 00:11:39.889
will call it sign-in button and I'm
going to do another one for the label

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899
going to do another one for the label
 

00:11:39.899 --> 00:11:49.249
going to do another one for the label
and will be referencing these later to

00:11:49.249 --> 00:11:49.259
and will be referencing these later to
 

00:11:49.259 --> 00:11:51.049
and will be referencing these later to
hide the button or change the text of

00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:51.059
hide the button or change the text of
 

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:52.729
hide the button or change the text of
the label depending on whether the user

00:11:52.729 --> 00:11:52.739
the label depending on whether the user
 

00:11:52.739 --> 00:11:57.049
the label depending on whether the user
is signed in or not and then finally I'm

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:57.059
is signed in or not and then finally I'm
 

00:11:57.059 --> 00:11:58.789
is signed in or not and then finally I'm
going to take my sign in button and I'm

00:11:58.789 --> 00:11:58.799
going to take my sign in button and I'm
 

00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:01.699
going to take my sign in button and I'm
going to drag drag it in here and create

00:12:01.699 --> 00:12:01.709
going to drag drag it in here and create
 

00:12:01.709 --> 00:12:05.289
going to drag drag it in here and create
an action we will call it sign in button

00:12:05.289 --> 00:12:05.299
an action we will call it sign in button
 

00:12:05.299 --> 00:12:15.739
an action we will call it sign in button
was pressed and all I actually need to

00:12:15.739 --> 00:12:15.749
was pressed and all I actually need to
 

00:12:15.749 --> 00:12:19.249
was pressed and all I actually need to
do here is called GPP sign-in shared

instance authenticate again this is
 

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:27.470

really all that the official Google+

sign-in button does when you click on it

00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639
sign-in button does when you click on it
 

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:31.970
sign-in button does when you click on it
so we needed to add in this one action

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:31.980
so we needed to add in this one action
 

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.379
so we needed to add in this one action
but otherwise we're going to get a

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:33.389
but otherwise we're going to get a
 

00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:35.600
but otherwise we're going to get a
button that behaves pretty similarly so

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:35.610
button that behaves pretty similarly so
 

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:40.970
button that behaves pretty similarly so
now we can run this and I'm going to

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980
now we can run this and I'm going to
 

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.929
now we can run this and I'm going to
click the Sign In button and there we go

00:12:44.929 --> 00:12:44.939
click the Sign In button and there we go
 

00:12:44.939 --> 00:12:47.989
click the Sign In button and there we go
we have our bearer token here in our

00:12:47.989 --> 00:12:47.999
we have our bearer token here in our
 

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:50.179
we have our bearer token here in our
console log so it looks like cynon

00:12:50.179 --> 00:12:50.189
console log so it looks like cynon
 

00:12:50.189 --> 00:12:51.499

it's because our system is smart enough

new scopes and you know you haven't done

new scopes and you know you haven't done
 

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:11.269
new scopes and you know you haven't done
anything to do is the application it

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279
anything to do is the application it
 

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:12.829
anything to do is the application it
will assume that you're still cool with

00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839
will assume that you're still cool with
 

00:13:12.839 --> 00:13:14.900
will assume that you're still cool with
signing in and so it won't show that

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:14.910
signing in and so it won't show that
 

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.819
signing in and so it won't show that

00:13:18.379 --> 00:13:18.389
sign in which would start to get pretty
 

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:20.449

tedious we can take advantage of this

00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459
tedious we can take advantage of this

I automatically signing the user in on
 

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:26.540
I automatically signing the user in on
subsequent visits so it kind of makes

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:26.550
subsequent visits so it kind of makes
 

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.520
subsequent visits so it kind of makes
sense to have this button on screen if

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:28.530
sense to have this button on screen if
 

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.280
sense to have this button on screen if
it's the first time the user has visited

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:31.290
it's the first time the user has visited
 

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:32.870
it's the first time the user has visited
the application or they haven't signed

the application or they haven't signed
 

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.030

in but if the users already signed in
 

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.070
in but if the users already signed in
and we know that we can sign them in

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:37.080
and we know that we can sign them in
 

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.930
and we know that we can sign them in
silently well then at that point it

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940
silently well then at that point it
 

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.360
silently well then at that point it
makes sense to go ahead and do so and we

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:41.370
makes sense to go ahead and do so and we
 

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.760
makes sense to go ahead and do so and we
can do that by calling the try silent

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:43.770
can do that by calling the try silent
 

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.550
can do that by calling the try silent
authentication method and we're going to

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560
authentication method and we're going to
 

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.990
authentication method and we're going to
do that by going into my interview

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000
do that by going into my interview
 

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.990
do that by going into my interview

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:00.780
silent authentication now what this
 

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.780
silent authentication now what this
method does is it basically looks and

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:02.790
method does is it basically looks and
 

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.790

this application if I have it'll just go
 

00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:09.770
this application if I have it'll just go

clicking on the sign-in button required

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:11.190
clicking on the sign-in button required
 

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.040
clicking on the sign-in button required
so let's see what happens now when I run

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.050
so let's see what happens now when I run
 

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:19.250
so let's see what happens now when I run
it so we start up the application I'm

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:19.260
it so we start up the application I'm
 

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.210
it so we start up the application I'm
not going to click on the Sign In button

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:22.220
not going to click on the Sign In button
 

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:25.010
not going to click on the Sign In button
but it looks like I've successfully off

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:25.020
but it looks like I've successfully off
 

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.330

anyway which is cool now there are

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:29.340
anyway which is cool now there are
 

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:30.950
anyway which is cool now there are
clearly some cleanup tasks we need to do

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:30.960
clearly some cleanup tasks we need to do
 

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.570
clearly some cleanup tasks we need to do
here we don't want this sign in button

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:32.580
here we don't want this sign in button
 

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.370
here we don't want this sign in button
sticking around if the user is already

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.380
sticking around if the user is already
 

00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:36.650
sticking around if the user is already
signed in we probably want to hide it or

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:36.660
signed in we probably want to hide it or
 

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:39.020
signed in we probably want to hide it or
maybe change it to a sign out button we

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:39.030
maybe change it to a sign out button we
 

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.430
maybe change it to a sign out button we
probably want to change the label once

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:40.440
probably want to change the label once
 

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.200
probably want to change the label once
the user signed in and we'll be dealing

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:42.210
the user signed in and we'll be dealing
 

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.450
the user signed in and we'll be dealing
with all that in a future lesson but for

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:44.460
with all that in a future lesson but for
 

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.160
with all that in a future lesson but for
right now let's take a closer look at

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:46.170
right now let's take a closer look at
 

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:48.320
right now let's take a closer look at
this access token and see what magical

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.330
this access token and see what magical
 

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.240
this access token and see what magical
powers this has granted us now the user

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.250
powers this has granted us now the user
 

00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:52.160
powers this has granted us now the user
is signed in and we'll be looking at

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.170
is signed in and we'll be looking at
 

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:59.370
