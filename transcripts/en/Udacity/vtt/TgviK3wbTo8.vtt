00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.615
We can find the y-intercept of this curve by plugging in x equals 0. That gives

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:08.804
us a y-coordinate of 4, and we already know the x-coordinate is 0, so the

00:00:08.804 --> 00:00:13.556
y-intercept is 0,4. X-intercepts are where y equals 0. Now, we need to factor to

00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:18.578
figure out what x values makes this equation true. The two equations that yield

00:00:18.578 --> 00:00:23.786
solutions that could each make this equation true are x plus 4 equals 0 and x

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:28.924
plus 1 equals 0. So now, I just have to solve each of these. Our x-intercepts

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:33.779
are then at negative 4,0 and negative 1,0. Lastly, let's find the vertex by

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:39.684
putting this in vertex form. Our final equation in vertex form is y plus 9 4th

00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:45.278
equals x plus 5 halves squared. That means, that our vertex is at negative 5

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:50.491
halves, negative 9 4th. If you think about the fact that we talked about what

00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:55.493
parabolas are for the first time just a couple of lessons ago, it's pretty

00:00:55.493 --> 00:01:00.495
impressive how much you can do to manipulate them and find out about their

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:03.644
graphs already. This is really awesome. Good job.
