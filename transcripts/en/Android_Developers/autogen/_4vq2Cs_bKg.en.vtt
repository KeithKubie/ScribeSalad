may be keep swiping it away and so now
 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.830
may be keep swiping it away and so now
in in P we prompt the user do you really

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840
in in P we prompt the user do you really
 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.869
in in P we prompt the user do you really
care about this notification do you

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879
care about this notification do you
 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.970
care about this notification do you
really want to see this content this

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980
really want to see this content this
 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.770
really want to see this content this
acts on channels so if you're not

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780
acts on channels so if you're not
 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.930
acts on channels so if you're not
describing your channels correctly then

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940
describing your channels correctly then
 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.240
describing your channels correctly then
this can lead to some confusion and

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250
this can lead to some confusion and
 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.449
this can lead to some confusion and
perhaps some lost notifications from the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459
perhaps some lost notifications from the
 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.520
perhaps some lost notifications from the
users perspective so let's look more

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530
users perspective so let's look more
 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.500
users perspective so let's look more
about notification Charles they provide

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510
about notification Charles they provide
 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.170
about notification Charles they provide
granular control to your notifications

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180
granular control to your notifications
 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.110
granular control to your notifications
for the user so you should

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120
for the user so you should
 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.390
for the user so you should
empower the user and clearly channels

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400
empower the user and clearly channels
 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.580
empower the user and clearly channels
are the way to empower them so let's

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590
are the way to empower them so let's
 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.379
are the way to empower them so let's
look at how to use them well first of

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389
look at how to use them well first of
 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.439
look at how to use them well first of
all they're now required on all apps as

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449
all they're now required on all apps as
 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.500
all they're now required on all apps as
we've they're required on API 26 and

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510
we've they're required on API 26 and
 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.090
we've they're required on API 26 and
that should be everywhere prevalent now

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100
that should be everywhere prevalent now
 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.540
that should be everywhere prevalent now
they help the user categorize that they

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550
they help the user categorize that they
 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.189
they help the user categorize that they
help you catalyze your notifications

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199
help you catalyze your notifications
 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.620
help you catalyze your notifications
that help the user to interact with them

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630
that help the user to interact with them
 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.969
that help the user to interact with them
but more on that

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979
but more on that
 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.430
but more on that
and finally they allow the user to

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440
and finally they allow the user to
 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.000
and finally they allow the user to
customize their settings so the user has

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010
customize their settings so the user has
 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.439
customize their settings so the user has
the final say so if you think

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449
the final say so if you think
 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:58.610
the final say so if you think
something's important and they don't

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620
something's important and they don't
 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.500
something's important and they don't
think it is they can they can tell you

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510
think it is they can they can tell you
 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.409
think it is they can they can tell you
this so let's look at the best practices

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419
 
 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.960
 
again you should allow the users to

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970
again you should allow the users to
 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.640
again you should allow the users to
manage their notifications through the

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650
manage their notifications through the
 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.590
manage their notifications through the
channel creation you should allow them

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600
channel creation you should allow them
 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.960
channel creation you should allow them
to maybe deep link into settings to

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970
to maybe deep link into settings to
 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.879
to maybe deep link into settings to
change these things if they expressing

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889
change these things if they expressing
 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.680
change these things if they expressing
an interest of working with your your

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690
an interest of working with your your
 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.320
an interest of working with your your
notification channels perhaps they want

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330
notification channels perhaps they want
 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:27.140
notification channels perhaps they want
to be able to change the importance of

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150
to be able to change the importance of
 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.450
to be able to change the importance of
something so setting the right

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460
something so setting the right
 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.680
something so setting the right
importance level for a notification

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690
importance level for a notification
 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.020
importance level for a notification
channel seems like an obvious one but

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030
channel seems like an obvious one but
 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.100
channel seems like an obvious one but
it's so easy to overlook and finally

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110
it's so easy to overlook and finally
 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.740
it's so easy to overlook and finally
user settings you should respect the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750
user settings you should respect the
 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.810
user settings you should respect the
user settings as you said earlier but

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820
user settings as you said earlier but
 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.450
user settings as you said earlier but
back them up where you can and don't try

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460
back them up where you can and don't try
 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.040
back them up where you can and don't try
and abuse them by deleting and

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050
and abuse them by deleting and
 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.300
and abuse them by deleting and
recreating other don'ts are only using

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310
recreating other don'ts are only using
 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.379
recreating other don'ts are only using
one channel this is a clear notification

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389
one channel this is a clear notification
 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.600
one channel this is a clear notification
smell if you like if you've only got one

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610
smell if you like if you've only got one
 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.550
smell if you like if you've only got one
channel in your application there's

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560
channel in your application there's
 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.140
channel in your application there's
probably something else you need to be

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150
probably something else you need to be
 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.439
probably something else you need to be
looking at if you provide poor

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:03.449
looking at if you provide poor
 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:05.089
looking at if you provide poor
descriptions for users so that they

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099
descriptions for users so that they
 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.439
descriptions for users so that they
don't really understand what the purpose

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449
don't really understand what the purpose
 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.210
don't really understand what the purpose
of a channel is then they're not gonna

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220
of a channel is then they're not gonna
 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.010
of a channel is then they're not gonna
be able to make the best decisions or if

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020
be able to make the best decisions or if
 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.110
be able to make the best decisions or if
you use wrong will or blocked channels

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120
you use wrong will or blocked channels
 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.300
you use wrong will or blocked channels
then this is probably you know they're

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310
then this is probably you know they're
 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.740
then this is probably you know they're
trying to communicate to you that that

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750
trying to communicate to you that that
 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.540
trying to communicate to you that that
they don't like this content and you

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550
they don't like this content and you
 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.320
they don't like this content and you
should respect that

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330
should respect that
 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.689
should respect that
and finally spamming the user with

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699
and finally spamming the user with
 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:22.939
and finally spamming the user with
notification channels is it's just not

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949
notification channels is it's just not
 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.210
notification channels is it's just not
the best way to proceed so choosing your

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220
the best way to proceed so choosing your
 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.879
the best way to proceed so choosing your
channels can really help choosing your

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:28.889
channels can really help choosing your
 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.260
channels can really help choosing your
channels carefully you really should

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270
channels carefully you really should
 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.580
channels carefully you really should
think of the user when you create your

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590
think of the user when you create your
 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.650
think of the user when you create your
channels not your application not your

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660
channels not your application not your
 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.540
channels not your application not your
architecture think of the user and how

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550
architecture think of the user and how
 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:36.830
architecture think of the user and how
they might want to interact with your

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:36.840
they might want to interact with your
 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.920
they might want to interact with your
app for instance it's a bad idea to try

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930
app for instance it's a bad idea to try
 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:40.580
app for instance it's a bad idea to try
and

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590
and
 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:41.840
and
notification channels around your

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850
notification channels around your
 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.910
notification channels around your
importance level that you find important

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:43.920
importance level that you find important
 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.070
importance level that you find important
so hey this is a really high priority

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080
so hey this is a really high priority
 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.780
so hey this is a really high priority
thing this isn't what notification

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790
thing this isn't what notification
 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.430
thing this isn't what notification
channels before you should certainly you

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440
channels before you should certainly you
 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.140
channels before you should certainly you
should group them around you know

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.150
should group them around you know
 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.600
should group them around you know
categories of notifications for instance

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610
categories of notifications for instance
 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.330
categories of notifications for instance
tagging in the photo or liked posts let

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340
tagging in the photo or liked posts let
 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.980
tagging in the photo or liked posts let
the user communicate back to you how

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:57.990
the user communicate back to you how
 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.910
the user communicate back to you how
they see that that type of notification

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:00.920
they see that that type of notification
 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.200
they see that that type of notification
you should also think about creating

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210
you should also think about creating
 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.780
you should also think about creating
notifications when there's more control

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:05.790
notifications when there's more control
 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.330
notifications when there's more control
needed for instance if I've on a chat

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340
needed for instance if I've on a chat
 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.670
needed for instance if I've on a chat
app and I've got a general channel for

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680
app and I've got a general channel for
 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.830
app and I've got a general channel for
all chat notifications coming in but

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:12.840
all chat notifications coming in but
 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.540
all chat notifications coming in but
then I expressed an interest in

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:14.550
then I expressed an interest in
 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.330
then I expressed an interest in
controlling like a family chat group you

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340
controlling like a family chat group you
 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.680
controlling like a family chat group you
should allow you should create a channel

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690
should allow you should create a channel
 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.840
should allow you should create a channel
at point and allow the user to dive

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:20.850
at point and allow the user to dive
 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.330
at point and allow the user to dive
deeper and have more finely grained

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:23.340
deeper and have more finely grained
 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.900
deeper and have more finely grained
control and finally lazily creating so

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:26.910
control and finally lazily creating so
 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.820
control and finally lazily creating so
this comes back to not creating too many

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:28.830
this comes back to not creating too many
 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.340
this comes back to not creating too many
groups channels or groups and that is

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:31.350
groups channels or groups and that is
 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.510
groups channels or groups and that is
know if Jing you never receives a direct

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520
know if Jing you never receives a direct

know if Jing you never receives a direct
message and through your app maybe don't

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:37.530
message and through your app maybe don't
 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.680

useful or this isn't useful and you
should listen to that so in Android P we

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.050
should listen to that so in Android P we
 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.970
should listen to that so in Android P we
added broadcasts for listening in to

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:54.980
added broadcasts for listening in to
 

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.190
added broadcasts for listening in to

them you should maybe back them up so
 

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.240
them you should maybe back them up so
the next time you create a channel on a

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.250
the next time you create a channel on a
 

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.400
the next time you create a channel on a
different device it makes sense and

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:07.410
different device it makes sense and
 

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.890

using the new API so first we're going
 

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.730
using the new API so first we're going
to create a instance personal instance

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:51.740
to create a instance personal instance
 

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.710
to create a instance personal instance
here so we're going to use the person

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720
here so we're going to use the person
 

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.110
here so we're going to use the person
beuter as you can see we are setting the

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120
beuter as you can see we are setting the
 

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.750
beuter as you can see we are setting the
name the URI the icon for this person

00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760
name the URI the icon for this person
 

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.120
name the URI the icon for this person
and this is going to represent the

and this is going to represent the
sender in a message and then we're going

00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459
sender in a message and then we're going
 

00:11:05.459 --> 00:11:07.610
sender in a message and then we're going
to pass that to this message that we're

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.620
to pass that to this message that we're
 

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.300
to pass that to this message that we're
creating here

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:08.310
creating here
 

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:10.220
creating here
as you can see we're passing the

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:10.230
as you can see we're passing the
 

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.290

instance of the person not like before

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:12.300
instance of the person not like before
 

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.330
instance of the person not like before
where we're passing the name of that

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:14.340
where we're passing the name of that
 

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.570
where we're passing the name of that
person and in this message we also want

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:17.580
person and in this message we also want
 

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.640
person and in this message we also want
to include the image so we're using the

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:19.650
to include the image so we're using the
 

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:22.090
to include the image so we're using the
set data method to include that image

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.100
set data method to include that image
 

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:26.329
set data method to include that image
and then after that we're adding this

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339
and then after that we're adding this
 

00:11:26.339 --> 00:11:28.970
and then after that we're adding this
message with another message so we're

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980
message with another message so we're
 

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.070
message with another message so we're
adding two messages into this messaging

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:31.080
adding two messages into this messaging
 

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.170
adding two messages into this messaging
style notification and then we're

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180
style notification and then we're
 

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:38.590
style notification and then we're
setting this down into our notification

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:38.600
 
 

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.810
 
okay so here's the quick summary of some
