00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.600
&gt;&gt;Ming: Welcome to another Leading@Google
talk. The Leading@Google series is getting

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.760
interesting folks from outside to speak on
interesting topics involving leadership and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:17.320
reaching out to the community. My name is
Ming. I'm the Jolly Good Fellow of Google

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.960
and I'm honored today to introduce a friend,
a better Jolly Good Fellow, a Jollier Gooder

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.960
Fellow.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960
[laughter]

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.960
Tony Hsieh. Tony is the CEO of Zappos and
the author of this book, "Delivering Happiness."

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.930
In 1999, at the age of 24, even younger than
me right now, Tony sold LinkExchange, the

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.340
company he co-founded to Microsoft for 265
million dollars.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.810
[audience member coughs]

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:53.830
He then joined Zappos as an advisor and investor
and eventually became CEO, where he helped

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:08.890
Zappos grow from almost no sales to over one
billion dollars in annual sales, while simultaneously

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:16.430
making Fortune's magazine's list of Best Companies
to Work for. In November, Zappos was acquired

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.920
by amazon.com, in a deal valued at 1.2 billion
dollars.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.350
Tony is a huge inspiration for me. One of
my goals in life is to create happiness in

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.229
the workplace by doing it from bottom up,
but while Tony does it from top down as CEO

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:40.600
and he does it systematically and he does
it in a way that is very profitable for his

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.321
company. His example is deeply inspiring for
me and I hope he will become a model for all

00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:53.549
the CEOs in the world. And with that, please
welcome Tony Hsieh.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.670
[applause]

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:02.520
&gt;&gt;Tony: Thank you. So, everyone can hear me
ok? I wanna take a quick survey first. How

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.850
many of you have actually purchased from Zappos
before? Oh, wow. So normally when I do this

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.890
survey, the ratio is about two to one, women
to men, and a lot of guys that I ask say they

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.280
themselves personally haven't, but their significant
other or wife has and so I was actually giving

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.471
a tour of our headquarters in Las Vegas and,
and we actually give tours to the public,

00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:30.810
so next time any of you are in Las Vegas,
we'll pick you up in a Zappos shuttle from

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.910
the airport, give you a tour and then drop
you off at your hotel afterwards.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.030
It's a lot of fun and I'll give the information
later on on how to get a tour, but anyways,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.230
I was giving a tour to an executive from one
of the major record labels and I asked him

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.150
the exact same question, and he said no, he
personally hasn't shopped from Zappos, but

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.290
he suspects his wife has because these white
boxes would show up at his doorstep and then

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.970
they'd disappear and he wasn't sure if she
was returning them or exchanging them or what

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.010
was going on. And every time he asked her,
she refused to answer what was, answer him

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.040
and tell him what was going on.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040
[laughter]

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.920
So, anyways, we went through the ground floor
of our office and that's where our merchandising

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.030
team is and then we went upstairs to our customer
loyalty team, which is our name for our call

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.590
center and, and he sat down next to one of
our call center reps and forced her to pull

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.810
up his wife's account.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.980
[laughter]

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.050
And he discovered that she had spent over
62 thousand dollars in, in his lifetime, soâ€”

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.050
Audience Member: Wow.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.050
[laughter]

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.680
Tony Hsieh: Yeah. Hopefully we weren't instrumental
in any divorce proceedings or anything.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.680
[laughter]

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.450
So, before getting into Zappos, I wanted to
talk a little bit about what led me to Zappos.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.800
And the story actually begins with pizza.
In college, I was running a pizza business

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.910
with my roommate, we were, probably had three
or four hundred students in our dorm. We were

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.100
on the ground floor and we were responsible
for investing in the ovens and we hired the

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.980
workers, set the menus, and occasionally,
I was making the pizzas myself as well.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.370
And this guy named Alfred, who's now our CFO
and COO at Zappos -- this is actually how

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.450
we met was over pizza. He would stop by every
night and order this large pepperoni pizza

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.379
from me. And for me it wasn't actually that
weird 'cause he, I remember late nights there'd

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:26.409
be ten of us at a Chinese restaurant somewhere
and he would literally finish everyone's leftovers.

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:31.849
And we had nicknames for him like, "Human
Trash Compactor," or "Monster," and so, but

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.860
then sometimes he would stop by a few hours
later and order another large pepperoni pizza

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.439
from me. And I was just thinking, "Wow. This
boy can really eat."

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:41.439
[laughter]

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:46.630
Well, I found out several years later, he
was taking the pizzas upstairs and selling

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.169
them off by the slice. So--

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.430
[laughter]

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:57.040
that's why he's our CFO and COO today at Zappos.
So, after the pizza business, the same roommate

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.210
I was running it with -- his name is Sanjay
 -- he and I got together and formed a company

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.210
called LinkExchange.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.379
This was back in 1996 during the early dotcom
days and we grew that company to about a 100

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:13.029
people and then ended up selling the company
to Microsoft in 1998. But, what a lot of people

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:18.539
don't know is the reason why we ended up selling
the company and it's because the company culture

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.669
just went completely downhill.

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.290
And I remember when it was just five or ten
of us it was kind of like your typical dot-com

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.479
back in the day. We were working around the
clock, sleeping under our desks, had no idea

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.180
what day of the week it was, trying to remember
to shower every few days and -- but it was

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.560
a lot of fun. And as we were growing, we had
friends that were on trips across the country

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.860
on vacation and they would stop by and hang
out for a day or two and then we'd hire them

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.569
and they never made their way back home.

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:47.569
[laughter]

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.750
And that got us to about 15 or 20 people and
then when we got to 20 people, it was still

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.379
a lot of fun, but we ran out of friends.

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:56.379
[laughter]

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:01.939
And so, we started hiring people that had
all the right skill sets and experiences,

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:06.840
but they weren't necessarily good for the
culture. And there wasn't any one hire that

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.010
made the culture go downhill, but just slowly
over time, by the time we got to a 100 people,

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:16.490
I, myself, dreaded getting out of bed in the
morning to go to the office and that was kind

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.080
of a weird feeling 'cause this was a company
that I had co-founded and felt like I had

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.610
lost control of the culture and if I felt
that way wondered how all the other employees

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.610
felt.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.849
So, that's really what drove us to sell the
company to Microsoft and after selling the

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.620
company, Alfred and I got together and we
formed an investment fund and we invested

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.280
in probably about twenty or so different Internet
companies and Zappos just happened to be one

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:44.590
of them. But over the course of a year, I
realized that for me, investing was really

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:45.590
boring.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.509
I felt like I was sitting on the sidelines
and not really involved and, and I really

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:54.819
missed being part of building something. And
so within a year, I joined Zappos full-time

00:06:54.819 --> 00:07:00.159
and I've been with Zappos ever since. I'm
sure many of you have heard, last July, Amazon

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:05.190
announced they were acquiring Zappos and that
deal officially closed in November, but actually

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.629
it's very different from most deals that Amazon
has done. In most of their deals, the plan

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.809
is to acquire the company and then integrate
it into Amazon.

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:18.159
For this, as a pre-conti-, condition for even
talking about the, the scenario, we told them

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:23.029
we wanted to remain independent and continue
to grow the Zappos brand and our culture and

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:27.629
our way of doing business our way. And so,
they've actually, they've stayed true to their

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.559
words so we're pretty happy with that and
basically, instead of flying once a quarter

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:37.430
to the Bay Area for board meetings, we now
fly once a quarter to Seattle.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.539
So, most people, when they hear about Zappos
think of us as an online retailer of shoes

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:47.800
because that's how we started, but internally,
we have a saying. We say that we're a service

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.050
company that just happens to sell shoes. And
we actually sell a lot more than shoes now;

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:58.040
we sell clothing, even beauty products, kitchenware,
houseware. And our whole goal is that we're

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.759
hoping ten years from now, people won't even
realize we started out selling shoes online.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:07.779
We really just want to build our brand to
be about the very best customer service and

00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:12.930
we've grown from basically no sales in 1999,
to -- in 2008 was the first time we hit a

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.909
billion dollars in gross merchandise sales
and we're continuing to, continuing to grow.

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:22.509
In Q1 of this year, our net sales were up
almost 50% year over year, previous year.

00:08:22.509 --> 00:08:26.930
And the number one driver of all that growth
has been through repeat customers and word

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.039
of mouth. So, our whole philosophy is, "Let's
take most of money we would have spent on

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:35.810
paid advertising or paid marketing, and instead,
invest in the customer experience and let

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:41.801
our customers do the marketing for us." And
we've, we're thinking 20 or 30 years from

00:08:41.801 --> 00:08:46.500
now, we've even had customers email us and
ask us if we would please run an airline or

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.921
the IRS and--

00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:48.921
[laughter]

00:08:48.921 --> 00:08:51.600
you know, we're not gonna do either of those
things this year, but--

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600
[laughter]

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.899
you know, 20 or 30 years from now, I wouldn't
rule out a Zappos airlines that's just about

00:08:56.899 --> 00:08:59.970
the very best customer service and customer
experience.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.350
So, one brand we look to for inspiration sometimes
is Virgin. They're in a whole bunch of different

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:08.600
businesses: music, airlines, and so on. The
difference is the Virgin brand is more about

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.779
being hip and cool whereas we just wanna be
about the very best customer service. So,

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:18.810
in any given day, about 75% of our orders
are from repeat customers. And when people

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.800
ask us, "So, what does it mean to give great
customer service?" Well, these are some of

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.220
the questions we think about.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.779
We think about what customers expect and then
what they actually experience and so when

00:09:28.779 --> 00:09:32.480
you go to our website, I'm sure as many of
you know, we offer free shipping both ways.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.560
So a lot of customers will order ten different
pairs of shoes, try them on with ten different

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.410
outfits in the comfort of their living room,
and send back the ones they don't like or

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.290
don't want. And we encourage that type of
behavior.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:48.529
We've actually found that customers with higher
return rates, maybe on a per order basis,

00:09:48.529 --> 00:09:53.320
are less profitable, but on a, in terms of
actual dollar basis, end up being more profitable

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.240
than customers that never return anything
at all because they end up being more comfortable

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.850
with the process and trying out new products
they wouldn't normally try out if it wasn't

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.980
free shipping both ways.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:09.050
We think about what are the stories that they'll
tell each other and so a lot of our investment,

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.920
actually what we found is on a lot of other
ecommerce websites, most of their investment

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.750
is on what happens in order to get the customer's
credit card number, whereas we really focus

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.889
on what happens after we get the credit, credit
card number from the customer.

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:27.750
And there's a lot of different things we do.
We run our warehouse 24/7, which actually,

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.410
is not the most efficient way to run a warehouse.
The most efficient way is to let the orders

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:36.470
pile up and then the picker has higher picking
density when walking around the warehouse.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.560
But we're not trying to maximize for efficiency
of the warehouse -- we're trying to maximize

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.100
for the customer experience.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.139
And our warehouse is located about 15 minutes
from the UPS hub in Louisville, Kentucky,

00:10:47.139 --> 00:10:52.009
and because of that and because we also do
surprise upgrades to overnight shipping for

00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:57.269
most of our loyal repeat customers, a lot
of our customers order as late as midnight

00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:01.089
Eastern and then their shoes show up on their
doorstep eight hours later.

00:11:01.089 --> 00:11:05.550
And that creates that whole "wow" experience
and, and emotional impact that causes them

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.850
to remember us for a very long time and tell
their friends and family about us. We also

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:15.810
have a 365 day return policy for people that,
I guess, have trouble committing or making

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:16.810
up their minds--

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:17.810
[laughter]

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:23.839
and we also have our one eight -- you know,
most websites it's very hard to find contact

00:11:23.839 --> 00:11:27.829
information. It's usually buried five links
deep and maybe it's an address that you can

00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:33.310
email once, whereas, for us, we take the exact
opposite approach. We put our 1-800 number

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:38.819
on the top of every single page of our website
because we actually want to talk to our customers.

00:11:38.819 --> 00:11:42.000
And it's funny 'cause sometimes I'll be speaking
at advertising or branding conferences and

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.910
there's a lot of discussion about consumers
being bombarded with thousands and thousands

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.750
of marketing messages every day. How do you
get your message to stand out or how do you

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.949
get your brand to stand out?

00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:57.100
And, as kind of low-tech and unsexy as it
may sound, our belief is the telephone is

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.649
one of the best branding devices out there.
Cause you have the customers undivided attention

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:05.680
for five to ten minutes. And what we found
is if we get the interaction right, that's

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.450
something that customers remember for a very
long time. And so, we've also done studies

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:15.319
when we've found that customers that do, do
come in contact with us end up buying more

00:12:15.319 --> 00:12:17.110
frequently and spending more money.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.600
So, we're actually trying to figure out how
do we get more customers to call us. And it

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:25.750
may seem weird for, for, for an Internet company
to really want customers to contact us through

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:30.000
the phone. Most of our phone calls actually
do not result in orders.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.329
Only about 5% of our overall sales volume
is through the telephone and, but, customers

00:12:36.329 --> 00:12:39.770
call for all sorts of different reasons. Maybe
it's their first time going through the returns

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.959
process and they just need a little help stepping
through how to print out that free return

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:51.730
label. Or maybe they have a wedding this weekend
and they just want some fashion advice and

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.720
we have some customers that call us, I think,
just 'cause they're lonely and--

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.040
[laughter]

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:04.459
we'll talk to them as well. We run our call
center very differently from most call centers.

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:10.060
Most call centers are, again, a, g-, focusing
on efficiency, viewing that as in the lens

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:14.269
of expense minimization, whereas for us, we
really view it through a branding lens. What

00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:19.509
can we do to really build the Zappos brand
to be about the very best customer service?

00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:23.310
And what we found is that, on average, every
customer does call us at least once sometime

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.770
during their lifetime. And if we get that
interaction right, it's something they remember

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:31.660
for a very long time and tell their friends
and family about and that's really what drives

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.170
a lot of our growth. So, we don't have scripts;
we don't measure call times.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:40.670
Most call centers are all about how many customers
can each rep talk to, which translates into

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:45.279
how quickly we can get the customer off the
phone. In fact, our, I just found out, got

00:13:45.279 --> 00:13:50.540
an email yesterday. Our longest phone call
was 7 1/2 hours long, from last week I think.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.540
[laughter]

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.829
And, I'm not sure how the bathroom situation
worked out for them, but--

00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:55.829
[laughter]

00:13:55.829 --> 00:14:00.370
but, we -- and in fact, if someone calls and
is looking for a specific pair of shoes, if

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:04.510
we're out of stock of their size, everyone's
trying to look on, at least, three competitor

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:09.230
websites. And if they find it there, direct
the customer to the competitor. And, obviously,

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:13.769
we lose that sale, but we're not trying to
maximize for every single transaction.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:19.560
We're trying to build a lifelong relationship
with our customers. So, for all this about

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.589
building our brand to be about customer service,
customer service is actually not our number

00:14:24.589 --> 00:14:30.371
one priority. Our number one priority is company
culture. And our whole belief is that if we

00:14:30.371 --> 00:14:34.509
get the culture right, then most of the other
stuff, like delivering great customer service

00:14:34.509 --> 00:14:39.120
or building a long-term enduring brand or
business will just happen naturally on its

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.389
own. So, there's a lot of stuff that we really
invest in on the culture side and it starts

00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:46.350
with the hiring process.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:50.560
When we hire people, we actually do two completely
different sets of interviews. The first set

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.269
is kind of your standard stuff that the hiring
manager and his or her team will do -- interview

00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:59.100
for fit within the team, relevant experience,
technical ability and so on. But then we do

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:04.280
a second set of interviews done by our HR
department, purely for culture fit. And they

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.399
have to pass both in order to be hired.

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:10.529
So, we've actually passed on a lot of really
smart, talented people that we know can make

00:15:10.529 --> 00:15:14.790
an immediate impact on our top or bottom line,
but if they're not a culture fit, then we

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.769
won't hire them. And the reverse is true,
too. Even if someone is a superstar at their

00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:23.180
specific job function, if they're bad for
our culture, we'll fire them just for that

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:29.040
reason. And our performance reviews are 50%
based on whether the employee is living and

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:33.350
inspiring the core values of the company,
which is essentially a formalized definition

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.810
of our culture.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.129
The other thing that we do is everyone that's
hired into our headquarters in Las Vegas,

00:15:38.129 --> 00:15:42.959
it doesn't matter what position, goes through
five weeks of training. One week is in Kentucky

00:15:42.959 --> 00:15:47.089
later on where our warehouse is; they do all
the warehouse functions, picking, packing,

00:15:47.089 --> 00:15:51.850
shipping, receiving and so on. But the first
four weeks, they go through the exact same

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:56.910
training, same training as our call center
rep and we go over company history, the importance

00:15:56.910 --> 00:16:00.911
of company culture, our philosophy about customer
service, and then you're actually on the phone

00:16:00.911 --> 00:16:02.930
for two weeks taking calls from customers.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:07.449
And the reason we have everyone, regardless
of what department they're eventually gonna

00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:12.680
end up in, do that is because if we're serious
about building our brand to be about the very

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.250
best customer service, then customer service
shouldn't just be a department. It should

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:23.750
be the entire company. And during that process,
we, we, it's an additional betting period

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:29.029
for us because it's pretty hard to fake an
attitude for that long a period of time and

00:16:29.029 --> 00:16:33.620
there's actually been people that had, we've
had to let go during that process because

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:39.129
they felt customer service was beneath them
and this is all before they actually started

00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:40.749
their actual job.

00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:44.839
The other thing we do is, at the end of the
first week of training, we make an offer to

00:16:44.839 --> 00:16:49.759
the entire class. And the offer is this: We
will pay you for the time you've already spent

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:55.980
training plus a bonus of $2000 to quit and
leave the company right now. And that's a

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:00.040
standing offer until the end of training and
then we actually extend it a couple months

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:02.639
after that and up it to $3000.

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:07.980
And the reason we do that is we want, and
you know, Las Vegas, there's plenty of other

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:13.490
call centers. Starting pay is $11 an hour
and we don't want someone that's there just

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:17.529
for a paycheck. We want employees that are
there because they really believe in the long

00:17:17.529 --> 00:17:21.790
term vision of the company and really feel
like this company culture is one that they

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:26.919
want to be a part of and contribute to. And
only about two or three percent of people

00:17:26.919 --> 00:17:27.950
end up taking the offer.

00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:32.800
When we first started this offer a few years
ago, it actually started out at a hundred

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:37.230
dollars and we keep upping the offer. It's
now at $2 or $3000 dollars because we feel

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:39.320
like not enough people are taking the offer.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.600
[laughter]

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.060
But our original intention was actually to
weed out the people that would've probably

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.490
left the company or been fired six or nine
months down the road anyways. But what we

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:55.630
found was the biggest benefit to it is actually
from the people that don't take the offer

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:59.630
'cause they still have to go home over the
weekend, talk to their friends and family

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:05.340
and ask themselves, "Is this a company that
I really believe in and want to commit to?"

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:09.370
And when they decide to turn down the easy
two or three thousand dollars, when they come

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:13.950
back to the office on Monday, they're that
much more engaged and passionate and committed

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.650
and by far, that's been the biggest benefit
of doing that.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:22.600
The other thing we have is something called
a Culture Book, which I'll give instructions

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.789
later on for how to get one for free, but
it's something we put out once a year and

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:31.630
we've done it for I think six years now, and
we ask all our employees to write a few paragraphs

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:36.750
about what the Zappos culture means to them.
And except for typos, it's unedited. So, it's

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:41.390
like when you go to Amazon, customer reviews
of a product, these are essentially employee

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.470
reviews of the company.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:48.010
And it's also, it's organized by department
so you can see how the warehouse culture might

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:53.200
be slightly different from the accounting
culture and I'll make that freely available.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:58.270
We also train everyone on how to use Twitter.
If you go to twitter.zappos.com, there's a

00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.410
link where you can see the 500 or so Zappos
employees that are active on Twitter and there's

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:09.120
another page where you can see in an aggregated
page of all, all the employees' tweets together.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:13.350
So, that can also give you a pretty good sense
of our culture.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:18.130
So, for the next several years at least, the
way we're thinking of the Zappos brand is

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:24.260
internally, we refer to it as the three Cs;
clothing, customer service and culture. And

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.400
this is essentially based on the life cycle
of the customer.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:32.159
So customers that have never heard of Zappos
have no idea what we do. We want them to know

00:19:32.159 --> 00:19:36.210
that we have a great selection of clothing
and footwear and other product categories.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:39.919
Once they know about that, then we want them
to know that we're all about the very best

00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:44.049
customer service. And that's not something
that, so much we tell them, as they experience

00:19:44.049 --> 00:19:47.840
when they call our call center or experience
that surprise upgrade to overnight shipping,

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.679
or see how easy the free return shipping is.

00:19:50.679 --> 00:19:55.100
And once they know that we're all about the
very best customer service, then we want them

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.100
to know about our culture and our core values,
'cause that's really the platform that makes

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.820
everything possible. So, we've actually had
customers tell us that when they get that

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:08.909
perfect pair of shoes or perfect outfit, that
Zappos is happiness in a box. So, whether

00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:14.320
it's the happiness that employees, that customers
feel when they get that perfect outfit or

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:18.799
the happiness that customers feel when they
experience great service or have a great customer

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:23.700
experience, or the happiness that employees
feel from being part of a culture where the

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:28.330
core values of the company match their own
personal values, the thing that really ties

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:33.590
all these things together that we realize
is that Zappos is really just about delivering

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:38.440
happiness, whether it's to customers or employees
and we apply that same philosophy to vendors

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.799
as well. And so, hence the title of my book
that just came out.

00:20:42.799 --> 00:20:46.750
So, I wanted to talk about two books. When,
when you come on the tour, you'll, first thing

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:52.460
you'll see in our lobby is the Zappos library.
And we have about 30 or 40 titles there. And

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:57.560
it's not a lending library; it's actually
a giving library. The books are freely available

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:04.650
to employees and to visitors alike, but two
of the titles that we really, really, that

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:09.870
I, and also that I personally really like
are "Good to Great" by Jim Collins, and "Tribal

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:14.730
Leadership." And, in fact, we partnered with
the authors of "Tribal Leadership" to the

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:18.990
audio version is actually available for free
to download from the Zappos website. And,

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.740
in fact, we even teach classes on both of
these books at Zappos.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:27.890
And the reason why I find both of these books
interesting is because the authors did their

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:32.720
research and looked at what separated the
great companies, in terms of long term financial

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.960
performance, from just the good ones. And,
they found that there were two important ingredients

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:42.240
that the great companies had that the good
ones, or mete-, mediocre ones generally didn't

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.130
have. And they were actually surprised by
what the, what they found through the research.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.130
[audience member coughs]

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:51.630
And the first ingredient that they found the
great companies had was they all had very

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:58.919
strong cultures. And, so we formalized the
definition of our culture into ten core values.

00:21:58.919 --> 00:22:03.669
And the difference is, a lot of, especially
larger corporations have, they might call

00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:07.630
them core values or guiding principles or,
or so on.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.350
The problem is usually they're very lofty
sounding. They kind of read like a press release

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:17.039
that the marketing department put out and
maybe you learned about it on day one of orientation

00:22:17.039 --> 00:22:22.169
and then it becomes this meaningless plaque
on the lobby wall. For us, we actually wanted

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:26.210
to come up with committable core values and
by "committable", we mean we're willing to

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:31.309
hire or fire people based on them, independent
of their actual job performance.

00:22:31.309 --> 00:22:36.840
And when you use that criteria, it's actually
a pretty hard list to come up with. And we

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.679
actually spent a year coming up with it. It
wasn't just a few high-level executives spend

00:22:41.679 --> 00:22:46.571
a weekend at an offsite and came up with the
list. Instead, this was about five years ago,

00:22:46.571 --> 00:22:51.150
I emailed the entire company and just asked
them, "What should our core values be?" Got

00:22:51.150 --> 00:22:54.690
a whole bunch of different responses back
and then we went back and forth for a year

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.870
and then finally came up with our list of
ten core values. So, this our list of ten,

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:03.640
you can actually, if you do a Google search
for Zappos Core Values, you, it should be

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.950
the first thing that pops up.

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:10.049
The other actually interesting litmus test
for when we were trying to come up with our

00:23:10.049 --> 00:23:14.940
core values, and in general, to, to think
about for any company that's thinking of core

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:20.030
values, is if you do a Google search for any
one of these individual core values, on almost

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:26.539
every one of them, Zappos is the number one
result or, or on the first page and for almost

00:23:26.539 --> 00:23:32.270
any other companies, if you search for their
core values, they're nowhere to be found if

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:33.890
you search for them one at a time.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:37.370
So, we actually have interview questions for
each and every one of these. Probably the

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:41.730
one that trips us up the most in the hiring
process is the last one, "Be humble," 'cause

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.669
there's a lot of really smart, talented people
out there that are also egotistical. And for

00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:50.270
us, it's n-, it's just not a question. We
just won't hire them, but it's one of those

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:55.269
things that is actually, probably the hardest
to have an interview question for 'cause we

00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:59.580
can't say, "How humble are you?" And they
say, "I'm the most humble person in the world."

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:00.580
[laughter]

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:05.740
But, one way we actually test for this is,
I talked about how we'll pick you up from

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:08.981
the airport in a Zappos shuttle and give you
a tour. Well for candidates, a lot of them

00:24:08.981 --> 00:24:13.420
are from out of town. Do the same thing, pick
them up in a Zappos shuttle, give them a tour

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.899
and then afterwards they'll spend the day
interviewing. At the end of the day of interviews,

00:24:17.899 --> 00:24:22.820
the recruiter will actually go back to the
shuttle driver and ask how he or she was treated.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.110
And if, if they weren't treated well, it's
not even a question. It doesn't matter how

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:31.380
well the day of interviews went, we won't
hire that person. And so, number three, I'll

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.170
give some examples. "Create fun and a little
weirdness." One of our interview questions

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.090
is, "On a scale of one to ten, how weird are
you?"

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.230
[laughter]

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:43.071
And if you're a one you might be a little
bit too straight laced for the Zappos culture;

00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:45.090
ten, maybe a little bit too psychotic for
us.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.090
[laughter]

00:24:46.090 --> 00:24:50.690
But, really, it's not so much the number that
we care about; it's how they answer 'cause

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.269
our belief is that everyone is a little weird
somehow and this is really more just a fun

00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:59.820
way of saying that we really recognize and
celebrate each person's individuality and

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:03.340
we want their true personalities to come out
and shine in the workplace.

00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:08.940
There's so many people where they're a different
person in, at home on weekends versus when

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:14.140
they're inside the office and people in corporate
America leave a little bit of themselves,

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:18.970
or in a lot of cases, a big part of themselves
at home. And we really would strive to create

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.370
an environment where people are just comfortable
being themselves. So, instead of worrying

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:28.120
about work/life separation, it's about work/life
integration, where it's just the same person

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.799
and not only are you comfortable being yourself,
but when you connect with your coworkers,

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:38.800
it's not just coworker relationships, but
true friendships that end up forming where

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.320
you would choose to hang out with these people
even if you weren't working at the same company

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.320
together.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:48.070
And so, for example, for managers, we actually
encourage them to spend 10 to 20 percent of

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:55.090
their time outside the office with their team
and whoever they work with. And, initially

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.990
the reaction we get back, especially from
people from other companies is, "Well, you

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:04.870
know, that sounds fun, but is it really working?"
I, there's an endless list of things to do,

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:08.970
but then we go back and survey the managers
that have done it, and we ask them how much

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:13.480
more productive and efficient is your team
because communication is better, there's higher

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.760
levels of trust, people are willing to do
favors for each other 'cause they're doing

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.539
favors for friends, not just coworkers.

00:26:18.539 --> 00:26:24.380
And the answers we get back, in terms of increased
productivity, range anywhere from 20% to 100%

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:30.200
more productive, so kind of worst case scenario,
you're breaking even and having more fun with

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.980
it.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:37.720
Number four, "Be adventurous, creative and
open-minded." One of our questions for the

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.600
interview is, "On a scale of one to ten, how
lucky are you in life?" One is, "I don't know

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.600
why bad things always seem to happen to me."
And ten is, "I don't know why good things

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:51.120
always seem to happen to me." Well, we don't
want to hire the ones because their bad luck

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.649
and they'll bring bad luck to Zappos

00:26:52.649 --> 00:26:53.649
[laughter]

00:26:53.649 --> 00:26:55.890
and that's not good for us.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:27:01.240
But this was actually inspired by a research
study I'd read about a few years ago where

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.950
they actually asked that exact same question
to a random group of people, got answers all

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:10.270
over the board, and then afterwards they had
the subjects do a task. And the task was to

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:15.470
go through a newspaper and count the number
of photos that were in that newspaper and

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:20.290
when they were done, give the answer to the
researcher. But what the participants didn't

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:24.429
know was that it was actually a fake newspaper.
And sprinkled throughout the newspaper were

00:27:24.429 --> 00:27:28.350
these headlines that would say things like,
"If you're reading this headline you can stop.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:29.720
The answer is 37."

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.419
[laughter]

00:27:31.419 --> 00:27:36.360
Plus, collect an extra $100. And, what they
found was that the people that considered

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:42.039
themselves unlucky in life generally didn't
notice the headlines. They went through the

00:27:42.039 --> 00:27:46.029
task at hand and, and eventually came up with
the right answer. And the people that considered

00:27:46.029 --> 00:27:50.240
themselves lucky in life generally stopped
early and made an extra hundred dollars.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:51.270
[laughter]

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:57.039
So, the takeaway is that it's not so much
that people aren't inherently lucky or unlucky,

00:27:57.039 --> 00:28:02.159
but luck is really more about being open to
opportunity beyond just how the task or situation

00:28:02.159 --> 00:28:07.940
presents itself. And so that's why we ask
that question for core value number four.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.039
One of our other core values is about being
open and honest and we really embrace transparency

00:28:12.039 --> 00:28:17.110
whether it's with our customers, with our
employees, or with our vendors. So, for example,

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:23.049
with our customers, we, last quarter, we have
a quarterly all hands meeting and last quarter

00:28:23.049 --> 00:28:26.590
we actually live streamed that on the Internet
for, to the public.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:30.340
For employees, we have this monthly newsletter
called, "Ask Anything," where it's literally

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:33.940
that. They can ask -- employees can ask about
financials or what brands we're gonna carry,

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:37.831
or really any question we want and we'll get
the right person to answer that question--

00:28:37.831 --> 00:28:38.831
[audience member coughs]

00:28:38.831 --> 00:28:43.650
and then compile it all with the questions
anonymously and then send it out as a newsletter

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.010
to our employees once a month.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:50.590
And with our vendors we have an extranet.
We work with about 1500 different brands and

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:55.350
they can all log in to our extranet, our back
end system, and view the exact same information,

00:28:55.350 --> 00:29:00.549
our own buyers and merchandisers can see.
So they can see on hand inventory, what sales

00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:06.230
are, profitability, mark downs and so on.
And when we first opened this up to them,

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:11.230
their response was great. "Love all this extra
information, but aren't you worried the information

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.919
is gonna get in the hands of competitors?"

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:17.710
And I'm sure, realistically, that some, some
of the information probably does make its

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:22.440
way into the hands of competitors at some
point, but on the flipside, we now have an

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:27.820
extra 1500 pairs of eyes helping us co manage
our business and they're not on our payroll.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:31.309
And a lot of times, they'll catch stuff that
our own buyers or merchandisers might miss

00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:35.750
because our merch-, buyers and merchandisers
have portfolios that are anywhere from 20

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:41.679
to 30 brands, so they may miss that one style
that's taking off and our, and our brand partners

00:29:41.679 --> 00:29:46.039
are really just focused on this and logging
in several times a day, reading the nightly

00:29:46.039 --> 00:29:51.250
email re-, reports and it really just makes
them a true partner in the business.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.370
So this is a common reaction we get, "Happy
for you, Zappos. You have this great culture,

00:29:55.370 --> 00:30:01.470
but, you know, the stuff you do would never
work at my company." And what's interesting

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:06.210
is that the, from the research that was done
in "Good to Great", what they found was that

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:11.149
it actually doesn't matter what your core
values are. So, I'm not up here trying to

00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:16.019
say, "Other companies should adopt the Zappos
culture and core values," because, in most

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:21.980
cases, that would probably not be the right
choice, the right decision for another company.

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:27.700
But what I am saying is that having core values
that you actually commit to, mat-, is what

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:31.600
matters. It's not what the core values are,
themselves. And what they found was the most

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:36.120
important thing, in their research, was that
you had a strong culture, that you had alignment

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.799
throughout the organization; that's where
the real power comes from. And when we rolled

00:30:39.799 --> 00:30:44.500
out our core values, it was actually one of
those things that even myself kind of resisted

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.360
inis-. initially, because it felt like one
of those big corporate things to do.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:52.820
But what we found was when we really committed
to them and truly committed, meaning, willing

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:58.009
to hire and fire people based on them, willing
to do performance reviews based on them, what,

00:30:58.009 --> 00:31:04.090
within a relatively short period of time,
we f-, the entire organization really changed,

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:10.179
and when it became integrated in our language
and our default way of thinking and it empowers

00:31:10.179 --> 00:31:14.590
every single employee to really make decisions
for themselves.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:19.419
They just need to ask, "What's our long term
vision and is this more in line with our core

00:31:19.419 --> 00:31:23.720
values or less in line with our core values?"
And it also enables employees to call each

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:26.669
other out for, whether, even if they're in
different departments or if it's a front line

00:31:26.669 --> 00:31:32.649
employee calling out a VP. So, we found that
it's been hugely, hugely powerful and really

00:31:32.649 --> 00:31:38.580
is what enables us to scale our culture. And
the, part of it is the only way a culture

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:44.149
can scale, most companies as they get bigger,
the company culture goes downhill over time.

00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:48.419
Not only do we not want that to happen, but
we want it to get stronger and stronger. And

00:31:48.419 --> 00:31:53.649
the only way that can happen is if every employee
views as part of his or her job description,

00:31:53.649 --> 00:31:56.360
living and inspiring the culture in others.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.420
And so, one analogy I like to think of sometimes
is like, when you watch the Discovery Channel

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.720
and over the Serengeti or whatever, there's
50 thousand, a flock of 50 thousand birds

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:11.000
flying and if you take a step back, it looks
like this one giant organism that's flying

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.220
in unison. And the reality is, there is no
head bird that is leading the group, but what

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:22.610
there are, are various -- every bird has pretty
much the same DNA and they have very simple

00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:27.080
instructions in their, encoded in their DNA,
like, stay this many in, inch-, this many

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:31.289
number of inches away from the bird on the
right, this many from the left, and, and so

00:32:31.289 --> 00:32:35.600
on. And when they all follow those same rules,
they're able to flock together.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.639
And so, analogously, at the core values are
like the DNA that enables the birds to f-,

00:32:40.639 --> 00:32:46.110
f-, function as a unit, whether it's ten birds
or 50,000 birds and that's really how we're

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:51.799
thinking of how we're gonna scale the company
culture at Zappos. I'm not, I'm gonna make

00:32:51.799 --> 00:32:59.440
this presentation available, but, sometimes
w-, the reaction that we get from other, other

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.409
companies is, "Ok, you're an Internet company.
Special rules apply to you."

00:33:02.409 --> 00:33:07.399
And the reason why I included those other
stories in there are because that one of them,

00:33:07.399 --> 00:33:12.410
for example, is the Atlanta Refrigeration
Company in Atlanta, Georgia. They do refrigeration

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:17.210
repairs out in the field and so, in some ways,
you can't think of a more opposite company

00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:23.280
or industry than Zappos and they came through
our offices and then, actually, went through

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.580
our Zappos insights program where they, we
helped them figure out their core values and

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:31.130
how to build their own strong cultures. And
then they went back and within a relatively

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:35.279
short period of time, their customers are
happier, their employees are happier. It's

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:39.759
really neat actually seeing the before and
after pictures and their profits and revenues

00:33:39.759 --> 00:33:40.759
are up.

00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:44.980
So, it's just pretty cool seeing the same
concepts apply and work in other industries.

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:48.230
So, going back to Good to Great and Tribal
Leadership, and, and talking about how they

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:53.399
were, two important ingredients that separated
the great companies from just the good ones.

00:33:53.399 --> 00:33:58.669
First one was culture and the second one was
that, and this again, I think, surprised the

00:33:58.669 --> 00:34:03.909
researchers, was that the great companies
had a vision that had a higher purpose, beyond

00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:09.760
just money or profits or being number one
in a market. And kind of the irony there is

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:15.560
that by not making profits, the number one
priority of the company, or the higher purpose

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.639
of the company, it actually enabled these
companies to make, generate more profits in

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:21.669
the long term.

00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:25.570
So, sometimes when I speak at entrepreneur
conferences, I get asked, "What's a good market

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:30.649
to go into where I can make a lot of money?"
And my response to them is, "Instead of thinking

00:34:30.649 --> 00:34:34.909
about where you can make a lot of money, think
about what are you so passionate about doing

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:39.659
that you'd be happy doing it for ten years,
even if you never made a dime, and that's

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:43.510
what you should be doing." And kind of the
ironic thing is the money will actually follow.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:49.720
So, we've all heard of craigslist, he, he
didn't set out to, to make money. He was passionate

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:54.099
about the community and now it's one of the
top trafficked websites on the Internet. So,

00:34:54.099 --> 00:34:57.910
I like to say, "Chase the vision, not the
money." There was a movie that came out, a,

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:03.520
I think a couple years ago called "Notorious".
I think it only lasted a week in the movie

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.440
theater, but I saw it and--

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.710
[laughter]

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:14.050
in it, Biggie Small is also known as Notorious
B.I.G., is, well, Puff Daddy says to Biggie

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:18.660
Smalls, "Don't chase the paper, chase the
dream."

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:19.660
[laughter]

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.119
I just wanted an excuse to put this picture
up here.

00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:25.079
[laughter]

00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:29.410
Anyways, so if you're an entrepreneur, say,
think about what would you be so passionate

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.450
about doing that you'd be happy doing it for
ten years even if you never made a dime from

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:38.089
it? And if you have employees, think about
what's the larger vision and greater purpose

00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:42.829
in the work beyond just money or profits or
being number one in a market?

00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:47.740
And there's a lot of consultants and books
that talk about how to motivate employees

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:51.250
and you know, they work to a certain extent
and there's different ways you can motivate

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:55.160
employees. You can motivate them through incentives;
a lot of companies do that. You can motivate

00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:02.510
them through recognition. A lot of corporate
America motivates through fear, but our belief

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:06.180
is that there's a huge difference between
motivation and inspiration.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.920
And if you can inspire your employees through
a vision that has a greater purpose beyond

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:15.190
just money or profits or being number one
in a market and if you can inspire your employees

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:20.369
by having and committing to corporate core
values that match their own personal values,

00:36:20.369 --> 00:36:24.569
then you can accomplish so much more and you
don't really need to worry about the motivation

00:36:24.569 --> 00:36:26.340
part of it.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:33.170
So, this a look at how the Zappos brand has
evolved over the years. In 1999, our, our

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:39.140
vision was, "Let's just have the largest selection
of shoes online." And, and then about four

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:43.720
years into it, we sat around and asked ourselves,
"What do we want to be when we grow up? Do

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:48.370
we want to be about shoes, or do we want to
be about something more meaningful?" And that's

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:52.590
when we decided we wanted our brand to be
about the very best customer service. And

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.339
when we did that, like, some-, it kinda surprised
us what happened.

00:36:56.339 --> 00:37:00.980
Suddenly, once we communicated that to our
employees, we found that employees were suddenly

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:05.900
a lot more engaged and passionate about the
company. And when customers called, they could

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.359
sense that the person on the end of the phone
wasn't there just for a paycheck, but truly

00:37:10.359 --> 00:37:14.490
wanted to pro-, provide great service. And
when vendors came and visited our offices,

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:19.880
we found that they wanted to stay longer,
come more frequently, because that enthusiasm

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.359
wore off onto them, rubbed off onto them.

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:28.569
And then in 2005, was when we rolled out our
core values and decided not only do we want

00:37:28.569 --> 00:37:33.700
culture to be important, but we, in fact,
want it to be the number one priority of the

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.210
company 'cause if we get that right, then
the customer service will come naturally as

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:42.329
a by-product of that. And in 2007, we started
asking ourselves, "Ok, what do we mean by

00:37:42.329 --> 00:37:43.329
great customer service?"

00:37:43.329 --> 00:37:49.050
There's lots of different ways to do, give
great service. Amazon has, is a customer centric

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:53.000
company as well, but they have a different
approach. They're more about high-tech and,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.641
and removing friction, whereas we really wanted
to do the more human, have the more human

00:37:58.641 --> 00:38:04.069
connection, so we're more high-touch instead
of high-tech and really developed that personally

00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:08.280
emotional connection with them. And then 2009
was when we took a step back and realized

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.880
that really, the thing that ties all this
together is just about delivering happiness,

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.970
whether it's to customers or employees or
vendors as well.

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:20.960
So, I wanted to tell another pizza story and
this actually happened a couple years ago

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:27.070
in Santa Monica, California. I was speaking
at a Skechers sales conference and it was

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:31.160
a long day. And at the end of the day, we
decided to go bar-hopping in the Santa Monica

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:36.270
area and, 'cause I, I'd never done that before,
and, I mean, I've gone bar-hopping, but not--

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:37.270
[laughter]

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:41.790
bar-hopping in the Santa Monica area before.
And so, I think there were three of us from

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:45.630
Zappos, three people from Skechers; one of
the brands that we work with. Went to the

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:50.310
first bar, ordered a round, someone ordered
a round of drinks and then, because it had

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:55.750
been a long day, someone ordered a round of
shots and so we took the shots and drank the

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:59.920
drinks and then went to the second bar and
someone else ordered a round of drinks to

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.760
pay back for the first round of drinks and
then someone else ordered a round of shots

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:09.060
to pay back for that first round of shots.
And you can't waste alcohol, so we took the

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:13.700
shots and we finished the drinks and then
we went to the third bar. And then, actually

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:17.020
don't remember how many drinks or shots we
had after that--

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.150
[laughter]

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:25.490
but what I do know is that last call is 2
AM in California, and lights went on and we

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:31.599
started heading back to the hotel room and,
and one of the girls from Skechers was talking

00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:35.711
about this pepperoni pizza that she craving
and asked if we wanted to go on, in on it.

00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:40.200
And we said, "Yeah, that sounds great, you
know, we'd been drinking, pretty hungry."

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:45.210
And she's like, "Oh, I cannot wait." She's
like, "Go order the room service. Like, I

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:49.230
checked it out on the room service menu before
we left. It was on page 17, it was the second

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:54.520
item down and when it comes I know it's gonna
be hot so I'm not gonna let it burn the roof

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.290
of my mouth. I'm gonna, like, smell it first--

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.290
[laughter]

00:39:57.290 --> 00:40:01.480
and let the odors go in." And it was only
a five minute walk, but it seemed much longer

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.230
than that because she would not stop talking
about --

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.230
[laughter]

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:09.069
the pepperoni pizza. So anyways, we finally
end up in the hotel room and she's all excited.

00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:16.599
She calls room service and then ten seconds
later, she hangs up the phone all dejected.

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:24.750
And I ask her, "What's wrong?" And, apparently,
at that hotel they don't serve hot food after

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:32.130
11 PM. And so, she was really dejected and,
and sad and so to try to cheer her up, I say,

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:38.329
"Did you know in college, I used to make pepperoni
pizzas?" And she looked at me and was like,

00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:39.600
"That's so not helpful right now."

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:42.030
[laughter]

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:47.319
And then the three of us from Zappos were
like, "Oh!" And, you know, we were more than

00:40:47.319 --> 00:40:51.579
a little bit inebriated, we said, "Call Zappos!
Call Zappos! We'll take care of you. We're

00:40:51.579 --> 00:40:56.030
all about the best customer service." And--

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:57.030
[laughter]

00:40:57.030 --> 00:41:01.650
in our minds that really was the funniest
thing ever and, and so she actually took us

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:09.914
up on our dare and put the phone on speakerphone,
called Zappos and the rest of us are in the

00:41:09.914 --> 00:41:16.440
background trying not to make noise, but trying
to laugh as quietly as possible. And the rep

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:21.960
said, "Thanks for calling Zappos, how can
I help you?" And the Skechers girl says, "Oh,

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:27.109
thank goodness you answered. I'm in Santa
Monica right now and been eyeing this thing

00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:31.589
on room service menu, page 17, item number
two, pepperoni pizza, but they don't serve

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:36.650
hot food after 11 PM. What kind of hotel does
not serve hot food after 11 PM? Is there anything

00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:40.700
you can do for me?"

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:41.700
[laughter]

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.450
And so, first there was an awkward silence--

00:41:45.450 --> 00:41:46.450
[laughter]

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:49.020
and then the rep said, "You know you called
Zappos, right? We--

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.020
[laughter]

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:55.230
sell shoes, we sell clothes, we don't sell
pizza, yet."

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.800
[laughter]

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.491
And the Skechers girl said, "Yeah, but I heard
you're all about the very best customer service."

00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:02.491
[laughter]

00:42:02.491 --> 00:42:03.950
And the rep said, "Ok, hold on."

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:06.010
[laughter]

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:09.780
And put us on hold for two minutes and then
came back and listed the five closest places

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:14.410
in the Santa Monica area that were still open
and delivering pizza at that hour.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:18.640
Now I, I hesitate a little to tell this story,
cause I don't want all of you to start calling

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.650
Zappos and --

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:20.650
[laughter]

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:26.920
ordering pizza, but obviously, we don't have
a process or procedure for late night drunk

00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:27.920
pizza orders, but--

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.920
[laughter]

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:34.369
but, I think it's just a fun story 'cause
if you get the culture right and make sure

00:42:34.369 --> 00:42:37.980
everyone understands the long term vision
of the company, you don't need a process and

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:42.650
procedure for everything. And these types
of situations, these stories, are just created

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:49.290
automatically, literally, for us, thousands
and thousands of times every single day and

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:52.750
that's how we've really built our brand. So,
 --

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.050
&gt;&gt;memberfemale1: Did you get the pizza?

00:42:55.050 --> 00:43:00.390
&gt;&gt;Tony: Well, we, sh-, it was, it was 3 AM
by that time, so we, we did not actually end

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:06.970
up ordering the pizza, but, but she actually
went back and put together this care package

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:09.500
for the rep. And so the rep is very happy
now.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.110
[laughter]

00:43:11.110 --> 00:43:16.000
But now she's a customer for life and has
probably, she's told that story, I'm sure

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.119
many, many times. And, and, and that's really
what -- these are the types of things that

00:43:20.119 --> 00:43:24.320
we think about. Like, wh-, where the stor-,
where does the story begin and where does

00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:28.339
it end? And, for us, the story doesn't end
when we get the credit card.

00:43:28.339 --> 00:43:33.940
It's really just this ongoing lifelong relationship
with, with customers. And, and we're really

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:39.290
think of ourselves as being in the stories
and memories business and, or experience and

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:43.410
emotions business. And so that's what eventually
led us to really think about building the

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:47.569
brand to be about happiness or delivering
happiness.

00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:55.079
So, wanted to take a step back from all this
business talk and actually have you guys think

00:43:55.079 --> 00:44:03.579
about this question, "What is your goal in
life?" And, and so whatever your actual answer

00:44:03.579 --> 00:44:07.359
is, think about that. And what's interesting
is that if you actually asked different people

00:44:07.359 --> 00:44:11.109
this question, you'll get all sorts of different
answers. Some people will say, "To grow a

00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:15.290
company." Some people will say, "To get a
great job." Or, "Get a boyfriend/girlfriend."

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:21.370
And then, ask yourself, "Why?" So, whatever
you had as your goal in life, ask yourself

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:27.880
why and then people will come up with different
answers: retire early, make money, find a

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:34.310
soul mate. And then ask yourself, "Why?" again
and people will come up with the next set

00:44:34.310 --> 00:44:39.589
of answers, but if you keep asking yourself
"why?" over and over again, what's interesting

00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:43.880
is that, eventually, everyone ends up with
the same answer.

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:48.990
And that's whatever their goal in life is,
whatever they're pursuing, they believe will

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:55.460
make them happier. So, a couple years ago,
having nothing to do with Zappos, I started

00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:01.510
reading books and articles and so on about
this field of research that's essentially

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:06.260
about the science of happiness. The formal
name for it is Positive Psychology. And it

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:11.340
actually didn't exist prior to 1998, so I'm
not talking about -- go to the self-help section

00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.900
of a bookstore and read books that say, "Think
Positive" and you'll be happy.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:20.770
I'm talking about actual research that's been
done and prior to 1998, almost all of psychology

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:24.859
was about looking at people that had something
wrong with them and then figuring out how

00:45:24.859 --> 00:45:29.609
to make them more normal. But, almost nobody
bothered to study how do you look at normal

00:45:29.609 --> 00:45:34.780
people and make them happier. So, just more
as hobby and, and everything, I thought, "Oh,

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.970
that's pretty interesting."

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:40.560
And so I started reading books and articles
on the topic and one of the consistent things

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.840
that has come out of the research is that
people are very bad at predicting what will

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.860
make them happy in the long term. Most people
think, "Once I get X, then I'll be happier."

00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:54.089
"Once I achieve X, then I'll be happy," when
the research shows that's not true.

00:45:54.089 --> 00:45:57.330
There's studies of lottery winners, for example.
You look at their happiness level right before

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:01.040
winning the lottery, and then look at their
happiness level a year later. And a year later,

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:06.130
it's the same or maybe even a little bit lower
than it was right before they won the lottery.

00:46:06.130 --> 00:46:11.560
And the reverse is true as well. There's people
that have become unexpectedly blind and you

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:15.770
look at their happiness level a year later.
And a year later, it's actually right back

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:18.400
to where it was before they became blind.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:22.040
So, I thought this was interesting and then
started thinking about it, both for my own

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:27.870
personal life, but also for business as well,
because if people are bad at predicting what

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:34.329
will make them happy, then us, for us trying
to build a brand around customer service,

00:46:34.329 --> 00:46:38.619
isn't just as simple as asking customers what
do they want 'cause they may not know. And

00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:42.630
same thing for employees, if we're trying
to build a culture with a lot of happy employees,

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:47.839
you can't always just ask employees what it
is that will make them happy because they,

00:46:47.839 --> 00:46:51.780
what the research has shown is that people
are bad at predicting what will actually make

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:52.849
them happy.

00:46:52.849 --> 00:46:57.150
And for our business and yours as well, there's
a lot of science behind, a lot of the stuff

00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:04.730
we do. We look at conversion, customer acquisition
metrics, repeat customer behavior and so on.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:09.770
And I don't know what the right percentage
is, but if the ultimate goal is happiness,

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:13.810
then what percent of your time do you want
to spend studying and learning about the science

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:18.000
of happiness? How much happier could you be
and how much could that potentially help your

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.849
business, whether it's in dealing with employees
or customers or vendors?

00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:27.450
A lot of people go through decades trying
to get to this ultimate destination of happiness

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:31.790
and then when they get there, realize it's
either very short lived or maybe not even

00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:37.020
there at all. What if by studying the science
of happiness and the research that's already

00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:41.049
been done, just reading up on it a little
bit, you can kinda maybe skip some of the

00:47:41.049 --> 00:47:44.320
steps and just go straight to the happiness
part of it.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.320
[laughter]

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.400
So, I thought that was interesting. So, I
just wanted to share a few different frameworks

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.700
that are kind of Cliff notes version of what
I thought was interesting from the stuff that

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:53.910
I've read about.

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:57.570
And the first framework is that happiness
is really just about four things: perceived

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:03.329
control, perceived progress, connectedness,
meaning the number and depth of your relationships

00:48:03.329 --> 00:48:07.900
and vision or meaning -- being part of something
bigger than yourself. And what's interesting

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:13.180
is that you can not only apply this to your
own life, but you can apply it to business

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.180
as well.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:19.049
So, for example, for perceived progress, in
our merchandising department, we used to hire

00:48:19.049 --> 00:48:23.040
employees entry level and then give them all
the training and mentorship and so on. They

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:30.230
get certified and then they'd get a promotion
18 months later and then they get another

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:33.809
set of training and certification and then
18 months after that, they'd get a promotion

00:48:33.809 --> 00:48:38.200
to become a buyer, which within Zappos is
a pretty big deal. So, it took 'em three years

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:39.630
to become a buyer.

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:43.760
Well, instead of giving a promotion every
18 months, we changed it a few years ago so

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:49.390
that we gave smaller promotions every six
months. And even though nothing had changed,

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:54.740
they still had to go through the same certification
and mentorship and training and so on, except

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:58.490
we found that, and it still took them exactly
three years to become a buyer, but we found

00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:02.290
that because there was this ongoing sense
of perceived progress, that employees were

00:49:02.290 --> 00:49:07.540
much happier and it cost the company nothing
to do that.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:12.109
Another framework is Maslow's Hierarchy. There's
a great book called "Peak" by Chip Conley,

00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:18.190
P-E-A-K, where he actually condenses this
into three levels and applies it to employees

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:25.290
and customers and investors as well. And so,
for example, for employees, the three levels

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:29.490
of the pyramid are in terms of what they think
of their work, whether they think of it as

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:34.819
a job versus career versus calling. And our
whole goal at Zappos is to move them up the

00:49:34.819 --> 00:49:39.299
pyramid, to think of their time at Zappos
as a calling. And we still want employees

00:49:39.299 --> 00:49:43.829
at Zappos ten years from now and the only
way that's gonna happen is if we provide all

00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:46.049
the training and mentorship and so on--

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:47.049
[audience member coughs]

00:49:47.049 --> 00:49:49.890
so that they feel like they're growing both
personally and professionally and so we offer

00:49:49.890 --> 00:49:51.200
a lot of different classes.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:56.349
We have 30 or 40 different courses now and
they're not just professional courses. There's

00:49:56.349 --> 00:50:01.799
also, for example, one on the science of happiness
that, that helps them with their personal

00:50:01.799 --> 00:50:07.450
growth as well. And the last framework I wanna
share was three different types of happiness:

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:12.530
pleasure, engagement and meaning. The first
type I like to call the "rock star" type of

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:16.560
happiness because it's about always chasing
the next high and it's great if you can sustain

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.560
it.

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:23.540
The problem is it's very hard to sustain,
unless you're basically a rock star. And it's,

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:27.809
it, what the research has shown is out of
these three types of happiness, a sort, as

00:50:27.809 --> 00:50:31.750
soon as your source of stimuli goes down,
goes away, your happiness level just drops

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:34.640
right back down to where it was before.

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:38.339
The second type is called "flow." There's
a book by the same name and it's about those

00:50:38.339 --> 00:50:42.390
moments, and we've all experienced this. For
some people it might be while running; for

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:46.990
other people it might be painting, but it's
about when you're so into something that you're

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:53.640
doing that three hours pass by, but it seems
like only 20 minutes have passed by. And other

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:59.720
attributes that, that are associated with
this, are that you lose a sense of self-consciousness

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.089
or even self, because you're so into what
you're doing. And professional athletes refer

00:51:04.089 --> 00:51:08.599
to it as "being in the zone" where peak performance
meets peak engagement.

00:51:08.599 --> 00:51:13.670
And kind of the strategy there is just notice
when it happens and then either change who

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:18.680
you hang out with, your friends or your environment
or your job or where you live to try to have

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:22.740
that type of occurrence happen more frequently.
And what the research has shown is that this

00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:27.820
is actually the second longest lasting type
of happiness. And the third type is about

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:31.609
being part of something bigger than yourself.
And so, that might mean, for some people,

00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:36.200
volunteering for their favorite charity, for
example. And what the research has shown is

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.940
this is actually the longest lasting type
of happiness.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.680
So, what I thought was interesting is most
people go through life chasing after the first

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:47.230
type, thinking, "Once I can sustain it on
an ongoing basis, which is pretty much impossible,

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:50.910
then I'll worry about the second type and
then if I ever get around to it, then I'll

00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:55.270
worry about the third type." When, based purely
on the data from the research, the proper

00:51:55.270 --> 00:52:00.970
strategy should be "focus on the third type
of happiness first, and then layer on top

00:52:00.970 --> 00:52:05.840
of that the second type, and then the first
one, which is really just icing on the cake."

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.300
So, some books that I recommend. Probably
the one that's made the biggest impact in

00:52:09.300 --> 00:52:13.950
my life over the past five years is "Happiness
Hypothesis." The author looks at a whole bunch

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:20.631
of different religions, philosophers and,
and, and, and religions, philosophers and

00:52:20.631 --> 00:52:25.090
cultures from different time periods, and
each of them has a different belief as to

00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:30.250
what happiness means or how to achieve it.
But then what I found was interesting was

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:34.760
that he compares their beliefs to actual scientific
research that's been done and he either agrees

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:38.260
or disagrees with different parts of their
beliefs.

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:44.830
You can email me, tony@deliveringhappinessbook.com,
or tony@zappos.com will work as well, for

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:49.250
a copy of this presentation. Also, the culture
book I talked about, be happy to send out

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:53.220
for free. It's actually on backorder, I think,
a couple weeks right now, but as soon as it

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:58.130
gets in we'll send it out to you. Now, next
time you're in Las Vegas, if you come for

00:52:58.130 --> 00:53:07.120
a tour, Monday through Thursdays, tours.zappos.com,
and just wanted to end with -- the research

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:12.910
has shown that great businesses are the ones
that are able to combine profits, passion

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:14.750
and purpose.

00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:18.500
And what I thought was really interesting,
and this was kind of a weird "aha" moment

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.750
for me when I took a step back, was that the
research from the Science of Happiness is

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:28.119
about being able to combine pleasure, passion
and purpose. So, in a weird way, it's almost

00:53:28.119 --> 00:53:35.660
like, what makes for great businesses almost
like a fractal of what makes sense for individual

00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:40.940
happiness and this is really what we're trying
to achieve at Zappos, and what we're hope,

00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:47.349
what I'm hoping that the book will, that just
came out, will help other businesses, is really

00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:51.849
think about happiness as a business model.

00:53:51.849 --> 00:53:54.809
And just want to leave you guys with thinking
about what percent of your time do you want

00:53:54.809 --> 00:53:59.880
to spend learning about the science of happiness
and how can learning about it really help

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:05.819
yourself personally, your business or your
brand? And if the research shows that businesses

00:54:05.819 --> 00:54:12.930
that have a higher purpose actually are able
to achieve more long term profits and if the

00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:19.059
research shows that for you, personally, if
you have a higher purpose then that actually

00:54:19.059 --> 00:54:25.420
leads to more happiness. Then think about
what is your business, your company's higher

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:34.140
purpose and what is your own higher purpose?
And I'm not up here trying to sell more shoes,

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.140
but--

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:36.140
[laughter]

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:41.010
if, through this presentation, you've been
inspired to focus more on making customers

00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:45.260
happier by really thinking more about the
customer experience or customer service or

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:51.660
you've been inspired to really make employees
happier by focusing more on company culture

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:55.530
or you've just been inspired to make yourself
happier by learning a little bit more about

00:54:55.530 --> 00:55:00.880
the science of happiness, if any of those
things have happened, then I'll have done

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:07.559
my part in helping Zappos achieve our higher
purpose, which is all about delivering happiness

00:55:07.559 --> 00:55:22.019
to the world. Thank you very much.
