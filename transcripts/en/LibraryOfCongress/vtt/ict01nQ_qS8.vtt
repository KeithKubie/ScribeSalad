&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.830
&gt;&gt; We're going to start things out
with structured data story time

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.600
from Rachel Shorey who
is a Software Engineer

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.640
in the interactive news
department at the New York Times.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.060 position:56%
She works primarily on large data
collection projects in the newsroom.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.800
Take it away, Rachel.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.100
&gt;&gt; Rachel Shorey: Hi.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.400
My name is Rachel Shorey.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.700
I'm a software engineer
at the New York Times

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.170
on the interactive news team, and
I'm going to tell you some stories.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.510
First, I want to talk a little bit

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.020
about the interactive
news team at the Times.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.260
We work on a variety of projects,
but we often end up being pulled

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.420
in when reporters get stuck
trying to deal with a data problem

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.530
or get a full understanding
of a data collection.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.710 position:56%
We pitch in when data is hard to get
or when there's just too much of it

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.120
for a reporter to deal with.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.610
We pitch in when the
form is unusable,

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.040
and we pitch in when there's just,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.750
when it's not even totally
clear where the dataset is.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.700
So, I'm here to tell you a
little bit about the story,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.410 position:56%
the data story behind the story that
you might see in the New York Times.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.420
This is a kind of thing that
happens when you get programmers

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.980
in the newsroom collaborating
with reporters.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.420
First, I want to tell you a
little bit more about the,

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.980
how the interactive
news team or my part

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.410
of the interactive news
team works and collaborates.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.580
One dataset that we've done a
lot of work on is election data.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.770
And, when I tell people that,
they say that's so great.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.080
I love the New York
Times election coverage.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.450
I especially love those
maps and graphics.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.750
And, I say, great.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.720
Me, too. Those are somebody else.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.760 position:56%
It is a great data project, and I,
we do in some ways contribute to it.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.470
If you imagine those as, like,
a really nice restaurant kitchen

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.740 position:56%
or something like that with like the
fancy dishwasher and the fancy sink

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.340
with the, like, hose that you
can wiggle around and the,

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.520 position:56%
and maybe one of those refrigerators

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.670
that has the cold water pump all
hooked into the water system.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:04.970
They're like, that's great.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.270
You're like the plumbing.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.570
And, I'm like.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.870
No. Really, we're more
like the thing

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.910
that connects the whole restaurant
to the city's water main.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.000
We're really far back there, but if
it breaks, you really know about it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.780
because there's water everywhere.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.690
So, that's how I think
of some of the work we do

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.340 position:56%
on the interactive team, but I think
the best way to talk about that is

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.640
to show it through the way that
these stories come together.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.940
So, here's a story.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.230
Once upon a time, there was
a troublesome web interface.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.530
Here's an example of a web
interface that caused one

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.830
of our reporters some trouble.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.760
This is the Bureau of Prisons,
and they make a website

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.120 position:56%
that makes it easy to find an
inmate who is in the federal system.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.070
Unfortunately, if you want
to find an inmate, or well,

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.500
I would say fortunately, actually,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.110
because there's some
privacy protection in here.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.500
You can't just type in an age
and find any inmate of that age.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.400
You have to know the person's name.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.880
You have to know some
information about them.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.980
So, in order to do this, you
have to know that information,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.110
and here's an example of
how a search might work.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.740
This is an inmate you
may have heard of.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.070
[ Laughter ]

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.170
As I said, to search for a person,
you have to enter their first

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.450
and last name, and it won't work
unless those names are correct.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.790
And, if you want to find a lot
of people, you're going to have

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.010
to enter them one at a time.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.100
A reporter came to me with a
large number of individuals

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.400
that she wanted to look up.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.350
She wanted to look them up because
they were convicted of terrorism

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.190
in U.S. courts, and she wanted
to know where they were located.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.230 position:56%
This was a big deal not too long ago
because there was a lot of question

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.930
about whether people in
Guantanamo could be tried or held

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.930
in the United States or in
the continental United States.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.540
So, she wasn't quite
sure what to do.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.550
She had all of these people
she wanted to look up.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.060
There were a lot of them, and it
was going to take a long time.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.020
And, to make matters worse, many
of them had three or four names,

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.500
and it wasn't quite
clear how they divided

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.430
into first, middle, and last name.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.510
So, thankfully, she
had the good sense

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.250
to apply a little software
notary to this problem

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.890
which she did basically
by turning around.

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.240
I happen to sit right
behind this person,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.000
so it was a very easy request.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.210 position:56%
She said, "Rachel, I need some help.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.030
How are we going to figure this,
get this data out of this website?

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.330
I know the data's there.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.470
I just need to get it."

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.210
Thankfully, the back end of
that website looks like this.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.860
Anybody who has a little
bit of familiarity poking

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.530
around the back ends of websites
will probably have a warm feeling

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.140
in their heart about how nice and
easy it is for a software developer

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.130
to pull down data like this
to process it and turn it

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.970
into usable records that
the reporter can use.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.270
I started working on this.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.040
She returned to calling
government offices

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.790
and asking them for
comment on things.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.240
Everyone worked on
what they did best.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.740
We ended up turning this into a
story that also included this map.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.370
We found out where the people
who were convicted of terrorism

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.200
in United States courts
are being held.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.460
Indeed, in the United States,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.800
and wrote an accompanying
story about it.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.060
So, using the information
that we were able to gather

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.370
as a collaboration between
a reporter and somebody,

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.550
a software engineer who
works on data things.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.670
We were able to tell a story
that countered the narrative

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.380
that was generally
being told at the time.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.170
I have another example.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.300
I really like this one.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.600
Another example.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.980
I really like this one.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.440
A doctor testified in court,
but his name was redacted.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.670
Some of his biographical
details were available, though,

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.000
including his data of birth, or his
date and place of certification.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.390
Sorry. Not date of birth.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.160
And some additional
biographical information.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.600
And, a reporter discovered

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.200
that there's this search
functionality available

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.320
for the American Board of
Psychiatry and Neurology

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.430
that lets you determine who
was certified or recertified

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.620
at a certain, in a certain
place and at a certain time.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.720
He knew, as I said,
the month and year

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.030
of the certification this
individual, but nothing else.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.230
If you look at this web
interface, you might note that date

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.200
of certification is not an option.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.240
What he really wanted
was to search by date.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.230
So, he's stuck, at this point.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.720 position:56%
Thankfully, he knew the phone
number of some local software nerds.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.570
This actually did happen late at
night, so he did call someone.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.870
This call did not go to me.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.450
It went to my colleague
Jeremy Bowers who was supposed

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.180
to be here today but
unfortunately could not join us.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.530
So, what Jeremy was able to
do is pull out all of the data

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.570
from the database and then do
the search by, and then give it

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.450 position:56%
to the reporter in this format where
he could search and sort by date.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.780
There are about 900
people who match the date

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.130 position:56%
that the reporter was interested in.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.960
He, what he did at that point, the
reporter is he started googling.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.440
He actually googled 88 of
these people, and then,

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.920
he found somebody who,
based on other information

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.780
that was available online, matched
other biographical information

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:00.280
in the testimony that he had read.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.960
So, yes. After doing this googling,
the reporting team sent somebody

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.760
to the house of this doctor,
knocked on his door, and they asked

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.560
for an interview, and they got
an hour on the record with him.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.750
This is really a story
that could not have come

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:17.250
about without true
reporter/programmer collaboration.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.610
We didn't have the idea to go
and pull data off that website,

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.800
and we didn't have the ability to
go and knock on the door and ask.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.100
I'm a software engineer.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.400
Can you imagine me
knocking on your door?

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.700
I'd probably be like, "Um.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.710 position:56%
Hi. Uh. I'm with the New York Times,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.250
and I'd like to ask
you some questions,"

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.790
and it probably wouldn't
have gone well.

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:39.600
So, so, it was really
a great collaboration.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.310
Here's the story that resulted.

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:45.700
It was actually part of a five-part
series about, about medical

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.450
and psychiatric care at Guantanamo
Bay, and this is a case where,

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.180
if you look at this story,
you would have no idea

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:53.890 position:56%
that a software engineer or any kind

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:58.380 position:56%
of data component may have been
involved because there's no graphic.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.270
There's nothing that
looks like data to you,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.590
but the data component was really
important in the reporting.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.350
It's how we found the source,
and it's how we told the story.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:12.210
Yeah. So, I'm going to
tell you another story.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.770
This is a story about data
that is too big for a reporter.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.220
Once upon a time, the data
just kept coming and coming.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.610
This is a lot of data.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.140
If you are, if you fiddle
around with data a lot,

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.090
you might be familiar with XML.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:27.430
Here is some.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.030
Can anyone tell what this is?

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.200
Can you guys see it well enough
to tell what this is data of?

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.470
Oh, we've got it over there.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:36.770
It's the Olympics.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.810
This is what the Olympics
looks like on the back end.

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.370
During busy competitions, we
can get 20 messages a second

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:48.310
from the Olympic data
stream, and yeah.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.430
So, it's a large dataset.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.930
Thankfully, in this
case, no one passes go.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.800
No one collects $200
before they call the nerds.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.240
Huge amounts of the Times
Olympics coverage is powered

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.520
by two news nerds sitting in a
press tent in the Olympic city.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.470 position:56%
My colleagues Michael Strickland and
Scott Blumenthal were there in Rio.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.970
They gave me a little
rundown of how that went.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.890
Our team keeps an, in fact,
our team keeps a collection

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.900
of Olympic mascots, the little
dolls, because the Olympics are

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.780
such a huge part of the
data work that we do.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.080
So, what do we do?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.380
We power graphics.

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.640
We get reporters the
most accurate information

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.370
in times and we answer questions.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:34.490
So, if you enjoy watching the New
York Times cover the Olympics,

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.570
if you enjoy things
like split times,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:38.610
if you want to see
those races that get run

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:39.920
in real time, and things like that.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.370
That's all thanks to
this data stream.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:46.040
In fact, my colleague Michael just
spent a week, like two weeks ago,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:49.890
in South Korea starting to prepare
for next year's winter Olympics.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:54.080
The news nerds from around the
world whose organizations cover the

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.820
Olympic feeds are actually
required to participate

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.250
in massive testing exercises
as part of their data contract

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.420
with the games that start
nearly a year in advance.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:09.230 position:56%
So, yes. If you enjoy watching this
kind of coverage, thank a news nerd.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.660
Anyway, this is actually one of
my favorite stories from Rio.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.030
I know it's not as exciting as
Katie Ledecky winning by 97 seconds

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.700
or whatever it was, but what I
like about this is that it was,

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.900
it's a narrative story
that came out of the data.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.590
So, one of the reasons
this story came about is

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.570
because my colleague
Scott Blumenthal

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.180
who is a software engineer is
also a huge boxing enthusiast

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.870
and boxes himself.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.410
So, he has been, he had his eye
on boxing from the beginning,

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.050
and he noticed, he was talking with
a reporter who was working on it.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.870
And, they noticed that there
had been, there was some scandal

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.200
about competitors who were
worried that judges were biased.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.370
And, they wanted to take a
little bit of a look at that.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.940
They wanted to know, like,
what are we seeing or whatever,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.350 position:56%
and when they started looking, they
realized that there were some judges

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:57.190
who just disappeared
from competition.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.430
Because judges are in that dataset.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.730
The judge of every match.

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.770 position:56%
There were judges who judged at the
beginning, and then stopped judging.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.420
And, there was no clear reason.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.440
They didn't, they weren't, like,

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.990
their ratings weren't
bad or whatever.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:10.660
They just, they just disappeared.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.590
And so, they were able to use
the data to find the story

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.130
that the judges were just gone.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.180
They were dismissed,
but it was secret.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.430
Let me tell you.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.560
There we go.

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.250
Let me tell you another story.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.140
Once upon a time, the
open government data was

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.040
in an adversarial format.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:33.470
Uh-oh. Heard some laughing there.

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:37.740
As you, as you may be
aware, we had a major event

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.220
in Washington this January.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.160
It was a Presidential Inauguration.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.800
Unfortunately, after every
party comes the bill.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.130
The cost of a Presidential
Inauguration is covered

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:49.670
by fundraising from the
Presidential Inaugural Committee,

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.190
and they have to release
a list of donors

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.170
to the Federal Election Commission.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.340
Here's what it looked like.

00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.650
What they did is they took this
report, and they delivered it

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.400
on paper to the Federal
Election Commission.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.600
Someone knocked on the door of 990
E Street and, or 999 I think it is,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.510
and handed it to the
Federal Elections Commission.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.760
I just want to point out that this
was not how they had to release it.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.210
It's not in statute that they
have to release it in paper.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.560
The last of them released
them online,

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.610
and it's not like they typed
this out on a typewriter

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.020
and that was the only
way they could do it.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.860
This is software.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.650
They just chose to hit
the "print" button instead

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.230 position:56%
of hitting the "send to FEC" button.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.760
Yes. So, it was not
machine-readable data.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.790
So, basically, the very next
call was, "Find me a nerd!"

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:40.120 position:56%
Unfortunately, the sad story here is
that the news nerds aren't actually

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.530
that much help in this situation.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.290
If the data is pretty badly
locked up, and we knew it.

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:45.590
But, what did we do?

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:47.080
We combined our nerd powers.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.190
This is a repository from an editor

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.170
at the Washington Post
named Steven Rich.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:58.260
He started manually cleaning
this filing in public.

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.100
Pretty quickly, he had
collaborations from reporters,

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:07.070
or from news nerds of various
sorts, a variety of organizations.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:10.720
I'm up there, you can see,
and a few other folks.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.660
So, in the end, we
had five different,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.240
five different organizations
contributing

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.530
to this kind of information.

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.840
Another fun fact about this day
is that I saw that this filing was

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.050
out as I was eating my breakfast,

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.250
and the next thing I remember
it was 4:00 in the afternoon

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.550
and I was sitting on my sofa

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.810
in my pajamas still manually
entering these things.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.060
So, it was a long day.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:33.030
Despite the collaboration, the
news organizations wrote their

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.330
own stories.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.080
It's not like we wrote one story,
but the background data was,

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:42.070
was in some ways collaboratively
managed.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.690 position:56%
The saddest news, in some ways for
the news nerds, is that by doing all

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:50.710 position:56%
of this work, we helped reporters
discover that there were some issues

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:55.720
with the filing and a few, just a
few errors in the way it was filed.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.510
So, that means they had
to file an amended report.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.810
What did that mean?

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.300
Another one of those paper filings
came out about three months later

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.840
that we all had to dig into again.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.900
They didn't file that one
electronically either,

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.430
as you can probably guess.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.170
So, let me tell you another story.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.200
Once upon a time, the
structured data was hiding.

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:20.500
Perhaps you've heard of this guy.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.390
He's, like, kind of famous I
guess these days, especially maybe

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:25.170
in this kind of a location.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.050
He wrote a play about
some guy named Hamilton.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.290
Apparently, people really liked it.

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:33.060
They liked it so much that they
bought, that tickets are now going

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.360
for thousands of dollars.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.480
I just want to point out
that on this thing it looks

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.920
like it says two tickets

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.900
because that's the
smallest number you can buy.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.070
But, this is actually
the price for one ticket.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.200
They would double it if
I bought two of them.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.530
So, this is how you buy a ticket
for "Hamilton" I guess these days.

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.730
One of the major problems, one of
the reasons that the tickets are

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.780
so expensive is the resale market.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.900
And people in New York,
understandably,

00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:59.300
at the New York times,
we're really interested

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:05.990
in how this market was working and
what was happening and how resale,

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.600
resale companies were using
bots to buy up these tickets

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.960
and then sell them again.

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.550
So, they thought, if only we could
monitor how dates are selling

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.010
out and what the costs are.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.090
I bet you'll never guess
what's coming next.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.140
Yes, they called in the nerds.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:23.910
In this case, it was
my colleague Tiff Fur,

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:26.530
and she basically wrote
a ticket buying bot.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.990
But, instead of buying tickets,
all it did was look at the prices

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.580
and whether things were sold out.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.200
So, it turns out a lot of people
at the Times were interested

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.410
in this data, potentially given
our proximity to Broadway there.

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.970
So, by recording this
ephemeral data,

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:43.290
Tiff was able to put together
a full structured dataset

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.770
that helped reporters understand
the scale of scalping on Broadway

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.810
for a variety of stories
they were telling.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:54.480
So, this is what, what they think
Hamilton scalpers are making

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.520
in these ticket sales.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.780
So, how am I doing on time?

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:03.080
Five minutes.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.640
Okay. I'm going to add one more
story that I don't have slides

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:06.890
for because it's particularly
relevant today.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:12.400
So, one recent situation where we
really wanted to get some data was

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.710
that the House of Representatives,
our neighbors right

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.100
across the street, were
voting on a healthcare bill.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.400
That's going to happen again today.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.710
The Senate gets to vote.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.340
Unfortunately, it's quite hard
to get the data out of the House

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.270
and the Senate quickly because a
lot of it is being recorded by hand

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.940
by the clerk of the chamber.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:33.150
So, what we ended up doing in the
House and what we will probably end

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.260
up doing in the Senate this
afternoon, I apologize if I have

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.640
to leave early to do this, is
have people actually sitting

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.580
in the chamber and quickly
writing by hand and doing things

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.180
like run out, take a
photograph, send it to someone

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.030
in New York who's going to
transcribe it, and run back in.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:51.560
We are literally, manually
entering data and sending it back

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:54.140
and transcribing it and
making it electronic that way.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.130 position:56%
In some cases, that's the fastest
way to do it, and it works very well

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.430
for us in getting House votes live.

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:03.920
Some people have said, "Why
do you need to do that?

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.430
The data's going to be
available in 40 minutes, maybe."

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.480
One thing that you can't get from
that data, especially in the House,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.930
is when people change their votes,

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.480
which is actually a pretty
common strategy in the House.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.170
Sometimes, it's accidental.

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:17.470
The way you vote in the House.

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.350
I learned a lot about how
you vote in order to do this,

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:21.410
in our bodies of representation.

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.890
In the House, what you do is you
slide a little card into a machine,

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.580
and then you hit, I
guess there's a big yes

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.360
and no button, and
you hit the button.

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.010
So, people just hit
the wrong button.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.950
There was a little
scandal a little while ago

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:32.700
about people letting
their kids vote for them,

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.210
which I think was causing
a few more of these errors.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.440
But, so, that's how they do it.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.920
If they vote incorrectly, they
can go and change their vote back,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.960
and there's some though that
people might vote strategically.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.050
They might say no, or they might
say yes and then if they don't,

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.090
if they're not really needed in
the final count, they might change.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.690
So, by recording the
votes in real time,

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.410
we were able to get
that information out.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.710
It was hard to do.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:00.670
We needed five people in
the chamber to do the House.

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:02.020
Thankfully, the Senate's
a little smaller.

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.750
We're hoping to be able to get
by with a few fewer people.

00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:08.750
So, like, every good
story, I'm going to end

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.570
with a "happily ever after".

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:15.120
Just the New York Times, we have
more programmers in the newsroom

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:18.160
than any other news
organization, and we do graphics

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.600
and digital storytelling.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.240
And, we do creative news
presentation, but we also work

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.120
with data for nearly every
definition of the word data.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:29.670
So, yeah. I'm ending this the
way good stories all end with a

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:34.390
"happily ever after", with
some very small exceptions.

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:39.690
So, thanks to my colleagues who
walked me through some of the work

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.420
that they did on data stories

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.140
so that I could share a more
wider perspective, and yeah.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:46.940
That's all I got.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:54.080
[ Applause ]

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.510

of the Library of Congress.
