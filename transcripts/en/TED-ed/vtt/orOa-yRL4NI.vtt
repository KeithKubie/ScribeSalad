00:00:07.144 --> 00:00:11.256
Peking House is my family-owned Chinese
restaurant in Willimantic, Connecticut,

00:00:11.256 --> 00:00:15.179
where I spent nearly 20 years growing up,
before we sold it.

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.073
My brother and I spent most of our time

00:00:17.073 --> 00:00:19.468
in the room in the back
called "the office."

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:21.820
"The office" was really
just a storage room,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.242
but it had our gaming systems,

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:29.243
and the game that we played the most
was called Super Smash Brothers Melee.

00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:30.685
For those who don't know,

00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:33.114
Super Smash Brothers Melee
is an older fighting game

00:00:33.138 --> 00:00:35.090
made for the Nintendo GameCube.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.934
My brother and I spent hours
playing this game,

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:42.727
so much that we even challenged
restaurant customers to matches.

00:00:42.727 --> 00:00:45.713
Eventually, my friends dragged me out
to a local tournament,

00:00:45.713 --> 00:00:49.242
where I ended up placing 13th out of 33.

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:53.388
Not bad, but definitely far from the best.

00:00:53.388 --> 00:00:55.644
After training with higher level players,

00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:58.257
and taking notes
on matches I found online,

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:00.648
I started to travel
to national tournaments,

00:01:00.648 --> 00:01:01.940
and before I knew it,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.141
I was being whisked around
the United States at the age of 17,

00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:07.517
all because of a video game.

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:10.635
Totally living the dream life, right?

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:12.382
This is how I ran head first

00:01:12.382 --> 00:01:16.587
into the competitive
Super Smash Brothers Melee community,

00:01:16.587 --> 00:01:20.170
a scene that I've been a part of
for nearly ten years.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.320
I'm sure that when
I say competitive gaming,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.562
you guys are imagining a room of people
hunched over their laptops.

00:01:25.562 --> 00:01:27.716
Sometimes it can look like that,

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:29.811
but more often
it looks something like this.

00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:33.406
(Laughter)

00:01:33.474 --> 00:01:36.516
Because Smash Brothers Melee
is such an old game,

00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:39.898
it requires those big,
boxy TVs to be played on.

00:01:39.898 --> 00:01:41.787
Our players are so dedicated,

00:01:41.787 --> 00:01:45.850
that they will actually lug these things
onto their flights as carry-ons.

00:01:45.874 --> 00:01:47.580
(Laughter)

00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:50.488
The community is also absurdly diverse.

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:54.437
This is a photo of Apex,
an annual tournament held in New Jersey.

00:01:54.437 --> 00:01:59.443
In 2013, over 1500 people showed up
from 16 different countries.

00:01:59.443 --> 00:02:02.344
I feel like if 16 countries
are flying out to New Jersey,

00:02:02.344 --> 00:02:04.345
that's saying something.

00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:05.495
Sorry, New Jersey.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.097
(Laughter)

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:08.729
In the gaming community,

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.865
I was known by my gamer tag "_milktea,"

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:17.341
but in real life,
I was still very much just Lilian.

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.673
When I was 17, I was shy and quiet,

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:25.972
and I was often bullied by my classmates
for being different, for being Asian.

00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:28.707
Some of them made fun
of the clothes I wore.

00:02:28.707 --> 00:02:31.306
Others asked me out on dates as a joke.

00:02:31.306 --> 00:02:34.037
Another called me a Chinese prostitute.

00:02:34.037 --> 00:02:35.320
But when I was "_milktea,"

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.685
I was part of a community
that welcomed and accepted me.

00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:45.469
Except what's missing from this picture?

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.247
Do you see any women?

00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:55.029
When the gender imbalance is this large,
social dynamics can become a bit skewed.

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:59.392
You get a lot more attention
than you normally would.

00:02:59.416 --> 00:03:00.940
[milktea is an angel]

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:04.605
At the time, I didn't understand why
I was getting this attention.

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:08.295
I just knew that it was so much better
than what I was dealing with at school.

00:03:08.332 --> 00:03:09.482
[I love Milktea.]

00:03:09.507 --> 00:03:10.857
Here's one of my favorites.

00:03:10.882 --> 00:03:12.882
[Milktea chan you are really attractive.]

00:03:12.907 --> 00:03:15.687
[If I had to rate you for beauty
I give you a 8 out of 10]

00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:19.045
[Only because I've been
crushing on another girl for a long time]

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:20.189
(Laughter)

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:22.934
But then, things took
a turn for the worse.

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:25.319
[Why is everyone blaming milktea lol?]

00:03:25.355 --> 00:03:26.555
[She is a harlot.]

00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.030
[She doesn't like Smash,
she just wants attention.]

00:03:29.057 --> 00:03:31.295
And then you started
to see comments like this.

00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:35.006
[coz you're only known in the scene
for being the subject of nerdy fantasies]

00:03:35.058 --> 00:03:37.026
[suck a **** in crappy smasher's dreams]

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.702
Over years,
I began internalizing all of this,

00:03:40.702 --> 00:03:45.244
and then I took these attitudes
and projected them onto other women.

00:03:45.244 --> 00:03:49.595
"Ew, why is she so girly?
Is she even a real gamer?"

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:53.003
I felt my voice shrinking
and the resent growing inside of me,

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:57.435
and eventually, I distanced myself
from the Smash community altogether.

00:03:57.435 --> 00:03:59.137
Fast forward a few years.

00:03:59.137 --> 00:04:02.225
I landed my first job in New York City.

00:04:02.225 --> 00:04:06.493
There, I realized that sexist behavior
didn't have to be the norm.

00:04:06.493 --> 00:04:10.267
But nevertheless, I stayed quiet
and withdrawn.

00:04:10.308 --> 00:04:12.632
Public speaking? Never going to happen.

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:13.679
(Laughter)

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:16.781
But then, this Facebook comment
appeared in my feed.

00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:20.052
[Stop chalking up the terror
of the internet to the Smash community.]

00:04:20.077 --> 00:04:22.186
[In general, we're very
accepting of females]

00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:24.538
I swear, at that very moment,

00:04:24.538 --> 00:04:27.570
my inner wallflower
spontaneously combusted.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.975
I started writing blog posts
that talked about my experiences

00:04:30.975 --> 00:04:33.269
and issues I had faced
within the community,

00:04:33.269 --> 00:04:36.540
and to my surprise,
they went viral within our scene.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.350
A well-known fighting game website
picked up one of my posts

00:04:39.374 --> 00:04:43.570
and later on, Polygon, a gaming site,
covered my future work.

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.618
All of this led to the creation
of The New Meta,

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:51.504
a panel that I cofounded and moderated
with the NYU Game Center.

00:04:51.504 --> 00:04:54.803
We roped in tons of women
from different gaming communities

00:04:54.803 --> 00:04:58.569
to talk about issues of sexism
within gaming.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.126
But the entire panel's point
was to raise awareness

00:05:02.126 --> 00:05:06.470
in a way that did not shame male gamers.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.686
As a woman, I was sexist,

00:05:08.686 --> 00:05:13.250
and even misogynistic,
against my own gender.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.917
Sometimes, when you've been immersed
in an environment for long enough,

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:23.412
it can be hard to differentiate
between harmful behaviors and normal ones.

00:05:23.412 --> 00:05:26.345
While some gamers
are intentionally malicious,

00:05:26.345 --> 00:05:27.955
some may not even realize

00:05:27.955 --> 00:05:32.868
that they're perpetuating sexist
behaviors in the first place.

00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:35.718
Empathizing with these gamers
is more productive

00:05:35.718 --> 00:05:37.835
than outright dismissing them.

00:05:37.835 --> 00:05:40.086
Initiate a conversation.

00:05:40.086 --> 00:05:41.755
Deconstruct these behaviors,

00:05:41.755 --> 00:05:44.750
no matter how obvious
they might seem to you.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.628
And please, leave
the accusatory tone behind.

00:05:47.628 --> 00:05:50.519
If I had been dismissed
as a sexist neckbeard,

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:54.214
I wouldn't be on this stage
talking to you right now.

00:05:54.214 --> 00:05:55.559
And to my surprise,

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:59.995
I found that people were willing
to change, and they wanted to help.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.369
[As a guy, how to treat girls
in eSports equally?]

00:06:02.394 --> 00:06:04.534
[Trying my hardest,
but advice would help.]

00:06:04.574 --> 00:06:07.923
And whenever I had any doubts,
I started to receive feedback like this.

00:06:07.947 --> 00:06:10.772
[I got a few female Smashers
into the scene because of you.]

00:06:10.812 --> 00:06:12.669
This entire experience has shown me

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.419
that my silence only further enabled
sexism within gaming.

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.150
Nobody is perfect.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:25.456
Internalizing biases and becoming lost
in them is deceptively easy.

00:06:25.456 --> 00:06:27.598
By being vocal,

00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:29.849
you force yourself and those around you

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.147
to reevaluate their actions
and their perceptions.

00:06:34.147 --> 00:06:36.564
Everyone in this room has a voice.

00:06:36.564 --> 00:06:39.872
You have to use it,
and you have to use it responsibly.

00:06:39.872 --> 00:06:42.244
Not only can you provoke change,

00:06:42.244 --> 00:06:44.731
but you can empower others to do so, too.

00:06:44.731 --> 00:06:46.452
Thank you.

00:06:46.498 --> 00:06:52.378
(Applause)
