00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.820
[Music]

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.840
If you suffer from social anxiety, you will fear certain situations.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.060
This can vary from person to person.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.920
Some fear speaking in front of groups of people.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.800
Some fear meeting new people.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.600
While others fear going to parties

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.020
or other types of social events.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.820
In whichever situation you fear arises,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.840
you'll probably experience sweating,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.180
flushing, feeling your heart race,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.200
or other symptoms of anxiety.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.520
One of the primary symptoms you'll feel

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.140
is thinking others will judge you

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.300
or find you lacking in some way.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.760
Not to worry, tho.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.500
No matter what your symptoms are or where they hit you,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.420
there are things you can do on your own

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.880
to deal with your social anxiety.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.320
Number One: Deep muscle Relaxation.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.880
Learning to physically relax

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.580
is one of the best ways to combat anxiety.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.800
It's impossible to feel both relaxed and anxious.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.720
For deep muscle relaxation,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.000
you will tense then relax the major muscle groups of your body,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.040
beginning with your feet and working your way

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.440
towards your head and face.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.060
Number Two: Slow breathing.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.300
Controlling your breathing when you're anxious

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.000
is another good way to deal with your emotions.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.140
When you're anxious,

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.620
your breathing becomes faster and more shallow

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.220
and as a result, you'll feel light-headed and dizzy,

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.300
bringing on more anxiety.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.560
Learning to breathe slower and more regularly

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.920
through your nose will help you calm down.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.100
This technique won't get rid of your anxiety,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.540
but it will help you better handle the situation

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.360
you're experiencing.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.900
Number Three: Visualization.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.600
The key to visualization

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.820
is to remember a place where you felt safe and comfortable.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.500
Once you remember this place,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.980
get a picture of it in your mind so clearly

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.500
that you can feel, see, smell

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.320
and even taste that place.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.000
This takes practice and patience

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.420
Number Four: Control your thoughts.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.680
Faulty thinking is a hallmark of social anxiety.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.660
Believing that others are judging you

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.320
and finding you faulty in some way

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.300
is a majorly detrimental way of thinking that occurs,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.820
so it is important to evaluate whether those thoughts are true.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.540
Ask yourself for proof.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.320
People with social anxiety

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.340
tend to overestimate how badly others think of them.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.640
Keep in mind:

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.320
your thoughts are only guesses about

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.640
what others will think or what you will do.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.280
How you think is a habit

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.300
and habits can be changed.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.080
Number Five: face your anxiety.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.060
Most people with social anxiety want to hide,

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.560
avoid, or run away

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.060
from whatever they're scared of,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.480
but by facing your anxiety instead,

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.040
you'll find that is usually something tou can tolerate

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.680
after a few exposures.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.540
However, you may want to try this on a situation

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.120
that brings a relatively low level of anxiety first.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.420
When using this method, focus on what's going on around you

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.620
instead of what's going through your mind.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.400
That should help you distract yourself from those anxious thoughts.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.960
Have you found any of the discribed methods helpful?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.680
