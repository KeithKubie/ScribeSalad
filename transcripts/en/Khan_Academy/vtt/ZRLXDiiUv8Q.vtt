00:00:00.816 --> 00:00:01.751
- [Voiceover] All right,
now we're gonna talk

00:00:01.751 --> 00:00:04.169
about the idea of an electric current.

00:00:04.169 --> 00:00:08.598
The story about currents
starts with the idea of charge.

00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:11.808
We've learned that we
have two kinds of charges,

00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:13.636
positive and negative charge.

00:00:13.636 --> 00:00:17.517
We'll just make up two
little charges like that.

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.646
And we know if they're the opposite sign,

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:24.019
that there'll be a force
of attraction between them.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.005
And if they have two like signs,

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:31.333
here's two charges that are both positive,

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:34.128
and these charges are
gonna repel each other.

00:00:34.128 --> 00:00:37.257
So this is the basic electrostatics idea,

00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:39.939
and the same thing for two minus charges.

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:40.934
They also repel.

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:45.101
So like charges repel, and
unlike charges attract.

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:48.594
That's one idea.

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:49.955
We have the idea of charge.

00:00:49.955 --> 00:00:52.942
And now we need a place
to get some charge.

00:00:52.942 --> 00:00:54.791
One of the places we
like to get charge from

00:00:54.791 --> 00:00:56.791
is copper, copper wires.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:59.619
A copper atom looks like this.

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:01.702
Copper atom has a nucleus

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.286
with some protons in it,

00:01:05.286 --> 00:01:09.010
and it also has electrons
flying around the outside,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.348
electrons in orbits around the outside.

00:01:11.348 --> 00:01:13.994
So we'll draw the electrons like this.

00:01:13.994 --> 00:01:17.244
There'll be orbits around this nucleus.

00:01:19.682 --> 00:01:21.349
Pretty good circles.

00:01:22.508 --> 00:01:25.737
And there'll be electrons in these.

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:27.525
Little minus signs.

00:01:27.525 --> 00:01:30.608
There's electrons stacked up in this.

00:01:32.706 --> 00:01:36.039
And even farther out, there's electrons.

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:43.332
So there's kind of a
interesting looking copper atom.

00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:46.563
Copper, the symbol for copper is Cu,

00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:48.896
and its atomic number is 29.

00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:53.917
That means there's 29 protons inside here,

00:01:53.917 --> 00:01:56.580
and there's 29 electrons outside.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.139
It turns out, just as a
coincidence for copper,

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.639
that the last orbital out here

00:02:03.182 --> 00:02:05.844
has just one electron in it,

00:02:05.844 --> 00:02:08.140
that guy right there.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.640
And that's the one

00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:13.281
that is the easiest to
pull away from copper

00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:17.303
and have it go participate in conduction,

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:18.970
in electric current.

00:02:21.354 --> 00:02:22.881
If I have a chunk of copper,

00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:26.464
every copper atom will
have the opportunity

00:02:28.326 --> 00:02:32.493
to contribute one, this one
lonely electron out here.

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:37.063
If we look at another element,
like for instance silver,

00:02:37.063 --> 00:02:41.148
silver has this same kind
of electron configuration,

00:02:41.148 --> 00:02:42.691
where there's just one out here.

00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:44.194
And that's why silver and copper

00:02:44.194 --> 00:02:46.777
are such good, good conductors.

00:02:48.624 --> 00:02:49.680
Now we're gonna build,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.712
let's build a copper wire.

00:02:51.712 --> 00:02:54.129
Here's sort of a copper wire.

00:02:55.897 --> 00:02:57.462
It's just made of solid copper.

00:02:57.462 --> 00:02:59.962
It's all full of copper atoms.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.763
And I'm gonna put a voltage across this.

00:03:08.685 --> 00:03:09.780
There's our little battery.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.645
This is the minus sign,
this is the plus side.

00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:15.645
And we'll hook up a battery to this.

00:03:19.634 --> 00:03:20.528
What's going on in here?

00:03:20.528 --> 00:03:24.528
Inside this copper is a
whole bunch of electrons

00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:28.271
that are

00:03:31.723 --> 00:03:32.861
associated with atoms.

00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:35.644
It's a neutral piece of metal.

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:38.898
There's the same number of
protons as there is electrons.

00:03:38.898 --> 00:03:40.866
But these electrons
are a little bit loose.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:43.385
So if I put a plus over there,

00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:44.441
that's this situation right here,

00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:46.881
where a plus is attracting a minus.

00:03:46.881 --> 00:03:49.236
So an electron is gonna sort of wander

00:03:49.236 --> 00:03:51.451
over this way and go like that.

00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:55.129
And that's gonna leave a net
positive charge in this region.

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:56.266
So these electrons are all gonna

00:03:56.266 --> 00:03:58.849
start moving in this direction.

00:04:00.188 --> 00:04:02.402
And down at the end,

00:04:02.402 --> 00:04:06.669
here, an electron is gonna
come out of this battery,

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.050
travel in here,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.976
and it's gonna go in there
and make up the difference.

00:04:10.976 --> 00:04:13.171
So if I had a net positive charge here

00:04:13.171 --> 00:04:16.584
from the electrons leaving
and going to the left,

00:04:16.584 --> 00:04:18.656
this battery would fill those in.

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:21.236
And I'm gonna get a
net movement of charge,

00:04:21.236 --> 00:04:26.072
of negative charge, around
in this direction, like this.

00:04:26.072 --> 00:04:28.104
The question is, how do I measure that?

00:04:28.104 --> 00:04:29.892
How do I measure or give a number

00:04:29.892 --> 00:04:32.391
to that amount of stuff that's going on?

00:04:32.391 --> 00:04:34.910
So we wanna quantify that,
we wanna assign a number

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.003
to the amount of current happening here.

00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:39.136
What we do is, in our heads,

00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:40.904
we put a boundary across here.

00:04:40.904 --> 00:04:43.139
So just make that up in your head.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.355
And it cuts all the
way through the copper.

00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:49.272
And what we know, we're
gonna stand right here.

00:04:50.204 --> 00:04:52.496
We're gonna keep our eye

00:04:52.496 --> 00:04:55.910
right on this boundary down in here.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.596
As we watch, what we're gonna do is,

00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:01.030
we're gonna count the number of electrons

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.530
that move by here,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.418
and we're gonna have a stop watch

00:05:05.418 --> 00:05:07.630
and we're gonna time that.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.463
So we're gonna get, basically,

00:05:08.463 --> 00:05:09.713
this is charge,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.103
it's negative charge,

00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:13.140
and it's moving to the side.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.151
What we're gonna do is, at
one little spot right here,

00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:18.868
we're just gonna count the
number that go by in one second.

00:05:18.868 --> 00:05:21.951
So we're gonna get charge per second.

00:05:23.765 --> 00:05:27.252
It's gonna be a negative charge moving by.

00:05:27.252 --> 00:05:29.585
That's what we call current.

00:05:32.088 --> 00:05:34.770
It's the same as water
flowing by in a river.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.520
That's the same idea.

00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:42.471
Now I'm gonna set up a different situation

00:05:42.471 --> 00:05:43.914
that also produces a current.

00:05:43.914 --> 00:05:45.459
And this time, we're
gonna do it with water,

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:46.709
water and salt.

00:05:49.133 --> 00:05:53.300
Let's build a tube of salt,
of salt water, like this.

00:05:55.086 --> 00:05:56.589
We're gonna pretend this is some tube

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:57.964
that's all full of water.

00:05:57.964 --> 00:05:59.851
I'm also gonna put a battery here.

00:05:59.851 --> 00:06:02.018
Let's put another battery.

00:06:07.694 --> 00:06:10.721
And we'll stick the wire into there.

00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:13.444
We'll stick the wire into there.

00:06:13.444 --> 00:06:15.110
This is the plus side of the battery,

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.320
and this is the minus side of the battery.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.403
Water is H20,

00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:24.822
and this does not conduct.

00:06:24.822 --> 00:06:26.984
There's no free electrons available here.

00:06:26.984 --> 00:06:27.879
But what I'm gonna do is,

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:29.300
I'm gonna put some table salt in it.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.962
This is ordinary salt
that you put on your food.

00:06:31.962 --> 00:06:36.057
It's made of sodium, that's
the symbol for sodium,

00:06:36.057 --> 00:06:38.474
and chloride, Cl is chloride.

00:06:39.552 --> 00:06:41.581
Sodium chloride is table salt.

00:06:41.581 --> 00:06:44.852
If we sprinkle some table salt into water,

00:06:44.852 --> 00:06:46.682
what happens is, these dissolve

00:06:46.682 --> 00:06:49.566
and we get a net plus charge here

00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:52.816
and a net minus charge on the chlorine.

00:06:53.792 --> 00:06:58.540
So out here is floating
around Na's with plus signs

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.707
and Cl's nearby, really
close nearly, with minuses.

00:07:13.241 --> 00:07:14.824
Let's keep it even.

00:07:18.565 --> 00:07:21.458
Now, when I dip my battery
wires into this water,

00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:22.558
what's gonna happen is,

00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:23.858
this plus charge,

00:07:23.858 --> 00:07:27.069
this plus charge over
here from the battery

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:30.035
is gonna attract the minus Cl's.

00:07:30.035 --> 00:07:34.038
So the Cl's gonna move
that way a little bit.

00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:35.502
And over here, the same
thing is happening.

00:07:35.502 --> 00:07:37.715
There's a minus sign here.

00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:40.465
There's a minus from the battery.

00:07:42.835 --> 00:07:45.720
That's going to attract this,

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.582
and it's also gonna repel Cl minuses.

00:07:49.582 --> 00:07:52.203
So what we get is a net motion

00:07:52.203 --> 00:07:55.703
of positive charge, plus q going this way,

00:07:59.253 --> 00:08:02.086
and we get minus q going this way.

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:08.476
How do we measure that current?

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:09.593
How do we measure that current?

00:08:09.593 --> 00:08:12.173
Well, we do it the same way as
we did up there with copper.

00:08:12.173 --> 00:08:14.776
We put a boundary through
here in our heads.

00:08:14.776 --> 00:08:15.859
We stand here

00:08:17.498 --> 00:08:21.072
and we watch the charges moving by.

00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:24.739
What we're gonna get
is some sodiums, Na's,

00:08:25.815 --> 00:08:27.148
moving this way,

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.387
and chlorines moving this way.

00:08:30.387 --> 00:08:31.951
Just like we showed here.

00:08:31.951 --> 00:08:32.784
Na

00:08:35.364 --> 00:08:36.766
moving this way.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.961
So there's gonna be plus charges
moving through the boundary

00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:41.115
and minus charges moving
through the boundary

00:08:41.115 --> 00:08:42.597
in the opposite direction.

00:08:42.597 --> 00:08:45.159
If I take the total sum of that.

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:47.778
For example, if I see one Na go this way

00:08:47.778 --> 00:08:50.440
and one Cl go this way,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.370
that's equivalent to two charges

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:54.828
moving through the boundary.

00:08:54.828 --> 00:08:55.906
Hope that makes sense.

00:08:55.906 --> 00:08:58.039
It's equivalent to two charges,

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:00.111
one going this way and one going this way.

00:09:00.111 --> 00:09:02.326
Because they have opposite signs,

00:09:02.326 --> 00:09:05.536
they add together and make two charges.

00:09:05.536 --> 00:09:07.286
In this case, current

00:09:12.078 --> 00:09:15.245
is equal, again, to charge per second.
