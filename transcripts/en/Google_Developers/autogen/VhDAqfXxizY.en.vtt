 contact with technology had not been 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.260
 quite broad I got the mail 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.700
 because I'm registered more in the part 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.010
 as entrepreneurship beyond 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.660
 technology came to us an email 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.060
 we wrote that it was a process of 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.870
 different filters filters by internet 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.820
 and then a physical filter already in Bogota and 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.950
 It has been an incredible experience 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.110
 get here to know we see that 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.140
 all this entrepreneurial environment and 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.210
 technological has been quite 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.190
 enriching 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.640
 hello my name is catarina partner of

 argentina good one month before more or less 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.050
 before the google contest alone 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.470
 had been with a project and there was 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.780
 google at the doors of argentina and 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.110
 well I wanted to take you the project and 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.150

 getting into forums and google stuff 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.840
 I found out about the contest between there were several 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.460
 filters as my partner said so 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.320
 when I was the competition and we won 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.720
 with my equipment the machine could create it 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.130
 it was like a dream come true is 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.660
 great because one makes you think that 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.010
 really when you want something with 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.930
 much strength and with much desire 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.360
 you can really achieve it and that google 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.870
 is open those opportunities is like 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:29.690
 what does it do to you to create it much more and 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.880
 nothing we are here and extremely happy and 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.450
 proud to be the representatives of 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.450
 our countries 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.349
 thanks, what do you think if we talk about a 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.269
 little more about how they imagined that 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.310
 it was going to be the competition they felt 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:48.230
 when they won and what they did 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.510
 specifically within each of 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.459
 your projects to bring your equipment to 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.989
 this triumph then talk 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.230
 briefly what does the project do for 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.230
 favor 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.540
 a project an application learn to 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.280
 differentiate trains from academia like 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.580
 identification elements 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.660
 he never works in a game 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.959
 identification account a prize was a 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.959
 great challenge because learning so much with 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.530
 just three days is one thing that I 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:25.160
 it helped a lot went to the documentation of 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.680
 android to be very complete the 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.919
 central and all three networks is 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.440
 decorated and sent the agency highlighted 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.130
 pretty explanatory to create 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.710
 professional and teaching presentations 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.610
 our voucher was super I started and 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.610
 here we are 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.750
 well my project was max point and the 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.160
 idea of ​​match point is mainly 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.020
 make small businesses the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.370
 entrepreneurs do not have to deal with 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.410
 those activities that are not the core 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.680
 of your business if you are a bakery and 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.390
 you your job is to make bread you would not have 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.860
 why deal so much with the part of 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.480
 lawyers with the marketing part 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.940
 we have what we intend 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.680
 on the platform is that specialists 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.660
 know that these activities are done by 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.190
 those entrepreneurs and so on 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.490
 devote your time more to things 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.320
 important my role within the group was 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.590
 mainly the project manager is 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.300
 say at the end of each day they were or was a 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.830
 three-day event and at the end of each 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.200
 day what we did was that we made a 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.000
 pitch that is more or less a speech one 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.400
 to the sale of the idea and my function 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.050
 main was how to approach the idea how 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.750
 develop it in a way that was more 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.370
 in Spanish for all the people who 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.740
 were not just like the side 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.620
 technological but that I had as a 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.180
 look much closer to the people and 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.340
 Well, very happy at the moment 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.520
 we won it was a great experience and so 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.550
 a spectacular prize me that we have 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.230
 well my role logically was designed 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.720
 but at the same time 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.700
 I do not know how a woman was like something different 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.410
 because it was like the vision of a woman 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.600
 within the group and the truth that touched me 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.090
 a group beyond that there are fights 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.220
 internal to each other but from 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.600
 joke the truth that we were a team that 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.150
 is the principle we join the three 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:11.790
 days a house we follow the marathon of 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:14.790
 night we were recontra focused on what 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.220
 what we wanted to do and we had something left 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.410
 spectacular and it is record we attend very 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.060
 proud of when mission we won 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.940
 and we could not believe it and well we 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.380
 we find everyone here today and with lives 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.990
 to follow this project good as 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.790
 all the groups that we earn the same as 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.490
 you can notice we are in the garage and there 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:35.580
 a spontaneous concert at this time 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:38.139
 for all developer visitors 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.580
 box then 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.630
 let's continue though a little bit of 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.450
 noise will ask you to speak a 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.910
 little bit stronger but I want to want 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:50.480
 continue this conversation with your 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:52.490
 expectations how they look after the 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.889
 experience of the level or by you that 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.110
 they think it's different and I would like 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.090
 top with something a little bit deeper 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.730
 that they believe is necessary for the 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.980
 women in their communities follow 

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.690
 doing technological things and go into 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.950
 this world of entrepreneurship 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.950
 creativity development 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.170
 for me it has been an experience 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.340
 amazing 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:19.949
 I opened my head 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.139
 of the whole world of technology and 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:25.500
 creativity today 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:29.580
 after google for me it was a 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:32.580
 show without being able to see all respect and has 

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:35.490
 been the last double basically went to 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:39.210
 my joint perspective to give ideas 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:41.570
 new and put into practice to grow 

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:46.290
 increasingly as a professional he confessed 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:48.449
 when to the community without competitors 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:51.570
 There are female nurses 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:55.910
 brazil iwasaki 

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:58.169
 is Real Madrid and no more vision more 

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:02.070
 creative of the world you take it home 

00:07:58.169 --> 00:08:06.150
 the local channel 5 manager is missing 

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:08.220
 practice knowledge and time is 

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.919
 will get acquired without arrival to 

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:14.210
 Internet 

00:08:09.919 --> 00:08:16.830
 information books palestras competitions and 

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:19.020
 services you know and busses and sign did 

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:21.740
 the time was treated way be you 

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:25.960
 to actively deal with 

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.960
 Christ project climate jump 

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:31.560
 Well, as a woman, my special 

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.790
 it is mainly to realize a 

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:35.100
 very different world 

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:36.270
 ok initially because I do not have a 

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.450
 background in the technological part 

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:41.700
 then get to a place of google 

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.890
 for me it was going to be a place like more than 

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.130
 engineers more than programmers like 

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:48.750
 something much farther from my reality and the 

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:50.280
 made to get to a place and if 

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.620
 you discover many things and it's a world 

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.560
 new is in many ways a language 

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:57.210
 different if it's a very accessible place and 

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:58.770
 it's a question that many of us have 

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.050
 very afraid of technology like what 

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:02.700
 we see very distant as something that does not happen 

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.400
 to our countries or not our 

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.110
 means and it is more to see it as something that is 

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.150
 very close and from which you can learn 

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:12.300
 very easy and that there is a quantity of 

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:14.940
 group clubs tools 

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.800
 sessions and activities that can 

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.810
 help and that you can enter as a 

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:20.520
 this world of technology then 

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.120
 let's say that in the part as of 

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:26.220
 technological environment for women 

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:28.890
 mainly as more events equal 

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.710
 let's say that if now with the experience 

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.329
 to be as you are as more spokesperson as 

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.610
 what can you tell many people 

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:37.199
 experience of what you lived that 

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:40.199
 it really is a world that if you can 

00:09:37.199 --> 00:09:41.549
 enter and it's a world that is open and 

00:09:40.199 --> 00:09:43.920
 that you are have many possibilities 

00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:46.110
 in which you can participate then 

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:48.959
 it's like more events more involvement 

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:50.670
 of different women not only for 

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:53.660
 the technological ones but also as 

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:53.660
 in any other field 

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.200
 good and my message for women 

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.510
 He is also justly told with me 

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.940
 experience the fact that 

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.740
 for me it is what I get from the 

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:07.010
 you tried this thing of what is rich that 

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.570
 is the complement or the fact of 

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:11.610
 can learn so much from a programmer 

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.590
 as another person who does not dedicate us 

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.840
 specifically what I do is like 

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:17.400
 that you learn and we see a lot a lot a lot 

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.410
 not only in my group but from other groups 

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.540
 and this is exactly what I want 

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:24.390
 convey women right that they do not 

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:25.860
 it's a thing that if it's better or worse if 

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:28.140
 who is better men to women 

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:31.140
 break this rivalry and start 

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.820
 see what everyone really has as their 

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:37.050
 positive aspect and that we can contribute 

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:39.420
 much from each place and just this 

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:43.370
 gender difference makes nothing that 

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:45.750
 we have two very good things and each one 

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:47.490
 it stands out well stored something else and 

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:51.590
 just supplement this to get 

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.590
 to something much richer among all 

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.190
