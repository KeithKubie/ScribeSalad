&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Good morning,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.490
and welcome to the final
talk of this season.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.640
We're already looking
forward, of course, to 2019

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.330
and another wonderful
set of talks.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.260
And maybe another
visit from Alex.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.830
I'm Stephanie Marcus from
the Science, Technology,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.650
and Business Division.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.730
And our speaker has
been here three times.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.590
That's more than anybody
in the series, ever.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.570
And this will be th
14th year next year.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.370
And three times in three years.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.820
And he is our Mr. Sunshine.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.930
He's the, [laughter].

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.540
Yes, oh no!

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.550
He spilled his water.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.850
[Laughter]

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.150
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Didn't
hit any ca-- .

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.100
Didn't hit any cables,
so we're good, okay.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.400
Alright.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.340
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: I
gotta get out of here.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.270
[Laughter] So Alex
is the, what are you?

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.040
The Associate Director
for Science?

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.420
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: That's correct.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.590
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Heliophysics division.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.640
But more, probably more than
dealing with all the data coming

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.140
in from the various missions.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.390
He loves to talk
about what he's doing.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.030
He's a great communicator.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.330
That's his passion.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.440
And he and his wife
developed a website

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.740
which you might want
to check out.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.960
It's called oursuntoday.org.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.530
And it has everything solar.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.030
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: The--
thesuntoday.org.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.330
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Oh, sorry.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.630
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: That's okay.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.930
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
Thesuntoday.org

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.230
and I think I will leave.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.010
And please welcome Alex Young.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.310
[Applause]

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.610
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Thank you.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.930
Let me, let me, let
me refill the water.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.230
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Okay.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.180
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Now
no, no harm there.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.470
So. I figured it
would have been me

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.770
if it was going to be anybody.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.790
So. That's why I didn't want
to have too much more coffee.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.090
I always start getting shaky.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.940
So thank you.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.670
It's really great to be here.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.240
I, I love this forum.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.120
Except for the fact that
I have to stand still

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.490
in front of the podium.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.820
But otherwise, this is
really, really exciting.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.320
And so I encourage you,

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.490
if you didn't get any NASA
goodies, to get some outside.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.570
But also to look at the
books, the journals.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.140
There's a little
bit of my stuff.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.740
But this is really not
about my work so much.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.600
Today we're going to talk
about heliophysics in general.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.900
What is heliophysics?

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.120
And in particular,
we'll also talk

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.730
about the new mission,
Parker Solar Probe.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.370
Which was launched in
August of this year.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.340
And I'm not going to tell
you too much about it yet.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.320
I will get to it.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.480
But I want to give you a feel
for what heliophysics is.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.300
Kind of my slant on it
and why it's important.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.060
Not just for its own science.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.430
But for all of the
science that NASA does.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.660
It actually plays a very
unique role in NASA.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.560
And because of that, I
actually want to start off

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.330
with some imagery
that personally,

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.390
for me I think is the
most powerful imagery

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.650
that NASA has ever taken.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.320
Some of you may be
familiar with this.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.540
But what you're looking
at is called the,

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.180
the Hubble Ultra-D field view.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.220
And so there was a spot in
the sky where if you look up,

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.760
you don't really see any stars.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.990
Okay? Even in the
blackest, in the, in the,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.760
in the darkest areas,
there are no stars.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.990
But scientists pointed
Hubble into that little,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.210
small piece of the sky.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.430
Not much more than
maybe this big around.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.010
And stared at it for
a long, long time.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.640
Many, many weeks.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.300
And what they found was this.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.390
Everything you see in
this image is a galaxy.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.070
Not a star, but a galaxy.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.000
So ten thousand galaxies can
be seen in this little tiny,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.480
tiny swatch of the sky.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.200
And to think about it.

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.820
Every single one of those
galaxies contains hundreds

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.490
of billions of stars.

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:20.950
So these galaxies are
kind of like the atoms

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.340
or the molecules
maybe, in our body.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.740
But of the universe.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.950
But the fundamental
part of these,

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.090
the fundamental particles, just
like the fundamental particles

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.870
that make up our bodies,
our subatomic particles.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.070
The fundamental particles
here are in fact stars.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.130
Billions and billions of stars.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.640
Make up these billions
and billions of galaxies.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.560
So ten thousand galaxies in this
little, tiny swatch of the sky.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.200
If we look everywhere
over the whole sky.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.350
We're talking hundreds
of billions of galaxies.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.010
Each containing hundreds
of billions of stars.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:03.700
And on top of that,
containing billions and billions

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.770
and billions of planets.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.910
In each one of those galaxies.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.480
More than the stars.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.780
So just mind-boggling.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.750
So the, this is to me one of
the most awe-inspiring images

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.640
that NASA has ever,
has ever recorded.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.750
But the reason I focus
on this is because to get

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.420
down to the core
piece is the stars.

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.280
It's made up of these
fundamental building blocks.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.160
And we have something
really special.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.730
We have one in our
backyard that's very close.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.850
And that we can see
in incredible detail.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.530
And that's what I'm going
to talk about today.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.550
Is our own star, the sun.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.490
Now looking at it
from the ground,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.520
we get beautiful
sunrises and sunsets.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.070
But the sun itself is not that
interesting when we just look

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.880
at it from the ground.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.260
Now, you've probably heard this,

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.030
especially during the
eclipse last year.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.380
You should never look at
it with the naked eye.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.860
Without proper filters,
proper protection.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.500
Because it's in fact so bright.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.330
And even if we were to say
look at it with a camera.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.470
We just get this sort
of washed-out image.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.490
Okay? Now, I can look at it
with a filter, the same kind

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.330
of solar-safe viewing glasses
that we had for the eclipse.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.580
And even there, I really just
see kind of a yellow ball.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.520
A simple, plain ball.

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.860
It's not very interesting.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.750
Not very exciting.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.040
Maybe we might see some
little spots on it.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.340
Some black spots.

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.640
We call those sunspots.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.610
When they're really big,
when the sun is active.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.370
And the sun actually
has an activity cycle.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.980
An activity season
of roughly 11 years.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.860
And when it's most active,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.670
you can in fact see
some of these sunspots.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.890
When you look with the
solar viewing glasses,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.430
you can see them
from the ground.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.230
But there is one special
time from the ground

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:10.420
when we can see the sun
in all of its glory.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.630
Or at least a lot of its glory.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.030
And some of you maybe
were lucky enough.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.890
Who saw the total solar
eclipse last year?

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.810
Now who saw totality?

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.110
Okay, wow.

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.410
That's a lot.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.910
That's a good percentage of
those who saw the eclipse.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.720
This is what we see
during that special time.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.370
When the moon is the
same size in the sky.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.620
The same apparent size,
and blocks the sun out.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:47.050
Blocks that bright disk which is
in fact a million times brighter

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.530
than the outer part of
the sun's atmosphere.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.720
And this is what's revealed.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.100
All of that structure.

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:55.730
I so want to just
run over there and,

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.130
and sort of touch this
and talk about it.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.620
But all of this structure
is real.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.890
These are in fact magnetic
fields coming out of the sun.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:10.010
the same magnetic
fields that you can feel

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.610
when you put a magnet
on your refrigerator.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.900
That invisible force.

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.900
But in fact, coming
out of the sun,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.160
the sun's very atmosphere
lights it up and traces

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.690
out these magnet fields.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.700
These are coming out of
those sunspots, in fact.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.770
Because those sunspots
we see are these regions

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.240
of intense magnetic field.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.660
And this is what's
driving the sun.

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:37.730
But that brief moment during a
total solar eclipse we see this

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.560
kind of detail in structure.

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.300
And get a glimpse that the
sun is way more interesting

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.280
than maybe we thought.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.140
But let's step outside
of the atmosphere.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:54.410
Go up above and look at the
sun with telescopes from space.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.020
And we can now see it
in even more detail.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.010
In even more interesting light.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:04.370
There's a lot of light
that doesn't make it

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.670
through the atmosphere.

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.090
Which is good for us.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:11.500
X-rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet,
extreme ultraviolet.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.120
Our atmosphere is actually
quite thick and protects us.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.740
But we can't see the sun in
those wavelengths of light.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:21.240
And it turns out that's where
it really gets interesting.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.990
So let's look at
the sun from space.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.830
In extreme ultraviolet.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.350
This is what it looks like.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:35.090
Now this is anything but
simple, and anything but boring.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.970
You see there are these
flashes that are occurring here.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.430
In fact, these bright
patches are

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.870
where the sunspots are, okay?

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.060
When I look at them in
more energetic light:

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:48.890
x-rays, ultraviolet.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.050
They're actually
bright, they're not dark.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.120
Because they're really hot,
and I'll talk more about that.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.630
But you see there's a flash.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:59.990
Which is a solar flare.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.650
It's a sudden release of light.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.890
Enough energy is
released in that flash.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.210
To power the world
for 100,000 years.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.090
Okay? And at the same time,

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.710
you see there's this
flicker across the surface.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.910
That's in fact a wave traveling
millions of miles an hour.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.170
There's a giant blast wave
when this flare happens.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.460
And it's pushing material
away and out into space.

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:29.090
Billions of tons of material,

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.720
something we call a
corona mass ejection.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.630
It's being pushed out
by the magnetic field.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:39.180
And in fact is it just, is
just as energetic as the flare.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.590
Because it's moving so
fast and so much stuff.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:44.020
It actually has the
equivalent amount of energy.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.910
And this flare, this
light and all

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:50.720
that material is
filling the solar system.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.090
And they're even driving
these huge shockwaves

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:59.210
that accelerate particles
to close to speed of light.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.250
And we get these
blasts of particles.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:04.160
So all of this stuff
is traveling

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.450
through the solar system.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:11.290
And it's happening to
some degree all the time.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.620
Little tiny ones are
happening all the time.

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.840
And then every so often, we
have the bigger one like this.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.680
But with these telescopes, I
can in fact look at the sun

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.190
at ten different
wavelengths of light.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.850
So here is the sort of
simple sun we're used to.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.460
Just the, the yellow ball.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.120
You do see some sunspots.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.940
Okay? Now if I can, oops.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.730
Supposed to start a video.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.660
And it's not starting.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:45.650
There we go.

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:48.330
Okay. Now I'm taking
little slices

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.880
and showing actually
other wavelengths.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:56.120
Starting with ultraviolet,
extreme ultraviolet.

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:59.500
All the way up into the
very edge of x-rays, okay?

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.950
I can take these
images simultaneously.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:06.580
And you see that, see there's
where the sunspots are.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.040
But now they're bright.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.700
And you see as it moves around,

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.610
how much different the
different wavelengths of light.

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.270
How different the sun is.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.400
And in fact, what you're seeing

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.700
in different wavelengths
of light.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:27.250
As we go from the surface
which is about 6000 degrees

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:35.080
up to 10,000 degrees, 80,000
degrees, a million degrees,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.700
up to about 10 million degrees.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:41.730
So as we go up into
more energetic light.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.710
We're in fact looking
at higher temperatures.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:48.750
But also, as we're doing that,

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.290
we're also looking higher
up in the atmosphere.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.290
So this is something
really weird.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:59.000
As I go from the surface,
which is 6000 degrees.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.690
And move up, it gets hotter.

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:04.260
That doesn't make any sense.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:08.090
I mean, when I go up to a
campfire and stand up next

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:10.950
to the warm fire, and
walk away from it.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:12.800
It gets cooler.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.990
When I move away from the
heat source, it gets cooler.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.290
That's what we're used to.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.610
Well, that's not
what's happening here.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.680
On the sun, as you go
higher in the atmosphere,

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.130
it goes higher in temperature.

00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:33.660
So this is one mystery about the
sun that we're going to explore.

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.230
But what else is going on
that's kind of strange?

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.270
So here's another ultra--
extreme ultraviolet image.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.420
You can see these are those
magnetic fields coming

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.970
out of the sunspots.

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.570
Again, they're normally
invisible,

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.090
but the sun's atmosphere
lights them up.

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:55.600
Okay? And all of this
material is heating.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.110
And expanding away from the sun.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.930
And in fact flows out into space
in what we call the solar wind.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.870
So the sun's atmosphere
is getting hotter,

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.660
but it's also expanding away.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.370
And is expanding super-fast.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.970
Millions of miles an hour.

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:14.970
It's streaming away.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:18.100
The solar wind is filling
the whole solar system.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.580
It's carrying away
the magnetic field.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.480
And it's interacting
with everything.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.470
In fact, it creates a giant
bubble around the solar system.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:30.810
I'll show you a cartoon of this.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.230
So there's the solar
system, there's the sun.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.150
And those particles
are streaming away

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.780
in that magnetic field.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.330
And it creates a
protective bubble around us.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.650
Protecting us from
interstellar space,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.050
all the other stuff out there.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:50.430
And that is the heliosphere.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:53.010
So helio, for sun.

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:57.660
This is the sphere of
the sun's influence.

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:04.860
And heliophysics is the study of
the sun and the sun's influence

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.540
on everything in
the solar system.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:11.500
Because in fact, all of this
stuff, this light, matter,

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.500
magnetic fields that are
streaming away from the sun.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:16.770
Are interacting with
other planets.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.490
With their atmospheres.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.610
With the planet's
own magnetic fields.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:24.350
With comets, asteroids.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:28.910
Even the stuff and
people we put into space.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:32.630
And so heliophysics is
the study of all of that.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.630
And all of that interaction.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.660
Now one of the aspects
of that is space weather.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.210
And I'm not going to talk
a lot about space weather.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:43.310
I actually gave a talk about
that a couple years ago.

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:45.990
But space weather is really all

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.720
of that exciting,
dynamic phenomena.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.420
Those solar flares, those
coronal mass ejections.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:57.580
And especially how do
they influence technology?

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.080
Because all of this
is electromagnetic.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.960
And all of our technology,
our cell phones,

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.850
our satellites are
electromagnetic.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:09.770
They're driven by
electricity and magnetism.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.070
So all of this stuff
coming off the sun interacts

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.630
with our technology.

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.480
Now we're very protected

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.610
to a large extent here
on the, on the earth.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:22.560
And it doesn't physically
impact us.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.140
But it does impact satellites.

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.730
It can be, create a dangerous
environment for astronauts.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.100
And in the most extreme case,

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.080
it can actually impact
our power grids.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.030
So that's one thing
that's really important

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.150
about studying space weather.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:41.070
When we get back
to the sun itself,

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.710
we want to understand
the fundamental things

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.290
about the sun.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:47.890
So the first one being
why does it get hotter

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:49.600
as the atmosphere moves away?

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.760
And why does the solar
wind expand away?

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.840
And actually one of the
things it does is it

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.140
actually accelerates.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.680
It gets faster as
it's moving away.

00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:02.040
So that's another strange
mystery about the sun.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.500
And then lastly, kind of
back to that space weather.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.670
All of these huge explosions,
I'm going to show you real data

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:10.100
of what that looks like.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:13.400
So there's one of those
explosions on the sun.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.390
Material blasting away at
millions of miles an hour.

00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:20.240
And if I zoom away
and look at the sun.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.970
Blocking out the bright disc,

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.290
and kind of creating
an artificial eclipse,

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.870
this is what it looks
like from space.

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:34.310
So there you see that's that
material actually unwinding.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.470
It almost looks like a
piece of string unwinding.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.800
Because that's the magnetic
field in that material

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.430
which is all twisted up.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:43.810
And it's unwinding
as it moves away.

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:49.150
So all of this, all of this
stuff from the sun, this energy.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:56.070
Is filling the solar system
with energy and material.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:18:01.900
And this is actually one
of the most beautiful

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.630
and obvious manifestations
of this.

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:07.030
It's the aurora.

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.590
So when I mentioned
that this material

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:11.880
and energy interacts
with a planet.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.220
With its atmosphere
and its magnetic field,

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:16.470
when that helps in earth.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.040
We get the Northern
and Southern Lights.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.620
This is seen from
the, from the ISS.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.180
This is actually over
the Indian Ocean.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.300
So this is the Southern Lights.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:29.240
But you see all of
those curtains.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.350
Those are particles that
originated from the sun.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.540
Interacting with the atmosphere.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.830
And they're causing it
to get excited and glow.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:41.540
We have oxygen and nitrogen

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:45.230
which gives us greens,
blues, and reds.

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:47.730
To create this aurora.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:50.870
But this is just one of
the manifestations of all

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.190
of this stuff coming
off the sun.

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:57.380
Here is kind of what
it looks like.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.020
If we could actually
see those particles.

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.820
We sit in this sea of
particles coming from the sun.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.330
The solar wind and
then every so often,

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.220
there's one of these coronal
mass ejections which is like.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.820
You can think of the solar wind
as sort of the background ocean.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.150
And then these giant
waves on top of it.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:18.730
Those are those coronal
mass ejections.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:22.900
And that's what happens
when it passes by the earth.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.610
In fact, here you see
the particles moving

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:27.910
around the earth.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.740
Being kind of repelled
by it a little bit.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.980
Because the earth
has a magnetic field.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:39.330
And these particles interact or
are repelled by magnetic fields.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.130
Some planets have magnetic
fields like the earth.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.340
Some planets don't,
like Venus or Mars.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:48.550
And so how they interact
is very different.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.690
And very important
to understand.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:55.640
Especially, for example, if we
want to someday move, go to Mars

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.150
and have people on
the planet's surface.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.850
The environment is
very different.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:08.680
But the big point here is
that space is not empty.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:13.250
We often hear about the
idea of the vacuum of space.

00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:14.610
With this sort of implication

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:16.810
that there's really
not much there.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:22.300
But in fact, space is full
of all of these particles.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.030
And electromagnetic fields
originating from the sun.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:29.340
Interacting with all
the different objects.

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.460
And this is what
scientists found

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.610
out at the beginning
of the Space Age.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:41.020
So 60 years ago, in fact, 1958.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.220
Group of scientists led by
a man named James Van Allen,

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.490
launched Explorer I.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:53.110
And that rocket traveled
through the outer parts

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.410
of the atmosphere.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.940
Very, very high up.

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:00.560
Through something that was,
we had possibly some ideas

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.670
about called the
radiation belts.

00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:08.910
And what we found out was
we flew Geiger counters

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.480
in space, basically.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.400
And found out it
was full of stuff.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.530
Full of radiation, a very
complicated environment.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:18.790
So there's Van Allen.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:22.160
And this was the
beginning of the Space Age.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.740
The beginning of
space exploration.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:30.010
And so what that group did
is they formed a, a team.

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.160
To put together a bucket list

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.400
of what are the big problems
we want to solve, okay?

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.290
And right about that same
time in 1958, this gentleman,

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.970
Eugene Parker, published
a paper.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.700
Predicting the solar wind.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.310
We didn't actually
know at that time

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.380
that the solar wind existed.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.300
And he said it did,
theoretically.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.220
He worked out what he said
are very simple equations.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:59.520
I've looked at them.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.820
They're not quite so simple.

00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.120
But he's a really sharp guy.

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.270
[Laughter] But very
fundamental equations.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:08.450
And just sort of worked it out,
and it just sort of fell out.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:09.900
People didn't, a lot of
people didn't believe him.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.430
He had trouble publishing
the papers.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.810
But he stuck be what
he knew to be true.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:18.560
And he published
this paper in 1958.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:21.040
And then a couple years
later, sure enough,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.630
some future missions showed.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.400
That yes, solar wind exists.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.130
And he predicted it in 1958.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:30.160
And that was the
beginning of the Space Age.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.060
And in some ways, the beginning
of modern heliophysics.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.790
And in fact astrophysics.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:41.260
One of the items on that
bucket list of things

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:46.660
that scientists wanted to
do was to go to the sun.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.140
And we had other items,

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.820
like building a giant
telescope in space.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.120
We have the Hubble.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.680
That's an example of
the result of that.

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:55.820
And there's several other
things that were done.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.950
So the last item that
hadn't been achieved

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:02.880
yet was sending a
spacecraft to the sun.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.180
So why not?

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.480
Why hadn't they done that yet?

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.630
Okay? It's 60 years.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:10.020
We've done a lot of
really cool stuff.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.940
Why not? So this is
actually a little analogy by.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.030
That I, that I, the project,
former project manager

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:21.690
for Parker Solar Probe,
Nicky Fox, likes to put up.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:23.230
To kind of give you a comparison

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:27.170
of what was the leap
in technology needed?

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:28.970
To achieve this?

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.890
And some of you may
not even know what

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.120
that object is on the left.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.420
[Laughter] Okay?

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.140
I think most of you do.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:39.750
But surprisingly, there's
a few people that don't.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:41.050
You don't know what it is?

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.480
[Inaudible] Okay, alright.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.610
But that's a rotary phone, okay?

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:48.910
To an iPhone.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.700
To an iPhone X, okay?

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:56.330
And the leap in technology
is almost indescribable.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:00.730
Okay? I mean, just the iPhones
today are so much more powerful

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.510
than any computer that we had,

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.530
you know a few decades
ago, okay?

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:05.890
Which is kind of crazy.

00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:11.660
So what are the challenges
that we had,

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:15.750
we had to get past
in order to do this?

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.400
In order to send a
spacecraft to the sun?

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.630
So I'm going to go
through a couple

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.780
of the technical challenges.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.420
This is a mission that
has been thought about.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:30.020
And versions of it have
existed for these 60 years.

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:33.450
So this is not something that
was just recently put together.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.800
People have been
trying to develop plans

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.940
for this from the beginning.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.650
I remember in graduate
school going to a conference.

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.780
To a version, to see a
version of solar probe,

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.490
as it's been called in the past.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.910
And I've seen, I don't
know how many iterations.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:52.280
They're, they're many tens of,

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:56.850
of substantial iterations
that have led to.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.220
What eventually became
called Solar Probe Plus.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.730
Before it was renamed, okay?

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:07.560
And the first part is heat.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:13.440
Okay? And that's actually really
one of the key issues is heat.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.490
Now you may think, "Well, yeah!

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:16.850
The sun is hot."

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.370
Okay? It's really hot, okay?

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.860
But it's actually a
little bit different

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.160
than what you might think.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.610
So we talked about the sun's
outer atmosphere called

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:25.910
the corona.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.460
That in fact gets to be
many millions of degrees.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:31.600
But that's actually
not the issue.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.900
And I want to explain

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.480
that because this is a
little bit of difference.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:39.440
Between the idea of heat
and temperature, okay?

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:43.800
Temperature tells us how
fast things are moving.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:46.340
So when I measure the
temperature in this room.

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.640
I'm actually getting a measure

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.400
of how fast the air
molecules are moving.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.030
So when it's measures
as 65 degrees, that,

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:55.000
I can actually connect that.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.920
With how fast the
molecules are moving.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:01.340
And the molecules, well actually
there are not molecules.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.850
But the atoms and the, the,

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.080
the subatomic particles
in the corona.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.200
Because in fact it's so
hot that normal molecules

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.500
and atoms don't exist.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.820
Everything breaks apart.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.600
Because they're moving so fast.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.720
They're in fact moving
the equivalent

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.470
of many millions of degrees.

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.750
That's really, really,
really fast.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:23.230
Okay? But the difference
is in this room.

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:27.730
While it might not feel like it,
the atmosphere is very thick.

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:29.740
There are almost an
incountable number

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.150
of particles in a
space like this.

00:26:33.150 --> 00:26:37.160
So if I think of a, a
box about this size.

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.300
There are trillions upon
trillions upon trillions upon

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.950
trillions of particles.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.780
Some of you may even remember
things like Avogadro's number.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.630
Ten to the 23's-- 6.02
times ten to the 23.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.140
Okay. Times a lot, okay?

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.320
That's a big number, okay?

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.970
So there's a lot
of particles here.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.780
And there's a lot of
particles to transfer heat

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.330
to my body so I can feel it.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:05.060
But in the corona, in
an equivalent-size box,

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:07.900
there's a handful of particles.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.310
Like I can count them.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.380
Maybe five to ten
particles in a small box.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:16.110
That's not very many particles.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:18.850
And so even though
they're moving super-fast.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:20.820
They have really
high temperature,

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:24.610
but it's very difficult
to transfer the heat.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:28.570
Okay? And so the way heat is
transferred is transferred

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:31.830
by conduction.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.520
Convection, like bubbling water.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.900
You see material moving.

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.990
The other way is by radiation.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:44.010
Okay? By radiating energy.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:46.630
When that's normally not
a very efficient way to,

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.890
to transfer heat.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:52.650
But actually here, the sun
is really, really bright.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.470
And there's a lot of radiation.

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:56.610
A lot of light.

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.350
You can go outside on a sunny
day, and you can feel how,

00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.850
how strong the sun is.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:07.260
Well imagine if you're actually,
if it's 50 or more times that.

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:09.550
Okay? Because you're
so much closer to it.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:13.490
So the front of the spacecraft
is getting so much radiation,

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.450
that's actually what's
heating it up.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:19.960
So the first part is there's
a heat shield that has

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.850
to be very highly reflective

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:24.570
to reflect most of
the sunlight away.

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:26.070
So that's the first part.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:30.840
But it's also made of a special
material, carbon composite,

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.030
foam and threading
that's about this thick.

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:39.680
And so the radiation imparts
enough heat to the front

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.130
of the spacecraft
that the temperature.

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:45.380
The physical temperature on
the front of that spacecraft is

00:28:45.380 --> 00:28:47.990
about 2500 degrees, okay?

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.290
Which is pretty hot.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.340
That's hotter than most
substances can exist here

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:52.640
on earth.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.470
Behind that heat shield,
it's about 85 degrees, okay?

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:01.840
So that's the first part of the
technology that was developed.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.570
Another one is the solar panels.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:06.330
So you think, well solar panels?

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:07.630
It's great.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:08.930
We can power the
thing by the sun.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:10.230
We're really close.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.530
We get a lot of energy.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:12.830
That's awesome.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.610
However, solar panels are
made of silicon material.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:19.150
Have you ever put your iPhone
in the car, and it gets really,

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.550
really hot and turns off, okay?

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.790
Electronics don't like heat.

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:26.460
So solar panels don't like heat.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.890
And in fact, they fold them

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.160
in when they're really
close to the sun.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:35.250
But also there's a radiator
system that's cooling it.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:37.940
And these engineers
are really clever.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:41.820
They came up with a way
to cool using a radiator.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.940
With just a gallon
of regular water.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:48.510
But what they figured out is
the way to arrange all this

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:53.340
to make it very efficiently
take heat away.

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.730
So that's, that's
pretty amazing.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.940
And in the last bit
that they did.

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:03.070
And this also seems kind of
simple, but in fact it's not.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:06.230
Is the original ideas were hey.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.640
We've got to get
close to the sun.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.220
It's actually really difficult
to get close to the sun.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.820
I mean, it's, it's pretty easy
to get straight into the sun.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:15.870
But then your mission
is pretty short.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.170
[Laughter] Okay?

00:30:17.170 --> 00:30:18.750
I want to fly by the sun.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.690
I want to fly through
the atmosphere.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.670
I just don't want, I don't
want to just go straight to it.

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:24.560
Because them, I'm
over, it's over.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.710
So the problem is, is that
when you leave the earth.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:29.920
And this is where it's
really hard to stay still.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:34.340
But the earth is
moving at many tens

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.480
of thousands of miles per hour.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.240
As it's, as it's
orbiting the sun.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.140
And so when I shoot
myself off the earth.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.000
I only, I don't just
have motion forward,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.430
but I have motion this way.

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:52.850
So I've got to slow that down
so that I don't overshoot.

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.340
Well, the original
idea was let's use one

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.550
of the giant planets,
like Jupiter, okay?

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.290
To use the gravitational
assist to slow us down.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:05.350
And then work our way in
closer and closer to the sun.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:08.270
But it actually takes a lot
of energy to get to Jupiter.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.870
So you have to have a
huge rocket for that.

00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:14.870
And a lot of the constraints
on how much material,

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.400
how much rocket fuel,
and all that.

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:21.950
Were really prohibitive to make
this mission cost-effective.

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.820
I mean, you can do anything
if you have enough money.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:27.900
But you know it's not really
practical to spend billions

00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.350
and billions and billions
of dollars on one thing.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:36.840
Okay? So a very clever scientist
came up with the idea of hey,

00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.780
let's use a smaller,
closer-in planet.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:43.610
And he figured out how
to do it with Venus.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:47.160
So we use Venus to
slow, excuse me.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:50.140
To slow Parker down.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.490
To get closer and closer.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.560
And I'll show you what
that orbit looks like.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:57.160
So I skipped this
image, but this is the,

00:31:57.160 --> 00:32:00.250
that's actually the
special, unique radiator.

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:01.820
For the solar panels.

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:07.250
So I want to talk a little
bit about the distance scales.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.160
Before I talk about the orbit.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.780
Now we're 93 million mile--

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.550
on average, we're 93 million
miles away from the sun.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:18.600
Okay? So how close
will we get, okay?

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.940
We're actually going to be
less than four million miles.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.120
Now, that doesn't seem like
a really, really close.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.700
But when you think
about it in terms

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.600
of being 93 million miles away.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:36.130
Less than four million
miles is pretty close.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:39.090
It's only a few percent,
the distance

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:40.390
between the earth and the sun.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.100
But I have a nice little analogy

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.850
to put this in perspective,
okay?

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:46.870
So let's think about
a football field.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:52.270
Think of the sun at one end of
the football field and the earth

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.190
at the other of the
football field.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.420
Now, we're interested
in the corona.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.270
There are those coronal
loops, for example.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:05.620
And those come out to about
the 15 yard line from the sun.

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.770
Mercury is at about the 35.

00:33:08.770 --> 00:33:13.470
Venus is over on
the, on earth's 28.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.190
Okay? So there are
those coronal loops.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.370
We want to, we want to
get close into those

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.770
to really measure
stuff from the sun.

00:33:20.770 --> 00:33:24.900
We've sent a spacecraft
in the past helios.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:27.820
And it got close.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.840
Okay? Within the
orbit of Mercury.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:35.430
But Parker Solar Probe -- .

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.980
&gt;&gt; It's in the red zone.

00:33:38.980 --> 00:33:41.540
&gt;&gt; It's going to
the four-yard line.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.360
Okay? That's really close.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.490
That's really close.

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.140
So that's what we have
to do in order to get

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:54.890
to where we know this
interesting physics

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.190
is happening.

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:59.830
But we do know from the studies
that we've done remotely.

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:02.740
We've been looking at the
sun in incredible detail.

00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.600
But from a distance.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.900
With imaging.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:10.370
And you can do a
lot from a distance.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.010
But there's a point at
which you need to go

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.170
where the action is, okay?

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.550
So we think about
across the room.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.710
I mean, I can use tools
to measure temperatures

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.590
across the room these days.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:27.080
I can learn a lot by, let's say
there were curtains over there.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.380
Saw the curtains were moving.

00:34:28.380 --> 00:34:30.820
I could tell you something about
the airflow through the room.

00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.920
But there's certain details
that I really can't figure

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.720
out unless I walk over to
the other side of the room.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.940
And actually measure with
a thermometer right there.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.600
And actually measure the,
the, the curtains in person.

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.120
To see which way
the wind is blowing.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.270
And all the [inaudible]
that I need to do.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:49.750
And so that's what's
happening here.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.750
To understand why is the
atmosphere getting hotter?

00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.330
What are the detailed
physics of that?

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:58.590
What is the phenomena
that's helping

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:02.450
to release all this energy
and create these solar flares?

00:35:02.450 --> 00:35:04.010
These coronal mass ejections.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.920
This really explosive phenomena,
driving space weather?

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:13.110
And just causing the
solar wind to expand away.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:17.220
We know now there's a region
where all this is happening.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:20.900
And it's happening right
where Parker is going to go.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.830
And now we're going to
go there, in person.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:29.520
And be able to physically
make measurements right there.

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:31.940
We're not just looking at things
from a distance, but we're going

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.220
to measure how fast
things are going.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.020
Which direction they're moving.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.410
The details about that
environment where all

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:43.260
of this interesting stuff
is happening on the sun.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:47.230
Okay? So in preparation for
the mission, I'm just going

00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:49.450
to show you some cool pictures.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:52.110
There's a lot of fun stuff
that went on, you know when,

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:56.440
when NASA and NASA's
partners prepare a mission.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.170
There's an insane
amount of testing done

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:00.730
on every individual part.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:02.440
On the spacecraft itself.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:05.540
And so these are some
examples of the various types

00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:08.230
of environment testing
they were doing.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:09.530
They packed it all up.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:14.650
Sent it down to Kennedy
Space Center.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.900
Then once they got there,

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.260
they actually put the
heat shield on at Kennedy.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.620
That was something
that was very delicate.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.920
They didn't want to
ship it together.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.900
So this was all put
together in a large building.

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.710
Put on top of a rocket.

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.820
Put on top of the
biggest rocket we've got.

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.980
The biggest rocket
that NASA has, okay?

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.800
It's called a, a Delta Heavy.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.820
And it also has a
special booster stage.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.460
So you got this tiny little
thing next to the rocket.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.940
It's not much bigger than a
small car on this giant rocket.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.780
With these huge engines.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:56.420
Because that's what we need to
get this into the orbit we want.

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.280
So we can start using Venus

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.590
to work our way in
closer to the sun.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.850
So that was the original
launch window.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.310
In fact, the launch
first, the launch,

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:10.570
when it first started
on August 11.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:15.390
The first day everything
was seemingly going well.

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:17.850
They have this long checklist.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.760
They've got to go through
everything, and even every item

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.290
in the checklist
actually has tens.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:25.900
Or more things within
those items.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.320
Got all the way down,
and there was a,

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.710
there was a little anomaly.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:32.470
A signal that said
something wasn't quite right.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:34.500
And the window is very short.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.760
Because in fact, we had
less than an hour every day.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.530
Because we're trying
to go to Venus.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:42.700
And they were launching really
early in the the morning.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.510
Because at that time,
Venus was the morning star.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:46.810
We're going in that direction.

00:37:46.810 --> 00:37:49.960
So we had very limited time
period where we could launch it

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.990
and get it going to Venus.

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.180
First day, didn't make
it to the checklist.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.480
Had to recycle.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.540
Next day, everything
went off flawlessly.

00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:03.170
So what does that look like?

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.240
Unfortunately, I don't
think I have any sound.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.540
Let me see.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:20.090
But I just want you to
see what this looks like.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.460
&gt;&gt; Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five, four,

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:35.170
three, two, one, zero.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.510
Liftoff of the mighty
Delta IV Heavy Rocket

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.030
with NASA's Parker Solar Probe.

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.290
A daring mission to shed
light on the mysteries

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.240
of our closest star, the sun.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.630
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: So
that was August 12.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:51.480
It was an amazing day.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.020
And so one of the things
that's really cool about this.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.240
And I haven't talked
a lot about it.

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.640
But Eugene Parker.

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.770
So let me pause this for a sec.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.020
So I want to step back
and talk about one

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:07.310
of the things that's
really unique about this.

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:10.450
Is when NASA launches a mission.

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.550
Typically, it has a name.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:15.210
Solar Probe Plus, in this case.

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:19.240
And then once it's launched,
it's named after a person.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.660
Okay? That's the typical thing.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:24.210
Hubble, Chandra, all
these different missions.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.550
But they're always people
that have, that are dead.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.450
That are no longer alive.

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:33.430
This is the first time we've
actually named a mission

00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:34.730
after someone who's still alive.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:36.660
Eugene Parker is still alive.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.840
He's 93 years old.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:41.900
He's an Emeritus at
University of Chicago.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:45.580
And he was at the launch.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:52.740
So let me show you a little
bit more about the launch.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:56.420
There he is.

00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:59.040
&gt;&gt; Five, four.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.340
&gt;&gt; [Woman screaming] Yes!

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.140
Wooooo!

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:05.130
[ Laughter ]

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.510
&gt;&gt; Wow! Go, baby, go!

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:12.560
[ Crowd Screaming ]

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.900
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: That's his
son, and that's his wife.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.090
And that's the project
scientists.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.510
[Laughter] Nicky Fox.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:27.050
[ Applause ]

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.820
&gt;&gt; Here we come.

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:31.120
Wow.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:32.420
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: So.

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.750
This is the culmination
of his life's work.

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:38.630
And I'm hoping he'll get
to see a lot of the data.

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:42.080
Because we're working our way.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.570
We've launched.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:47.560
And in fact, it's going to take
several years to get there.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.660
We make 24 orbits
around the sun,

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.220
each time getting
closer and closer.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.210
And during that time,
we actually pass

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:59.890
by Venus seven times to
give us the continued boost.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.440
To sort of slow us
down and allow us

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.740
to get closer and closer.

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.490
And I'm going to show
you some, some animations

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.370
of what those orbits look like.

00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:09.410
And I'll show you
where it is right now.

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:13.490
But the cool thing is
that we've passed Venus

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:15.490
on our first Venus flyby.

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:18.040
That happened in September.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.690
And then we actually
passed by the sun.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.140
So we've made our
first pass by the sun.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.530
So it's a little bit
bright over here.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:28.830
I'll show you some
other imagery.

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:30.850
You might not be able
to see it too much.

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:35.800
But the red, there's
the orbit, okay?

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.100
And there's Venus.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.390
So you see, it doesn't encounter
Venus every time it makes one

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:41.720
of those orbits.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.250
But every so often.

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:48.930
So let's, let's actually look
at here's what those look like.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:50.940
So the closest approach

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:55.740
to the sun is called
perihelion as in sun, helio.

00:41:55.740 --> 00:42:00.400
Okay? And there's the
first close approach

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.460
which happened starting
October 29.

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.700
So November fifth was when
it was at its closest,

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.170
on its first close approach.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:14.670
And then you see there
was its first Venus flyby.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:19.440
Now on its way to Venus,
one of the things it has.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:20.740
And I'll talk a little bit more

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.460
about the different
instrumentation on there.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:26.970
But one of the types of
instruments is a camera

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:29.600
that looks out to the sides.

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.270
So that when it's flying by the
sun, all the stuff coming out,

00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:34.890
it can actually image it.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:36.460
Visually see it.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.760
So we tried out the camera.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.060
What we call the first light.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.760
So any time an instrument
gets data,

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.170
even if it's not
necessarily taking pictures.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:45.840
We just call that first light.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.140
But that comes from telescopes.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:49.000
The first images they saw.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.080
This is the first view
of the two cameras.

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.720
They have two fields of view.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.280
That's the Milky Way.

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.050
But the point is to show you
how amazing that camera is.

00:42:59.050 --> 00:43:00.870
You see all the detail.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:03.260
Because it's going to be
able to look at these,

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.890
these relatively small things
streaming away from the sun.

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.390
It also took another picture.

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:10.890
That's the earth.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:14.440
It's looking back at the earth.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:23.470
So again, this is the first set
of orbits and so on August 29,

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:28.290
it became the closest
spacecraft to the sun ever.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.000
And it's just got,
started its mission.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.750
And it's become the
fastest spacecraft ever.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.510
When it makes its
closest approach,

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:41.750
3.9 million miles on orbit 24.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:48.130
It will be glowing, going close
to 450,000 miles per hour.

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:50.930
That is almost half a
million miles per hour.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:55.160
And it's a, a substantial
fraction of the speed of light.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.280
So it's an incredibly
fast mission--

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.160
incredibly fast spacecraft.

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.560
So another aspect of it.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.110
Not only do we have
this unique technology.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:08.420
So first spacecraft named after
someone who's still living.

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:12.340
It's already made these
incredible achievements.

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:17.260
But it's also the first
fully autonomous spacecraft.

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:19.060
Now why is that important?

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:21.970
Well, when it's close
to the sun,

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:25.310
it takes about eight
minutes for light to get

00:44:25.310 --> 00:44:26.610
from the sun to the earth.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:28.400
So it takes about eight
minutes for a signal,

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.920
for a radio signal
to get that far.

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:35.740
So when it's traveling by the
sun, that heat shield has got

00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.720
to be pointed at the sun,
protecting the spacecraft.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.620
Any slight motion where part
of the spacecraft is no longer

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.670
under the shadow of
that shield would.

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:47.970
It would burn up.

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:49.800
Pieces of it would
burn up very quickly.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.650
Okay? Because such
a harsh environment.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:57.160
So the spacecraft has to
constantly be adjusting itself.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.570
And a human being
could never do that.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:03.140
Because human being
couldn't do it very quick--

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.520
as quickly as needed,
necessary in the first place.

00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.230
But we can't communicate
fast enough to a spacecraft.

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:12.320
So that spacecraft has to be
able to take care of herself.

00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.000
So she is fully automatic,
automated.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.920
And this is the first
time we've ever done this.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.900
So there's a lot of really
exciting firsts here.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:27.460
But more important, we
are going to our own star.

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:33.550
This is the only star in the
universe that is so close

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:35.310
that we can see it in detail.

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:37.720
We can understand it

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.890
in the fundamental
physics that's going on.

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:44.080
We can't do that with any
other star in the universe.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:50.340
Our star is in fact a laboratory
that allows us to study physics.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.160
That we could never
study anywhere else.

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:55.650
And we can apply what we
know and learn from our star

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.860
to all the other
stars in the universe.

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.700
It's actually critical.

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.760
You know many of
you may be aware

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.980
that we now have
discovered thousands

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:07.600
of planets outside
our solar system.

00:46:07.600 --> 00:46:09.640
But in order to really
understand those planets,

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.130
and understand the
environments they live in.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.110
We have to understand
the environment created

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:16.330
by their stars.

00:46:16.330 --> 00:46:20.030
And we do that by
understanding our own star.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:23.700
So the mission, Parker
Solar Probe,

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.130
is not just a mission
about the sun.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.940
It's a mission about
the universe.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:33.340
It is a key to understanding all

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:35.020
of those fundamental
building blocks.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.400
The stars everywhere.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.800
Where are we now?

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.100
So you can actually go

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:43.630
to the Parker website,
and you can look.

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:46.150
So it's kind of hard
to see, but you can see

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:47.840
where it is on every day.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.170
This actually is today's date.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:50.960
I downloaded this today.

00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.650
And you can see it gets,
where it gets closest.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:56.190
And you see it gets
closer and closer.

00:46:56.190 --> 00:46:59.050
And as it gets down
towards orbit 24,

00:46:59.050 --> 00:47:02.210
there's where it's
closest to the sun, okay?

00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:05.050
That's going to happen in 2024.

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.260
Year 2024.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.360
Happens to also be the year
of another total solar,

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.830
total solar eclipse
in the United States.

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.840
So everyone needs to go to that.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.510
Absolutely.

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:20.730
I'm going to skip this.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:25.820
I wanted to show you this
before I get to questions.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.250
To give you some perspective

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:29.210
of what is the spacecraft
going to see?

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:31.130
Now, you'll see a
lot of animations

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:33.330
with the spacecraft flying by
the sun like it's right there.

00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:35.210
And it's not actually
that close.

00:47:35.210 --> 00:47:41.280
But over here, this
is the sun we see.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.050
This would be the
sun in the sky.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:44.480
Same size as the moon, roughly,

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.320
which is we would
call a half a degree.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.720
That's how big the sun is in the
sky, and how big the moon is.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:54.620
So if that's the sun
we see here from earth.

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:58.540
This is the sun that
Parker Solar Probe sees.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:04.560
Okay? Twenty-eight times
that, 28 times farther across.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.810
Okay? And it's incredibly
bright.

00:48:06.810 --> 00:48:11.510
It's going to be flying through
those giant loops that you saw.

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.990
Through the region where
the sun's atmosphere is

00:48:14.990 --> 00:48:17.650
to the super, super
high temperatures.

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:20.050
And all that activity
is coming from.

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:23.650
So this is an amazing
mission that is going

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:25.640
to provide fundamental
understanding

00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.890
of our star, of other stars.

00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:31.370
But also understanding
of the phenomena

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.260
that drives space weather.

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:37.670
That impacts you and I, that
impacts our daily lives.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:42.410
And could potentially,
at some point,

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.570
impact the larger society.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:48.580
If we don't continue to,
to study and understand it.

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.120
So this is a really, really,
really exciting mission.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.000
And over the next few
years, we're going to have.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.020
Starts off with two
flies past the, the sun.

00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:03.420
I think next year is
three passes in the sun.

00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.340
And then from every
year on to 2024,

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:10.420
there are four perihelions,
four flybys the sun,

00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:11.970
getting closer and closer.

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:14.170
And every time, we'll be
gathering more and more data.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:19.430
And eventually we'll
get to that final goal.

00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:21.930
And we will continue
to stay there as long

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:24.670
as the spacecraft has fuel,

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.720
which should be several
more years.

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.260
We won't get any
closer but we'll stay

00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:30.860
at that closest every
time we orbit.

00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:33.000
We'll be at that
closest approach.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:36.090
And we'll continue to get
new and exciting information.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:39.010
And certainly, we
will learn things

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:41.340
that we never had any idea.

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:45.450
That we, we're going to find
puzzles and questions that we,

00:49:45.450 --> 00:49:47.410
we have never foreseen.

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:49.620
Because that's one of the
exciting things about science.

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.460
Is actually what you don't know

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.530
and what you don't
expect to happen.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:56.630
And I know that's going
to happen from this.

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:58.300
So I want to stop there.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:01.840
And then if I've got
some time for questions.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.610
But I hope you got a,
have a good feel for kind

00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:07.930
of what heliophysics is about.

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:11.810
And the beginnings of how we're
coming into sort of a new age

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:14.530
of understanding
the environment.

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:16.350
The space we live in.

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:17.800
And how our star drives that.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.100
Thank you.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:20.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:25.310
[ Applause ]

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:26.610
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus:
I understood that,

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:29.100
so that's maybe a first.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:30.710
[Laughter] Thank you.

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.720
But aren't you getting
some data tomorrow?

00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.020
The first data?

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.320
I thought I read that.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:37.620
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Yes.

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:38.920
We're, so we'll, the team,

00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:41.880
the science team will be getting
some, some new data coming up.

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.720
And there will be a press
conference next week.

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.350
So next week is the American
Geophysical Union meeting.

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:50.670
Which this year will be in D.C..

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:51.970
It's an exciting.

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:53.460
So this is an exciting
year for a lot of reasons.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.530
It's the 100th anniversary of
the American Geophysical Union.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:59.240
It's going to be the
first data from Parker.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.100
This is 60 years after the
beginning of the Space Age.

00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:06.410
Sixty years after his
fundamental paper, and 60 years

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:07.900
after the founding of NASA.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:12.960
So this is a really,
really, really exciting year.

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.450
And I'm not even
talking about Apollo.

00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:17.520
Because we're also getting
some anniversaries of Apollo.

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.680
This year is the anniversary
of-- and we just had it.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.460
The anniversary of Earth Rise.

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:29.520
The first time we
saw the earth rise

00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.020
up over the moon from space.

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:36.550
And it gave us a perspective
of our planet in a way

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:37.850
that we've never had before.

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:39.150
We saw it as a planet.

00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:41.770
We saw it outside of it.

00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:44.650
And that is one of the,
the pivotal moments

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:47.690
about our perception
and perspective

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:49.270
of our place in the universe.

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:51.680
So it's a, it's a
really exciting year.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.240
Lot of cool stuff.

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.030
So yeah, next week
we'll be seeing some,

00:51:56.030 --> 00:51:58.310
some first results from Parker.

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:00.700
And I didn't go into
the details.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:02.040
There's going to
be a lot of stuff

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.550
about the different instruments.

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:04.980
But there's a whole
suite of instruments.

00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:06.760
I showed you the camera.

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.280
But there are instruments
measuring the temperatures

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.660
of particles.

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.930
High energy particles.

00:52:12.930 --> 00:52:14.820
Kind of the background
particles.

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.590
All of the electromagnetic
fields in the environment.

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:21.860
All these different parts of
what that environment is like.

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.260
These whole suite of instruments
will be giving us lots

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:27.730
of different data to
tell us what it's like.

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:30.230
Not just visually, but with lots

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:33.650
of detailed fundamental
information.

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:36.360
Okay, so I've talked again.

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:46.660
Questions in the back?

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.860
&gt;&gt; So what is the probability
for failure of the mission?

00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:53.340
And what are the most
probable failure outcomes,

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.820
outcomes, I guess?

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:57.460
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: So what is
the probability of failure?

00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:01.500
And what are the most
probable outcomes?

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:02.800
Well, okay.

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.100
So this is getting
into something--

00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:05.620
I am not a systems engineer.

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:11.110
Now I'm not going to, so I can't
give you any, any hard numbers.

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:12.410
I will, actually I have
some colleagues here

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:13.870
that maybe can back
me up on things.

00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:17.650
You know a lot about missions,
so I'm looking at you, Lou.

00:53:17.650 --> 00:53:20.930
But let me just say that
the simplest way to put it.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.350
Is that these engineers
have gone

00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:25.190
through every possible scenario
and situation that they can,

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:26.490
they can have any control over.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:30.490
There are always things
that could happen.

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:34.400
You know there can be failures
in equipment and electronics.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.500
But again, these things are
tested and tested and tested.

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:40.710
Over and over again.

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:44.860
And certified and especially,
they all have a legacy

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:46.890
of being used on, in a
lot of other missions.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.460
And I will say a lot

00:53:48.460 --> 00:53:50.940
of the technology that's
used on this spacecraft.

00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:53.710
HAs been developed in
the planetary community.

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:55.690
Which has incredibly
harsh environments.

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:58.720
Especially around places
like Jupiter and Saturn.

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.850
Okay? Which in some ways are
even more harsh than the sun.

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:04.170
Not all of it.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:07.670
The, the, the actual physical
light is much higher in the sun.

00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:10.420
But the particle
environment, the radio,

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:13.250
the radiation environment
is really, really severe.

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:16.120
So it doesn't give
you a specific number.

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:20.020
But the chances are
incredibly slim.

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:23.170
Now, if something were to
happen, there are backups.

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:25.010
There are contingencies.

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:28.410
For spacecrafts to handle a
lot of different situations.

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:30.620
I have worked with
many different missions

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:34.210
where some instruments
have failed.

00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:37.510
Or some instruments, part
of instruments have failed.

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:40.150
That doesn't mean the
whole mission is over.

00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:42.400
It does change the
science goals.

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.350
But in every case that
I have worked with.

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:48.070
And I know this is, this
is true for most missions.

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:52.110
It does not stop us,
the substantial amount

00:54:52.110 --> 00:54:54.120
of science that's
coming in from it.

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.000
Okay? It may limit some of
the, the higher-end goals.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.680
But the overall goals
have always been achieved.

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:01.980
In these sorts of missions.

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.780
I don't know if you want
to, if you have any,

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:06.440
any additional things
you want to say, Lou.

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.900
&gt;&gt; Well, the space
radiation environment is the,

00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.200
probably the key.

00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:11.500
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Yeah.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:15.230
&gt;&gt; The electronics are
radiation hardened to enable

00:55:15.230 --> 00:55:20.970
to withstand the particle,
particle radiation of space.

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:25.220
The other thing is that if,
if the pointing mechanisms,

00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:27.410
if the gyroscopes were to fail.

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:30.640
And that each shield wasn't
to be just exactly in front

00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.030
or between the instruments
and the sun.

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.400
That could be a problem,
but that's all,

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.700
that's equally unlikely.

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.000
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Right,
but that's the,

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.300
that would be the
most critical thing.

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:40.170
Would be pointing being off.

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:44.390
And the instruments not being
behind that heat shield.

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:46.320
Now one thing I will
say about this.

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.660
There are some unknowns here.

00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:48.960
We are going to a region

00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.280
of the sun we have
never been to before.

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:53.990
It's also a region that we
can't see certain things.

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:57.350
There, there have been
discussions about populations

00:55:57.350 --> 00:56:00.150
of small bodies and
things like that.

00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:05.060
Very close to the sun that have,
that are speculated to exist.

00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:06.720
But we can't see them.

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.760
Because it's literally
too bright.

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:11.470
We try to see them
during eclipses.

00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:14.730
But we don't really
know the details

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:16.740
of that environment
around the sun.

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.460
Within the, the orbit
of Mercury.

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.940
So there could be
potential issues there.

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:26.680
So I, not quite as definitive an
answer as I'm sure you'd like.

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:28.050
But you know.

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:30.350
So you had a question,
sir, over-- ?

00:56:30.350 --> 00:56:34.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, when it reaches
its closest approach,

00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:37.270
will that be its
stabilized orbit?

00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:43.330
Or will it decline
more over time?

00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:45.380
And what, what is [inaudible]?

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:49.200
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Well, when it,
when it reaches that orbit,

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:52.300
it will stay in that orbit.

00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:55.040
Even after the mission ends.

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:56.670
And it's no longer pointing.

00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:58.660
It will start to
break up as a cloud.

00:56:58.660 --> 00:56:59.960
But orbital dynamics.

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.480
That cloud of space
stuff will continue

00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.400
to orbit the same orbit.

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.880
It will eventually deteriorate.

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:08.240
And actually it eventually gets,

00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:10.180
become part of the
corona itself.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:12.790
It'll sort of be absorbed by it.

00:57:12.790 --> 00:57:14.960
I'm not exactly-- I
don't remember exactly

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:17.050
where the aphelion is.

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:19.750
I'd have to look on there.

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:24.480
It's roughly around
the distance of Venus.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.780
Okay? If you look at the orbit,

00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:27.900
you see it's roughly
the distance of Venus.

00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:30.510
And then Venus is
moving much faster.

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:33.270
[ Inaudible ]

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:37.550
Yes, so it will keep pretty
much the same orbit that it has

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:39.870
on that last, closest approach.

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:42.460
It will continue there
while it has fuel.

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:45.130
And even after it runs out
and, and its pointing is off.

00:57:45.130 --> 00:57:47.270
It'll stay in that
orbit basically.

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:50.290
Yeah. So there was a question
there, and then I'll go to you.

00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:55.400
&gt;&gt; Voyager I and II, they
said that they'd kind

00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.510
of pass the heliosphere-- .

00:57:57.510 --> 00:58:02.090
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:06.070
What does that mean when
you talk about solar winds

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:07.900
and what impact would
that have on the-- ?

00:58:07.900 --> 00:58:09.200
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Well so, so yes.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:10.970
So you mentioned
Voyager I and Voyager II.

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:12.990
So that's, that is actually
a, actually you bring

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:14.290
that up is really good.

00:58:14.290 --> 00:58:16.670
That's another sort of
monumentist thing about--

00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:19.120
monumental thing
about this year.

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.860
Voyager I we believe has
already left the, the,

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:25.650
the sphere of the
sun's influence.

00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:28.890
And now we believe
Voyager II is close to,

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:30.670
if not already, left it.

00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:34.070
You know, it's not, it's
not a definitive place.

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:35.560
But a region.

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:41.330
But that is basically where we
are outside of the influence,

00:58:41.330 --> 00:58:43.600
the primary influence
of the sun.

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.020
And we start to see
the influence

00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:49.860
of the interstellar medium and
changes in the cosmic rays.

00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.850
So the, the universe is full

00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:55.140
of these particles called
cosmic rays which are coming

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:58.390
from supernova, exploding stars.

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:03.550
The sun and the heliosphere
actually pushes those

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:04.850
particles away.

00:59:04.850 --> 00:59:07.020
It sort of acts as
kind of a shield

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:09.040
to deflect some of
those particles.

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.010
When the sun is most active.

00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:13.280
When the solar wind
is at its peak.

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.260
It's pushing more out.

00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:16.730
And pushing more
of those particles

00:59:16.730 --> 00:59:18.030
out of the solar system.

00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:20.450
And then when the sun is
less active, there are more

00:59:20.450 --> 00:59:21.750
of those particles getting in.

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:28.130
So we're seeing the changes as
it moves outside that boundary.

00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:30.510
Is that, does that
answer your question?

00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:38.100
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:39.400
[Inaudible] means like
what is the solar wind

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.510
that it's encountering or?

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:47.100
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.180
Alex Young: I guess
I'm not quite sure.

00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:51.350
Not quite-- .

00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:55.850
You mean, the solar wind
out at the boundaries?

00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:57.660
Is that what you're
referring to?

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.920
[Inaudible response]
Well, that's just sort of.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.710
&gt;&gt; Assume that the
source was the sun.

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:03.260
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Yeah,
the source is the sun.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.780
So this, this all of these
particles are continuing out.

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:09.610
From the sun.

01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:12.500
And they eventually
start to slow down,

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.560
and they reach, reach
this boundary.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.940
And that's kind of where
the solar wind is no,

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:21.850
is no longer substantial.

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:24.390
No longer has any influence.

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.230
So I'm not sure if
I'm answering.

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:29.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [inaudible]

01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:31.040
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Okay, alright.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.340
Yes. [Inaudible] Oh, okay.

01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:33.640
I'm sorry.

01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.940
So yes, sir?

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.450
&gt;&gt; Someone kind of
answered my other question.

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:41.970
But I wanted to ask
how is Parker, I guess,

01:00:41.970 --> 01:00:46.510
going to help us
understand why certain-- ?

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:52.080
[ Inaudible ]

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.420
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: So what,
so why is, so why is,

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:58.740
so how is Parker going to help
us understand why the solar wind

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:01.500
accelerates, I think?

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.550
So the solar wind, because
the atmosphere is heating

01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:06.000
up and expanding.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.790
The solar wind naturally
expands.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.630
Okay? That, that's
just a natural part

01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:12.140
of the atmosphere [inaudible].

01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:16.410
But what's happening
is in this region,

01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:17.910
where Parker is flying through.

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:20.820
It doesn't just expand
normally with what you expect.

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:25.280
Now the, the big mystery is why
is the atmosphere hotter, okay?

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.800
Once we know that it's
hotter, let's not worry

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.950
about answering that question.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:32.100
The fact that the
atmosphere's hotter,

01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:34.150
we know that it should
stream away.

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:35.960
Okay? That, that's
going to happen.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.960
But what is weird
on top of that.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.530
Is that not only does it stream
away with, with what we expect

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:44.760
from that, those
million-degree temperatures.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.760
But it in fact accelerates.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.320
So it's expanding from the sun.

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.300
And then it speeds up.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.490
That's weird, okay?

01:01:54.490 --> 01:02:01.720
And so that's the part where
what we do know from other types

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.330
of observations and theory.

01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:04.760
Is there's something happening

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.240
with the magnetic
field of the sun, okay?

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.030
Something is happening in
the solar atmosphere due

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:12.740
to the magnetic field.

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.080
That is causing those
two things to happen.

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.820
But we don't really
understand the details.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:25.040
So that is why Parker
being there, actually being

01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:26.340
where this is happening.

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:29.860
Where this acceleration
is occurring is critical.

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:35.210
So being again as I said,
where the action is.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:38.070
Parker will be making
fundamental measurements

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:39.480
which answer the questions.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.210
We have ideas.

01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:45.470
We have a set of
competing theories.

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:48.370
But what we need to
do is pin it down.

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:51.250
Okay? So it's not that
we don't have any clue.

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:52.550
That's not the case.

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:57.010
We have clues, but we need some
more pieces to that puzzle.

01:02:57.010 --> 01:03:01.250
And we are certain that what
we're going to learn from Parker

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.900
from being where this
stuff is happening.

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:06.900
Actually, I'll get to
your question real quick.

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.420
An analogy, one analogy that,

01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:11.360
that I that Nicky
Fox likes to use.

01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.650
Is if something happens
upstream.

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:15.970
Like somebody drops a
pebble in the water,

01:03:15.970 --> 01:03:18.010
and there's a ripple
coming down.

01:03:18.010 --> 01:03:19.310
You're father downstream.

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:20.610
You see a ripple.

01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:21.910
You see something happen.

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:24.950
But you don't really know
where exactly did it happen?

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:27.320
And what are the details?

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.600
What was the shape of the rock?

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.250
That made the ripples
and this sort of thing?

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:34.090
So going to where the
pebble's being dropped

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:38.000
into the stream is
telling us more

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.900
than just seeing the
resultant ripples down the way.

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:42.420
Is that, does that
kind of make sense?

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:43.870
I think that, that's
really the key

01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:45.870
of what it's going
to provide for us.

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:47.170
Yes, sir?

01:03:47.170 --> 01:03:48.940
&gt;&gt; First thing about the
timing of the mission,

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.240
like scheduling of it?

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.080
Did it matter at all where we
are in the [inaudible] cycle?

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.800
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Okay, so
the timing of the mission,

01:03:55.800 --> 01:03:58.350
does it matter at all where
we are in the sunspot cycle?

01:03:58.350 --> 01:04:00.260
That's actually a
really good question.

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:04.230
The, the immediate answer is no.

01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:09.590
Now yes, it matters because
we have to think very, very.

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:12.720
We know that all this radiation

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.020
on the spacecraft is actually
pushing the spacecraft, okay?

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:19.210
There's actually pressure
from the solar wind.

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:20.510
From the radiation.

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:25.120
So where we are in the solar
cycle means that we can make,

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:26.580
we have to make adjustments.

01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:29.290
So it's sort of like
you're going outside,

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:30.590
you're riding your bike.

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:31.890
And it's windy.

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:33.750
And you know if the
wind is blowing this way

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:35.050
or the wind is blowing that way,

01:04:35.050 --> 01:04:37.510
you have to adjust how
you're riding the bike

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:40.000
to make sure you don't
get blown over or you know

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.310
if you have to speed up.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:43.210
So knowing that is important.

01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:45.670
But overall, does it
matter that it's windy?

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:47.450
No, that's actually okay.

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:50.790
We just for the planning,
we would need

01:04:50.790 --> 01:04:52.320
to take that into account.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.370
But it's actually exciting.

01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:55.670
We're going to be getting

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:59.620
to the closest approach
near solar maximum.

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:02.590
And that excites
scientists because having one

01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:06.160
of these big eruptions go off
while we're there is really

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.010
going to be a beneficial thing.

01:05:08.010 --> 01:05:11.900
It's actually going to provide
new and unique information.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:13.200
Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:19.660
&gt;&gt; Are these images going
to be seen in ultraviolet,

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:20.960
extreme ultraviolet light?

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.260
[Inaudible]

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.560
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: So the, so are
these images going to be seen

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.490
in other wavelengths
besides visible?

01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:29.320
This particular instrument that
I showed that is only visible.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.220
So those are only visible
in light images, yeah.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.830
They had to make
certain decisions

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:37.530
about what they were
going to put on board,

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:38.970
given the limitations.

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:41.950
You know stuff is
expensive to put into space.

01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:45.430
And the heavier it is, the more
there is to, the more cost.

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:48.110
And so they just had to
make some science decisions.

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:50.670
And they decided
that ultraviolet,

01:05:50.670 --> 01:05:52.720
extreme ultraviolet
images were not necessary

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.750
for what they wanted to do.

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:57.550
Yes, sir?

01:05:57.550 --> 01:06:06.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.600
It's not passing the same points

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:11.510
because the sun was,
the sun is moving.

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:14.040
It actually rotates
faster at the poles

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:17.110
than it does above and below.

01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:19.930
But there will be no same-- .

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:24.310
Well, first of all because it's
not a solid body, there's going

01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:27.310
to be no features or structures.

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:32.850
That will, that will last
substantially in any one place.

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:36.840
So it's not really going to be
coming back to the same spot.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:41.040
It's all going to
be kind of mixed up.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.100
Now you can see large sunspots.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.400
Come back around.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:50.160
They'll change and they'll
be in similar proximity.

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.000
But it would just
be total coincidence

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:57.060
if you actually hit one.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:59.540
I'd have to look at the
actual timing, but they're,

01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:03.110
they're not really
in sync at all.

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:04.570
Yes, sir?

01:07:04.570 --> 01:07:11.580
&gt;&gt; I don't really know how
to ask this because I'm not

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.880
as smart as you are about it.

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:16.910
But you were talking about
temperature and the number

01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:24.230
of particles in a box of like
atmosphere versus out there.

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:28.920
So what I'm wondering is these,
these prominences that fly off

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:32.120
from the sun because
they're so hot.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:35.760
What would be their temperature
like as they get to the earth?

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.390
As they pass the earth?

01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:39.800
Are they still really hot?

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:46.340
Or do they lose a lot of heat or
whatever the energy is that-- .

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:48.770
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: That's actually
a really good question.

01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:53.100
So, so when these structures,
these prominences and which,

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:55.540
which we call, we call
them coronal mass ejections

01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:57.170
when they leave the sun.

01:07:57.170 --> 01:08:00.970
Are they still hot
when they get here?

01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:03.920
They are. Okay?

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.770
The structures actually
have magnetic fields,

01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:09.110
their own magnetic fields.

01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:12.470
That break away from the sun and
so when you see this big blob

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:15.150
of stuff from the sun, these
coronal mass ejections.

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:17.970
They actually have their own
internal magnetic field, okay?

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:20.340
So they have internal structure.

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:23.590
And they do still have

01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:26.910
that internal structure
does keep this energy.

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:28.770
So internally some energy.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.970
Is it as hot as it was
when it was on the sun?

01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:35.630
No. But are those
temperatures still hotter

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:38.320
than sometimes the
ambient solar wind?

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.660
Yes. But the temperature
scales are much different.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:45.430
But yeah, there is some
energy that's kept inside

01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:46.770
of that, that structure.

01:08:46.770 --> 01:08:49.670
But the other thing is that
structure has expanded.

01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:52.290
Those things expand
very quickly.

01:08:52.290 --> 01:08:55.220
Even when you saw that,
that video that I showed

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.390
of that thing un, unwinding.

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:01.280
By the time that thing had
unwinded of that image.

01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:03.220
That actually was
several times the size

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:05.340
of the sun just in length.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:08.200
So they actually
form these clouds

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:11.020
that fill the entire
inner solar system.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:15.150
So the temperatures are
nowhere near the many millions

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:18.830
of degrees that you
see on, in the corona.

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:22.400
But they do, they do, there is
still a lot of energy there.

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.260
And they also contain
kinetic energy.

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:30.350
So anything that moves
has kinetic energy.

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:34.160
The more mass there is and
the faster something is going.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:36.050
The more energy it has.

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:39.520
So given that these things
are so massive, so huge,

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.970
and they're traveling at many
millions of miles an hour.

01:09:41.970 --> 01:09:44.730
They have a lot of
internal energy in them.

01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:46.030
And we see that.

01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:49.930
We actually physically
see the earth's atmosphere

01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:52.360
and the earth's magnetic
field shake

01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:55.130
when these things hit the earth.

01:09:55.130 --> 01:10:00.380
In fact, that shaking is what is
ultimately creating the aurora.

01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:02.820
One of the things that, a
fundamental thing is physics is

01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:04.900
if you have a magnetic field.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:08.890
And you move it very quickly, it
generates electrical currents.

01:10:08.890 --> 01:10:12.510
That's actually the principle
behind a generator, for example.

01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:13.950
Or a motor.

01:10:13.950 --> 01:10:18.380
So when that coronal
mass ejection comes

01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:21.030
and hits the earth's
magnetic field.

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:22.970
The earth's magnetic
field rings like a bell.

01:10:22.970 --> 01:10:25.310
So that magnetic
field is moving.

01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:28.710
And it generates currents
in the upper atmosphere.

01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:32.150
And those drive the particles
which give us the aurora.

01:10:32.150 --> 01:10:35.940
When those currents are really
strong and we actually have a,

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.650
a very strong solar storm.

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:41.570
It builds currents on the ground
and can knock out power grids.

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:46.630
That's the concern for
large space weather events.

01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:50.940
So these things have a lot of
energy, a lot of energy, yeah.

01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:52.240
Yes, sir?

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:55.820
&gt;&gt; Regarding the solar wind,
you had an illustration early

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.240
on that showed what appeared to
be something of a current flying

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:01.280
over the solar system.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.170
Where it buffeted on
one side, but it's kind

01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:04.770
of strung out on the other?

01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:06.790
Is there, is the tour
solar system moving

01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:08.090
through the universe?

01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:11.060
Or is there an actual
external current.

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:14.190
And just a quick
unrelated question.

01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:17.500
Was there any accommodation made
for keeping it from crashing

01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.260
into the Elon Musk's Tesla?

01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.560
[Laughter]

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.180
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: So, so I'll
start with your first question.

01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.210
Was there any, second question.

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:28.350
Was there any accommodation
to keep from crashing

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.420
into Elon Musk's Tesla?

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:34.930
I'm sure there was because I
really don't think they wanted

01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:38.420
to hit a, hit a car with a
billion-dollar spacecraft.

01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:41.390
I don't' think they really
cared so much about the car.

01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:44.970
I can, I can, I can say that.

01:11:44.970 --> 01:11:48.100
Given that there are hundreds
and hundreds of people

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:49.770
that have spent their
lives working on this.

01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:51.400
That would really,
really be bad.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.900
So. And I've seen spacecraft

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:55.920
and had colleagues
whose spacecraft blew

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.220
up and things like that.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:59.280
And that's not a,
not a pretty sight.

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.160
So, so you other question.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.130
So he said I had an an--
an animation or a-- .

01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:07.610
&gt;&gt; It showed, it showed
that the solar system

01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:08.910
that the solar wind-- .

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:10.300
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Oh,
the, the, okay.

01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:15.890
So the animation that I had
about the, the heliosphere.

01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:18.060
What is your question
about that?

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:20.350
&gt;&gt; Is there actually
an external current?

01:12:20.350 --> 01:12:21.650
Or is that-- ?

01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:23.010
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Yes, so is
there an external current?

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:26.700
Okay. Let me, let me
find that quickly.

01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.060
Do I have time, okay?

01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:32.660
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious if it's
coming from a specific source.

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:33.960
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: No,
it's actually,

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.960
that's actually a
really good question.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.170
So this one?

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:41.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:42.770
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Okay.

01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:47.920
Yeah. So, so what you're
seeing there is well what, the,

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.410
the movement of it is trying

01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:53.700
to illustrate the change
in the solar cycle.

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.490
Okay? So the solar
cycle, you know.

01:12:56.490 --> 01:13:00.100
The, the sun goes from low
activity to high activity,

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:02.640
back down to low activity
over eleven years.

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.580
And so what you're seeing
there is the breathing

01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:07.880
of the solar system.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:09.350
Breathing of the heliosphere.

01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:11.240
When solar activity's high.

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.540
It's puffed out.

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:15.870
And when it's low, you
know it kind of pulls in.

01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:18.040
And so that's what
that motion is.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:19.340
But all this stuff.

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:23.430
This, this heliosphere
is traveling itself

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:25.770
through the interstellar medium.

01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:29.410
So this is like a
ship in the water.

01:13:29.410 --> 01:13:32.280
And the fact that this
stuff is pulled behind it,

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.280
it actually makes kind
of, it makes a wake.

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:41.950
Because that whole system is
traveling through the galaxy.

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:47.210
And so it's traveling through
this interstellar material.

01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:50.250
But it's very, very, you
know this is very simplified.

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:52.130
It's actually much more
complicated than this.

01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:55.320
It's not this even simple
spherical structure.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.460
Because it's being dragged back.

01:13:57.460 --> 01:14:00.610
And you see the same
thing with the earth.

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:02.910
The earth has a magnetic field.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:06.340
And if it was just sitting
still, it would be kind

01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:08.160
of a nice symmetric shape.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.740
But in fact, the earth, because
it's moving around the sun.

01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:14.690
Has this long teardrop
shape, the magnetic field

01:14:14.690 --> 01:14:17.590
because it's being
stretched by the solar wind.

01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:22.930
So planets and solar systems all
do this sort of similar thing.

01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:26.510
As they're moving
through different material

01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:28.790
in their environment.

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:31.090
Yes, ma'am?

01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:37.830
&gt;&gt; Do you have any instruments
on board that records sound?

01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:39.320
Like solar wind?

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.950
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Do we
have any instruments

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:44.110
on board that record sound?

01:14:44.110 --> 01:14:45.410
Well, in, in a way we do.

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:47.340
So you know sound is just
compression of the air.

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:50.280
And that's, or the compression
of water, compression of metal.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:51.580
Any of those.

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:54.980
A compression of
material is a sound wave.

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:57.520
And for us, the compression

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:00.810
of the air is picked
up by our ears.

01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:04.380
But there are waves
of these materials.

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.090
You know we're, we're traveling
through these materials.

01:15:06.090 --> 01:15:07.630
And there are waves generated.

01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:09.200
And we are measuring
those waves.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:12.160
We do have instruments
which will measure them.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:15.810
They could in fact be
turned into sounds.

01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:17.660
And I know that they will.

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.770
People do something called
sonification, actually.

01:15:19.770 --> 01:15:22.330
We're interested in
that in my group.

01:15:22.330 --> 01:15:27.240
Taking data and turning it
into sounds that we can hear.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.570
So it's sort of translating it.

01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:32.260
So you're, so anything
that's travelling

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:36.000
through stuff that's moving
technically has its own kinds

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.470
of sound waves.

01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:40.310
And we do, we will be measuring
waves as we travel through it.

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:43.210

guess we should stop.

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:44.510

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:45.850
Okay, can, can I
answer one question?

01:15:45.850 --> 01:15:47.280
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Sure.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:52.350
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Dr.
Young, my name is Z-e-o-s.

01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:55.490
And I have two short questions.

01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:59.670
IN our galaxy, the
planets, nine or so.

01:15:59.670 --> 01:16:06.270
Do all the planets have the
most [inaudible], say the north,

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:07.890
the most magnetic pole?

01:16:07.890 --> 01:16:13.510
All of them are aligning the
same, say one, two, three four?

01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:18.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.460
&gt;&gt; So are all the
magnetic poles of planets

01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:22.420
and the sun align the same way?

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.550
Well not all the planets have
magnetic fields, for one.

01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:27.630
And they're not all
aligned the same way.

01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:29.240
The poles are also changing.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:33.440
The sun's poles change
regularly over 22 years.

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.940
Its activity cycle
is eleven years.

01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:41.880
But actually every eleven years,
the sun's pole moves, reverses.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.950
And then moves back over
the next eleven years.

01:16:43.950 --> 01:16:47.430
So 22 year is actually
the magnetic cycle.

01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:50.030
And then the activity
cycle's embedded in that.

01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:53.430
The earth, for example, has
a cycle that's not regular.

01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:57.860
And its field moves over
tens of thousands of years.

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.330
And other planets
do similar things.

01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:02.980
So they're all very different
and very complicated.

01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:04.970
So the, so the basic
answer is no.

01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:06.590
The magnetic fields
are not aligned.

01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:08.510
&gt;&gt; And my, my last question.

01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:39.060
[ Inaudible ]

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:43.160
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Well, I will
say that the, the calendars,

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.210
the modern calendars are
the bane of our existence.

01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:48.390
Because they've made our
lives so complicated.

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:52.180
Because of the fact that
the moon cycle's different.

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:53.980
The sun's cycles are different.

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:57.220
The star's cycles are different.

01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:00.530
And some, you know
bozo somewhere decided

01:18:00.530 --> 01:18:02.940
to pick a particular set.

01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:04.240
A calendar set-- .

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.540
&gt;&gt; Exactly how long ago
did they change that?

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:06.840
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: I don't
know when, I don't know

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.890
when the Gregorian calendar
and all that came about.

01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:11.190
When, when was that?

01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:15.810
&gt;&gt; Well, we know that the, the
Romans assigned a certain length

01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:19.350
of days to the, to the
months, for example.

01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:22.940
So August has 31 days
because Augustus was -- .

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.790
&gt;&gt; Why they came up
with the number 12.

01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:26.090
I don't understand that.

01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:27.390
Why they tried to change that?

01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:29.420
&gt;&gt; It's a solar calendar
versus a lunar calendar.

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.720
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: Yeah.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.020
&gt;&gt; You're thinking
a lunar calendar.

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:33.320
And ours-- .

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.620
&gt;&gt; Alex Young: It's a solar,
it's a solar calendar.

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:37.140
I mean, it, it, but it is,
it is an incredible pain

01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:39.570
because of all these
different systems of the,

01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:41.420
the different periods
don't line up.

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:43.060
And they make things
very complicated.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.990
And interesting so.
