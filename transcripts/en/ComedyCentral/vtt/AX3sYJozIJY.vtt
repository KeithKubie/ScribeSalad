his hard earned cash! Everyone
pay attention to me!

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:12.545
Ugh, it's only 1 dollar bills
folks. Don't bother.

No, it's still free spendable
money, this is a huge story.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.084
Dollars are like the new penny.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:20.286

Beyonce is a survivor

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.247

she will keep on surviving.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.482

-Just tell us why'd you do it!
-Oh, I'll tell you why!

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:49.709
I did it all
for my girlfriend. Diane.

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:55.949
Son of a bitch
