00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
(intro music)

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.640
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.660
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.100
And welcome to another addition of 'WTR',

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.240
AKA: "Was That Real?"

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.200
This is where we look at TV that was forgotten by some but remembered by other by how strange they were.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.680
With that said, we all love Dr. Seuss' timeless characters of the Cat in the Hat and the Grinch.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.280
So much so, that some people even watched this bullshit.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.400
But did you know there was a time when they actually did a crossover?

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.820
It's called by a couple of names over the years

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.200
"The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat", "The Cat in the Hat gets Grinched"

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.860
Which... both sound like children's intros to sexual harassment.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.520
But what everyone called it when I was growing up was "The Grinch versus the Cat in the Hat".

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.960
Because really, that's what it is.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.620
It's two popular characters in the same universe, finally meeting up and... well, surviving each other.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.420
This seems kind of strange for Dr. Seuss, who didn't really do crossover battles.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.680
That kind of stuff would usually be associated with something like, say... a Marvel production.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.480
Well, funny you should think that, because this actually was made by Marvel Productions.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.440
Yeess, soon the Lorax and Sam I Am are going to fight over the warring nations of the Sneeches and the Whos!

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.820
With the cameo by Spiderman we've all been waiting for.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.380
This was advertised everywhere when it came on TV, and to its credit, it's really not a bad idea.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.900
It's kind of like Batman versus Superman.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.380
Yeah.. you're funny.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.460
There you go.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.720
Where there's two seemingly opposite protagonists, who also seem to have a lot in common.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.540
Both are agents of anarchy- they like to disrupt the status quo and take people out of their comfort zones.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.420
The reasons, though, is what makes them enemies.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.340
One does it to lighten the mood and open up possibilities,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.740
while the other does it to ruin the mood and limit possibilities.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.620
Even the lessons have a different spin.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.100
With the Cat in the Hat, he's the one dispensing the moral; with the Grinch, he's the one learning the moral.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.560
So it seems like there was just enough in common and just enough different to make this really, really good.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.060
Right?

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.220
Well, as much as I've praised Seuss in the past, even I have to admit, not everything was perfect.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.600
Nothing was awful, but some ideas were better as just that: Ideas.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.080
And for what it's worth, this does seem to have a lot of ideas, especially for kids.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.040
It just didn't seem to have a lot of focus.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.380
Again, a tough combination as "Cat in the Hat" was a somewhat random and archaic story,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.380
where "Grinch" had a very solid beginning, middle and end.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.940
Which makes this a very tricky combination.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.560
The Grinch, as well, was already used twice: With a Halloween special after the Christmas debut,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.860
but didn't exactly get the strongest reaction.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.540
So was tough to figure out if he could work in other tales outside of his first one.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.060
The story?

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.120
The Grinch wakes to the voice of the Schmucker's Jelly guy describing the morning.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.300
(Grinch whistling) Narrator: "Never before has this nasty, old guy left out of his bed

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.020
with a smile in his eye and whistled, 'Hello!'"

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.960
(NC imitating the voice) Well, I could kill kids with a pitchfork and you'd still love my voice.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.420
However, the Grinch goes back to his evil ways when his mirror yells at him.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.960
"I see nothing to whistle about!"

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.180
Yeah, like I said: kind of odd.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.480
'Mirror' convinces him to go out and cause trouble

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.580
&amp; this is where he literally bumps into the Cat in the Hat.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.080
Who makes the apparent mistake in calling him "green face".

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.680
"Any inconvenience out of these that I may have caused you Mr... Green Face."

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.520
"Mr. Green Face?"

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.100
That is our word.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.460
So, the Grinch decides to chase him down, create a machine that messes with reality and...

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.020
just, kind of annoy him.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.620
It's... kind of a downgrade compared to his other adventures.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.960
First, he wants to rob people of the joys of giving,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.860
then he want to terrify the world with fear from hellish looking monsters.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.480
Now, he's just... kind of a troll.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.860
In fact, you could argue that he's literally the world's first internet troll. Think about it:

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.660
He uses his computer to hack your everyday life to mildly annoy you,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.620
and he's the only one that finds it funny at all.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.180
Guess he's sort of a pioneer of obnoxiousness when you think about it.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.560
"And that brings about (Max barks) the most horrible things!"

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.460
I'll admit, it's a little odd to see the Cat in the Hat

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.420
constantly duped and get more and more frustrated as it goes on.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.860
It's kind of like seeing Groucho Marx get mad, or Radical Edward get mad, or the Road Runner get mad.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.960
There's just some creations you always think are gonna be comfortable and in control of their world.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.620
Which makes it a little off-putting when you see they don't always have the smart answer.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.620
(scoffs) It really cracks me up when he straight out calls the Grinch a psychopath.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.660
"That Grinch! That psychopathic Grinch!"

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.140
How funny is that? There's a Dr. Seuss story where somebody uses the word 'psychopath'!

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.780
That's insane! Or... psychopathic, I guess.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.120
To be fair though, only a psychopath would change the pronunciation of words to make them rhyme.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.840
"The sounds that you make are the sounds of my choice.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.860
I can make you sound better or make you sound wo-yus (worse)."

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.080
CHEATER!

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.020
"Are you feeling pretty goot, Mr. Cat in the Hoot?"

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.580
Goot and hoo- why were you changing that? They already rhymed.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.760
This all comes to a head when the Grinch uses his machine to mess with a resturaunt

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.040
for really no reason than to give Seuss an excuse to say he took LSD for inspiration.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.300
(zany trumpet instrumental)

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.400
Yup, this is another Dr. Seuss 'trip out' scene that doesn't connect to much but...

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.280
Who cares?! It's a Dr. Seuss trip out scene.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.480
I will totally endorse getting a minor drunk if it leads to another 'Pink Elephant' sequence.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.880
(slams) Screw priorities! I want a trip-out, man!

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.020
Look at this, he's going against the lesson of his own books! Green eggs are okay, but polka dot eggs?

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.120
Chuck that shit!

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:49.180
But to be fair, maybe the Cat in the Hat's frustration ties into the "kinda-sorta" message.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.960
Yeah, even the moral is a little hard to grasp but I still can't say it's really wrong in any way.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.780
Amongst his frustration he finally realizes the way to win is not killing by anger but killing with kindness.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.920
He goes to the Grinch's house and reminds him of his mother.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.800
"Even a Grinch had a mother, who taught him of love" (singing)

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.520
Thank God he happened to have a good relationship with her, because it eventually

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.520
softens him up and makes him good again.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.660
He even has an inner monologue with her which... the more I think about, strangely happens a lot in this.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.600
Half of the special is technically is just people talking to themselves.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.480
Everyone's a psychopath!

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:37.040
So I guess the message centers around... Power of motherhood? To always bring family into everything?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.420
That a person's weakness is in their heart- It's confusing. Nevertheless,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:47.060
It is still a kinda nice, albeit, unfocused scene leading to a relatively harmless ending.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.860
And that's really the best way I can describe this special: Nice, unfocused but harmless.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.220
It's certainly not Seuss' strongest work and truth be told, it could have been a bit more interesting.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.120
But it's still neat seeing two of his most famous characters meet and interact off each other.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.560
While the story's not the best, it still feels like this is what the characters would do and say

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.640
if they did run into one another.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.020
So, it's kind of fun to watch if only for that reason.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.560
Yeah, it's pointless. Yeah, it doesn't always make sense, but sometimes that's okay.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.420
It's still creative, still strange &amp; still unmistakably Seuss.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:25.760
You can still get it on DVD and witness all the goofiness, or psychotic, tendencies yourself.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.220
Give it a buy and see one of the most surreal crossovers ever devised.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.640
I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:44.400
Coming next week, it's Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed- the death of Alicia Silverstone's career.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.580
But you can see it now under Vessel's ad-free early access. Just $3 a month to see tons of

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.160
people's videos early as well as a bunch of other extra features.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.680
Check it out and get the early scoop.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:15.320
(outro music)

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.320
Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the charity shout-out.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:39.740
This week we're doing one that you might not think about that much but is still very, very important.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.120
The Guide Dog Foundation.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:48.740
This organization has been around since 1946 and their mission is simple: to provide guide dogs in training, free

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.680
of charge to people who are blind or visually impaired.

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:59.180
For 70 years the Guide Dog Foundation has trained and placed guide and service dogs to provide increased independence,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:05.320
enhance mobility and companionship to people who are blind, have low vision or have other disabilities.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:12.540
Once they make the decision to get an assistance dog, applicants become a part of the foundation's open and welcoming community.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.860
They're supported with a compromised commitment from highly empathetic and certified trainers.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:24.020
They pair each student with a dog that's right for them, and the power of their bond makes the strongest friendships.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.340
Crossing the street independently becomes a moment of liberation and trust.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.560
Traveling alone becomes a welcome adventure.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:38.880
Embracing new experiences becomes an everyday occurrence. It cost over $50,000 to breed, raise, train

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.280
and place one assistance dog.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.220
However, all of the foundation's services are provided at no charge to the individual.

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:52.940
Funding comes from the generosity of people like you, corporations, foundations, businesses and many more.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:56.900
So, definitely take a look, watch some of their videos and see how you

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.320
can help sight to someone who needs it the most.
