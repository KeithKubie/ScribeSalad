00:00:00.251 --> 00:00:04.693
So that basically starts us wanting to
rethink some of the ideas that we've had

00:00:04.693 --> 00:00:06.658
about lenses and defocus things.

00:00:06.658 --> 00:00:09.431
Let me review some of that just to kind
of get us started, because then we

00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:12.042
actually going to look at how we're
going to change these things.

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:15.839
Of course, remember that basically what
we have and we have a lens like this.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.085
We have an aperture, the opening, right?

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:23.380
The opening is the amount of area that
actually goes though the aperture and

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.921
it hits the sensor after
the shutter is open.

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:30.169
The shutter is the one that controls
the amount of time, the aperture,

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.698
the amount of light that enters.

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:35.323
Now, if you recall some of the simple
optic stuff we looked at this before.

00:00:35.323 --> 00:00:39.523
There's also always a sensor,
a lens and the light of course,

00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:41.911
from the focal plane goes through.

00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:44.399
And it's for
the object on the focal plane,

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.301
what basically happens is the image
is formed on the camera sensor and

00:00:48.301 --> 00:00:50.598
that's exactly we get a focused image.

00:00:50.598 --> 00:00:53.221
And of course,
the image of the point light source,

00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:56.977
if there is a point light source at this
point here where the object is we will

00:00:56.977 --> 00:00:58.845
basically get Something like this.

00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:03.047
And of course, the point spread function
would just be a short line like this.

00:01:03.047 --> 00:01:04.583
So, of course, this is inverted.

00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:08.531
The white bright one basically shows
this is my point spread function here

00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:09.558
for this feature.

00:01:09.558 --> 00:01:13.063
This is the optics we have looked
at many times in this class.

00:01:13.063 --> 00:01:17.795
Now let's actually start thinking about
what defocus does in the context of this

00:01:17.795 --> 00:01:20.997
simple lens system,
which basically means now is I'm

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:23.936
going to move the object
at a different distance.

00:01:23.936 --> 00:01:28.543
So the same light source from here would
now basically mean that the actual

00:01:28.543 --> 00:01:32.271
convergence of this light is
happening a little bit ahead.

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:34.146
This is where my camera sensor.

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:37.226
So, of course,
it's now getting to be a little bit,

00:01:37.226 --> 00:01:40.383
forming a little bit a er,
before this location.

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:43.187
And of course,
there's now divergence showing up,

00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:46.818
which then results in a point spread
function that's much thicker.

00:01:46.818 --> 00:01:51.582
And of course, that translates into
the image of the defocused point light

00:01:51.582 --> 00:01:56.059
source would look something like this,
much wider as show here.

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:57.969
Let's move the object further back.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.844
Of course, when we do this,

00:01:59.844 --> 00:02:03.686
you can notice that the point
spread function gets wider.

00:02:03.686 --> 00:02:07.974
And of course, we also know that would
mean that the image of the defocused

00:02:07.974 --> 00:02:10.268
point light source would look bigger.

00:02:10.268 --> 00:02:14.124
Just to kind of continue this exercise,
we will actually now do last one,

00:02:14.124 --> 00:02:18.188
where we basically move this further
away and you know, this is even wider.

00:02:18.188 --> 00:02:21.320
And of course,
bigger blob is showing up here and

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.881
it's a defocused point light source,
which is point here.

00:02:24.881 --> 00:02:28.283
So we know about this kind of stuff and
with that, gives us a little bit of

00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:31.549
an idea about how all of this works,
something we looked at before.

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.351
Another further example of
this is it gets bigger.

00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:38.375
And here now, I'm showing you last
stage where I move the object further.

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:41.435
And of course, the point spec
function is really wide and

00:02:41.435 --> 00:02:44.130
the defocus point light
source is also much larger
