00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.700
We're on problem number 7.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.189
If the average of x and 3x is
12, what is the value of x?

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.370
So the average, so x plus 3x--
and I'm averaging two numbers

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.270
so divide by 2-- that's going
to be equal to 12.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.180
So we just solve for this.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.800
Multiply both sides of the
equation by 2 and you get 2

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.090
times, times 2, this
cancels with this.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.020
You get x plus 3x
is equal to 24.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.890
And what's x plus 3x.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.670
That's 4x, right?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.645
4x is equal to 24.

00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:35.720
x is equal to 6, and
that's choice C.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.970
Next problem.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.970
Problem 8.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.700
At Maple Creek High School, some
members of the chess club

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.320
are also on the swim team, and
no members of the swim team

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.130
are tenth graders.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.830
Which of the following
must be true.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.220
This seems like it'll call
for a Venn diagram.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.680
So let's say that that
represents the chess club.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.790
And they say some members
of the chess club

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.210
are on the swim team.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.930
So some members are
on the swim team.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.620
Maybe I should put the swim
team in like blue.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.100
So let's say the swim team.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.350
That's the swim team.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.510
And these are the members,
right, that are

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.980
in both right here.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.200
But then it tells us no members
of the swim team are

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.170
tenth graders.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.970
So if I draw another circle
for the tenth graders, it

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.560
can't intersect with the swim
team, but it could intersect

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.080
with the chess team.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.540
I don't know.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.510
I mean it could be like that.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.240
That could be tenth graders.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.830
It could be like that.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.930
Or it could be out
here some place.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.150
But we don't know.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.880
There could be chess and tenth
graders, just not the same

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.440
people who are on
the swim team.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.690
So let's see.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.180
So which of the following
must be true?

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.960
No members of the chess club
are tenth graders.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.370
No.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.800
This is a situation where you
could have some members of the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.500
chess club who aren't
on the swim team who

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.420
could be tenth graders.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.039
B, some members of the chess
club are tenth graders.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.840
Well some members could be, but
we don't know for sure.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.880
This could be tenth grade.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.690
We don't know.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.530
This could be the tenth grade
kind of set or this could be

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.970
the tenth grade.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.590
There might be no tenth graders
in either the chess

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.310
team or the swim team.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.890
We don't know for sure.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.940
And then choice C, some members
of the chess club are

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.590
not tenth graders.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.890
This we know for sure.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.240
How do we know it for sure?

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.030
Because these kids who are on
both, they're in the chess

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.210
club, but they're also
on the swim team.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.960
The fact that they're in swim
team, we know that they can't

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.550
be tenth graders.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.670
So this is some members of the
chess club-- this little

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.330
intersection here-- that
are not tenth graders.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.440
So choice C is the
correct choice.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.530
Next problem.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.380
If 3x plus n is equal
to x plus 1, what is

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.540
n in terms of x?

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.555
So we essentially just
solve for n.

00:03:11.555 --> 00:03:13.790
Let's subtract 3x
from both sides.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.100
You get n is equal to--
what's x minus 3x?

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.580
It's minus 2x.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.000
And n plus 1.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.710
And we're done.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.870
And that choice isn't there, but
if you just switch these

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.000
two terms you just get that
equals 1 minus 2x and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.900
that's choice D.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.850
Pretty quick problem, especially
for one that's the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:32.450
ninth problem.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.110
They normally get a little
harder by this point.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.630
Problem 10.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.290
If k is a positive integer, let
k be defined as a set of

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.470
all multiples of k.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.480
So k with a square around it
is equal to the set of

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.490
multiples of k.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.900
All of the numbers in which of
the following sets are also in

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.770
all three of the set-- OK.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.690
All of the numbers in which of
the following sets are also in

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.900
all three of the sets
of 2, 3 and 5?

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:22.330
So the what they're saying is 2,
3, 5, this donates all the

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:23.580
multiples of 2.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.450
This is all multiples of 3.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:37.340
This is all multiples of 5.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.800
So what they're essentially
saying is let's find a number

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.970
where all of its multiples, all
of this number's multiples

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.740
are also going to be multiples
of each of these.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.290
So it has to be a multiple--
so every number that--

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.920
whatever this mystery number
is, let's call it x-- every

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.790
multiple of x has to be a
multiple of 2, 3 and 5.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.950
Well the simple way is if x is a
multiple of 2, 3 and 5, then

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.340
every multiple of x
is going to be a

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.970
multiple of 2, 3 and 5.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.160
So what's 2 times 3 times 5?

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.680
It's 2 times 3 times 5.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.090
That's 6 times 5, that's 30.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.160
So 30 is a multiple of all of
them, so any multiple of 30

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.990
will be a multiple
of all of these.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.050
When we look at the choices
we don't see 30.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.360
But do we see any other
number that is a

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.010
multiple of 2, 3 and 5?

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.160
Well sure, 60 is, right?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.620
We just multiply by 2 again.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.100
But 60 is still a multiple
of 2, 3 and 5.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.530
If you were to do 2, 4, 6, 8 all
the way you'd get 60, if

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.260
you go 3, 9, 12, 15 all the
way, you'd get to 60.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.580
You go 5, 10, 15, 20,
25, you'd get to 60.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.630
So 60 is a multiple
of all of them.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.600
So what we're saying is-- so
what's the set of all the

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.410
multiples of 60?

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:58.260
It's 60, 120, 180, 240,
et cetera, right?

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.510
And all of these numbers are
in each of these sets.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.020
Because all of these numbers are
multiples of 2, 3 and 5.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.190
So our answer is 60.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.320
If you look at the other
choices, some of them are

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.740
divisible by 5, some are
divisible by 2 or 3,

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.100
some are 3 and 5.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.870
But none of them are divisible
by 2, 3 and 5, only 60 is.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.120
Next problem.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.890
That problem was a little hard
to read initially though.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.140
That's how they confuse you.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.383
So we're going to go from A to
D-- I should have drawn all

00:06:33.383 --> 00:06:38.570
the lines first. Let me draw the
lines first. It's like a

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.741
hexagon kind of.

00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:43.900
The top, the outside of
the hexagon there.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.330
A, B, C, D, E, F.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.740
And then this is the origin.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.640
And the figure above,
AD is equal to BE.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.020
Oh, no, no.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.810
They don't tell us that.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:01.820
I'm hallucinating.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.720
In the figure above AD, BE,
and CF intersect at 0.0.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.880
The intersect's here
at the origin.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.710
If the measure of AOB, the
measure of that, is 80

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:22.520
degrees, and CF bisects
BOD, so it

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.110
bisects this larger angle.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.880
CF bisect BOD, that angle.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:32.230
So that tells us that
this angle has to be

00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:34.100
equal to this angle.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.520
That's the definition of
bisecting an angle.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.310
You're splitting this larger
angle in half.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.110
So these angles have to be
equal to each other.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.270
So what is the measure of EOF?

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.770
So we want to figure
out this angle.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.285
Well this angle is opposite to
this angle, so they're going

00:07:54.285 --> 00:07:54.840
to be equal.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.970
So if we can figure out
this angle we're done.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.370
So let's call this angle x.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:03.770
If that angle's x this
angle is also x.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.900
This x, this x, and this
80 degrees, they're all

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.440
supplementary because they all
go halfway around the circle.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.140
So x plus x plus 80 is going
to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.090
2x plus 80 is equal to 180.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.590
2x is equal to 100,
x is equal to 50.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:29.390
And as we said before, x is
equal to 50, the angle EOF,

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.750
which you're trying to figure
out, is opposite to it so it's

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.850
going to be equal.

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.909
So this is also going
to be 50 degrees.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.610
And that's choice B.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.559
Next problem.

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:43.590
I don't know if I have time
for this, but I'll try.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.780
Problem 12.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.310
k is a positive integer.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.890
What is the least value
of k for which the

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.310
square root of-- OK.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:59.390
So what is the least value
of k for which 5k

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.390
over 3 is an integer.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:04.600
So this has to be a whole
number, right?

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.720
So essentially if we want to
find the least value of k, we

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.700
essentially want to say, well
what's the least integer that

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.910
this could be?

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.240
And they're telling us that
k is a positive integer.

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:19.330
So first of all, in order for
the square root to be an

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:24.230
integer, this whole thing has
to be an integer, right?

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:27.710
So let's see, k has to
be a multiple of 3.

00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:31.525
In order for this expression to
be an integer, k has to be

00:09:31.525 --> 00:09:32.670
a multiple of 3.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.500
If k is 3, we get square root
of 15 over 3-- well that

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.140
doesn't work.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:44.080
If k is 3 we just
get 5 in there.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.850
Actually, let me continue this
into the next problem because

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:46.730
I don't want to rush this.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:48.470
I'll see you in the
next video.
