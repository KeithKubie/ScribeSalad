00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:14.809
In 
the late 1960s, NASA’s Apollo missions were

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.939
in full swing, with both Apollos 8 and 10
having successfully launched, orbited the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.720
Moon and returned with their astronauts safely
to the Earth.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.909
By the summer of 1969, the space program was
ready to try something new – land a craft

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:33.730
with men on the Moon, and then re-launch and
bring them safely home.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.501
Given the numerous engineering and other difficulties
inherent in the project, Apollo 11’s mission

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:40.890
was considered extraordinarily high-risk.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.320
Accordingly, the men who were assigned to
the mission, Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.960
and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin, had to face the
strong possibility that they would not return

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.920
from the mission (particularly Aldrin and
Armstrong).

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.740
This was not only a major problem for the
astronauts themselves, but also a more down

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.990
to Earth problem for their immediate family.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:05.369
You see, very unfortunately back then a woman’s
ability to support herself and potential children

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.940
financially often came down to “find a husband.”

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.130
With said husbands potentially dead on the
Moon, they needed a backup plan for support.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.720
The solution here, of course, would simply
be a good life insurance policy…

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.030
But others were equally aware of the questionable
probability of success of this particular

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.030
mission.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.409
In fact, an insurance policy on the life of
any of the astronauts was reported to cost

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.420
at minimum several times the astronauts’
annual salaries (which were about $15,000-$20,000,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.370
or about $105,000-$140,000 today).

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.750
Needless to say, this wasn’t a viable option.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.979
Still needing to ensure their families’
futures, and knowing the value of memorabilia

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.170
associated with the missions, the Apollo 11
astronauts decided to leave behind a series

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.820
of keepsake autographs, called insurance covers
or postal covers.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.150
In the world of stamp and postal memorabilia
collecting, cover is the term used to describe

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.710
the exterior of a package or envelope.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.159
For the Apollo 11 covers, the astronauts obtained
illustrated covers from two makers, the Manned

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.659
Spacecraft Center Stamp Club (MSCSC Covers)
and Al Bishop (Bishop Covers).

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.420
Displaying various illustrations of what the
Moon landing should look like, images of the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.350
mission’s emblem and even likenesses of
the men and/or the Moon, the covers were rather

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.380
decorative and would be highly prized, particularly
if the astronauts failed to return.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.530
During the month prior to the launch, Armstrong,
Collins and Aldrin had been quarantined in

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.100
an effort to reduce the risk of one or all
of them catching an illness that might prevent

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.540
them from participating in the mission.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.200
With little else to do in their downtime,
they signed hundreds of covers, and then left

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.390
them with a trusted individual.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.599
On the day of the launch and/or day of the
lunar landing, the individual with the covers

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:54.380
took them to the post office to have the stamps
cancelled, thus adding to the covers’ value.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.060
Of course, the men of Apollo 11 returned safely,
and this unique form of life insurance turned

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.920
out to have been unnecessary.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.930
But knowing a good idea when they saw one,
subsequent Apollo astronauts followed in Armstrong,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.730
Collins, and Aldrin’s footsteps.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.920
As such, covers were signed by the men who
flew Apollos 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16- all missions

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.440
in which men were to land on the Moon.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.280
Thankfully, all returned safe and sound.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.640
You might at this point be wondering about
Apollo 17.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.310
Officially, no covers were prepared by the
astronauts of the final Apollo mission.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.310
Why?

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.739
Mainly because of the infamous Apollo 15 stamp
scandal in which the astronauts took this

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.379
idea a bit further and smuggled aboard 398
unauthorized covers (to go along with the

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.940
243 authorized covers NASA had sent up in
partnership with the U.S. Postal Service)

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.080
which they took to the Moon and back.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.740
100 of the 398 unauthorized covers were sold
to stamp dealer Hermann Sieger for a total

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.750
of $21,000 ($7,000 for each astronaut or about
$40,000 each today).

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.540
These were supposed to be held and not sold
until after the Apollo program was over and

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.269
were to serve as college funds for the astronauts’
kids.

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.600
However, Sieger deciding to start selling
them before the Apollo program had ended.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.090
The news media caught wind of it and the astronauts
in question got in some major hot water from

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.160
Congress over the ordeal, not long before
the Apollo 17 mission was to launch.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.629
Needless to say, the astronauts of Apollo
17 were keen on keeping their signing of these

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:24.760
“life insurance” covers secret and when
they survived the mission, there was no reason

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:46.249
to reveal they did it, though later some of
the covers were sold or given away.
