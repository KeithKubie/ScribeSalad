00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.000
Hello and welcome
back to what I guess

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.650
I'm going to call our interlude
between Chapter 1 and Chapter

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.470
2.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.550
Since I've started recording
our first battery of videos,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.340
a number of things have changed.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.040
And so I just want
to touch on those

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.764
before we get into Chapter 2.

00:00:21.764 --> 00:00:23.680
The first and most obvious
thing you'll notice

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.340
is that I am now using Xcode 5.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.990
And my guess is you're
going to be using it, too.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.830
And for most of the
stuff moving forward,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.660
I'm going to be testing
on iOS 7 devices.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.230
So that's the first
and biggest change.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.910
The second is that we've
upgraded both the Google+

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.390
the Google Play Games SDKs since
that we first launched these

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.560
videos.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.850
In Google+ land, we are
now using SDK version 1.4.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.040
And on Google Play Games,
we're now using version 1.2.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.490
If you've used older version
of either of these libraries,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.720
you're going to need to
download the new versions

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.560
of these libraries
and install them.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.410
And I actually need
to do that here,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.269
so I'm going to show
you how I do it.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.880
It turns out that,
at least in my case,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
upgrading frameworks
and bundles within Xcode

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.470
is-- it causes
some issues for me.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.810
I've never had good luck
with this Xcode suddenly

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.300
seems to forget what my
GPG manager is, and can't

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.100
seem to find it.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.580
And I run into a
lot of odd issues.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.500
And as counter intuitive
as it might seem,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.010
I've actually had
much better luck

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.080
if I update these frameworks
just using Finder.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.084
So I'm going to do that.

00:01:33.084 --> 00:01:34.500
So first thing we
are going to do,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.340
I'm going to close
this project in Xcode.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.220
Next up, I'm going to
open up a Finder window

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.970
where my project is located.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.610
And now, I'm going to
download the updated

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.730
version of each of
these libraries.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.300
So let me open up Chrome here.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.340
And first, I'm going to go to
 developers.google.com/games/services/downloads.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.860
By the time you see
this video, this

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.460
should now say Games SDK
version 1.2, or maybe 1.2.1.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.327
And click on this
link to download it.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.190
And then you can go to
 developers.google.com/plus/downloads

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.650
to download the updated version
of the Google+ SDK for iOS.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.830
And I'm going to
download it here.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.860
And you can see it's telling
me I have SDK version 1.4.1.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.940
So now, I'm going to go
into my Downloads folder.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.470
And here we can
see the new SDKs.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.930
Let's extract this zip.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.930
And this will probably
say 1.2, not 1.2.beta.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.589
And now we can replace
the frameworks.

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:45.880
So here's what I'm going to do.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.390
It's pretty straightforward.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.830
First, let's do the Google+ SDK.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.060
So I'm going to go into
my Guess My number folder,

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.610
or wherever it turns out
Xcode has copied the framework

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.990
folders for you.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.740
In my case, it's right here.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.116
I'm going to delete
these two frameworks.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:03.780
There we go.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.780
Just the two frameworks.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.890
And I'm going to
copy them over again

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.740
within Finder into
the same location.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.550
And then I'm going
to the same thing

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.760
with my Play Games services
framework and bundle.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.900
Delete it.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.750
And then two copy
these two over.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.134
There we go.

00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:31.300
Again, I know this seems a
little counter intuitive.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.700
We're sort of
swapping up frameworks

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.260
under the feed of Xcode.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.840
And it doesn't seem to
know that it's happening.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.730
But if you open up this
project again in Xcode,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.760
it seems to handle these
changes pretty elegantly,

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.430
which is nice.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.040
Now once that's done, if you
try to compile this thing,

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.740
you'll probably get
a number of errors.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.570
Yep.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.370
And it looks like it's
stuff that looks like this.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.770
And that's because the new
Google+ SDK requires four more

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.820
frameworks for us to add.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.050
So we'll go into these.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.320
And so the first thing we're
going to add is Core Motion.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.029
There we go.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.904
We're also going to
add Core Location.

00:04:24.345 --> 00:04:25.970
Next we're going to
add Assets Library.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.430
And finally, we're going
to add Media Player.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.630
All right, once those four new
frameworks have been added,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.070
the SDK should
compile correctly.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.650
Let's run it and
see what happens.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.430
No issues.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.400
Build succeeded.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.530
That's good.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.410
And there we go.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.310
Everything seems to be
working, although you

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.840
might notice an odd
little error, which

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.380
is that our title
has now disappeared

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.610
underneath this
Navigation controller.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.450
And in fact, if I click Easy,
to go into an easy game,

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.290
you'll see that the
instructions I can't really

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.790
see because it's hidden
behind this somewhat

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.140
translucent
navigation controller.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.849
Now this is happening
because, well, I

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.140
did not follow the recommended
protocol and start using

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.310
auto-layout when it
first became available.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.650
And right now
somebody in Cupertino

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.199
is laughing at me
saying, yeah, you

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.490
thought you were so smart
ignoring the recommendations.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.940
But who's laughing now?

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.390
Huh, huh, tough guy?

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.750
So if you are using
on auto-layout,

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.720
this probably doesn't
happen to you.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.470
In my situation,
there does happen

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.240
to be a pretty
easy way to fix it.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.520
And that involves
using these new iOS 6.7

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.924
deltas that you see right here.

00:05:40.924 --> 00:05:42.340
So here is what
we're going to do.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.760
Here's how this works.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.600
I'm going to switch over
to my File Inspector.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.080
And I'm going to say, I want
to view this nib as an iOS 6.1

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.480
layout.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.530
Everything's
looking good so far.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:04.600
And now I want to select this
label and these three buttons,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.080
go back to the Size
inspector, and here I'm

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.890
going to set the delta y to 60.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:13.090
And that means place these
objects here, for now,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.400
in iOS 6.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.930
But when you switched to
iOS 7, moves them down

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.290
by about 60 points.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.790
Hit Return.

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:27.440
And now, when I run this,
we'll see that, in iOS 7,

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.620
the Guess My Number label,
as well as these buttons,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.740
have now been moved down
underneath the navigation

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.070
controller bar here.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:47.540
And if I were to
run this in iOS 6,

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.854
they are still back in
their original location.

00:06:50.854 --> 00:06:52.270
So this is one
work around, if you

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.250
find yourself running
into the same issues

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.180
once you've switched to iOS 7.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.860
And we can do the same thing
in the game view controller.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.490
Here, I'm going to
select, actually,

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.200
just about everything here.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.510
Make sure I'm viewing
it as iOS 6.1.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.420
And then we go back
to my size inspector

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.330
and set the delta y to 60.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.560
And that will have
this one fixed as well.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:28.930
So if I go back to
iOS 7 and run this,

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.970
everything is now placed
properly-- on an iOS 7 device.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.100
And so with that, we are
now fully modernized.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:41.260
We're using Xcode 5,
iOS 7, using version 1.4

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.470
of the Google+ SDK,
or, I guess, 1.4.1,

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.280
and using version 1.2
of the Play Games SDK.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.879
And who knows.

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:51.420
Maybe by the time
you see this video,

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.530
we'll even be at
a higher version.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:54.600
But there you go.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.372
With that, we're
now all set to go.

00:07:56.372 --> 00:07:58.080
And we can start
looking at achievements,

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.450
which we'll do in
the next lesson.
