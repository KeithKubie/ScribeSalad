00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:02.879
Woah. Wow

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.318
Hey Guys Welcome Back to Another Random Experiment Today I'm here With my buddy tony Stark Because

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.598
We're Gonna be Testing to see Whether you can Let off Gunpowder

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.319
With A stun gun [so] here's the deal This Company Called Loot

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.010
Crate Just Ship this Box to my House and I have no [idea] what's inside I guess that's why

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.389
They Call it a mystery Box [but] you and I are Gonna Rip This Thing open and See what kind of fun we Can have

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.490
Today With [Whatever's] in it hey I got an iron man [Check] that out so here's [Where]

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.039
We're Gonna answer the Question will Electricity ignite Gunpowder

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.580
Let's go give it a try

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.939
[Now] the Gunpowder I'm going to be using Is a muzzleloading Propellant and it's not True black Powder but it is a triple Fg

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.159
Equivalent and I thought it'd be Fun to build a fairly nice Pile of this Stuff Although this is going to be very Dangerous and

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.840
I could not recommend Anybody try this at

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.239
Home

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.329
This Little Toy has a Button when you press it the Arc Reactor lights up which Is pretty cool and the neat Thing [about] This

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.329
Toy is its [100%] metal, [oh]?

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:56.969
No I just ran out of Juice, [oh]

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.359
You got, to be Kidding me my taser Just died and I don't think I have enough Time to charge it dang it now

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.059
We don't have very much Time to Work [With] here Because we've got A severe Thunderstorm?

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.639
Rolling in Right now so we've got A very Limited Window of

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.280
Opportunity Work With now This is A real Bummer Guys Because you Probably know That Water and Gunpowder don't mix if This stuff Gets Wet

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.019
It's not gonna Work it's Really, Really, Really Bad Timing for something like This to happen rain Is not good

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.450
Well Needless to say I didn't Make it Just Camped out While this rain Settles Down how. Would you look at. That now [Kalin]

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.270
[Alright] it Looks like, We got a little Break in the Clouds so let's run out and Try That again

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.060
How's our Little Mascot doing over here, did he Survive

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.340
That Guy

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.479
Is made of a hundred percent diecast Metal this Thing is Completely Soaked

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.799
Alright The rain Subsided Just A bit and I got my stun gun [charged] so let's give This Another Shot

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.130
Yeah!

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.679
It Worked it Worked Look, Look at that that was a really cool, Reaction that was awesome

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.870
[Wouldn't] The Fire Look at the way that Just went Up in Flames

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.119
and he's a little bit warm to the touch and you can See a little bit of Residue on the Outside but other Than that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.800
He's in Perfect [Shape]

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.410
Let's go Bigger I'm Gonna go Ahead and use pretty much the whole rest of the Bottle here This Should, be a pretty good Reaction

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.510
Now we've got iron man Buried up [to] his Knees and Gunpowder?

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.770
And a little Trail of powder Back here so I have Just a second or [two] to get out of the

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.770
Way all right let's do it, [oh]?

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.399

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.599
That is so cool

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.699
Now I admit this did Catch me a little bit Off-Guard when it went Up in Flames you can See as it starts to spark

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.709
and i jump off the Flame Grows About

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.709
As fast as I could get away [from] it pretty much Engulfs the entire

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.709
Table in Flame and [then] the smoke [Just] Goes Up in A Huge Mushroom Cloud that Looks so cool

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.099
Yeah and our [Captain] [America] got a little over Spray but other than that it's Umberto There's a little bit of a Scorch Mark There
