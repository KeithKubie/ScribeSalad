00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.410
So Matt, let's say an adopted individual

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.200
was looking for a parent or sibling through

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.210
a genome match. Now, would they be looking

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.340
for somebody who they share 50% IBS with?

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.720
&gt;&gt; actually no. Remember that an IBS score for

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.201
a parent-child relationship is already much higher, somewhere around 85%.

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:16.846
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:00:16.846 --> 00:00:21.570
&gt;&gt; The 50% number is referring to actually the shared segments,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.800
the shared SNV single nucleotide variance between a parent and a child.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.990
So, for example, we would be able to lay the chromosomes side by side

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.320
and see that in a parent and a child, they share the SNVs all

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.250
along the whole length of the chromosome.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.980
Whereas a sibling relationship, you would share

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.130
regions of chromosomes that are shared SNV's,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.140
but not the whole length of the chromosome.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.360
&gt;&gt; That's really cool, but where can I actually line these two up?

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.440
&gt;&gt; Well, you can actually do this on the 23andMe

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.910
website. They have an ancestry tool that allows you to

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.710
select individuals that you've shared your genome

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.140
with, and you can lay the chromosomes

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.260
side and side, and you can see

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.570
exactly which segments you share with another individual.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.490
&gt;&gt; That's awesome. So we're not just looking at the percent we're related to

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.800
somebody, but we're actually seeing what portions

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.950
of our genetic information we share with someone.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.700
&gt;&gt; Exactly, that's exactly what it is. Now,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.000
the shared regions of descent, actually represent the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.770
percentage relation we are to each other. If

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.360
you share 50% of these regions, you're 50% related.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.820
And we call this, identity by descent, or IBD.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.160
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I get this whole parent-child relations thing. But, what about

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.308
beyond that? What if I share 25% IBD with someone? What does that mean?

00:01:29.308 --> 00:01:33.510
&gt;&gt; Well, let me ask you, which of the following family relationships do you

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.620
think would share 25% relatedness with you? Go ahead and check all that apply.
