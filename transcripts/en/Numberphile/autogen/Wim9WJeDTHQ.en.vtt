00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.999
today we are doing the number two 777 7

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009
today we are doing the number two 777 7
 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.990
today we are doing the number two 777 7
7 7 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 so I guess if you want

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000
7 7 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 so I guess if you want
 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.910
7 7 8 8 8 8 8 9 9 so I guess if you want
to split that up two hundred seventy

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920
to split that up two hundred seventy
 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.589
to split that up two hundred seventy
seven trillion seven hundred and seventy

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599
seven trillion seven hundred and seventy
 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.330
seven trillion seven hundred and seventy
seven billion seven hundred and seventy

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
seven billion seven hundred and seventy
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.290
seven billion seven hundred and seventy
eight million eight hundred eighty eight

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300
eight million eight hundred eighty eight
 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.420
eight million eight hundred eighty eight
thousand eight hundred and ninety nine

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430
thousand eight hundred and ninety nine
 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.810
thousand eight hundred and ninety nine
this is a a record-breaking number when

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
this is a a record-breaking number when
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.460
this is a a record-breaking number when
it comes to the multiplication

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
it comes to the multiplication
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.830
it comes to the multiplication
assistance of a number so we'll do a

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840
assistance of a number so we'll do a
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.200
assistance of a number so we'll do a
smaller one just to get a handle on it

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
smaller one just to get a handle on it
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.279
smaller one just to get a handle on it
we'd like to give me a small I don't

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289
we'd like to give me a small I don't
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.810
we'd like to give me a small I don't
know like three or four digit number

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
know like three or four digit number
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.020
know like three or four digit number
would you like ready oh I always regret

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
would you like ready oh I always regret
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.650
would you like ready oh I always regret
asking you this 54:28 right so the first

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
asking you this 54:28 right so the first
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.200
asking you this 54:28 right so the first
thing we do is we multiply all the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
thing we do is we multiply all the
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.030
thing we do is we multiply all the
digits together so five and two is gonna

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
digits together so five and two is gonna
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.940
digits together so five and two is gonna
give us ten four and eight to give us 32

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950
give us ten four and eight to give us 32
 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.139
give us ten four and eight to give us 32
so it's gonna be 320 and then we

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
so it's gonna be 320 and then we
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.549
so it's gonna be 320 and then we
continue we multiply all the digits

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559
continue we multiply all the digits
 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.150
continue we multiply all the digits
together

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
together
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.479
together
now there's a zero so zero so you made

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489
now there's a zero so zero so you made
 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.959
now there's a zero so zero so you made
it two steps before we hit a one digit

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969
it two steps before we hit a one digit
 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.729
it two steps before we hit a one digit
number and if we have any one digit

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739
number and if we have any one digit
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.860
number and if we have any one digit
number you just you can't multiply the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
number you just you can't multiply the
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.230
number you just you can't multiply the
digits anymore and you stop so the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
digits anymore and you stop so the
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.750
digits anymore and you stop so the
question is I'm so disappointed yeah

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760
question is I'm so disappointed yeah
 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.920
question is I'm so disappointed yeah
can I have another try did you want

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
can I have another try did you want
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.750
can I have another try did you want
another go yeah let's try this it's not

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
another go yeah let's try this it's not
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.010
another go yeah let's try this it's not
called persistence for nothing what

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
called persistence for nothing what
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.789
called persistence for nothing what
would you like see where you went wrong

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
would you like see where you went wrong
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.640
would you like see where you went wrong
brady is a 502 spells doom because

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
brady is a 502 spells doom because
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.870
brady is a 502 spells doom because
that's gonna chuck a 0 on the end

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
that's gonna chuck a 0 on the end
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.399
that's gonna chuck a 0 on the end
straight away so don't make that mistake

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
straight away so don't make that mistake
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:29.330
straight away so don't make that mistake
again three to six nice you going for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
again three to six nice you going for
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.819
again three to six nice you going for
primes look at you okay let's see how

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829
primes look at you okay let's see how
 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.700
primes look at you okay let's see how
that goes so that six sevens which is 42

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
that goes so that six sevens which is 42
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.179
that goes so that six sevens which is 42
someone will correct me if I'm wrong

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189
someone will correct me if I'm wrong
 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.490
someone will correct me if I'm wrong
four times two is gonna give us eight

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
four times two is gonna give us eight
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.850
four times two is gonna give us eight
and then we're stuck two steps at home

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
and then we're stuck two steps at home
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.580
and then we're stuck two steps at home
if you want try and pick a number see if

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
if you want try and pick a number see if
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.749
if you want try and pick a number see if
you can beat Brady's current record of 2

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759
you can beat Brady's current record of 2
 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.520
you can beat Brady's current record of 2
so how long do you reckon this one goes

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530
so how long do you reckon this one goes
 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.649
so how long do you reckon this one goes
for your big number yeah big number what

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659
for your big number yeah big number what
 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.460
for your big number yeah big number what
do you what do you think we're gonna get

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
do you what do you think we're gonna get
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.690
do you what do you think we're gonna get
out of that one have yeah what do you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700
out of that one have yeah what do you
 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.039
out of that one have yeah what do you
reckon dude you've already told me it's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049
reckon dude you've already told me it's
 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.569
reckon dude you've already told me it's
a record holder that's right but because

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
a record holder that's right but because
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.060
a record holder that's right but because
you're willing to do it for me now makes

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070
you're willing to do it for me now makes
 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.950
you're willing to do it for me now makes
me think it's not crazy big whether by

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
me think it's not crazy big whether by
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.230
me think it's not crazy big whether by
shied away from a crazy-big calculation

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
shied away from a crazy-big calculation
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.249
shied away from a crazy-big calculation
so I'm gonna go for something

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259
so I'm gonna go for something
 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.350
so I'm gonna go for something
surprisingly smaller I'm gonna go for

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
surprisingly smaller I'm gonna go for
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.590
surprisingly smaller I'm gonna go for
like 10 10

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600
like 10 10
 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.280
like 10 10
my calculator out two times seven equals

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290
my calculator out two times seven equals
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.780
my calculator out two times seven equals
there's one seven two four nine nine six

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790
there's one seven two four nine nine six
 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.040
there's one seven two four nine nine six
times six times two oh okay so now we're

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
times six times two oh okay so now we're
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.270
times six times two oh okay so now we're
down to four times three times eight

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280
down to four times three times eight
 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.370
down to four times three times eight
what's very exciting about this is I've

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
what's very exciting about this is I've
 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.310
what's very exciting about this is I've
never actually checked this this is the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320
never actually checked this this is the
 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.290
never actually checked this this is the
first time I've actually and now I'm

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300
first time I've actually and now I'm
 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.030
first time I've actually and now I'm
feeling a little nervous like that's the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
feeling a little nervous like that's the
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.680
feeling a little nervous like that's the
level of preparation yet on numberphile

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
level of preparation yet on numberphile
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.600
level of preparation yet on numberphile
how much prep I put into these videos

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610
how much prep I put into these videos
 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.150
how much prep I put into these videos
pretty is like what numbers are you into

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160
pretty is like what numbers are you into
 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.340
pretty is like what numbers are you into
currently I like are kind of interested

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350
currently I like are kind of interested
 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.820
currently I like are kind of interested
in this one two seven seven times 54 5

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830
in this one two seven seven times 54 5
 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:07.070
in this one two seven seven times 54 5
times 4 is 20 is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
times 4 is 20 is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.850
times 4 is 20 is 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860
11
 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.340
11
Oh 11 and that's the correct answer

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350
Oh 11 and that's the correct answer
 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.860
Oh 11 and that's the correct answer
thank goodness it has a persistence of

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870
thank goodness it has a persistence of
 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.190
thank goodness it has a persistence of
11 which is the current world record for

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200
11 which is the current world record for
 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.290
11 which is the current world record for
multiplication persistence of a number

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300
multiplication persistence of a number
 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.690
multiplication persistence of a number
other numbers equaled the record but

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700
other numbers equaled the record but
 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.820
other numbers equaled the record but
this is the shortest number with the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830
this is the shortest number with the
 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.090
this is the shortest number with the
biggest currently no and persistence and

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100
biggest currently no and persistence and
 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.580
biggest currently no and persistence and
so that is the current champion hang on

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590
so that is the current champion hang on
 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.040
so that is the current champion hang on
so you're with no limit on the number of

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050
so you're with no limit on the number of
 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.170
so you're with no limit on the number of
digits no-knock is about managers

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180
digits no-knock is about managers
 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.180
digits no-knock is about managers
everyone and often in these videos I say

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190
everyone and often in these videos I say
 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.310
everyone and often in these videos I say
I went away and I programmed a thing and

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320
I went away and I programmed a thing and
 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.350
I went away and I programmed a thing and
then I calculate it and I found this I

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360
then I calculate it and I found this I
 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.690
then I calculate it and I found this I
found that i have not programmed this

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700
found that i have not programmed this
 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.100
found that i have not programmed this

underprepared today I haven't coded it

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360
underprepared today I haven't coded it
 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.390
underprepared today I haven't coded it
up but we could should we do it live do

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400
up but we could should we do it live do
 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.150
up but we could should we do it live do
me do it do it cuz I always say I code

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160
me do it do it cuz I always say I code
 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.430
me do it do it cuz I always say I code
something and I find them let's code

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440
something and I find them let's code
 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.780
something and I find them let's code
something let's find it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
something let's find it
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.180
something let's find it
I'll get my laptop so funny story last

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190
I'll get my laptop so funny story last
 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.480
I'll get my laptop so funny story last
week my keyboard stopped working and the

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490
week my keyboard stopped working and the
 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.360
week my keyboard stopped working and the
trackpad on my laptop which is a bit

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
trackpad on my laptop which is a bit
 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.850
trackpad on my laptop which is a bit
awkward okay so first things first we're

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860
awkward okay so first things first we're
 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.440
awkward okay so first things first we're
gonna set something going which is going

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450
gonna set something going which is going
 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.700
gonna set something going which is going
to do this process over and over and

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710
to do this process over and over and
 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.220
to do this process over and over and
over again but we want it to stop once

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230
over again but we want it to stop once
 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.290
over again but we want it to stop once
it gets to a thing which is only one

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300
it gets to a thing which is only one
 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.840
it gets to a thing which is only one
okay so this is gonna take some number

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850
okay so this is gonna take some number
 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.310
okay so this is gonna take some number
and the first thing we're gonna say is

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320
and the first thing we're gonna say is
 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.000
and the first thing we're gonna say is
if the

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010
if the
 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.240
if the
the length of the number of digits to

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250
the length of the number of digits to
 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.390
the length of the number of digits to
the string and so the great thing about

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400
the string and so the great thing about
 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.030
the string and so the great thing about
n isn't it's not only a number when we

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040
n isn't it's not only a number when we
 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.770
n isn't it's not only a number when we
care about digits I'm going to turn it

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780
care about digits I'm going to turn it
 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.600
care about digits I'm going to turn it
into a string that goes from being like

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610
into a string that goes from being like
 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.490
into a string that goes from being like
a number represented in binary or

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500
a number represented in binary or
 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.490
a number represented in binary or
whatever base to just being the base ten

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500
whatever base to just being the base ten
 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.280
whatever base to just being the base ten
digits in a string and if the length of

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290
digits in a string and if the length of
 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.310
digits in a string and if the length of
that string equals one then we're done

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320
that string equals one then we're done
 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.570
that string equals one then we're done
right we're at the very end of the thing

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580
right we're at the very end of the thing
 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.220
right we're at the very end of the thing
right so that's at that point print

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230
right so that's at that point print
 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.310
right so that's at that point print
whatever n is and then finish so return

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320
whatever n is and then finish so return
 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.120
whatever n is and then finish so return
I don't know like done all right that's

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130
I don't know like done all right that's
 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.620
I don't know like done all right that's
just gonna tell it you know your job

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630
just gonna tell it you know your job
 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.250
just gonna tell it you know your job
here is done

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260
here is done
 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.880
here is done
okay otherwise we need to multiply

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890
okay otherwise we need to multiply
 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.410
okay otherwise we need to multiply
together all the digits digits equals

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420
together all the digits digits equals
 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.240
together all the digits digits equals
with two as a list I for I in the string

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250
with two as a list I for I in the string
 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.370
with two as a list I for I in the string
version of the number right so they're

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380
version of the number right so they're
 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.530
version of the number right so they're
turning into a string of digits and then

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540
turning into a string of digits and then
 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.880
turning into a string of digits and then
it's taking out each one individually

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890
it's taking out each one individually
 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.580
it's taking out each one individually
all but we want them as as numbers so

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590
all but we want them as as numbers so
 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.720
all but we want them as as numbers so
let's turn them back into numbers so

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730
let's turn them back into numbers so
 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.480
let's turn them back into numbers so
bizarrely I'm turning it into digits as

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490
bizarrely I'm turning it into digits as
 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.280
bizarrely I'm turning it into digits as
a string then taking out each one

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290
a string then taking out each one
 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.510
a string then taking out each one
separately then turning them back into

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520
separately then turning them back into
 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.100
separately then turning them back into
numbers right which is kind of because

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110
numbers right which is kind of because
 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.720
numbers right which is kind of because
this is a base-10 thing one of the sad

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730
this is a base-10 thing one of the sad
 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.810
this is a base-10 thing one of the sad
things about stuff like this is its base

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820
things about stuff like this is its base
 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.570
things about stuff like this is its base
specific so now we've got all the digits

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580
specific so now we've got all the digits
 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.670
specific so now we've got all the digits
for J I'm just using J is the

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680
for J I'm just using J is the
 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.260
for J I'm just using J is the
placeholder in digits so now we want to

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270
placeholder in digits so now we want to
 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.360
placeholder in digits so now we want to
multiply them all together okay you know

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370
multiply them all together okay you know
 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:48.480
multiply them all together okay you know
let's have current result result equals

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490
let's have current result result equals
 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.590
let's have current result result equals
one to start with and then each time

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600
one to start with and then each time
 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.160
one to start with and then each time
result equals result multiplied by that

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.170
result equals result multiplied by that
 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.340
result equals result multiplied by that
digit and you can do x equals just means

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350
digit and you can do x equals just means
 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.660
digit and you can do x equals just means
make it equal to this times Jack whoops

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670
make it equal to this times Jack whoops
 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.570
make it equal to this times Jack whoops
J okay I think that's it and that's

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580
J okay I think that's it and that's
 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.340
J okay I think that's it and that's
gonna give us a new result but then

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350
gonna give us a new result but then
 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.050
gonna give us a new result but then
we've got to repeat the process so this

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060
we've got to repeat the process so this
 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.960
we've got to repeat the process so this
is where we can cheat and I haven't

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970
is where we can cheat and I haven't
 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.520
is where we can cheat and I haven't
genuinely haven't tried coding this

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.530
genuinely haven't tried coding this
 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.810
genuinely haven't tried coding this
before so I don't know if this is going

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820
before so I don't know if this is going
 

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.160
before so I don't know if this is going
to work I'm going to try and get

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170
to work I'm going to try and get
 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.130
to work I'm going to try and get
recursive and then put that new result

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140
recursive and then put that new result
 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.440
recursive and then put that new result
into the same function so if it's one

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450
into the same function so if it's one
 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.990
into the same function so if it's one
long it'll stop otherwise it'll multiply

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000
long it'll stop otherwise it'll multiply
 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.880
long it'll stop otherwise it'll multiply
all the digits together and then put it

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890
all the digits together and then put it
 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.410
all the digits together and then put it
back into the beginning and it will

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420
back into the beginning and it will
 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:33.330
back into the beginning and it will
keep repeating through this process and

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340
keep repeating through this process and
 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.850
keep repeating through this process and
you know what let's make it print the

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860
you know what let's make it print the
 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.730
you know what let's make it print the
result each time so we get we get to see

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740
result each time so we get we get to see
 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.200
result each time so we get we get to see
them all as it as it loops through and

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210
them all as it as it loops through and
 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.630
them all as it as it loops through and
then when it hits here it'll stop and

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640
then when it hits here it'll stop and
 

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.430
then when it hits here it'll stop and
say done okay that can't go wrong that's

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440
say done okay that can't go wrong that's
 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.340
say done okay that can't go wrong that's
fine I really should have checked this

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350
fine I really should have checked this
 

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.540
fine I really should have checked this
in advance okay

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550
in advance okay
 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.370
in advance okay
copy I'm just gonna fire up terminal

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380
copy I'm just gonna fire up terminal
 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.260

okay so what I'm actually gonna do this

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.270
okay so what I'm actually gonna do this
 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:57.270
okay so what I'm actually gonna do this
is the laziest way to run something

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280
is the laziest way to run something
 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.790
is the laziest way to run something
literally paste it into terminal let's

00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800
literally paste it into terminal let's
 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.470
literally paste it into terminal let's
do the persistence of three to seven

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:04.480
do the persistence of three to seven
 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.420
do the persistence of three to seven
which is the second one you said 42

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430
which is the second one you said 42
 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.220
which is the second one you said 42
eight and then eight forever right and

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:11.230
eight and then eight forever right and
 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:12.510
eight and then eight forever right and
so it's donate twice and then going

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520
so it's donate twice and then going
 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.250
so it's donate twice and then going
we're out okay I couldn't fix the code

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260
we're out okay I couldn't fix the code
 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.890
we're out okay I couldn't fix the code
to not get the the last one twice I just

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:16.900
to not get the the last one twice I just
 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.840
to not get the the last one twice I just
changed where the check is so actually

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850
changed where the check is so actually
 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.490
changed where the check is so actually
what I could have done is have another

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:20.500
what I could have done is have another
 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.730
what I could have done is have another
check in here so I don't print the

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740
check in here so I don't print the
 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.010
check in here so I don't print the
result and then print it again before

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.020
result and then print it again before
 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.440
result and then print it again before
stopping I could put the check in but

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450
stopping I could put the check in but
 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.050
stopping I could put the check in but
I'm not gonna nodes it fit for purpose

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:31.060
I'm not gonna nodes it fit for purpose
 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.360
I'm not gonna nodes it fit for purpose
alright for a first pass it's fine

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:33.370
alright for a first pass it's fine
 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.070
alright for a first pass it's fine
and then the very first one let's just

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.080
and then the very first one let's just
 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.900
and then the very first one let's just
check the first one just to make sure

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:36.910
check the first one just to make sure
 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:42.320
check the first one just to make sure
I've messed this up five four two eight

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.330
I've messed this up five four two eight
 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.640
I've messed this up five four two eight
it goes to three twenty goes to zero

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:44.650
it goes to three twenty goes to zero
 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.280
it goes to three twenty goes to zero
right and now the ultimate test can it

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:47.290
right and now the ultimate test can it
 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:53.160
right and now the ultimate test can it
handle two six seven 6/8 two nines there

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.170
handle two six seven 6/8 two nines there
 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.440
handle two six seven 6/8 two nines there
we go right so and that's that's so much

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:55.450
we go right so and that's that's so much
 

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:58.250
we go right so and that's that's so much
quicker right so it's now spat out

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:58.260
quicker right so it's now spat out
 

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:00.990
quicker right so it's now spat out
exactly these all the way down and then

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000
exactly these all the way down and then
 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.140
exactly these all the way down and then
it stops doesn't give us a number are do

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.150
it stops doesn't give us a number are do
 

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.670
it stops doesn't give us a number are do
we want like a do we want a number of

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680
we want like a do we want a number of
 

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:10.230
we want like a do we want a number of
steps at the end number of steps okay

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.240
steps at the end number of steps okay
 

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.720
steps at the end number of steps okay
okay I ready will cut this out and put

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:12.730
okay I ready will cut this out and put
 

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.460
okay I ready will cut this out and put
it on the second channel too one two

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:17.470
it on the second channel too one two
 

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.910
it on the second channel too one two
three four five six loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 1

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:20.920
three four five six loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 1
 

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.320
three four five six loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 1
2 yeah total steps 11 okay right so now

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:25.330
2 yeah total steps 11 okay right so now
 

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.930
2 yeah total steps 11 okay right so now
we can put a number in and instantly we

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:27.940
we can put a number in and instantly we
 

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.150
we can put a number in and instantly we
get everything we could no longer print

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:30.160
get everything we could no longer print
 

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.980
get everything we could no longer print
every single step along the way it's

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:31.990
every single step along the way it's
 

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:33.780
every single step along the way it's
kind of fun to see and we get the total

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:33.790
kind of fun to see and we get the total
 

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.030
kind of fun to see and we get the total
number steps so Brady let's put on what

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:36.040
number steps so Brady let's put on what
 

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.870
number steps so Brady let's put on what
would you like you know let's put put as

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880
would you like you know let's put put as
 

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:41.280
would you like you know let's put put as
we just mash it for a while and see what

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:41.290
we just mash it for a while and see what
 

00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.230
we just mash it for a while and see what
we get no cuz you can be strategic ah

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240
we get no cuz you can be strategic ah
 

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.060
we get no cuz you can be strategic ah
you're right to put a 5

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:45.070
you're right to put a 5
 

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.829
you're right to put a 5
just put in a bunch put in 59 $15.99 two

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839
just put in a bunch put in 59 $15.99 two
 

00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:51.420
just put in a bunch put in 59 $15.99 two
three four five six seven eight nine 10

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:51.430

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.210
three four five six seven eight nine 10
11 12 13 14 15 which is just nine to the

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:54.220
11 12 13 14 15 which is just nine to the
 

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.670
11 12 13 14 15 which is just nine to the
15 and I put in another 10 Oh another

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680
15 and I put in another 10 Oh another
 

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:57.689
15 and I put in another 10 Oh another
ten nine yep

00:08:57.689 --> 00:08:57.699
ten nine yep
 

00:08:57.699 --> 00:08:59.449
ten nine yep
well let's just see if that one works

00:08:59.449 --> 00:08:59.459
well let's just see if that one works
 

00:08:59.459 --> 00:09:02.970
well let's just see if that one works
two steps oh because we got the zero in

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:02.980
two steps oh because we got the zero in
 

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:04.710
two steps oh because we got the zero in
the answer next time but what I can do

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720
the answer next time but what I can do
 

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.389
the answer next time but what I can do
in your in terminal just push up you get

00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399
in your in terminal just push up you get
 

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:08.730
in your in terminal just push up you get
the previous one stuck a few more 9s on

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:08.740
the previous one stuck a few more 9s on
 

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:13.590
the previous one stuck a few more 9s on
the end two steps now what if we um put

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600
the end two steps now what if we um put
 

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:21.990
the end two steps now what if we um put
in eight instead two steps what about

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000
in eight instead two steps what about
 

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.660
in eight instead two steps what about
what about the string you used like at

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:24.670
what about the string you used like at
 

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:25.620
what about the string you used like at
the current record holder

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:25.630
the current record holder
 

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.019
the current record holder
yeah but put a three on the front I love

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:28.029
yeah but put a three on the front I love
 

00:09:28.029 --> 00:09:33.900
yeah but put a three on the front I love
it okay so 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 9

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:33.910
it okay so 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 9
 

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.370
it okay so 3 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 9
9 ah brilliant I love like I love you

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:35.380
9 ah brilliant I love like I love you
 

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:42.019
9 ah brilliant I love like I love you
thinking ready and 2 steps so it's zero

00:09:42.019 --> 00:09:42.029
thinking ready and 2 steps so it's zero
 

00:09:42.029 --> 00:09:45.329
thinking ready and 2 steps so it's zero
zeros are a lamb boom hit a zero you're

00:09:45.329 --> 00:09:45.339
zeros are a lamb boom hit a zero you're
 

00:09:45.339 --> 00:09:48.030
zeros are a lamb boom hit a zero you're
out this is minesweeper but for number

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.040
out this is minesweeper but for number
 

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.410
out this is minesweeper but for number
searches okay

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:49.420
searches okay
 

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.699
searches okay
so this is what I would do I would now

00:09:50.699 --> 00:09:50.709
so this is what I would do I would now
 

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:52.920
so this is what I would do I would now
play with this for a while and it seems

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:52.930
play with this for a while and it seems
 

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.889
play with this for a while and it seems
to be whenever you put in some random

00:09:55.889 --> 00:09:55.899
to be whenever you put in some random
 

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:59.220
to be whenever you put in some random
string of numbers and boom right because

00:09:59.220 --> 00:09:59.230
string of numbers and boom right because
 

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.639
string of numbers and boom right because
it was a zero the next one it's gone

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:01.649
it was a zero the next one it's gone
 

00:10:01.649 --> 00:10:03.750
it was a zero the next one it's gone
would need to be more strategic what

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760
would need to be more strategic what
 

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.800
would need to be more strategic what
about all the digits of pi all of them

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:06.810
about all the digits of pi all of them
 

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.150
about all the digits of pi all of them
get cracking on that three eight one

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160
get cracking on that three eight one
 

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.980
get cracking on that three eight one
four one five nine two six five I figure

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:13.990
four one five nine two six five I figure
 

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.879
four one five nine two six five I figure
that's that's enough - Wow

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:17.889
that's that's enough - Wow
 

00:10:17.889 --> 00:10:19.829
that's that's enough - Wow
11 seems a lot more impressive all of a

00:10:19.829 --> 00:10:19.839
11 seems a lot more impressive all of a
 

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:21.540
11 seems a lot more impressive all of a
sudden no wonder it's the world record

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:21.550
sudden no wonder it's the world record
 

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.670
sudden no wonder it's the world record
so does this mean that you could set up

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680
so does this mean that you could set up
 

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.860
so does this mean that you could set up
a program that would just put every

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:25.870
a program that would just put every
 

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.509
a program that would just put every
number in one after another and just

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519
number in one after another and just
 

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:29.189
number in one after another and just
leave it you know leave it for an hour

00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:29.199
leave it you know leave it for an hour
 

00:10:29.199 --> 00:10:31.860
leave it you know leave it for an hour
or two so what we've done now is we've

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:31.870
or two so what we've done now is we've
 

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.370
or two so what we've done now is we've
built the basics of checking next we

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:35.380
built the basics of checking next we
 

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.199
built the basics of checking next we
want to build something to do the search

00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:37.209
want to build something to do the search
 

00:10:37.209 --> 00:10:38.819
want to build something to do the search
so we could just get something to

00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:38.829
so we could just get something to
 

00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:40.650
so we could just get something to
generate random numbers of a certain

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:40.660
generate random numbers of a certain
 

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.350
generate random numbers of a certain
size shove them in and send us an email

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360
size shove them in and send us an email
 

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.179
size shove them in and send us an email
if it gets a good one the next step

00:10:45.179 --> 00:10:45.189
if it gets a good one the next step
 

00:10:45.189 --> 00:10:48.030
if it gets a good one the next step
would be to be strategic about what

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.040
would be to be strategic about what
 

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.170
would be to be strategic about what
numbers we were putting in because

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:49.180
numbers we were putting in because
 

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:51.269
numbers we were putting in because
already you realized don't put it in a 5

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279
already you realized don't put it in a 5
 

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:54.540
already you realized don't put it in a 5
you put in a 5 it's not gonna work so we

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:54.550
you put in a 5 it's not gonna work so we
 

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:57.389
you put in a 5 it's not gonna work so we
could create a search which doesn't put

00:10:57.389 --> 00:10:57.399
could create a search which doesn't put
 

00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:58.530
could create a search which doesn't put
in fives

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:58.540
in fives
 

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.930
in fives
doesn't put in any combination we know

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:00.940
doesn't put in any combination we know
 

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.330
doesn't put in any combination we know
will definitely give us zero and

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:03.340
will definitely give us zero and
 

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.980
will definitely give us zero and
actually we can get even smarter than

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:04.990
actually we can get even smarter than
 

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:06.690
actually we can get even smarter than
that because if we're looking for the

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:06.700
that because if we're looking for the
 

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.900
that because if we're looking for the
smallest number that it works for it

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:09.910
smallest number that it works for it
 

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.250
smallest number that it works for it
doesn't matter what order the digits are

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:11.260
doesn't matter what order the digits are
 

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:14.010
doesn't matter what order the digits are
in so in fact all the current record

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:14.020
in so in fact all the current record
 

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:15.960
in so in fact all the current record
holders the shortest number of digits

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:15.970
holders the shortest number of digits
 

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.330
holders the shortest number of digits
for different persistence values so

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:18.340
for different persistence values so
 

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.040
for different persistence values so
there's a record holder for 10 and for 9

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:20.050
there's a record holder for 10 and for 9
 

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:22.410
there's a record holder for 10 and for 9
and so on they're always the digits

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:22.420
and so on they're always the digits
 

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:24.300
and so on they're always the digits
worries in ascending order because you

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:24.310
worries in ascending order because you
 

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.010
worries in ascending order because you
want the smallest number with those

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:26.020
want the smallest number with those
 

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.900
want the smallest number with those
digits so in fact you don't have to

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:27.910
digits so in fact you don't have to
 

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.330
digits so in fact you don't have to
search for shuffled around versions you

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:30.340
search for shuffled around versions you
 

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.920
search for shuffled around versions you
just need that set of digits in that

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:31.930
just need that set of digits in that
 

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:33.540
just need that set of digits in that
order and then there's other things so

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:33.550
order and then there's other things so
 

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.840
order and then there's other things so
for example this one here we'll use your

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:36.850
for example this one here we'll use your
 

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.690
for example this one here we'll use your
first one you put in five four to eight

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:39.700
first one you put in five four to eight
 

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.150
first one you put in five four to eight
that's going to give you exactly the

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160
that's going to give you exactly the
 

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.970
that's going to give you exactly the
same result as first of all you could

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:44.980
same result as first of all you could
 

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.270
same result as first of all you could
have put in two four five eight which is

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:48.280
have put in two four five eight which is
 

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.700
have put in two four five eight which is
smaller but actually two times four is

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:50.710
smaller but actually two times four is
 

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.400
smaller but actually two times four is
going to give you eight so you could

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:53.410
going to give you eight so you could
 

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.860
going to give you eight so you could
actually have just put in five eight

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:55.870
actually have just put in five eight
 

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.290
actually have just put in five eight
eight that's going to give you exactly

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:58.300
eight that's going to give you exactly
 

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.870
eight that's going to give you exactly
the same sequence as that and it's

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880
the same sequence as that and it's
 

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.210
the same sequence as that and it's
smaller so if all you care about are the

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:03.220
smaller so if all you care about are the
 

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.250
smaller so if all you care about are the
smallest possible values for that

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.260
smallest possible values for that
 

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.350
smallest possible values for that
sequence of persistence afterwards

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:07.360
sequence of persistence afterwards
 

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.720
sequence of persistence afterwards
multiplication persistence then you

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:09.730
multiplication persistence then you
 

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.460
multiplication persistence then you
never want to have a 2 and a 4 you never

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:11.470
never want to have a 2 and a 4 you never
 

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.140
never want to have a 2 and a 4 you never
want to have two threes because I could

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.150

be a 9 you never want a 5 at all in fact

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:16.090

00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.750

1/4 I think and then all sevens eights

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:27.550

and nines for the rest of it so we could

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:30.070
and nines for the rest of it so we could
 

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.910
and nines for the rest of it so we could
reduce our search space dramatically

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:32.920
