00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.839
From lightsabers to the force and mind tricks the Jedi are a force to be reckoned with even against the best of superheroes

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:12.449
But with the new Star Wars The Last Jedi trailer and movie coming out soon not to mention EA's

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.090
Battlefront 2 debacle we started wondering whether or not the Jedi could actually exist hypothetically. Could

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.850
humans ever have or obtain some of these capabilities? First up are the Jedi's incredible reflexes,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.089
which could be linked to seeing the world in slow motion,

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.678
along with their ability of foresight. When you're put in a dangerous or stressful situation

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:38.279
time often seems to slow down, and this is because your brain begins taking in much more information than normal.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.910
But even in these moments your reflexes and time perception

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.800
hardly compare to some other animals.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.719
If you've ever tried to hit a fly you might realize that what is a really quick swat on

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.788
your part is easily avoided by the fly and that's because the fly actually perceives it as slower.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.659
Scientists use the point at which a flickering light is seen as one

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.329
continuous light as a marker for visual sensitivity.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.075
And it turns out flies can see light flickering at a rate nearly seven times faster than we do.

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:07.768
For them, one second actually

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.549
feels longer.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:16.739
Scientists believe that perception of time co-evolved with how fast an animal moves, how quick their metabolism is and how big their bodies are.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.799
After all it doesn't make much sense for your brain to take in so much

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.460
information if your body can't physically react to it in time.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.970
As a result

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.449
leatherback turtles only get about 1/3 of the information that human brains do in one second. Dogs on the other hand can see about

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.219
25% faster than humans, making our TVs look like a set of flickering lights.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.380
But with improvements in vision sensitivity jedi-like reflexes could become possible.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.589
But it would only matter if you could physically react fast enough.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.477
Otherwise you would just be seeing something come towards you slowly with no means to actually stop it.

00:01:48.477 --> 00:01:50.280
While the force is a somewhat mystical

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.140
and elusive concept in the movies, it touches on some ideas that scientists have long tried to explore.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.879
Ancient Greeks actually believed in a fifth element that connected everything in the universe and even Isaac Newton proposed a concept of our brains

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.029
interacting with something called ether that was all around us,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.359
which could potentially give us psychic powers. And while the force is described in many different ways Obi-wan suggests,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.620
"It's an energy field created by all living things it.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.789
Surrounds us, penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together."

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.220
This sounds in some ways like the electric fields that exist in and all around us.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.549
Human brains for example emit brainwaves, a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels at the speed of light.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.030
This is released from the activity of thousands of neurons simultaneously

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.579
firing at the same frequency.

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.989
And many animals are actually optimized to sense this electricity, like the platypus.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.759
It catches prey in murky waters at night with their eyes, ears and nostrils all closed and instead using its bill covered in nearly

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.439
40-thousand electro-receptors to detect the micro volts of electricity that their prey emits.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.128
Even human cells have the ability to detect electric fields though

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.030
not consciously.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.200
But perhaps with some genetic engineering our acute awareness of this force could become more pronounced.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.769
Speaking of electricity, many members of the Sith are able to shoot lightning out of their hands.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.099
And there are certain species of fishes that do something similar.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:20.820
Consider the electric eel capable of producing up to 600 volts of electricity. These fish have evolved electric organs at least

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.800
100 million years ago by converting muscle cells to electro sites.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.960
Instead of simply contracting to release a small amount of voltage like normal muscle cells do

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.720
electro sites actually push ions across a membrane in order to create a large flow of positive charge,

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.049
ultimately creating an electric current allowing them to release a shock at will from several feet away. Perhaps through gene modification

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:48.979
technologies like CRISPR a version of these electro sites could be created in humans allowing for electric capabilities.

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:56.389
Now theoretical physicist Michio Kaku thinks that we do have the materials and technology now to make a lightsaber. Just those technologies need to be upgraded.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:04.189
Light sabers are weapons of powerful compact energy that can cut through anything with a few exceptions like another light saber.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.589
Dr. Kaku's design consists of a blade made from superhot plasma, one of the four fundamental states of matter

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:16.459
where air is sucked into the base of the blade and is superheated to create a six thousand six hundred and forty-eight degrees Celsius plasma.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.890
An electromagnetic coil would be used to control the plasma while a telescopic ceramic rod,

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.609
which shoots out of the handle and can resist the as temperature holds the blade all together.

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.599
Where does the energy come from? In the handle of the lightsaber are trillions of nano batteries that power the plasma generator and

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.049
Dr. Kaku thinks of this technology could be ready in the next 50 years.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.049
The Star Wars films state that those with a high

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.060
Midi-chlorian count are actually much more in tune with the force.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.878
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form that resides within all living cells.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.400
They live inside me.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.820
George Lucas has suggested that this was based on the idea of

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.320
mitochondria, an organelle found in all eukaryotic organisms that helped supply energy, cellular differentiation,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:05.000
cell growth, and many other tasks. And while most of your cells have their own DNA in the cell nucleus,

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:11.220
mitochondria actually have their own genome in DNA, which is more similar to a bacteria.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:17.699
Lucas used this as a metaphor for how without symbiosis whether it's cells or entire organisms working together life couldn't exist

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.389
Now if being more in tune with life simply meant having more mitochondria

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:29.720
it could be as simple as doing more exercise. A study that had seniors complete a 12-week exercise program found that skeletal muscle

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:37.400
mitochondrial DNA increased 53 percent after training. Of course we have no real reason to believe this would do much else.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.440
Unless George Lucas knows something about the mitochondria that scientists don't.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.940
George

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.520
Many Jedi are able to employ a type of

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:49.739
telekinesis through the force, and while there's been a lot of interest in the idea of moving objects with your mind

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:55.001
scientific research has not produced reliable, repeatable demonstrations of telekinesis.

00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:57.449
So you can't levitate an object with your mind,

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:01.499
but we have been able to manipulate the force with technology. Though

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.929
it goes against intuition, non-magnetic substances can be levitated within a magnetic field.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:15.330
Physicists have been able to levitate animals, like this frog using a high magnetic field as living things consist of diamagnetic molecules like water

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:20.189
Proteins and bones and the tiny forces these molecules give off allow them to levitate.

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:24.179
Finally the Jedi are able to use Jedi Mind Tricks to implant suggestions,

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.759
which is perhaps most closely linked to hypnosis in our world. The ability to respond to suggestions.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:37.150
Though it typically takes time to induce a person into a hypnotic state and hypnotizability itself is a spectrum where not everyone responds.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.490
But as we move into the future and start potentially putting technologies into our brain

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.720
another route may actually be possible.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.119
This mouse has fiber optic cables wired into its right motor cortex,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.820
which controls movement to the left. As soon as the light is shot into its altered neurons it cannot help

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.600
but run to the left. Its thoughts and actions have been hacked.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.020
As humans continue to enhance their bodies and brains through

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.369
technology brain hacking akin to Jedi Mind Tricks may become a major concern.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.990
Connect to the reward centers of the brain and now you can control how someone feels.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.779
