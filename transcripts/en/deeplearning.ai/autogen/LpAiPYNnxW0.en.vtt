00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 align:start position:0%
was aspiring to do it probably would not
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.460 align:start position:0%
was aspiring to do it probably would not
have<00:00:25.740><c> been</c><00:00:25.890><c> this</c><00:00:26.070><c> in</c><00:00:26.820><c> fact</c><00:00:27.179><c> at</c><00:00:27.779><c> the</c><00:00:27.929><c> time</c><00:00:27.960><c> I</c>

have been this in fact at the time I
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.509 align:start position:0%
have been this in fact at the time I
thought<00:00:28.619><c> being</c><00:00:28.920><c> a</c><00:00:28.980><c> professional</c><00:00:29.250><c> basketball</c>

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
thought being a professional basketball
player<00:00:29.820><c> would</c><00:00:30.300><c> be</c><00:00:30.480><c> the</c><00:00:30.869><c> right</c><00:00:31.050><c> way</c><00:00:31.230><c> to</c><00:00:31.289><c> go</c><00:00:31.560><c> I</c>

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 align:start position:0%
player would be the right way to go I
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.850 align:start position:0%
player would be the right way to go I
don't<00:00:32.940><c> think</c><00:00:33.090><c> I</c><00:00:33.540><c> was</c><00:00:33.780><c> able</c><00:00:34.080><c> to</c><00:00:34.110><c> achieve</c><00:00:34.320><c> it</c><00:00:34.650><c> I</c>

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
don't think I was able to achieve it I
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.500 align:start position:0%
don't think I was able to achieve it I
feel<00:00:35.309><c> that</c><00:00:35.340><c> machine</c><00:00:35.670><c> let</c><00:00:35.790><c> me</c><00:00:35.910><c> left</c><00:00:36.149><c> out</c><00:00:36.329><c> that</c>

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 align:start position:0%
feel that machine let me left out that
 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.780 align:start position:0%
feel that machine let me left out that
DeVos<00:00:36.960><c> ball</c><00:00:37.230><c> didn't</c><00:00:37.590><c> work</c><00:00:37.710><c> out</c><00:00:37.890><c> yeah</c><00:00:38.579><c> that</c>

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 align:start position:0%
DeVos ball didn't work out yeah that
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
DeVos ball didn't work out yeah that
didn't<00:00:39.030><c> work</c><00:00:39.180><c> out</c><00:00:39.329><c> it</c><00:00:39.600><c> was</c><00:00:39.719><c> a</c><00:00:39.750><c> lot</c><00:00:39.899><c> of</c><00:00:39.930><c> fun</c>

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 align:start position:0%
didn't work out it was a lot of fun
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.720 align:start position:0%
didn't work out it was a lot of fun
playing<00:00:40.290><c> basketball</c><00:00:40.770><c> but</c><00:00:40.950><c> it</c><00:00:41.280><c> didn't</c><00:00:41.700><c> work</c>

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 align:start position:0%
playing basketball but it didn't work
 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.420 align:start position:0%
playing basketball but it didn't work
out<00:00:42.000><c> to</c><00:00:42.210><c> try</c><00:00:42.420><c> to</c><00:00:42.450><c> make</c><00:00:42.719><c> it</c><00:00:42.809><c> into</c><00:00:43.050><c> a</c><00:00:43.079><c> career</c>

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 align:start position:0%
out to try to make it into a career
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.150 align:start position:0%
out to try to make it into a career
so<00:00:45.180><c> what</c><00:00:46.050><c> I</c><00:00:46.110><c> really</c><00:00:46.320><c> liked</c><00:00:46.530><c> in</c><00:00:46.680><c> school</c><00:00:46.950><c> was</c>

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
so what I really liked in school was
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.970 align:start position:0%
so what I really liked in school was
physics<00:00:47.760><c> and</c><00:00:47.940><c> math</c><00:00:48.120><c> and</c><00:00:48.360><c> so</c><00:00:49.199><c> from</c><00:00:49.559><c> there</c><00:00:49.800><c> it</c>

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
physics and math and so from there it
 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.439 align:start position:0%
physics and math and so from there it
seemed<00:00:50.399><c> pretty</c><00:00:50.730><c> natural</c><00:00:51.120><c> to</c><00:00:51.239><c> study</c>

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 align:start position:0%
seemed pretty natural to study
 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
seemed pretty natural to study

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
and math in the real world and I should

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
engineering seemed interesting to me
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.810 align:start position:0%
engineering seemed interesting to me
like<00:01:04.110><c> understanding</c><00:01:04.800><c> how</c><00:01:04.949><c> anything</c><00:01:05.460><c> works</c>

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 align:start position:0%
like understanding how anything works
 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
like understanding how anything works
seems<00:01:06.660><c> interesting</c><00:01:07.170><c> trying</c><00:01:07.980><c> to</c><00:01:08.070><c> build</c>

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 align:start position:0%

anything<00:01:08.460><c> is</c><00:01:08.700><c> interesting</c><00:01:09.180><c> and</c><00:01:09.500><c> in</c><00:01:10.500><c> some</c>

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
anything is interesting and in some
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.620 align:start position:0%
anything is interesting and in some
sense<00:01:11.310><c> artificial</c><00:01:11.880><c> intelligence</c><00:01:12.300><c> went</c><00:01:12.540><c> out</c>

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 align:start position:0%
sense artificial intelligence went out
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.010 align:start position:0%
sense artificial intelligence went out
because<00:01:12.840><c> it</c><00:01:12.990><c> seemed</c><00:01:13.260><c> like</c><00:01:13.290><c> it</c><00:01:13.470><c> could</c><00:01:15.020><c> somehow</c>

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
because it seemed like it could somehow
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
because it seemed like it could somehow
help<00:01:16.380><c> all</c><00:01:16.650><c> disciplines</c><00:01:17.130><c> in</c><00:01:17.310><c> some</c><00:01:17.550><c> way</c><00:01:17.700><c> and</c>

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 align:start position:0%
help all disciplines in some way and
 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.180 align:start position:0%
help all disciplines in some way and
also<00:01:19.410><c> it</c><00:01:19.530><c> seems</c><00:01:19.800><c> somehow</c>

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 align:start position:0%
also it seems somehow
 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.220 align:start position:0%
also it seems somehow
a<00:01:20.430><c> little</c><00:01:20.790><c> more</c><00:01:20.970><c> at</c><00:01:21.510><c> the</c><00:01:21.720><c> core</c><00:01:21.930><c> of</c><00:01:21.960><c> everything</c>

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.230 align:start position:0%
a little more at the core of everything
 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.290 align:start position:0%
a little more at the core of everything
like<00:01:22.500><c> you</c><00:01:22.650><c> think</c><00:01:23.040><c> about</c><00:01:23.250><c> how</c><00:01:23.430><c> a</c><00:01:23.460><c> machine</c><00:01:24.120><c> can</c>

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
like you think about how a machine can
 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.840 align:start position:0%

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 align:start position:0%
actually most excited about right now is
 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.270 align:start position:0%
actually most excited about right now is

00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.430 align:start position:0%
seeing if we can actually take a step

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 align:start position:0%

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.950 align:start position:0%
back and also learn the reinforcement
learning<00:06:01.500><c> algorithm</c><00:06:02.150><c> so</c><00:06:03.150><c> reinforcement</c><00:06:03.810><c> is</c>

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
learning algorithm so reinforcement is
 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
learning algorithm so reinforcement is
very<00:06:04.140><c> complex</c><00:06:04.590><c> credits</c><00:06:05.100><c> and</c><00:06:05.250><c> very</c><00:06:05.460><c> complex</c>

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
explorations very complex and so maybe
 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.820 align:start position:0%

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
see how fast it learns if it learns more
 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.050 align:start position:0%
see how fast it learns if it learns more
quickly<00:06:49.620><c> that</c><00:06:49.830><c> was</c><00:06:49.919><c> a</c><00:06:49.949><c> good</c><00:06:50.160><c> modification</c><00:06:50.910><c> and</c>

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
quickly that was a good modification and
 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.839 align:start position:0%
quickly that was a good modification and
maybe<00:06:51.720><c> you</c><00:06:51.810><c> keep</c><00:06:52.020><c> it</c><00:06:52.169><c> and</c><00:06:52.349><c> improve</c><00:06:53.159><c> from</c><00:06:53.580><c> there</c>

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849 align:start position:0%
maybe you keep it and improve from there
 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.330 align:start position:0%
maybe you keep it and improve from there
Wow<00:06:54.690><c> I</c><00:06:54.870><c> see</c><00:06:55.139><c> right</c><00:06:55.349><c> yeah</c><00:06:55.560><c> this</c><00:06:55.919><c> is</c><00:06:56.039><c> direction</c>

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
Wow I see right yeah this is direction
 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
Wow I see right yeah this is direction
yeah<00:06:56.909><c> it's</c><00:06:57.509><c> I</c><00:06:57.780><c> think</c><00:06:58.020><c> it's</c><00:06:58.229><c> a</c><00:06:58.289><c> lot</c><00:06:58.470><c> to</c><00:06:58.620><c> do</c><00:06:58.740><c> with</c>

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 align:start position:0%
yeah it's I think it's a lot to do with
 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.260 align:start position:0%
yeah it's I think it's a lot to do with
maybe<00:06:59.220><c> the</c><00:06:59.460><c> amount</c><00:06:59.610><c> of</c><00:06:59.699><c> compute</c><00:07:00.090><c> that's</c>

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 align:start position:0%
maybe the amount of compute that's
 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
maybe the amount of compute that's
becoming<00:07:00.690><c> available</c><00:07:00.840><c> so</c><00:07:01.680><c> the</c><00:07:02.009><c> more</c><00:07:02.220><c> this</c>

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:02.849 align:start position:0%
becoming available so the more this
 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:04.850 align:start position:0%
becoming available so the more this

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.490 align:start position:0%
were unreinforced millenials the final
 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.990 align:start position:0%
were unreinforced millenials the final
thing<00:07:08.699><c> and</c><00:07:08.879><c> so</c><00:07:09.330><c> the</c><00:07:09.599><c> more</c><00:07:09.780><c> compute</c><00:07:10.169><c> we</c><00:07:10.289><c> get</c><00:07:11.000><c> the</c>

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
thing and so the more compute we get the
 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
thing and so the more compute we get the
more<00:07:12.150><c> it</c><00:07:12.240><c> becomes</c><00:07:12.419><c> possible</c><00:07:12.720><c> to</c><00:07:13.050><c> maybe</c><00:07:13.199><c> run</c>

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 align:start position:0%
more it becomes possible to maybe run
 

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.980 align:start position:0%
more it becomes possible to maybe run
something<00:07:14.039><c> like</c><00:07:14.629><c> reinforcement</c><00:07:15.629><c> learning</c><00:07:15.690><c> in</c>

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 align:start position:0%
something like reinforcement learning in
 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
something like reinforcement learning in
the<00:07:16.169><c> inner</c><00:07:16.319><c> loop</c><00:07:16.560><c> of</c><00:07:16.740><c> a</c><00:07:16.919><c> bigger</c><00:07:17.099><c> algorithm</c><00:07:18.770><c> so</c>

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 align:start position:0%
the inner loop of a bigger algorithm so
 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.249 align:start position:0%
the inner loop of a bigger algorithm so
you<00:07:20.190><c> know</c><00:07:20.280><c> starting</c><00:07:20.759><c> from</c><00:07:21.000><c> the</c><00:07:21.270><c> 14</c><00:07:21.720><c> euro</c><00:07:21.990><c> you</c>

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:23.789 align:start position:0%
you've worked in the iPhone maybe what
 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:26.659 align:start position:0%
you've worked in the iPhone maybe what
some<00:07:23.819><c> 20-plus</c><00:07:24.659><c> years</c><00:07:24.930><c> now</c><00:07:25.110><c> so</c><00:07:25.740><c> so</c><00:07:26.069><c> tell</c><00:07:26.550><c> me</c><00:07:26.639><c> a</c>

00:07:26.659 --> 00:07:26.669 align:start position:0%
some 20-plus years now so so tell me a
 

00:07:26.669 --> 00:07:29.059 align:start position:0%
some 20-plus years now so so tell me a
bit<00:07:26.729><c> about</c><00:07:26.849><c> how</c><00:07:27.210><c> your</c><00:07:27.710><c> understanding</c><00:07:28.710><c> of</c><00:07:28.830><c> AI</c>

00:07:29.059 --> 00:07:29.069 align:start position:0%
bit about how your understanding of AI
 

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
bit about how your understanding of AI
has<00:07:29.909><c> evolved</c><00:07:30.720><c> over</c><00:07:30.900><c> this</c><00:07:31.169><c> at</c><00:07:31.590><c> this</c><00:07:31.710><c> time</c><00:07:32.090><c> yeah</c>

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090 align:start position:0%
has evolved over this at this time yeah
 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
has evolved over this at this time yeah
so<00:07:33.240><c> when</c><00:07:33.360><c> I</c><00:07:33.389><c> started</c><00:07:34.050><c> looking</c><00:07:34.590><c> at</c><00:07:34.710><c> AI</c><00:07:35.000><c> sorry</c>

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
so when I started looking at AI sorry
 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.779 align:start position:0%
so when I started looking at AI sorry
interesting<00:07:36.360><c> cuz</c><00:07:36.830><c> it</c><00:07:37.830><c> really</c><00:07:37.889><c> coincided</c><00:07:38.759><c> with</c>

00:07:38.779 --> 00:07:38.789 align:start position:0%
interesting cuz it really coincided with
 

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
interesting cuz it really coincided with
coming<00:07:39.210><c> to</c><00:07:39.240><c> Stanford</c><00:07:39.539><c> to</c><00:07:39.810><c> do</c><00:07:39.900><c> my</c><00:07:40.080><c> master's</c>

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:46.070 align:start position:0%
