00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.890
I'm here with Cameron Pittman, who's
a course developer here at Udacity.

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.430
Thank you so much for
talking to me today.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, happy to be here.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.870
&gt;&gt; So Cameron's here to talk about
some use of games in education.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.400
And so I know you did something really
cool back when you taught in high school

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.850
with games in your
high school classroom.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.070
So can you tell us
a little bit about that?

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.350
&gt;&gt; Sure.
So I was teaching high school physics,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.420
and I realized I wanted
a better lab simulator.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.700
It's really hard to find
lab supplies sometimes and

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.290
it's sometimes a lot easier
to use something virtual.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.220
So I decided to use a video game,
because they're easily accessible and

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.540
readily available.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.980
And I wound up using the video
game Portal 2 to teach physics.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.790
Portal Two has a puzzle maker in it.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.320
And this puzzle maker makes it really,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.720
really easy to make a level
in about five minutes.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.020
It really is so simple that even
somebody who has never even really used

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.360
a computer before can figure it out.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.710
All you need to use is click and
drag and maybe one or two clicks, and

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.700
you actually have a full-blown level.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.240
And because the game is
essentially a physics puzzle game,

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.330
the game itself follows
the laws of physics.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.930
So what I had my students doing
is building levels in the game

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.250
that were essentially experiments.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.990
And then I had them running experiments,
collecting data, and

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.640
then comparing the data they were
collecting to what they would expect to

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.790
see in the real world.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.140
Which was pretty cool.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.370
It was pretty wild.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.220
We wound up doing about
ten labs in the class.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.590
We did everything from
simple momentum and

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.610
motion to kinetic energy,
potential energy.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.000
We even did some thermodynamics in
the game, which is pretty wild.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.910
Because the laws of physics hold up
that well, that essentially we could

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.760
throw a bunch of objects bouncing off of
each other into a level, and it kind of,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.860
sort of followed the laws of
thermodynamics, which is amazing.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.990
We had some other cool ones
with terminal velocity.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.140
And, yeah, I just had my
students comparing what they saw

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.860
to what they would see
in the real world.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.000
And it wound up being a really,
really fun semester.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I bet.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.620
I bet they really got
a kick out of that.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.600
So for any of our students who
might develop games to be used

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.770
in the classroom.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.860
What do you need to think
about when you're developing

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.550
games to the classroom?

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.840
Make sure they're really a learning
experience and not a distraction for

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.090
the students, or just something they
kind of have fun playing around with,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.410
and don't learn anything from?

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.620
&gt;&gt; Sure well it's important to remember
that games are a means to an end and

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.699
just one tool amongst many that
teachers have at their disposal.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:14.400
So I think the idea here is just simply
make sure that the game, like the fun

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.630
mechanics of the game, are teaching
what you want students to learn.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.840
So I kind of saw using Portal
as a way to engage students.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.430
Because immediately you're using
a video game which is new and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.720
different that students aren't familiar
with, normally in a classroom.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.470
But they love outside of the classroom,
so I had their attention and

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.100
that's half the battle
in a physics class.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.880
I was really happy about that.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.420
And then the other thing that I
was really happy about is that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.390
the actual mechanics of the game,

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.130
reflected exactly what I wanted
students to be learning at that time.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.750
So there are a number of ways that you
can make an educational game just awful.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.660
For instance, you could create let's say
a fighting game, a beat them up game.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.820
But instead of getting a new life at the
end of the level you have to solve some

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.480
math problems and
then you get a new life.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.100
That's silly.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.030
That's dumb.
That's just a big distraction.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.090
What you would want to do instead is
create a game maybe like Dragonbox.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.410
Have you ever heard of that one?

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.320
&gt;&gt; I have not, no.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.250
&gt;&gt; Oh it's awesome,
it's an algebra game.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.910
And it's essentially,
it looks like a card game, but

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.200
it follows the laws of algebra.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.040
You have to put cards in certain places,
and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.610
what you're really doing there
is having fun with fractions,

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.400
and cross multiplying, and
it's actually a ton of fun.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.960
And it's not a distraction, whatsoever.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.470
Because the actual fun game
mechanic is teaching algebra.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.630
&gt;&gt; Huh.
Very interesting.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.550
Now the one thing that I feel it's
worth noting though, is that there

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.840
are those in the education community
which, and just for full disclosure,

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.270
I am one of them, that are often dubious
about the usage of games in education.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.850
Mostly because many of us think

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.620
that it's really important to make
the material appealing in-and-of itself.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.680
That if we have to put a game on it,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.370
we've kind of already
fought a losing battle.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.610
And now, when they move on to a class
that doesn't use games, they're just

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.590
going to tune out, because I'm used
to learning being very engaging and

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.940
fun because there was
a game attached to it.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.620
And now I don't learn in the real world.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.560
What would you say to people like me
who have that criticism about this?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.530
That doesn't sound like that applies to
the Portal 2 thing but for other games,

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.250
what would you say to that?

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.290
&gt;&gt; I understand that concern.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.150
I love physics and

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.700
I think physics in and
of itself should be super interesting.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.190
Same thing with basically all science or
engineering in tech.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.280
But for instance if I were
learning let's say I don't know,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.670
what didn't I like in school?

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:12.792
I liked all my classes.

00:04:12.792 --> 00:04:15.723
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You're not
the target audience for this.

00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:18.880
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But
I think it's just one tool of many.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.440
If it's a distraction, and
if it takes away from the fun or

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.150
the essence, of the material itself.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.190
You're probably just
using the game wrong.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.220
It's a tool like anything else.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.980
It's just another media form.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.000
You have videos, you have books you
have audio, these are all very valid and

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.460
relevant media sources to learn
anything and now you have games.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.940
Games are just another way
to interact with material.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.830
So despite the fact that normally
they are associated with fun and

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.160
they could potentially be distracting.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.780
If used in the right way I think
there's really nothing to fear there.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.680
&gt;&gt; I think you're getting at
a really important distinction,

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.650
which is between using games for
education and game-ifying education,

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.340
which are two very different things.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.720
When we attach these badges and

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.840
things like that to education
it can apply some motivators.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.170
But they're really extrinsic motivators,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.360
which might not get to the heart of
what we really want to do in education.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.400
Do you have any final thoughts for our
students who might be looking at doing

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.010
a game for their class project here?

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.370
&gt;&gt; You should go for it.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.080
It's fun.
It's so much fun, and when you see kids'

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.730
eyes light up, when you see them get
really excited about playing a game, and

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.730
feel motivated to solve the kind of
problems that you want them to solve.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.810
That's awesome, it's great.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.260
It's a fantastic feeling, but at the end
of the day, it's just a lot of fun.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.890
I mean,
you're adding fun to the classroom.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.330
And there's really no reason that
learning can't be super enjoyable for

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.030
everybody involved.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.690
So I say go for it.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.820
Have a good time.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.320
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.540
Well thank you so
much for talking to us.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And have a great rest of your day.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:37.440
&gt;&gt; Happy to be here.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.940
Thanks.
