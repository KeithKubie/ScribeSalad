00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.350
We're asked to simplify
9 squared.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.160
And that quantity, whatever 9
squared is, we know what it

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.600
is, it's 81, but we'll
keep it at 9 squared.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.720
They need to simplify 9 squared
to the third power.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.750
And they want us to express
our answer in exponential

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.810
form, which is just another way
of saying that they want

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.080
us to keep it as exponents.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.340
They don't want us to multiply
it out and get some really

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.680
really large number.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.950
So think about how to do this.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.170
So we have 9 squared
to the third power.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.680
Well the simplest way to do this
is just if you know the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.000
exponent rule, or the exponent
property, that if you raise

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.210
something to an exponent, and
then if you raise that entire

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.170
thing to another exponent, then
you can just multiply

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.150
these two exponents.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.960
So this is going to be the same
thing as 9 to the 2 times

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.430
3 power, which is the same thing
as 9 to the sixth power.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.270
And we'd be done.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.260
We've expressed our answer in
exponential form, 9 to the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.420
sixth power, we've simplified.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.200
Now you say, what's not
exponential form?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.670
What's not exponential form is
if we would actually multiply

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.820
9 times 9 times 9 times 9 times
9 times 9, which is

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.430
going to be a very very
large number.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.280
And we'd probably want a
calculator or it would

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.320
take us some time.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.630
So 9 to the sixth
is the answer.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.070
Now another way to view it, if
you don't like that formula,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.770
is we could even apply
other formulas.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.780
What's another way to think
about 9 squared

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.050
to the third power?

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.240
I'll do this in a different
color just for fun.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.780
9 squared times 9 squared
times 9 squared.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.140
This is 9 squared to
the third power.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.860
And we also know the other
exponent property, or the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.290
other exponent rule.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.050
That if you have the same base
being raised to different

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.160
powers, in this case
they're all being

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.900
raised to the same power.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.740
And you're taking the product of
them, then this is the same

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.200
thing as taking that same base,
that 9, and raising it

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.940
to the sum of the powers.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.390
So 9 to the 2 plus 2 plus
2, which is once

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.250
again, 9 to the 6.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.750
I don't even have to
write it again.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.500
So either way, you're going
to get the same thing.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.260
And just be very clear, here
we added the exponents.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.669
Because we had the same base
and we're multiplying them.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.300
So we added the exponents.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.750
Here, we multiplied the
exponents because we had

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.370
something to an exponent and
then that whole thing being

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.820
raised to another exponent.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.510
But regardless of which
direction you go in, as long

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.440
as you use your properties in
the correct way, you should

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.280
get 9 to the sixth power.
