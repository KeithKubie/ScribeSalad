ROGER BOWLEY: I'm going to be
talking about logarithms,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.490
logarithms to the base 10.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.370
So for example, if I have a
number, which is 100, I can

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.990
think of that as 10 squared,
or 10 to the power 2.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.104
So 2 is the logarithm of this
number, 100, to the base 10.

00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:22.920
1,000 is 10 to the 3.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.090
This is the logarithm, the 3,
and it corresponds to the

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.310
number of 0's there.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.760
It is logarithm of
1,000 equals 3.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.230
I can do 10 to another number.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.700
So for example, 10 to the 1.6232
turns out to be 42.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.125
That means that if I were to
take 10, that means that the

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:51.830
log to the base 10 of
42 is 1.6232 to

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.190
four significant figures.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.930
The reason it's useful
is multiplication.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.390
If I have two numbers and
I want to multiply them

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.980
together, it's easy to make
mistakes, because there are a

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.580
lot of little operations that
have to be added up.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.210
If you go through logarithms and
you get a logarithm of a

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.290
number, such as 42, and you
multiply it with another

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.860
number, such as 37, or 59, or
200, you get the logarithm of

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.350
that number, and you add
these numbers together.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.490
Let me show you an example.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.280
37 times 59.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:30.110
Now, I can write 37 as 10 to the
1.5682, and multiply that

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.610
by this number, which is
10 to the power 1.7709.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.370
And when I multiply these
numbers together, all I have

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.030
to do is add this number to that
number to make this into

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.920
10 to the 3.3391.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.110
BRADY HARAN: That's
like a shortcut.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.850
ROGER BOWLEY: Yes.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.970
Instead of multiplying numbers,
you're adding this to

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.980
that to get this exponent,
and that number, it

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.145
turns out, is 2183.

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:08.840
Instead of having to write this
out longhand as 37 times

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.480
59 and work it all out in gory
detail, which will require 9

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.030
times 7 and 3 times 9, and then
5 times 7, and working it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.750
out, and not making a mistake,
all you have to do is

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.810
addition, which is
much easier.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.550
And if I were to do division, I
would do subtraction, which

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.350
is much easier.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.150
Addition and subtraction
are much easier than

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.940
multiplication and division.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.820
So this is a great
simplification.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.200
It makes your life
much easier.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.410
The catch is that you have
to know these numbers.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.590
37 is 10 to the power of this.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.950
So where did I get that from?

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.400
Where did I get 59
is this number?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.230
Well, the big secret, the thing
that makes it possible

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.640
is that I have a table of these
logarithms, and I look

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.250
up 37, this is actually 3.7, so
in order to make it 37, I

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.990
have to add a 1 to it,
and it's 1.5682.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.390
So that's this number.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.680
And then I look up 59.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.100
And there's 59.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.690
59.0, I go across , its 0.7709,
but this is 5.9, so I

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.940
have to add a 1.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.790
So these, I cheated, it's
all in a table.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.780
I can look it up.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.950
When I was a lad at school, this
is how we learned to do

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.140
multiplication.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.780
I mean, we learned how to do
long multiplication, but we

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.370
added these numbers together
to get the answer quickly.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.170
And it was the way of doing
it, because there weren't

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.870
pocket calculators in my youth,
because I'm so old.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.950
This is all we had down mine.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.670
So when I've got this number,
I have to go to a different

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.180
table, which is called the
table of antilogs.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.310
Now, the 3 in the front of this
means 1,000, so I just

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.760
have to look up 0.3391.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.780
So I go down the table,
there's 0.33.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.530
And then you look across
the top, and

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.500
there's a 9, 3391, 2183.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.390
And then I look at the
1, which is this

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.600
thing, and add that.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.850
And you see I get 2183.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.240
And if there was a number there,
I'd have to add that

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.390
last one, but it's actually 0.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.950
So this is 2183, which
turns out to be the

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.839
right answer exactly.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.880
So you could get four
significant figures by doing

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.830
this, which is reasonably
accurate.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.990
It's the speed, the
reliability.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.850
If these tables are accurate,
you can get the numbers out.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.050
BRADY HARAN: Is this just
something that schoolboys and

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.440
schoolgirls would use, or were
log tables important for

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.190
professionals?

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.800
ROGER BOWLEY: Oh, yes.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.180
Log tables would be used by
professionals who wanted to

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.870
get accuracy.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.990
And they might not be just four
significant figures, they

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.090
might be more, depending
on the accuracy of the

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.950
calculations that you
need to make.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.480
And they made calculations very
reliable, provided the

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.610
tables were reliable.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.390
But the tables, to start with,
weren't very reliable.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.150
And that's really a complete
story in itself, which I'd

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.280
like to tell you.

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.640
Well, now you're going to ask
the question, where do these

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.700
numbers come from?

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.760
How did I make up tables of
antilogarithms and logarithms?

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.840
And this was done by a man
called John Napier.
