00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
equitable funding they actually don't
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.910
equitable funding they actually don't
need to do anything besides just be

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
need to do anything besides just be
 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.040
need to do anything besides just be
alive and one of the things that we need

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
alive and one of the things that we need
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.270
alive and one of the things that we need
to do is make sure that we set up a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
to do is make sure that we set up a
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.549
to do is make sure that we set up a
system where people just have the basic

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
system where people just have the basic
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.860
system where people just have the basic
necessities like food water education we

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870
necessities like food water education we
 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.540
necessities like food water education we
can guarantee that there's no reason why

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
can guarantee that there's no reason why
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.670
can guarantee that there's no reason why
we don't have it yeah so actually think

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
we don't have it yeah so actually think
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.779
we don't have it yeah so actually think
about the difference in equality and

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
about the difference in equality and
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.609
about the difference in equality and
equity right the quality is everybody

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
equity right the quality is everybody
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.959
equity right the quality is everybody
gets the same thing equity is that

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:05.969
gets the same thing equity is that
 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:06.949
gets the same thing equity is that
people get what they need and deserve

00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:06.959
people get what they need and deserve

and in the work of justice we're almost
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.999
and in the work of justice we're almost
always fighting for equity so we think

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009
always fighting for equity so we think
 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.039
always fighting for equity so we think
about things like school funding we are

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
about things like school funding we are
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.899
about things like school funding we are
not asking for equal funding we know

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
not asking for equal funding we know
 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.029
not asking for equal funding we know
that it just costs more to educate kids

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039
that it just costs more to educate kids
 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:19.069
that it just costs more to educate kids
who grew up in poverty it costs more to

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079
who grew up in poverty it costs more to
 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.959
who grew up in poverty it costs more to
educate kids with special needs and we

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969
educate kids with special needs and we
 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:22.730
educate kids with special needs and we
know that we need to pay that cost that

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
know that we need to pay that cost that
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.919
know that we need to pay that cost that
those kids deserve that we're not saying

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929
those kids deserve that we're not saying
 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.230
those kids deserve that we're not saying
that every kid it costs the same to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
that every kid it costs the same to
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.489
that every kid it costs the same to
educate every kid that's just not true

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499
educate every kid that's just not true
 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.080

the disparities around criminal justice

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599
the disparities around criminal justice
 

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.539
the disparities around criminal justice
that there are disparities around race

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
that there are disparities around race
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.519

equity and equality is an important
distinction and the only way to get to

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
distinction and the only way to get to
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.379
distinction and the only way to get to
equality calling it access whatever a

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389
equality calling it access whatever a
 

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:50.449
equality calling it access whatever a
metric of equality you want is by having

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:50.459
metric of equality you want is by having
 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:52.819
metric of equality you want is by having
equity of resources right equity of

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
equity of resources right equity of
 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.649
equity of resources right equity of

and you deserve something different and
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.809
and you deserve something different and
from a system level I'm gonna make sure

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819
from a system level I'm gonna make sure
 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:01.489
from a system level I'm gonna make sure
that you have access to that so I was

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:01.499
that you have access to that so I was
 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.139
that you have access to that so I was
talking to somebody about about who Sam

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
