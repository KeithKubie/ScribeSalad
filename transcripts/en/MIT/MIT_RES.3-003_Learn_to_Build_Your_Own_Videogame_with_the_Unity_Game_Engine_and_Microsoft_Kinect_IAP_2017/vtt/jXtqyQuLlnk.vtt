00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:19.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:24.090
KYLE KEANE: All right.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.570
So this movement happening
above the screen.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.370
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.730
STUDENT: So the original
inspiration was from Minecraft.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.980
And we were kind of
constructing this cubes freely

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.347
with different textures.

00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:39.555
And we made this with Kinect.

00:00:39.555 --> 00:00:41.080
So basically with
one hand you can

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.690
control the position of your
character, which is a ball.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.740
And with the other
hand, you can decide

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.440
whether to create,
which is going up,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.590
and eat, which is going down.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.240
So because now we are
deleting this cubes.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.251
STUDENT: Also you can
assign the [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:00.724
to the existing cube.

00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:02.690
Will you please?

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.030
But when you use--

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.290
STUDENT: Always gauge.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.412
But when you use the
hand out, it will delete.

00:01:11.412 --> 00:01:12.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.574
STUDENT: So it's a little
bit hard to select.

00:01:14.574 --> 00:01:17.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.815
STUDENT: Sometimes you
[INAUDIBLE] confuse--

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:24.210
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.420
STUDENT: And
actually we also plan

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.940
to create some examples
so that the user can

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.630
plan what they want to construct
and follow the instruction.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.470
Maybe some can.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.700
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.270
STUDENT: It looks like you've
made it so the cubes are

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.720
on a grid, right?

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.000
Is that correct?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.510
They're not just
randomly located--

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.520
STUDENT: Oh yes.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.930
At first we had the problem
that, when the cube is created,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.420
it overlapped each other.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.300
So then we do make
it at the position

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.090
that is in tangent because the
cube has side, a unique cube.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.905
So it will not overlap anymore.

00:02:08.905 --> 00:02:13.130
And in the future, we may
consider group the object.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.030
So we either go to move the
whole one object together.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.950
For example, if you have
a house or anything,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.875
then you can move
it at one time.

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:29.670
KYLE KEANE: Anybody
have any questions?

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.294
STUDENT: And there's
a palette that you

00:02:31.294 --> 00:02:33.289
use to recolor the objects?

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.955
STUDENT: Oh yes.

00:02:33.955 --> 00:02:36.335
There's on the other
side if you can.

00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:40.549
STUDENT: Only five colors
but we can add more?

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.243
STUDENT: If you just
demo, you could actually

00:02:43.243 --> 00:02:44.662
pick different colors--

00:02:44.662 --> 00:02:45.507
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:45.507 --> 00:02:47.090
STUDENT: It's literally
hard to think.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.030
MARC VRABLIC: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.350
Because it's kind of
awkward to draw with.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.085
That's one of the best
things about Pictionary,

00:02:54.085 --> 00:02:56.017
when people can't draw.

00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:57.300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.716
STUDENT: Also we
think that it may

00:02:58.716 --> 00:03:02.850
be intuitive to use two
hands to create and object

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.170
instead of one hand and
use the other [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.020
[LAUGHTER]
