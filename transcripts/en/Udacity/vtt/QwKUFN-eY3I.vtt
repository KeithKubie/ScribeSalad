00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.630
Here's an example of extending our previous top level description with

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.900
some properties. We still have our client and server components.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.300
We still have our RPC connector. We still have our attachments. However, we've

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.920
added some property statements within the descriptions of the components and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.280
connector. In particular, the first property is labeled Aesop-style, and

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.640
it's some kind of style ID. Second one is Unicon-style. Now, be aware that Aesop

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.290
and Unicon are other architectural description languages with their own tools.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.690
By the way, I've indicated here a comment using C++'s slash, slash commenting

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.080
style. For the second component, the server component, there are two properties,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:54.530
and these are not intended for particular external architectural style

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.525
architectural description language. The first one is labeled idempotence, and

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:05.290
it's got a Boolean value indicated as true. The second one is an integer,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.700
including a maximum concurrent clients that this particular component can,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.840
is capable of dealing with. As far as the connector is concerned,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.920
there are properties for synchronization. For the maximum number of

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.360
roles that that connector can have and for a particular protocol, in this case,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.950
using the Wright, as in Frank Lloyd Wright, architectural description language.
