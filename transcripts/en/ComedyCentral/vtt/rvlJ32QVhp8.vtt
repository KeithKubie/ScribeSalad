00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.503
It's officially Canada Day,
so it's the perfect time

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:06.072
to appreciate Canada's
hunky prime minister,

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.976
the man who makes people say
"Oh, Canada"--

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.245
Justin Trudeau.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.214
(audience shrieking, whooping)

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:19.519
Yeah, you want to give him
some head of state.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.321
Uh, he's become
so popular, in fact,

00:00:22.354 --> 00:00:24.757
that he's just about to join
the Marvel Universe.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.428
Trudeau is set to appear,
uh, on a variant cover

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.097
of an upcoming issue of
<i> Civil War II: Choosing Sides.</i>

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.099
I'm guessing he's the only man
with the power

00:00:33.132 --> 00:00:35.401
to convince Dr. Doom
to give away free health care.

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.904
So, comedians, I want you
to come up with some more powers

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:40.406
a Canadian super hero
might have in 60 seconds.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.874
Go ahead, Adam.

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:43.643
Uh, radioactive
passive-aggression.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:45.578
Points. Adam again.

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:48.081
Being... being very,
very, very, very sorry.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.949
All right, points.
Jim.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:52.752
The ability, uh,
to call pastrami smoked meat.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:54.153
Points. Adam.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:56.556
Uh, the power
to knock you the (bleep) oot.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.525
Points. Morgan.

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.828
The power to be
equally hot and boring.

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:04.497
Points. Morgan again.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.767
The power to destroy
your enemies when you find one.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.802
Points. Jim.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.804
The ability
to complain about America

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:13.903
but emulate America completely.
