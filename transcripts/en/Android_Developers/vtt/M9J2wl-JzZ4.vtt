MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
My name is Moonlit.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:01.818
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:00:01.818 --> 00:00:02.317
Woo!

00:00:02.317 --> 00:00:04.239
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:06.780
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: I'm a partner
development manager at Google

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.750
Play, specializing in games.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.290
I am keenly aware that I am
one of the last two things

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.420
standing between
you and Happy Hour.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.050
So let's look at something fun.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.270
What are some of the
recent trends in innovation

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.290
in mobile gaming,
specifically, genre mashing

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.730
and subscriptions?

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.980
You probably noticed
my cheerleading squad

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.630
sitting here.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.210
We're lucky to have
Lauren, Chris, and Charles

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.840
from three of our top
partners join me on stage.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.890
You'll hear from
each one of them

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.670
their stories of innovation.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.500
But first, let me set the stage.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.470
Today, we'll cover
these three things.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.850
First, I'll give you an
overview of the global trends

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.660
around genre mashing
within mobile gaming.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.720
Second, we'll show you
that this trend is not

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.330
limited to just mashing games.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.830
Our three guests
here will show you

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.310
how they took genre
mashing beyond gaming

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.070
by bringing in three very
different industries.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.900
And last, we'll
touch on a little bit

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.660
of monetization innovation
recently, namely subscriptions

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.180
in mobile gaming.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.300
All right, let's talk about
genre mashing within gaming.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.090
The idea of combining
multiple core game

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.850
loops into the same
game on mobile,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.580
it's not a recent phenomenon.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.150
In 2012, GungHo swept
the world with launch

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.550
of "Puzzle" and "Dragons,"
the godfather of puzzle RPG.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.060
Then in 2014, "Summoners
War" by Com2uS

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.200
kickstarted the era of CC
RPG or card collecting RPG.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.790
It also kickstarted the era of
long acronyms in mobile gaming.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.130
So consider this a
forewarning for the amount

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.760
of acronyms I'm going to use
in the next five minutes.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.660
Today, genre mashing
happens all over the world

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.330
in mobile gaming, from
the most casual, to core,

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.400
to beyond gaming.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.950
Next, I'll share with you
some testimonies and case

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.090
studies from the top mobile game
developers around the world.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.710
On the more casual end,
we have Rodeo Stampede--

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.140
an endless runner game
with builder meta.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.510
Featherweight, the
Australian developer,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.700
with Yodo1, the
Chinese publisher,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.455
used genre mashing as
a way to differentiate,

00:02:33.455 --> 00:02:34.830
turning something
that would have

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.950
been a subtle twist into
something much more unique.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.910
The game-- this innovation--
has won them multiple awards

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.900
and helped the game
go viral globally.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.610
"Gardenscapes" is probably one
of the most iconic successes

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.160
of genre mashing
in mobile gaming.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.410
Playrix, the Russian
game developer,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.610
see genre mashing as a way
to stand out from the crowded

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.740
and established market.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.650
Something we also observed
earlier in Emily's talk

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.690
on de-risking your launch.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.370
Playrix brilliantly
interweaves two core games

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.650
their core audience loves--

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.230
match-3 and builder.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.910
The result is incredible player
love, loyalty, and growth.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.250
The game is top grossing
globally, including Asia.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.920
Now, moving on to
value more core--

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.760
"Castle Crush" by TFG, a
Brazilian game developer,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.030
combined the elements
of combat strategy game

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.340
with that of traditional
trading card game--

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.180
kind of like "Magic,
the Gathering."

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.460
The game only launching
June this year,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.920
and it already has more
than 5 million installs,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.450
with a 4.5-star rating.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.280
"Lords Mobile" is a
real-time MMO strategy

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.760
game with the colorful
elements of an RPG.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.570
IGG, the game developer,
sees genre mashing

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.570
as a way to meet the
demand of their users

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.630
for more sophisticated games.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.450
They also see it as a way
to bring a new experience

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.720
for users who might otherwise
not try a different genre.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.230
"Magic Rush" by Moonton
Elex, Chinese developer

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.100
and publisher, is a fresh
combination of three genres.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.840
Moonton created "Magic Rush"
as a global entry point.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.890
By studying user pattern
and demand around the globe,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.980
they learned that RPG
has been popular in Asia,

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.860
whereas combat strategy
games perform really

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.580
well in Europe and America.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.500
So "Magic Rush"
was born as the way

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.470
to improve upon
the elements of RPG

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.650
with the swipe action
of tower defense games

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.430
and the social appeal of SLG.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.960
But enough talking
about mashing games.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.660
I'm going to turn it over
to my guest speakers, who

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.780
will share with you
how they reinvented fun

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.160
by mashing gaming with three
very different industries.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.050
First, we'll hear
from Pocket Gems

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.690
about "Episode
Interactive," a game that's

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.290
turning into a new
medium for storytelling.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.330
And then we'll have
Crowdstar to tell you

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
about their recent hit,
"Design Home," which

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.310
presents mobile game as a canvas
for design and creativity.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.260
And last, we'll
hear from Workshop

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.390
about how they're
turning mobile gaming

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.320
into a new channel for music.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.730
These are my star presenters.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.360
First, let's welcome Lauren
Luke from Pocket Gems.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.860
LAUREN LUKE: Thanks, Moonlit.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:49.470
Hi, everyone.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.030
I'm Lauren.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.250
I'm with Pocket Gems.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.944
Storytelling is at the
core of what we do.

00:05:54.944 --> 00:05:57.110
One of the games I'm going
to be talking about today

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.590
is "Episode."

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.040
So storytelling
itself isn't new.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.140
It's evolved over the course
of thousands of years.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.370
It's crossed cultures,
generations, continents,

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.402
and it's existed in
many complex forms.

00:06:11.402 --> 00:06:13.360
And when we look at it's
modern-day shape, what

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.400
we're looking at right now is
storytelling in mobile games.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.650
Episode is the world's
largest network

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.930
for stories created on mobile.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.260
Right now, we have 73,000
stories with four billion

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.880
episodes viewed.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.480
We started back in 2014 as
a format for story building

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.750
that was built from the
ground up for mobile.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.916
This format is still
in its very early days,

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:37.290
which is very
clear when you look

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.410
at other forms of
modern storytelling

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.080
like television and movies.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.270
Episode is built
for mobile, meaning

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.890
that it has a portrait format.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.140
It allows for
bite-sized consumption,

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.790
and it's user-driven.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.940
You can think of it as
Snapchat meets Netflix.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.540
Like Snapchat, it's an
interactive entertainment

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.010
built for mobile.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.900
Like Netflix, Episode is home to
a network of Hollywood caliber

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.090
stories.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.070
We've been inspired by
both novels and comics.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.290
Our stories are interactive
and also animated,

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.520
but we're not limited
by print technology.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.420
We've also drawn from
television and movies.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.920
We have engaging stories--

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.830
sometimes, even spun
by Hollywood writers.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.990
But users control
their own pace and how

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:29.290
they engage with the story.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.410
Episode is loved by a
mobile-only generation, which

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.960
is comprised largely
of Generation Z, which

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.270
is just now coming of age.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.260
In a survey that we did
of 36,000 people aged 13

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:45.730
through 25 in the US, we found
that for women 13 through 25,

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:50.320
14% are using their phones
for more than 12 hours a day,

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.040
11% are somehow checking
their phones in the shower,

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.120
and of those age
13 through 17, 12%

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.970
check their phones
every few seconds.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.280
So mobile now needs
a native format

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.190
to address how this generation
interacts with real stories.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:10.210
This is a group that's grown-up
entirely with smartphones,

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.700
meaning that they have
always actively participated

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:15.090
in how they receive
their entertainment.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.410
So whether it's sending
snaps to friends,

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:21.460
going climbing with VR, or
watching a video on Musically,

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.290
they expect their
entertainment to be

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.065
both interactive and visual.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.170
We've also been working with
a handful of IP partners.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.270
As Hollywood has
taken successful books

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:36.630
and made them into legendary
film franchises, such as Harry

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.970
Potter and Twilight,
Episode is now

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:42.299
the first to take great
TV and movie franchises

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:44.790
and bring them
natively to mobile.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.670
In 2015, we partnered
with Paramount

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.950
to bring "Mean
Girls" to episode.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.980
In 2016, we worked with our
friends over at Warner Brothers

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.020
to release "Pretty
Little Liars."

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.750
And this year, we're thrilled
to be working with Universal

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.837
to introduce "Pitch Perfect"
on mobile to the world.

00:09:00.837 --> 00:09:02.670
So this will be out in
the next few months--

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.650
keep an eye open for it.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.090
And with these
franchise launches,

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.600
Episode has begun to establish
itself as an industry model,

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.310
bringing fans the
ability to actually

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.650
be part of stories that
have these cult followings.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.930
As YouTube's led to
the rise of streamers,

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.410
and Snapchat's given way to a
new kind of social celebrity,

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.950
Episode has also formed
a new class of creators.

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:27.660
We've shared our
storytelling tools

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.970
and made them available
to all who are in Episode.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.000
Episode creators
are now building

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.940
their own long-form
narrative stories.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.130
Right now, we have over
eight million creators

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.750
who are telling their own
stories within the app.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.200
And there are five million
weekly active users

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.420
who are reading Episode
original stories

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.540
as well as these Hollywood
inspired stories.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.850
So as we continue
to build Episode,

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.100
we are thinking constantly,
not only of the stories

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.560
that we're bringing to the
world but of this community

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.060
of storytellers.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.550
And we're thrilled to be part
of this special and unique

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.920
opportunity to help
give storytellers

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.050
both a platform and a voice.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.620
Thank you.

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.467
Next up, we've got
Chris from Crowdstar.

00:10:12.467 --> 00:10:13.674
CHRIS MCGILL: Thanks, Lauren.

00:10:13.674 --> 00:10:14.475
Thank you.

00:10:14.475 --> 00:10:16.080
Hi, I'm Chris.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.960
I'm the GM of "Design Home."

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.470
I'm super excited to be here.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:21.750
I want to thank Moonlit.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.731
I want to thank Cliff.

00:10:22.731 --> 00:10:24.480
I want to thank Emily
for the opportunity.

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.719
And Google has been an
unbelievable partner to us.

00:10:27.719 --> 00:10:30.010
We're a little different,
and they've really gotten us,

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.840
and I super appreciate it.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.240
Well, "Design Home" is a
3D interior design game.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:45.060
It's essentially an endless
dollhouse but for grown-ups.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.860
And before I talk
about "Design Home,"

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.110
I want to talk a little
bit about the philosophy

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:51.260
of the studio I work
for called Crowdstar.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.120
Because Crowdstar has
actually been mashing up

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.660
reality-based design
games for five years,

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.840
first with the hit "Covet
Fashion" in the fashion

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.650
space, which after five years
is still going very strong,

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.150
and now with "Design
Home," which we

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.160
launched about 11 months ago.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.140
And to be honest with you,
Crowdstar was born in a moment

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.930
of desperation-- or at
least the current iteration

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:17.190
of Crowdstar--

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:19.500
when they realized
that they had better

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.840
do something different
and something bold,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.050
or they were going to
die a certain death.

00:11:25.050 --> 00:11:27.480
And what they did, and I
wasn't there at the time,

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.251
is really look for
the white space.

00:11:30.251 --> 00:11:32.250
And what they found was
there was a huge segment

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:35.310
of people that were totally
under-served by the gaming

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.950
market in something that
not only would enthrall them

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.110
but also would help
them in their real life.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.430
And that segment was women--

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.950
not girls but women.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.790
And they have a
different mindset really.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.840
These are women who are coming
into their own financially.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.750
They are highly engaged,
highly creative.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.140
They often are
focused on somebody--

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.300
on people that aren't always
themselves, namely families.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.580
And this is a creative
canvas for them

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.810
to not only express
their creativity

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.810
but apply it to real life.

00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:16.590
And it's a positive sum game.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.790
We always make sure it
is a positive sum game.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.440
OK, so what do we do?

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.390
Well, we partner
with real brands.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:31.190
We model real products, and
we put them into 3D settings.

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.200
We're essentially
changing the conversation

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.470
between makers and consumers,
so that makers aren't just

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:39.620
talking at consumers.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.090
We're giving the
consumers a chance

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.870
to play with products
in a fun atmosphere,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:47.450
and it always comes with links,
so that you can buy things

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.110
in the real world.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.770
So for example, we
have dozens and dozens

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.300
of real furniture partners.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.190
Some bigs, and we also go
and find niche boutiques.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.310
And to date, we've
modeled 6,700 products,

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:02.960
and that grows every single day.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.430
It's a very simple game loop.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:13.770
It's shop, design, win.

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.480
It opens up a world
of content experiences

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:21.340
that you just can't do, you
can't do in your own home.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:23.980
You get to mix and match and
visualize completed designs

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.160
in a way that mood boards
could never duplicate.

00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.740
We launch five challenges--
hand-crafted challenges--

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:31.330
a day.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.320
They stay open for three days.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.710
And once you're done with
your design, you submit it,

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.967
and it gets scored,
frankly, by the audience.

00:13:38.967 --> 00:13:41.050
So it goes in and other
people vote on what's good

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:42.580
and what's not.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.350
You get back your score.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:45.710
You get virtual prizes.

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.810
So everybody is happy.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.350
And then you also see
what the winning designs

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.180
were, the highest
score so that you

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.540
can see what you might have done
better or what goes with what.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:58.850
So there's always a
learning experience.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.840
And it's a mixture of
highly relatable settings,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.350
whether it's a suburban
house in Erie, Pennsylvania,

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:12.340
to an apartment in New York,
to aspirational settings

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.316
like a tropical island.

00:14:14.316 --> 00:14:15.940
And then we have some
fantasy settings.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.250
So you could be
designing a moonbase.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.510
Or like at Christmastime,
one of my personal favorites

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:23.530
was you did the interior
of a gingerbread house.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.370
It's simple, and it's fun.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:34.310
But it turns out that modeling
reality is really hard,

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.650
and I'm blessed to work with
some incredible producers,

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.880
engineers, and artists
because the standards that you

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.270
have to reach to model
reality are really high.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.460
These are not
stylized characters

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.080
running around a screen.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.210
You have to figure
out, not only model

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:52.660
the furniture and
the decor perfectly,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:53.660
but the room has to fit.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.680
You have to figure
out the lighting.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.888
You have to figure out the
shadows and how everything

00:14:56.888 --> 00:14:59.470
is going to go together when
you have thousands of products

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.300
that the user might use.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:08.930
So, and then you have to also
run a handcrafted live ops,

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:10.640
which is just really intense.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.780
And again, I'm super
blessed with the people

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.770
that I work with.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.430
And while we're happy
with the aesthetics now,

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.050
you can imagine where
this space is going.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:26.770
I mean our objective is to be
able to fall into the room--

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.750
to taste the air in the room.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:35.680
And with AR, VR, and lots
of other possible Rs coming,

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.695
it's a pretty exciting
and dynamic space.

00:15:38.695 --> 00:15:40.510
I'm enthralled on
really where it can go.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:47.100
So, so far, we were
launched in November 15th.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:50.400
So we're coming up on
our one year birthday.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.410
Through June, which is
what I can talk about now

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.650
that we're a publicly
traded company because we

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:59.580
were acquired by Glu, we've
had 25 million downloads.

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.090
We've exceeded a
million users every day.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.905
We've done a little more
than $40 million in bookings.

00:16:04.905 --> 00:16:06.780
But I think really the
most interesting thing

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.580
is that our users are
generating more than 2 million

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.070
handcrafted rooms a day.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.740
We've built a house of
over 500 million rooms.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.270
I think we're just
getting started.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.130
And thanks for your time.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.630
I'll buy you a drink
at the bar if--

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:24.179
later.

00:16:24.179 --> 00:16:26.220
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: Now,
you've heard from Workshop

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.940
how they're thinking about
their subscription design.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.670
I want to also share with
you some best practices.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.800
There are two main ways
of using subscription

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.510
in your mobile games.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.760
One, we have subscription VIP.

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.550
Two, we have subscription IAP.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.300
I promise I'm not going to rap.

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:49.930
Subscription VIP-- it's all
about the high-value users.

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:52.650
These users are
motivated by prestige,

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.230
vanity, loyalty rewards.

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:58.200
So your goal as a developer
is to really increase

00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.660
long-term retention,
total revenue,

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:05.069
the loyalty from the payers
and also other players.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:08.130
Some examples of
subscription VIP design

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.550
include exclusive
and/or early access

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.569
to special content,
specific and special promos

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:20.760
for these subscribers, and
also higher daily caps.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:23.099
For subscription
IAP, you should be

00:17:23.099 --> 00:17:25.440
thinking about targeting
everybody else--

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.930
but especially, the non-buyers.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.820
These people are motivated by
getting a good financial deal.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.940
So your goal as a developer
is to really increase

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.410
buyer retention and cultivate
the habit of logging in daily

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.540
to increase your LTV.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.720
So some example of
subscription IAP design

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.390
include having a SKU
of gems that pay out

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.280
over several periods of time--

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.200
several days, for example.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.450
This will help
players come back in

00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:57.780
and log in daily to
claim the rewards.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:18:00.840
As with all subscription
and monetization design,

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.450
really keep track
of the downsides.

00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:05.670
Be careful of
cannibalization, and keep

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:11.070
a close pulse of your pillar of
sentiment among your community.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.766
Now, talking about trends
and innovations fun,

00:18:13.766 --> 00:18:15.390
I also want to leave
you with something

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.330
to take with you as you
head into Happy Hour

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:21.910
after the next session.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:23.470
So let's summarize.

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.540
Genre mashing should be used
for, one, differentiation,

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.440
or two, as a new way
to consume content.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.960
Subscriptions should be used
for, one, VIP to identify VIP,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.130
to encourage engagement,
to increase loyalty.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.350
And subscription
IAP should be used

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.040
to offer a good deal for
people who might otherwise not

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.490
spend in your games.

00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:52.920
Now, thank you,
and thanks, Lauren.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.650
Thanks, Charles and Chris for
an amazing talk and sharing

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:57.770
with us your experience.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.270
Let's give them a
round of applause.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.320
[APPLAUSE]
