00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.040
course, with network security. Network security is

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.680
an extremely important topic, especially considering high-profile

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.180

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.740

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.900

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.650
one of the specific attacks that we're going to look at in this course.
