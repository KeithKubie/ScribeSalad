mathematician at Princeton and it is
 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.200
mathematician at Princeton and it is
called Conway checkers Conway checkers

called Conway checkers Conway checkers
 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.600
called Conway checkers Conway checkers
is a game which is played on an infinite

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
is a game which is played on an infinite
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.780
is a game which is played on an infinite
board so it's infinite in all directions

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790
board so it's infinite in all directions
 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.900
board so it's infinite in all directions
you take a line and you put it somewhere

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
you take a line and you put it somewhere
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.880
you take a line and you put it somewhere
in the middle of your board and you're

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890
in the middle of your board and you're
 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.830
in the middle of your board and you're
not going to move it and then what you

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
not going to move it and then what you
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.740
not going to move it and then what you
do is you take a few checkers and you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750
do is you take a few checkers and you
 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.529
do is you take a few checkers and you
place them underneath the line anywhere

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539
place them underneath the line anywhere
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.019
place them underneath the line anywhere
you like it's totally random it's up to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029
you like it's totally random it's up to
 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.179
you like it's totally random it's up to
you what you want to do and then you

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
you what you want to do and then you
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.819
you what you want to do and then you
start playing by simplified checkers

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829
start playing by simplified checkers
 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.450
start playing by simplified checkers
there is only one type of move you can

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
there is only one type of move you can
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.610
there is only one type of move you can
jump over an adjacent checker and then

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
jump over an adjacent checker and then
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.110
jump over an adjacent checker and then
disappear that checker so I can jump

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120
disappear that checker so I can jump
 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.840
disappear that checker so I can jump
vertically or I can jump horizontally

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
vertically or I can jump horizontally
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.369
vertically or I can jump horizontally
and I can do this left right up or down

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
and I can do this left right up or down
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.709
and I can do this left right up or down
so there are four possible moves but

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719
so there are four possible moves but
 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.720
so there are four possible moves but
they're all of the same type now what is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
they're all of the same type now what is
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.510
they're all of the same type now what is
not allowed is if you have three

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520
not allowed is if you have three
 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.260
not allowed is if you have three
checkers in a row you try to jump like

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270
checkers in a row you try to jump like
 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.289
checkers in a row you try to jump like
this and you land on something also you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
this and you land on something also you
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.010
this and you land on something also you
cannot jump over several checkers that's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
cannot jump over several checkers that's
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.910
cannot jump over several checkers that's
not allowed

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
not allowed
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.630
not allowed
you cannot jump diagonally you limit it

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
you cannot jump diagonally you limit it
 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.990
you cannot jump diagonally you limit it
to jumping only horizontally left and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
to jumping only horizontally left and
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.649
to jumping only horizontally left and
right or vertically up and down in of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
right or vertically up and down in of
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.109
right or vertically up and down in of
course at some point you may jump over

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
course at some point you may jump over
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.289
course at some point you may jump over
the line because you will be close to it

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299
the line because you will be close to it
 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.679
the line because you will be close to it
there you go

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
there you go
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.969
there you go
this is yeah that's a lot in fact your

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979
this is yeah that's a lot in fact your
 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.830
this is yeah that's a lot in fact your
goal is to get as high as possible on

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
goal is to get as high as possible on
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.080
goal is to get as high as possible on
the line so Conway's challenge to us is

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090
the line so Conway's challenge to us is
 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.300
the line so Conway's challenge to us is
if you start below the line in whatever

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310
if you start below the line in whatever
 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.789
if you start below the line in whatever
configuration you wish as many checkers

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799
configuration you wish as many checkers
 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.429
configuration you wish as many checkers
you wish and you follow those simple

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
you wish and you follow those simple
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.660
you wish and you follow those simple
rules what is the highest row above the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
rules what is the highest row above the
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.520
rules what is the highest row above the
line that you can reach well what do you

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530
line that you can reach well what do you
 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.040
line that you can reach well what do you
think I think the answer is going to be

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050
think I think the answer is going to be
 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.619
think I think the answer is going to be
disappointingly low but is that what

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629
disappointingly low but is that what
 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.880
disappointingly low but is that what
your gut feeling says or your experience

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890
your gut feeling says or your experience
 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.860
your gut feeling says or your experience
well part of me thinks if I can use an

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870
well part of me thinks if I can use an
 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.510
well part of me thinks if I can use an
infinite number of checkers in any

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520
infinite number of checkers in any
 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.460
infinite number of checkers in any
configuration I want I should be able to

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
configuration I want I should be able to
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.040
configuration I want I should be able to
build some mechanism to push quite high

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050
build some mechanism to push quite high
 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.860
build some mechanism to push quite high
but that's right that's what my gut

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
but that's right that's what my gut
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.690
but that's right that's what my gut
feeling said about the problem I said

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
feeling said about the problem I said
 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.400
feeling said about the problem I said
what kind of question is this of course

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410
what kind of question is this of course
 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.420
what kind of question is this of course
I will somehow create an algorithm

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
I will somehow create an algorithm
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.600
I will somehow create an algorithm
perhaps inductive algorithm and reach

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610
perhaps inductive algorithm and reach
 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.880
perhaps inductive algorithm and reach
higher and higher and higher ropes

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890
 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.920
exactly so let's try and let us be

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930
exactly so let's try and let us be
 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.619
exactly so let's try and let us be
fishing do I really need the whole army

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629
fishing do I really need the whole army
 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.860
fishing do I really need the whole army
of checkers to reach the first row well

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
of checkers to reach the first row well
 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.540
of checkers to reach the first row well
obviously if I put the checkers like

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550
obviously if I put the checkers like
 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.059
obviously if I put the checkers like
this I'm not gonna go anywhere above the

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069
this I'm not gonna go anywhere above the
 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.080
this I'm not gonna go anywhere above the
line but if I put them vertically

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090
line but if I put them vertically
 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.660
line but if I put them vertically
everyone can play this quite easily you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670
everyone can play this quite easily you
 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.500
everyone can play this quite easily you
can jump over and you know you reach to

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510
can jump over and you know you reach to
 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.160
can jump over and you know you reach to
Row 1 all right let's try Row 2 now at

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
Row 1 all right let's try Row 2 now at
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.160
Row 1 all right let's try Row 2 now at
this point the audience should stop the

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170
this point the audience should stop the
 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.699
this point the audience should stop the
video and really try it because it's not

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709
video and really try it because it's not
 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:24.230
video and really try it because it's not
entirely obvious what to do

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240
 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.930
I think we need to put if we put another

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
I think we need to put if we put another
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.210
I think we need to put if we put another
two there we can feed it so Brady has

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220
two there we can feed it so Brady has
 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.370
two there we can feed it so Brady has
learned a lot of mathematics and his

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380
learned a lot of mathematics and his
 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.610
learned a lot of mathematics and his
intuition is really good indeed if we

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620
intuition is really good indeed if we
 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:47.600
intuition is really good indeed if we
start like this let's see one move two

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610
start like this let's see one move two
 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.640
start like this let's see one move two
moves and finally three moves and we are

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
moves and finally three moves and we are
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.040
moves and finally three moves and we are
in row two above the line so we're done

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050
in row two above the line so we're done
 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.590
in row two above the line so we're done
now for an extra challenge row three

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600
now for an extra challenge row three
 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.360
now for an extra challenge row three
how many checkers do you think we will

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
how many checkers do you think we will
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:19.310
how many checkers do you think we will
need yes but the question is in what

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320
need yes but the question is in what
 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.630
need yes but the question is in what
configuration maybe you can use the

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640
configuration maybe you can use the
 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:33.860
configuration maybe you can use the
smaller ones better yeah okay he's so

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870
smaller ones better yeah okay he's so
 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.220
smaller ones better yeah okay he's so
good you've seen this before

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230
good you've seen this before
 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.710
good you've seen this before
my goodness you're my fastest to them

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720
my goodness you're my fastest to them
 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.700
my goodness you're my fastest to them
how's that

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710
how's that
 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.390
how's that
Brady your arms let's try you think you

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400
Brady your arms let's try you think you
 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.570
Brady your arms let's try you think you
can play it or oh yeah yeah okay okay

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580
can play it or oh yeah yeah okay okay
 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.360
can play it or oh yeah yeah okay okay
try so what we did before

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370
try so what we did before
 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.930
try so what we did before
yes and then and then that they're not

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940
yes and then and then that they're not
 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.650
yes and then and then that they're not
there okay that's gone and then we need

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660
there okay that's gone and then we need
 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.940
there okay that's gone and then we need
to get that to there okay

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950
 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.930
ah this looks very promising do you know

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940
ah this looks very promising do you know
 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:18.650
ah this looks very promising do you know
what so let's think we use two four and

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660
what so let's think we use two four and
 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.890
what so let's think we use two four and
eight checkers to get to row one two and

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900
eight checkers to get to row one two and
 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.310
eight checkers to get to row one two and
three this looks very determined process

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320
three this looks very determined process
 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.710
three this looks very determined process
to me how many checkers shall we try for

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720
to me how many checkers shall we try for
 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.990
to me how many checkers shall we try for
all four six times

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000
all four six times
 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.980
all four six times
I do but you know what there isn't an

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990
I do but you know what there isn't an
 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.040
I do but you know what there isn't an
configuration with 16 even

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050
configuration with 16 even
 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.330
configuration with 16 even
more the pattern breaks I can show you

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340
more the pattern breaks I can show you
 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.680
more the pattern breaks I can show you
the configuration that actually wins and

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690
the configuration that actually wins and
 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.890
the configuration that actually wins and
there it is so that's 20 checkers and

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900
there it is so that's 20 checkers and
 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.619
there it is so that's 20 checkers and
the viewers can try to play with those

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629
the viewers can try to play with those
 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.089
the viewers can try to play with those
checkers and see if you can reach the

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099
checkers and see if you can reach the
 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.590
checkers and see if you can reach the
fourth row this is actually quite a feat

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600
fourth row this is actually quite a feat
 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:01.270
fourth row this is actually quite a feat
[Music]

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280
 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.029
I'm not going to try to try it on Braden

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039
I'm not going to try to try it on Braden
 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:07.580
I'm not going to try to try it on Braden
this is really tough you start with

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590
this is really tough you start with
 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.369
this is really tough you start with
those 20 checkers you play play play

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379
those 20 checkers you play play play
 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.770
those 20 checkers you play play play
play and you get to Row 4 in fact there

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780
play and you get to Row 4 in fact there
 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.200
play and you get to Row 4 in fact there
are other configurations with slightly

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210
are other configurations with slightly
 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.610
are other configurations with slightly
more checkers for example 21 and so the

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620
more checkers for example 21 and so the
 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.839
more checkers for example 21 and so the
way you do it is you arrange them on 4

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849
way you do it is you arrange them on 4
 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:30.559
way you do it is you arrange them on 4
by 5 so we're going to have already 20

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569
by 5 so we're going to have already 20
 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:35.059
by 5 so we're going to have already 20
checkers which is what we had before but

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:35.069
checkers which is what we had before but
 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:37.879
checkers which is what we had before but
in this particular situation you put one

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889
in this particular situation you put one
 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.540
in this particular situation you put one
more so you end up with 21 checkers and

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550
more so you end up with 21 checkers and
 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.279
more so you end up with 21 checkers and
it's kind of a very nice symmetric

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289
it's kind of a very nice symmetric
 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.129
it's kind of a very nice symmetric
situation that actually capitalizes on

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139
situation that actually capitalizes on
 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.040
situation that actually capitalizes on
our previous attempt to reach Row 3 so

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050
our previous attempt to reach Row 3 so
 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.059
our previous attempt to reach Row 3 so
you can try this and indeed reach

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:53.069
you can try this and indeed reach
 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:57.290
you can try this and indeed reach
somewhere up row 4 of course with 21

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300
somewhere up row 4 of course with 21
 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.439
somewhere up row 4 of course with 21
points this game here is less efficient

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:00.449
points this game here is less efficient
 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:02.540
points this game here is less efficient
than the previous one which was with 20

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550
than the previous one which was with 20
 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.420
than the previous one which was with 20
and you can ask yourself is there a more

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:05.430
and you can ask yourself is there a more
 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.230
and you can ask yourself is there a more
efficient game with 1918 and so on but

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240
efficient game with 1918 and so on but
 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.059
efficient game with 1918 and so on but
really that's not the point of the game

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:11.069
really that's not the point of the game
 

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:17.659
really that's not the point of the game
and now the challenge zone so we have 21

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:17.669
and now the challenge zone so we have 21
 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:19.730
and now the challenge zone so we have 21
here well how many do you think we need

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:19.740
here well how many do you think we need
 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.899
here well how many do you think we need
for all 5 we went more than twice up

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:23.909
for all 5 we went more than twice up
 

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:26.689
for all 5 we went more than twice up
from the previous case so if we go more

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:26.699
from the previous case so if we go more
 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:32.480
from the previous case so if we go more
than twice up maybe about 50 yeah 50 or

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490
than twice up maybe about 50 yeah 50 or
 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.760
than twice up maybe about 50 yeah 50 or
60 I think it's gonna become impossible

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:34.770
60 I think it's gonna become impossible
 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:36.469
60 I think it's gonna become impossible
I'm already surprised we got to 4 I

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479
I'm already surprised we got to 4 I
 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:38.209
I'm already surprised we got to 4 I
think it's gonna become impossible as I

00:07:38.209 --> 00:07:38.219
think it's gonna become impossible as I
 

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:40.850
think it's gonna become impossible as I
but I don't see any restriction what can

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860
but I don't see any restriction what can
 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.519
but I don't see any restriction what can
possibly stop us from reaching the fifth

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:43.529

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:48.500
possibly stop us from reaching the fifth
row so there is this mysterious into
