00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.150
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: So, today, we have Shivani York
and Srivaths Lakshimi from TIME.com, and they

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:19.830
did a great demo of the usual list on TIME.com.
So, Shivani, can you tell us a little bit

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.070
about yourself and...?
&gt;&gt; YORK: Sure. So, I’m the director of Web

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.940
Development and Products Strategy at TIME.com,
and we worked over the last month or so with

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.899
Patrick in Google to implement the new Friend
Connects and new APIs and Cloud Computing

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.420
for Time list.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Excellent. Can you tell us a little

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:45.620
bit more about Time list, what it is?
&gt;&gt; YORK: So the Time list concept is we do

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.999
a lot of our daily list. We do a lot of specials
that are daily by nature, weekly by nature,

00:00:50.999 --> 00:01:04.820
and quarterly by nature. For our daily list,
which is the one that we're going to start

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:15.460
off with, they take the form of top 10. And
they can be very–they're sort of like a–some

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.070
of them are very fun and personal by nature,
their different perspective of the current

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.540
day's news. So, I'll give you an example.
Some of the recent ones have been top 10 iPhone

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.909
Apps for moms, or top 10 movie catchphrases.
So when you think of things–list like that,

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.619
they're–they lend themselves very well to
be personalized, to be ranked by users. So,

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:43.159
our edit team creates those top 10 lists on
a daily basis, and we also do other list as

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.720
well, but we're going to start with top 10.
So the concept here was, the challenge that

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.090
we threw at Google was how do we make this
list more fun, more interactive and more social

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.859
by nature? There are a couple of catches to
it, too, as well. We didn't want to create

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.109
a big application load at the bottom. We don't
want to create a separate community or separate

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:04.060
social network. We wanted to be able to leverage
social networks that were already out there.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:27.560
And we wanted it to be fun, easy to use, interactive
and easy to build, which, you know, being

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.420
a small development team we wanted to make
sure that this wouldn't be a big overhead

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.230
and a ten-month project. So that's where you
guys came in.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.270
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yes. So, tell me about the user
experience when they're experiencing the social

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.570
list. What does it look like?
&gt;&gt; YORK: So, the experience that you’ll

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.910
see which will be live on TIME.com in the
next few weeks is you will get our editorial

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.320
list, which is the full list of sort of it’s
top 10 iPhone Apps. You will get the ten iPhone

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.180
Apps that are selected by editorial team.
And then users will get the ability to rank

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.020
the list and make it their own. So you'll
get an interface that'll allow you to drag

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.740
and drop that list into your own rankable
form. You can take three of the top 10 or

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.890
you can take all 10 of the top 10. Then you
can sign in with any of the open social networks.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.050
You can sign in with Yahoo, Google, Facebook,
Open AZ. And then once you sign in, you can

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.710
then save and share that list to your Twitter,
you can share on your Facebook, you can email

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.000
it to friends. And the exciting thing is that
once you share that list, that URL is yours

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.020
and it's unique to use. So you can come back
as a user and look at your list, delete it,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.100
create new ones. So it just becomes–it takes
that one list and gives the users the capability

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.560
to create hundreds of list that they can make
their own.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.820
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Excellent. What are you expecting
from these applications? Do you have any expectations

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.121
or is this an experiment to see how it goes?
&gt;&gt; YORK: It's something that we've been brainstorming

00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:44.710
about for the last few months at least. I
mean, it has both advertising implications

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.600
as well as user implications. What we're hoping
we'd get out of it in the short term is giving

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.950
you just fun things to do with our list. I
mean, our lists are a huge engaging area on

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.000
our site. They're very sort of click through
by nature so people come to it their short

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.015
form. They usually include a video or a photo
on top, and there are maybe two or three paragraphs

00:03:56.015 --> 00:03:57.190
on each page. We can easily click through.
And like I said, the subject matter for some

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.570
of those lists is so interesting. It sort
of reminds you of something. So, you know,

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.090
top 10 iPhone Apps. I mean, everybody who
uses an iPhone App has an iPhone App that

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.880
they like. So why not give them the ability
to create their own version of it. So what

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.811
we're hoping to get out of it in the short
term is to build user engagement to make the

00:04:14.811 --> 00:04:21.789
list more sticky and to take advantage of
the viral nature of Facebook and Twitter and

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:34.580
give people sort of the ability to customize
the list and make it their own. In longer

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:48.129
term, I think it has implications both in
the advertising side. So I think this is something

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.610
that will be a very exciting products--product
for advertisers as well. I mean, you know,

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.280
imagine if we created an editorial list and
we also had an advertising-driven list that

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.509
was related right next to it and you can take
both and share both and create fun, you know,

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:07.229
concepts out of both of those. And then we
also do larger list. We, you know, we do quarterly,

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:13.370
we do best of everything, top 100, Time 100,
which is a list of a hundred most influential

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.509
people. Imagine taking that and building your
own list of my ten most influential people

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:16.810
that have influenced me personally. So–then
the time edit list becomes very viral and

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.449
very personal and very interesting to each
user in a different way. So we're hoping that

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:26.350
it'll drive engagement, build additional page
views, and we got to take advantage of the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.830
viral nature.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: That's great. Thanks very much,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.940
Shivani. Srivaths, do you want to talk about
the technical aspect, how was this implemented,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.330
how long did it take and what the application
is?

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.949
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yeah. What else happening here
is all of them appears on cash between–basically

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:40.509
it's a static page and we don’t want to
put anymore load by integrating the Facebook

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.210
connect and Google connect or Friends connect,
whatever. And we are using GQuery APIs from

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.289
Google, which really helped us integrating
with the Google Friends Connect here. And

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.879
most of the logic is in JavaScript. So, the
JavaScript is [INDISTINCT] in our server so

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.610
the amount of reloading the JavaScript again
and again is [INDISTINCT] so it's not going

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.550
to put any of our servers or anything. And
we don’t want to make a separate database.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.550
What we use are log n authentication information.
So one good thing with integrating with Google

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.550
Friend Connect was, like, we use App Engine
from Google tools. And it’s very good and

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.550
we can have all the logs in the App Engine,
we know the user information like who logged

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:02.550
in, what's the network, what list they're
trying to create, how many discs left, whether

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.550
they're just one or the 10 or something in
between one and 10. And we are really proud

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.550
to be the partner of Google's Friend Connect.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Okay. We're very happy to have

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.550
you as a great use case of this kind of new
architecture. So to summarize, you're going

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:06.550
to study HTML page.
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Uh-huh.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.550
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: And then you had GQuery uploads
that is used to do all the user interface.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.550
And then you have Google Friend Connect for
the authentication and security, and then

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.550
you use the security token, is that it, that
brings connection to you?

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.550
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yeah, the security token with
the user ID and the network ID has been sent

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.550
to the App Engine on the solar side on the
App Engine [INDISTINCT].

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.550
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: I see. So then...
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Whether it's a valid user or not

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.550
so that once the user clears the list, the
App Engine gives us a new user information

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:14.550
you need. It's going to be some numeric value,
so it's going to be unique for each user.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.550
And the good thing is, tomorrow you can assure
that, okay, Patrick created this list and

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.550
you shut it with [INDISTINCT] and say, "See,
my list is in TIME.com." It's going to be

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.550
a good sign for everyone.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yes, so you generate these unique

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.780
URLs and then all the dynamic comes in to
support from App Engine...

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.400
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yes.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Dynamically on the blind side.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.580
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: That's right.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah, that's a new type of architecture

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.533
where you have your data repository somewhere
else and you are doing these [INDISTINCT]

00:06:26.533 --> 00:06:29.118
peoples. And thanks to the security token,
you can do a restful under severed sites to

00:06:29.118 --> 00:06:45.449
make sure that user is...
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: And one good thing is all the

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:46.569
data is going to be installed in App Engine
at some point of time, you may want to do

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:47.569
some internal community or whatever inside
TIME.com. We can just export everything from

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.949
App Engine so we have all the user information
and we just dump in with [INDISTINCT].

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.319
&gt;&gt; YORK: Right. If you remember, one of the–sort
of the challenges that are thrown to you guys

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:57.010
was that this was easy to build. So we didn’t
want to have to build a database and then

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.199
build their architecture. So it was having
Google’s App Engine there was a huge help

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:04.010
to us. So the data is there for us and available
for us to use when we have our own community.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.169
But for now, we didn’t have to create a
new database, new servers. So, it was just

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:07.169
very quick to get it up and running because
of that.

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:08.169
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Great.
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yeah, we also integrated with

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:09.169
Facebook to come out, and one little thing
we missed with that is we don’t squat the

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:10.169
data and we don’t know who come with the–what
is happening because there was one disc with

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:11.169
this Google Friend Connect as it's stored
in App Engine, we have all the data in there.

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:12.169
&gt;&gt; YORK: And another feature that I forgot
to mention earlier was--so as--not just people

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:13.169
being able to share their own list, another
thing that you guys implemented that was terrific

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.360
was being able to see a user view of our list.
So there's the editorial-driven list of top

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.062
10 movie catchphrases and then there's a version
that people can come to and see that this

00:07:19.062 --> 00:07:21.430
is how everybody in the community in TIME.com
and Google and Yahoo and Facebook had ranked

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.660
it. And this is what they think is the top
10 movie catchphrases or top 10 iPhone Apps.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:24.819
And even if you don’t play around with the
list and even if you're not that highly engaged

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:26.590
users that creates their own list, it's just
interesting to come back to see the two different

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.830
versions of the list. And I think that’s
where I was sort of we'll catch a lot of users

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.830
that are skeptical about trying their own
version of it.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.870
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: And the other good thing is as
we have implemented in Google Friend Connect

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.870
is site disc. It's not like a list disc or
anything. Once you're signed in the future

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.870
in TIME.com just like if you need something
or anything for this list. You start with

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.870
some comments, whatever, it's going to be
an easy step. Maybe a couple of pause to a

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.870
day to integrate the product.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah, because you own the data.

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:35.870
&gt;&gt; YORK: Yeah. I mean, I was very impressed
by the time that it took you guys to build

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.439
it and get it up and running. I mean, I seriously
didn't think that you guys will be able to

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:38.819
do this by the conference. So...
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: The conference was done in less

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.009
than three weeks.
&gt;&gt; YORK: It took three weeks. That included

00:07:40.009 --> 00:07:41.009
use cases, designs, building, building the
database, you know, doing all the backend

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:42.009
work. So it's–the time to get it up and
running, the speed of it is quite amazing.

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:43.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: It feels really comforting.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Staying up till 3 am doing it, so...

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:44.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah, as usual.
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: It wasn't though, see? That is

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:45.009
good response work here and many people liked
it. So we hope we will launch the VL version

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:46.009
some time [INDISTINCT] so that we give users
the ability to make their own [INDISTINCT].

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:47.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: That's great, and I look forward
to see live [INDISTINCT].

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:48.009
&gt;&gt; YORK: Yeah, us, too, are very excited about
it.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: I know. So, tell me about the
statistics. So how do you see the–how the

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:50.009
users have rated this list?
&gt;&gt; YORK: So you have to do some work to see

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:51.009
how other people have rated the list. So the
user interaction right now or when we launched

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:52.009
will be–you have to create your own list
in order to see how the rest of the community

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:53.009
has ranked the list, which we think is a better
user experience because you sort of get something

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:54.009
at the end of creating a list. And then you
also get a histogram which you implemented

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:55.009
recently. So you get a version of how users
have ranked this list and they also get little

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:56.009
charts, which are very interesting to see
on how each item has been ranked by the user.

00:07:56.009 --> 00:07:57.009
So it's just another view of how that list
was rated by other people.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:07:58.009
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yeah, it's going to be [INDISTINCT]
sort of, like, so, you know, [INDISTINCT]

00:07:58.009 --> 00:07:59.009
said that it's something on the flash point–flash
disc made by editors and maybe the users didn't

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:00.009
like it. It's going to be–many people would
have rated that it’s number ten, or something

00:08:00.009 --> 00:08:01.009
like that. It's going to be a good and clean
graphical representation of how the other

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:02.009
one was rated.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Right. And as I mentioned, you know,

00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:03.009
this lists are highly engaging for our users.
I mean, you know, we get a tremendous page

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:04.009
view numbers on this. So we're just hoping
that by launching this, we increase that engagement

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:05.009
on our site.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Okay, we're excited to see how

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:06.009
it will go. Actually, it would be really interesting
to get some numbers and you can share some

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:07.009
like the moms after launching that or...
&gt;&gt; YORK: Definitely.

00:08:07.009 --> 00:08:08.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: [INDISTINCT]something great of
trying to see how more engaging these lists

00:08:08.009 --> 00:08:09.009
are.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Yeah. And modify it if something

00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:10.009
isn't working.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah. Sure.

00:08:10.009 --> 00:08:11.009
&gt;&gt; YORK: Yeah. This is a new [INDISTINCT]
released by Google Friend Connect. It was

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:12.009
released two months ago, so.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah.

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:13.009
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: So I think that is somewhat involved
in both TIME.com site and the Google site

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:14.009
to make it more optimized. It was the test
what happens.

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:15.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Oh, yeah, the application is quite
cutting edge. So here, you're using the Google

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:16.009
Friend Connect JavaScript TPI...
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yes.

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:17.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: That's only two months old.
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: And [INDISTINCT].

00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:18.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: [INDISTINCT], which is also two
months old.

00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:19.009
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: There's Google App Engine...

00:08:19.009 --> 00:08:20.009
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: And I believe this is the fast
site using both of those.

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:21.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Yeah. Yeah, I think you are the
first big site who's going live with this,

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:22.009
except maybe for Washington Post. They did
a demo as well. I think they're using–I

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:23.009
don’t know if they're using both. I think
they're using the [INDISTINCT]. I need to

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:24.009
double check with them. But, essentially,
you–the Washington Post and TIME.com will–are

00:08:24.009 --> 00:08:25.009
the first ones to go right with this.
&gt;&gt; YORK: That's great.

00:08:25.009 --> 00:08:26.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: And then you're using App Engine
and you're using the [INDISTINCT] for...

00:08:26.009 --> 00:08:27.009
&gt;&gt; YORK: Right...
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: It's full of Google products.

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:28.009
That was–that's what made this list.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Right. And I think, you know, once

00:08:28.009 --> 00:08:29.009
we get to the larger list, at the 100 list,
the UI will be very interesting because we're

00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:30.009
going to have to make some changes, too, to
let people be able to easily browse through

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.009
the 100 and create their own version of each
list. So we'll come across that bridge over

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:32.009
the next few months. But we're excited about
launching it for the daily top 10 and then

00:08:32.009 --> 00:08:33.009
expanding it out to the rest of our specials.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Okay. Great. I look forward to

00:08:33.009 --> 00:08:34.009
see that live.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Great. Thanks, Patrick, and Srivaths

00:08:34.009 --> 00:08:35.009
for all your help. And we also have a third
person which is actually missing from the

00:08:35.009 --> 00:08:36.009
interview, Henry Chan, who tremendously helped
and he did all the front-end work.

00:08:36.009 --> 00:08:37.009
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: Henry should have been there.
He spent lots of nights coding that...

00:08:37.009 --> 00:08:38.009
&gt;&gt; YORK: Yeah, he's maybe getting–catching
up on sleep at this point. So, I can't blame

00:08:38.009 --> 00:08:39.009
him.
&gt;&gt; PATRICK: I'm pretty sure he needs it. Okay,

00:08:39.009 --> 00:08:40.009
thanks very much.
&gt;&gt; YORK: Thanks, Patrick.

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:40.012
&gt;&gt; LAKSHMI: Thank you.
