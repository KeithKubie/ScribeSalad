00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.210
Disney Princess are some of the most famous
and beloved movie characters of all time.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.360
Whether we are talking about old Princesses
like Snow White or Sleeping Beauty or ladies

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.930
from the new generation like Frozen’s Elsa
of Tangled’s Rapunzel, fans seems to think

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.020
they know all there is to know about their
Disney Princesses.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.439
Well, we’re hear to challenge that by bringing
you some mind blowing facts and these famous

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.649
animated women.

Here are 10 Secrets About Disney Princesses
That Will Blow Your Mind

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.590
Beauty and The Beast
With more and more footage dropping every

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.200
day, the world can’t wait to see the live
action adaption of Beauty and The Beast and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.629
from we’ve seen so far it looks like Emma
Watson will knock the part out of the park.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.910
Belle is definitely one of the most unique
Disney Princesses of all time and she is actually

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.509
the one Princess who has hazel eyes.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.700
In her own movie, Belle is the only character
in her town who wears blue and this is to

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.990
signify that she is an outsider.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.729
During the conception and creation of Belle
it was also very important that the Princess

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.880
would always have a wasp of hair falling in
her face to signify that she is not perfect.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.579
Belle certainly is one of a kind and here’s
hoping Emma Watson does the iconic character

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.020
justice!

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.749
Frozen
Frozen introduced us to one of the most complex

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:40.349
Disney Princesses of all time in Elsa and
it turns out that the original script actually

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:43.169
had Elsa slotted as the villain of the film.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:47.060
This apparently changed after the iconic song
“Let It Go” became such a hit amongst

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.770
the filmmakers and they decided to turn Elsa
into the empowering Princess we now know and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.770
love.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.020
Elsa was also one of the more complex characters
in terms of animation too as she actually

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.780
has 420,000 individual hairs on her head.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.820
To put that in to perspective, Rapunzel AKA
the princess who is famous for her hair, only

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.840
has around 27,000 individually animated hairs
on her head.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.220
The Little Mermaid
Other than the fact that it is indeed happening,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.780
we don’t know much about the upcoming live
action adaptation of The Little Mermaid.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.830
One thing is for sure, though, and that is
that the film better feature the iconic song

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:38.950
“Part Of Your World” or there will be
riots.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.480
Interestingly enough, this famous song almost
didn’t make it in to the original animated

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.629
film and the story behind this is pretty bizarre.

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.530
Apparently, during a test screening of the
underwater film, kids seemed quite bored during

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.060
“Part Of Your World” which made Disney
executives question its inclusions.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.420
Luckily, cooler heads prevailed and Walt Disney
Studios decided to keep the ballad in the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.400
movie which we have to say was definitely
a good decision!

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.870
Cinderella
One of the most iconic Disney images of all

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.840
time is Cinderella’ castle.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.910
It’s in the logo and it’s the centerpiece
of Disney World and all of this is no accident.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.829
Walt Disney actually admitted that Cinderella
was his favorite Disney Princess of all time

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.969
and he went even further to say that the scene
where we see Cinderella's dress transformation

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.209
was his favorite piece of animation ever.

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.239
That’s pretty high praise a character to
receive and it makes sense as Walt famously

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.090
said that he identifies with her story and
struggle.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.420
We guess it makes sense why Cinderella was
the first Disney Princess to be given the

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.860
live action adaptation in 2015.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.000
The Princess and The Frog
The Princess and The Frog brought a lot of

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.989
“firsts” to the world of Disney Princesses
as it introduced the world to the first African

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.340
American Princess as well as the first princess
who actually had a job.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.739
Anika Noni Rose did a great job bringing Princess
Tiana to life but did you know that Beyoncé

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.290
almost voiced the Princess.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.840
Allegedly, the pop icon didn't think she should
have to audition for the role, which we can

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.950
understand, but ultimately this ended up costing
her the part.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.050
We guess that Queen Bee just didn’t want
to stoop down to Princess Bee.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.269
Snow White
Snow White was the first feature length animated

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.850
Disney movie and it introduced us to one of
the most famous characters of all time, Snow

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.850
White.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.710
The Princess is not only the youngest Disney
Princess of all time but she is also the only

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.789
one to actually have her own star on the Walk
Of fame.

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.030
Adriana Caselotti, the actress who voiced
Snow White, was only paid $20 a day for the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.030
role.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.930
This sounds criminally low but in 1937 it
was actually a pretty good salary.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.380
80 years later, there have been many different
adaptations and interpretation of the famous

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.380
story but when it comes down to it – nothing
compares to the original!

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.090
Pocahontas
Although there have been tons of questions

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.699
about how historically accurate the events
of Disney’s Pocahontas are, it stills remains

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.800
true that she is the only Disney Princess
who was actually a real person.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.500
On top of that Pocahontas also happens to
be one of only two Princesses who have multiple

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.550
love interests in their film.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.560
Both Kocoum and John Smith court Pocahontas
in her movie, which causes quite the love

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.560
triangle.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.890
The other princess with this distinction is
Frozen's Princess Anna who was famously pursued

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.740
by both Prince Hans and Kristoff in her story.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.569
Aladdin
Aladdin is another movie on the long list

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.220
of Disney films slated to have live action
adaptation on the way and with characters

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.460
this unique we hope they are able to find
the right talent.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.971
Jasmine is a very exciting princess and did
you know that she is actually the only princess

00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:37.660
to ever kiss a villain (this became the case
when she kissed Jafar).

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.259
Anna, from Frozen, actually came close to
joining Jasmine but her and Hans never actually

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.419
kissed – they just sang together!

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.759
Another interesting fact about Jasmine is
the fact she and Mulan are the only princesses

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.260
to wear pants instead of the traditional Princess
gown.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.770
Mulan
Mulan is undoubtedly the most badass Disney

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.569
Princess that we have ever seen and it probably
wouldn’t surprise too many fans to hear

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:03.690
that she is the princess with the highest
body count of all time.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.320
But, did you know that she is actually the
overall Disney character who has taken the

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.320
most lives?

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.020
Yes, in her original film, Mulan ends up taking
the lives of nearly 4000 Hans and horses,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.530
leaving just six alive.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:20.910
This is a pretty incredible number of kills
especially when you consider the fact that

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.639
Mulan was almost not allowed to fight in the
war at all.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:29.090
Mulan presents a very empowering female lead
who we do not want to mess with!

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.919
Tangled
Tangled is a great movie and the filmmakers

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.539
did a great job of staying true to the original
story of Rapunzel while also adding in a ton

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:37.770
of fun new stuff.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.770
All of the detailed animation used for Rapunzel’s
iconic hair was impressive, but there was

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.810
another details that fans may have not even
noticed that really showed off how much care

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.400
was put into this flic.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.770
Mother Gothel’s dress is specifically designed
to be clearly from the renaissance period

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.490
and this is no accident.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.990
Tangled is set in 1780, about 400 years after
the Renaissance, so the presence of the old

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.210
dress is actually there to emphasize how long
Gothel had been living.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.319
And with that we have made it to the end of
our list 10 Secrets About Disney Princesses

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.860
That Will Blow Your Mind.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.470

them most?
