00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.040
Just as map reduce provides a simple and intuitive programming model

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:12.200
for the domain expert to develop big data applications, PTS provides

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.430
a simple programming model for the domain expert to develop live

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.820
stream analysis applications. Time-based distributed data

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.900
structures for streams, automatic data management,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900
transparent stream persistence. These are then

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.900
unique features of the PTS programming model

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.350
that facilitates live stream analysis. I invite you to read the paper in its

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.260
entirety to understand the many systems

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.980
challenges that are identified and solved by

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.160
PTS in providing this programming model. This

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.080
completes our discussion in this course on

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.291
the topic of real-time and multimedia.
