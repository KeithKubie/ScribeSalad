00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.770
 In this lesson, I want to take a look 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.810
 the mathematics behind mortgage loans. 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.150
 It will not really be a lesson for finance. 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.550
 In fact, it's more about math. 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.470
 In my mind, however, it affects one of the most fundamental 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.470
 questions I ask 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.120
 for quite some time now. 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.970
 It is known that we take loans when we want to buy houses. 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.100
 Let's say you're pulling $ 200,000 in a mortgage loan. 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:29.900
 It is secured by your home. 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.700
 You will pay it for 30 years, or we can say, 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.180
 that it is 360 months. 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.720
 Because if you normally pay it every month, 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.140
 the interest is charged each month. 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.460
 Let's say you pay 6% interest. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.760
 This is annual interest and is usually distributed 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.150
 on a monthly basis, i. 6% divided by 12. 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.890
 That is, it is 0.50% per month. 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.110
 Per month. 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.320
 When you get such a loan, your broker 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.780
 or your banker, will look at a table, 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.480
 or introduce the numbers into a computer program. 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.710
 And he will tell you "Okay, your installment follows 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.590
 to be $ 1,200 per month. " 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.170
 If you pay these $ 1,200 a month for 360 months, 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.700
 at the end of those 360 ​​months you will pay $ 200,000. 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.190
 Plus the interest that has accrued. 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.290
 But this number is not so easy. 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.940
 Let's show an example of how mortgage actually works. 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.060
 On the Zero Day you have a $ 200,000 loan. 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.380
 You have a $ 200,000 loan. 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.190
 You do not pay any contributions. 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.880
 You will make your first installment 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.740
 after a month from today. 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:05.590
 This amount will be obtained from the 0.50% set. 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.780
 That is, a decimal fraction equal to 0.005. 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.730
 After a month with such interest, this amount will increase 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:19.870
 200 000 * (1 + 0.005). 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.356
 Then you will import those 1200 dollars. 

00:02:23.356 --> 00:02:27.446
 The amount will be minus $ 1200. Maybe I should write it like 1.2K. 

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:30.696
 Right now I just illustrate the idea itself. 

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:33.702
 What remains for the next month, 

00:02:33.702 --> 00:02:38.782
 will be redefined by 0.50% or 0.005. 

00:02:38.782 --> 00:02:40.562
 Next month, you will return again 

00:02:40.562 --> 00:02:42.102
 and you'll bring in those $ 1,200. 

00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:45.802
 Minus $ 1,200. 

00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:49.208
 This will happen 360 times. 

00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:50.894
 That is, you will continue to do so. You can be 

00:02:50.894 --> 00:02:53.224
 if you really try to express yourself 

00:02:53.224 --> 00:02:55.879
 this number, at the end of the period you will have one huge one 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.289
 an expression that will contain 360 parentheses 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.619
 right here. Finally, everything will be equal to 0. 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:04.619
 Because, after making the last installment, 

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.159
 then the house is paid. 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.209
 How, however, is the monthly installment determined? 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.499
 Let us mark it with p. 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.539
 Is there a mathematical method to calculate it? 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:21.349
 To do this, let's take a closer look at the task. 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.739
 Let L say that L equals the sum of the loan. 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.949
 The amount of the loan. 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:35.459
 Let i be equal to the monthly interest rate. 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.779
 Monthly rate. 

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:46.029
 Let n be the number of months, 

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:47.989
 for the repayment period. 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.509
 Then, we want p to be equal to the monthly 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:54.799
 payment, ie. monthly payment. 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.639
 Part of it is the interest, part of it is the principal. 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.729
 However, the amount you will pay each month, 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:02.909
 to repay the loan and the interest is the same. 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.689
 So this is your monthly installment. 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.659
 This is the same phrase I just wrote down here. 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:16.459
 I wrote it in a general way. Starts with the amount of credit L. 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.519
 After one month it will increase as 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.959
 multiply the sum by 1 + i. In this case i 

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.849
 is equal to 0.005. 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.519
 Then you pay a monthly sum equal to p, ie. we record minus p. 

00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:32.899
 This is therefore the end of the month. 

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:36.099
 Now, however, you have some amount left out of your loan. 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.219
 It is calculated for the next month. 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:43.219
 You will then reintroduce the amount p. 

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:47.219
 And this process will be repeated 300 times, or n times, 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.329
 because it is still about the common look. 

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:57.669
 You will therefore have n number of parentheses. 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.909
 And after the process is repeated n times, then all this 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:02.949
 will be equal to 0. 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.979
 My question, the one I want to answer 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.979
 in this lesson, is this: How do we find the number p? 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.739
 If you know the amount of the loan, the monthly 

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:13.419
 interest rate and number of months, 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:16.019
 how will we find p? 

00:05:16.019 --> 00:05:18.579
 It really does not look like an easy algebraic one 

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:19.909
 an equation we can solve. 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.619
 Let's see if we can make some transformations. 

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:27.409
 Let's see if we can write the phrase in another way. 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:32.219
 Let us use an example in which n is equal to 1. 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.519
 If n equals 1, then the situation looks like this. 

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:40.519
 You take the amount of the loan, multiply it in one month, 

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:45.779
 i. 1 + i, and then make the monthly installment. 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.339
 This is a credit that is paid for a month. 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:53.089
 That is, after a payment, the amount of the credit is covered. 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:55.459
 Nothing left for a surcharge. 

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:59.459
 If we now want to find p, we can exchange the two sides of the equation. 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:03.139
 P is equal to L * (1 + i). 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.989
 We divide the two sides of the equation to 1 + i. P is obtained 

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:12.389
 1 + i is equal to L. 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.550
 You might say, "Hey, here we found p. 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.620
 Why are you doing this?". 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.200
 I do it to show you 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.740
 model that will be produced. 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.630
 Let's see what happens when n equals 2. 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.770
 n equals 2. 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.600
 Then you start with the original credit. 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.790
 Calculated for one month. 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.740
 You make your contribution. 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.950
 Then there is some amount of the loan. 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:36.090
 It will be calculated for another month. 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.210
 Then you make your second installment. 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.150
 This mortgage loan contains only two installments. 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.880
 And now it's paid off! 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.170
 You do not have the amount of credit left. 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:45.900
 Both the principal and the interest are paid. 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.520
 Let us now find p. 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.350
 I will write p with some color. 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.270
 Here's what p will do in pink. 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:54.830
 Let us add p to both sides of the equation, then exchange them. 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.610
 Therefore this green p will be equal to this one 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.000
 expression here. 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:09.940
 It is equal to L * (1 + i), minus this pink p. 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.510
 It's the same p. I just want 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.390
 to show you how it looks algebraic. 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:18.740
 Minus this pink p, 1 + i. 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.840
 If we now divide both sides into 1 + i, we get p 

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:31.000
 on 1 + i is equal to L * (1 + i), minus this pink p. 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.449
 Let's now add this pink p to both sides of the equation. 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:43.359
 Pink p, plus p on 1 + i, 

00:07:43.359 --> 00:07:47.359
 is equal to L * (1 + i). 

00:07:47.359 --> 00:07:50.949
 Now we divide both sides into 1 + i. 

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:59.019
 Pink p is obtained on 1 + i, plus the green p, the same p, 

00:07:59.019 --> 00:08:01.929
 which is already divided into 1 + i. 

00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:03.969
 Now it will be divided again into 1 + i. 

00:08:03.969 --> 00:08:10.229
 That is, it will be divided into 1 + i square. And equal to the loan L. 

00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:12.659
 Something interesting is happening. 

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:16.659
 Perhaps you should look at the present value lessons. 

00:08:16.659 --> 00:08:19.429
 In this case, you get the monthly installment, 

00:08:19.429 --> 00:08:23.239
 divide it into interest, and get the credit amount. 

00:08:23.239 --> 00:08:26.409
 You make each contribution. You divide her 

00:08:26.409 --> 00:08:31.039
 at 1 plus monthly interest, 

00:08:31.039 --> 00:08:33.239
 the number of months. 

00:08:33.239 --> 00:08:35.869
 You are actually taking this value 

00:08:35.869 --> 00:08:38.699
 of the installments and again get the loan amount. 

00:08:38.699 --> 00:08:41.829
 You can check it if you want 

00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:43.769
 to practice algebra. 

00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:46.049
 You can do the same with n equal to 3. 

00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:48.329
 I will not do it because I do not have the time. 

00:08:48.329 --> 00:08:50.999
 If you choose n to be equal to 3, then you will get, 

00:08:50.999 --> 00:09:00.889
 that credit is equal to p on 1 + i, plus p on 1 + i of square, 

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:06.325
 plus p on the (1 + i) third degree, 

00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:09.665
 If you have time, I encourage you to prove it 

00:09:09.665 --> 00:09:13.665
 for yourself, using the same approach we applied here. 

00:09:13.665 --> 00:09:16.455
 You will see that it will get a little scary. 

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:18.235
 There will be many edits of the phrase, 

00:09:18.235 --> 00:09:19.865
 but it will not take you far. 

00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:23.945
 Generally, I hope I showed you that we can imagine 

00:09:23.945 --> 00:09:27.265
 the amount of credit as the present value of all contributions. 

00:09:27.265 --> 00:09:31.265
 Then we can say that the amount of the loan - if I summarize, 

00:09:31.265 --> 00:09:33.745
 for n months instead of some number - 

00:09:33.745 --> 00:09:38.745
 is equal to the following. I will take p as a common multiplier. 

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:45.705
 Equals p on 1 on (1 + i), plus 

00:09:45.705 --> 00:09:49.815
 1 on (1 + i) per square, etc. 

00:09:49.815 --> 00:09:58.905
 n number of times, finally plus 1 on (1 + i) of degree n. 

00:09:58.905 --> 00:10:01.435
 Now maybe you see what's going on. 

00:10:01.435 --> 00:10:04.985
 This is a geometric progression. 

00:10:04.985 --> 00:10:07.965
 This is a geometric progression. 

00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:10.715
 There is a way to find the sum of a geometric 

00:10:10.715 --> 00:10:13.035
 progression with any number of members. 

00:10:13.035 --> 00:10:17.795
 Geometric progression. 

00:10:17.795 --> 00:10:20.355
 As I said at the beginning, this lesson will be 

00:10:20.355 --> 00:10:22.515
 for applying a sum of members of geometric progression. 

00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:28.675
 It is equal to the sum of 1 on (1 + i). Here I will use 

00:10:28.675 --> 00:10:37.075
 some other letter. In degree j, with j starting from 1. 

00:10:37.075 --> 00:10:41.075
 From the first degree - ie. here is this article - from j equal to 1, 

00:10:41.075 --> 00:10:43.605
 to j equals n. 

00:10:43.605 --> 00:10:45.915
 That's what this sum is equal. 

00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:48.845
 Let's see if there is an easy way to calculate the amount. 

00:10:48.845 --> 00:10:51.195
 We do not want to collect 360 times. 

00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:53.445
 You can do it and get a number. You divide 

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:55.605
 L on this number and get p. 

00:10:55.605 --> 00:10:57.755
 But there should be an easier way to do it. 

00:10:57.755 --> 00:11:00.405
 Let's see if we can simplify the expression. 

00:11:00.405 --> 00:11:04.405
 For easier calculations, let me make a substitution. 

00:11:04.405 --> 00:11:09.055
 Let's say r is equal to 1 on (1 + i). 

00:11:09.055 --> 00:11:13.475
 And let this whole sum be equal to s. 

00:11:13.475 --> 00:11:16.275
 This sum is equal to s. 

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:19.765
 If r equals any of these members, then 

00:11:19.765 --> 00:11:22.685
 s will be equal to the following. This will be equal 

00:11:22.685 --> 00:11:25.575
 to r of the first degree. I record r at first degree. 

00:11:25.575 --> 00:11:28.005
 This will be equal to r of square, 

00:11:28.005 --> 00:11:31.135
 because if we pick up a numeric square, we get 1 again. 

00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:34.435
 Then, we have plus r of a square, plus r of a third, etc., 

00:11:34.435 --> 00:11:38.705
 until we get to plus r at degree n. 

00:11:38.705 --> 00:11:41.195
 I'll show you a little trick. 

00:11:41.195 --> 00:11:44.075
 I always forget the formula, so this is a good way 

00:11:44.075 --> 00:11:46.475
 to find the sum of the geometric progression. 

00:11:46.475 --> 00:11:48.895
 In fact, this can be used to find the sum of infinite 

00:11:48.895 --> 00:11:50.395
 geometric progression. In this case, however, we work 

00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:51.573
 with the end one. 

00:11:51.573 --> 00:11:54.403
 Let's multiply s by r. 

00:11:54.403 --> 00:11:57.543
 What will be equal to r? 

00:11:57.543 --> 00:12:00.393
 If you multiply each of these members by r, 

00:12:00.393 --> 00:12:03.263
 the first one will get a square. 

00:12:03.263 --> 00:12:06.403
 The second will be the third. 

00:12:06.403 --> 00:12:08.523
 You keep doing so until 

00:12:08.523 --> 00:12:12.523
 you do not reach r at r - 1. You multiply it by r 

00:12:12.523 --> 00:12:14.503
 and you get r at degree n. 

00:12:14.503 --> 00:12:19.683
 Then you multiply r on degree n by r and you get 

00:12:19.683 --> 00:12:22.373
 plus r at r + 1. 

00:12:22.373 --> 00:12:26.833
 Here are all the members multiplied 

00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:30.123
 by r, just putting them to the same degree. 

00:12:30.123 --> 00:12:32.873
 What you can do now is to get this one out 

00:12:32.873 --> 00:12:35.313
 a green expression of this purple expression. 

00:12:35.313 --> 00:12:43.353
 And if we form s minus r * s, what will happen? 

00:12:43.353 --> 00:12:46.873
 I just get this line out of this line. 

00:12:46.873 --> 00:12:52.373
 Here we get r1 minus 0, ie. r at first 

00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:53.523
 degree minus nothing here. 

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:56.173
 Then r gets a square minus r per square and is destroyed. 

00:12:56.173 --> 00:12:58.483
 r of the third minus r of the third are destroyed. 

00:12:58.483 --> 00:13:02.143
 All members up to r at grade n minus r at grade 

00:13:02.143 --> 00:13:04.583
 are destroyed. Then stay that one 

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:05.993
 last article here. 

00:13:05.993 --> 00:13:07.783
 That's why it's a nice trick. 

00:13:07.783 --> 00:13:10.963
 Remains minus r at degree n plus 1. 

00:13:10.963 --> 00:13:12.623
 Now we export s. 

00:13:12.623 --> 00:13:18.113
 The s * (1 - r) is obtained, so far I have delivered, 

00:13:18.113 --> 00:13:23.847
 is equal to r of first degree minus r at degree n plus 1. 

00:13:23.847 --> 00:13:27.127
 If we now divide both sides into 1 - r, 

00:13:27.127 --> 00:13:29.277
 we will receive the requested amount. 

00:13:29.277 --> 00:13:42.107
 The requested amount is equal to r, minus r at degree n + 1, on 1 - r. 

00:13:42.107 --> 00:13:44.887
 This is equal to the amount requested, like 

00:13:44.887 --> 00:13:47.147
 we defined r this way. 

00:13:47.147 --> 00:13:50.767
 And now we can re-record all this crazy formula. 

00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:54.767
 We can say that the loan amount is equal to the monthly amount 

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:58.767
 contribution multiplied by this expression. 

00:13:58.767 --> 00:14:00.297
 I'll save it in green. 

00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:05.757
 Multiplied by r minus r of degree n + 1. 

00:14:05.757 --> 00:14:08.417
 All this is on 1 - r. 

00:14:08.417 --> 00:14:12.417
 If we now want to express p, we multiply both sides 

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:18.957
 by the reciprocal of this expression and we obtain that p is equal to the amount of the loan, 

00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:21.317
 multiplied by the reciprocal of that expression. 

00:14:21.317 --> 00:14:23.597
 I record it in pink because it's reciprocal. 

00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:30.537
 1 - r on r - r of degree n plus 1. 

00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:33.527
 Where r equals this expression here. 

00:14:33.527 --> 00:14:34.537
 And we are ready! 

00:14:34.537 --> 00:14:37.167
 This is the way to find out what 

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:39.567
 is equal to the contribution of your mortgage loan. 

00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:41.297
 Let's apply it. 

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:45.297
 Let's say your credit is $ 200,000. 

00:14:45.297 --> 00:14:50.607
 Let the annual interest rate be 6%, 

00:14:50.607 --> 00:14:58.177
 which is 0.5% per month; the same as 0.005. 

00:14:58.177 --> 00:15:01.317
 This is the value of the monthly interest rate. 

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.257
 Let's say it's credit for 30 years, so n will be 

00:15:04.257 --> 00:15:06.177
 equal to 360 months, 

00:15:06.177 --> 00:15:08.477
 Let's calculate what we get. 

00:15:08.477 --> 00:15:11.437
 The first thing we want to do is find, 

00:15:11.437 --> 00:15:13.507
 what is the value r. 

00:15:13.507 --> 00:15:16.237
 Let's find the value of r. 

00:15:16.237 --> 00:15:19.527
 r is equal to 1 on 1 + i. 

00:15:19.527 --> 00:15:30.557
 Let us take 1, divided by 1 + i, i. plus 0.005. 

00:15:30.557 --> 00:15:40.487
 This is equal to the monthly interest, at half a percentage point. 

00:15:40.614 --> 00:15:43.214
 Then, 0.995 is the value of r. 

00:15:43.214 --> 00:15:45.904
 Let me save it, 0.995. 

00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:48.485
 This calculator does not save variables, so 

00:15:48.485 --> 00:15:50.635
 I'll just write this down here. 

00:15:50.635 --> 00:16:00.245
 r is equal to 0.995. 

00:16:00.245 --> 00:16:02.465
 We just used this here. 

00:16:02.465 --> 00:16:04.355
 I miss some precision, 

00:16:04.355 --> 00:16:06.145
 but I think it's OK. 

00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:09.335
 The important thing here is to give you the basic idea. 

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:11.195
 What is the monthly installment? 

00:16:11.195 --> 00:16:20.695
 Let's multiply the $ 200,000 credit. $ 200,000. 

00:16:20.695 --> 00:16:50.364
 1 - r, ie. 1 - 0.995, divided by r, equal to 0.995, minus 0.995. 

00:16:50.364 --> 00:16:53.224
 Now n is equal to 360 months, so it will work out 

00:16:53.224 --> 00:16:58.664
 360 plus 1 or 361. Something I definitely can not 

00:16:58.664 --> 00:17:03.948
 to think in mind. Now we close the brackets. 

00:17:03.948 --> 00:17:09.848
 And the final answer is approximately $ 1,200. 

00:17:09.848 --> 00:17:12.398
 Indeed, if you want absolute precision, you will get it 

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:15.608
 slightly less than this value, but will be approximately $ 1,200. 

00:17:15.608 --> 00:17:18.008
 That's how we managed to find 

00:17:18.008 --> 00:17:20.878
 the actual monthly installment from the mortgage. 

00:17:20.878 --> 00:17:23.348
 Therefore p is equal to 1200 dollars. 

00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:26.298
 It was really a very unusual approach to find 

00:17:26.298 --> 00:17:28.358
 something people face every day. 

00:17:28.358 --> 00:17:30.628
 But now you know the mathematics behind it. You don `t need to 

00:17:30.628 --> 00:17:32.352
 you are dealing with a table or an electronic one, 

00:17:32.352 --> 00:17:35.052
 to get the number through an experiment.
