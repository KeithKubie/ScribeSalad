00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.390
&gt;&gt;Mamie Rheingold: You may know Howard Rheingold
as a colorful and prescient anthropologist

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.150
who defined concepts like virtual communities
and smart mobs before we were all participating

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.660
in them.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.080
You may know him as the former editor of the
'Whole Earth Review' and the founding editor

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.140
of 'Hotwired'.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:27.259
Or perhaps you are a student of Howard's either
at Berkeley or Stanford or his social media

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.810
classroom and online learning community Rheingold's
U.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.390
Or maybe you know him for his painted shoes,
paisley blazer, Panama hat and psychedelic

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.480
art.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.769
In fact we were in SXSW last month, a street
person came up to him and thank him for keeping

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.430
Austin weird.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.829
But I know him as Dad.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.100
So 10 years ago, my dad wrote 'Smart Mobs:
the Next Social Revolution'.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.980
This was years before twitter and 4square,
before NFC and Google wallet.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.740
My dad wrote about a future in which people
will leave messages and places and mobile

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.220
phones will become remote controls for the
physical world.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.740
A decade before the Arab Spring and the Occupy
Movement, he predicted that the merger of

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.320
mobile phones, personal computers and the
Internet were lowering barriers to collective

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.220
action and were going to enable economic,
social and political revolutions.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.640
Sound familiar?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.090
In 1985, he wrote 'Tools for Thought: The
History and Future of Mind Expanding Technology',

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.430
in which he envisioned the future of personal
computing when hundreds of millions of people

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.049
around the world would be a part of a network
community.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.840
And how this would change the way people think,
learn and communicate.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.939
He warned that nobody knows whether this will
turn out to be the best or the worst thing

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.570
that the human race has done for itself because
the outcome of this empowerment will depend

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.220
in a large part on how we react to it and
what we choose to do with it.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.580
And in his new book 'Net Smart: How to Thrive
Online', Howard warns that the future of digital

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.890
culture depends on how well we learn to use
the media that have infiltrated, amplified,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.330
distracted, enriched and complicated our lives.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.310
And he introduces five essential literacies
for the 21st-century.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.910
And you'll be able to buy the book for $10
in the back at the end of this talk thanks

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.019
to Books Inc.

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.270
And if you're not able to buy it today, you
can go back to Books Inc. and all you need

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.370
to do is show your Google badge.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.800
And I really want this to be a conversation.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.590
I'm really excited to be connecting him with
you guys.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.180
Who are the makers, who are creating the tools
that are changing the way people are going

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.890
to be thinking and living in the 21st-century.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.100
So I want to make sure you guys get a chance
to ask your questions.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.220
And before I jump in, you probably should
know who I am.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:01.030
My name is Mamie, I've been a Googler since
May 2006 so coming up on six years.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.550
I've worked on grassroots innovation at Google
and now on the developer relations team.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.730
So, to kick it off I want to ask the question
that's on all of our minds.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.380
Is Google making us stupid?

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.590
&gt;&gt;Howard Rheingold: Well you know, I would
phrase that question differently.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.620
But it's a really good question to start a
conversation.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.819
And I strongly believe that if you believe
that or fear that our use of social media

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:40.930
are making us shallow then why not teach more
people how to swim and explore the deep end

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.340
of the pool.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.340
Slight difference which I don't think is semantic,
which is I'm really a believer in human agency

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.900
and that technologies afford but don't compel
behavior.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.800
&gt;&gt;Mamie: Okay, so over the last 20 years you've
written 'Tools for Thought', 'Virtual Communities

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.459
Virtual Realities', 'Smart Mobs' why 'Net
Smart'?

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.620
&gt;&gt;Howard: Well I've thought about this a lot.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.890
I've been forced to think about it since I
wrote in 1985 about where were personal computers

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:18.320
going and 1993 about people socializing online.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.080
In 2002 about the combination of the mobile
phone and the Internet and the PC.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.470
And each point, the question arose either
from critics or from scholars or a question

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.850
that I ask myself which is, is this stuff
any good for us?

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:42.160
And I've concluded that the way you use a
search engine, the way you stream video from

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:49.000
a phone, the way you update your Facebook
status matters to you and to me and to everyone

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.400
because first of all these are the languages
that we need to know in order to succeed personally.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:04.160
But, the way we use these media today are
going to strongly influence the way they are

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.440
used and misused for decades to come.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.690
So I think you'll see that there is a theme
running through the book which I'm talking

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.130
about personal empowerment, but I'm also talking
about improving the commons.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.230
And I think that that is the way to improve
the commons.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.740
&gt;&gt;Mamie: So I know when you wrote Tools for
Thought, you were inspired by Doug Engelbart's

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.892
1962 Augmenting Human Intellect.

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:29.240
And I want to know, how do you respond to
that today?

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.160
Are we currently living in a future that he
envisioned?

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.030
&gt;&gt;Howard: Who here has read Doug Engelbart's
1962 paper?

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.050
Okay.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.050
It's worth rereading.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.880
I reread it just about every year.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.551
But you want to go look at it.

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:48.660
It was written in 1962 and everything that's
happening here really flowed from that paper.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.660
Literally.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:56.090
People talk about the mouse, which is actually
hypertext using text processing which became

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.250
word-processing.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:03.030
Mixing video and computer images.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.420
His laboratory was the first network information
Center for the ARPANET.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.760
So it's really kind of the root of the technology
we use today.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:17.140
And in that paper, he talks about humans using
language artifacts, methodology and training.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:24.890
I've talked to Doug over the years about this
and he notes the obvious which is that the

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.940
artifacts have multiplied multibillion fold.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:39.690
The first electronic digital computer used
less RAM than an icon does on a PC today.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:46.380
But the methodology and the training, maybe
less so the language, have not evolved so

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.380
much.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.910
And I think that this is a fundamental issue
of literacy that faces us every time we have

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:59.770
the technical capabilities to communicate,
to encode and decode information in new ways.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.550
&gt;&gt;Mamie: Great so you mentioned that literacy.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.570
And in Net Smart, you define five essential
literacies for thriving in the 21st-century.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:14.690
Attention, crap detection, participation,
collaboration and network smarts.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.240
And I definitely want to use this conversation
to explore each of those literacies.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.341
But first, what do you mean by literacy?

00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:25.610
And what's the difference between a literacy
and a skill?

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.610
[Pause]

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.180
&gt;&gt;Howard: Well I'm, I use the metaphor of
swimming at the beginning.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.610
If you're the only person in the world who
knows how to swim and you fall into deep water

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.890
it will serve you well.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.480
If you're the only person in the world who
knows how to ride a bicycle, you can still

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.880
get from place to place faster.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.940
If you're the only person in the world who
knows how to read and write, or the only person

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.410
who knows how to make a link on a webpage,
it's not gonna serve you that well.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:52.310
It's not gonna serve anybody else that well.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:58.530
So all of the literacies I talk about attention,
participation, collaboration, crap detection

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:03.370
and network know-how have to do with both
the skill of encoding and decoding.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:07.940
A fundamental alphabetic literacy and ability
to read and write.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:14.310
But beyond that individual skill, the ability
to use that skill in concert with others.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:21.100
There is a social connection to all of the
skills that we use not only with digital production

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:27.340
media, but with the digital networks that
propagate and communicate information.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:33.539
&gt;&gt;Mamie: And so why is attention the fundamental
literacy for and always on the world?

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:36.360
&gt;&gt;Howard: You know, I think I have a slide
here that's kind of interesting.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.370
Let me search through it.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:41.540
Oops, I don't have that slide.

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:50.930
I had a, I took a screen grab from that mall
surveillance camera that I'm sure you've all

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.930
seen this.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:56.770
It's had millions of hits on YouTube of the
young woman who fell into the fountain while

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.230
she was texting.

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:08.100
Pew Internet and American Life Studies have
surveyed Americans, and one in six have admitted

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.930
into running into something while looking
at their phone.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:15.910
And then of course there is what happens when
you're in a classroom.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:21.410
If you are professor in a classroom today,
you face students who are looking at their

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.410
laptops.

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.400
If you are a Googler in a meeting these days,
you are facing people who are looking at their

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.120
laptops.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:37.460
So attention is a fundamental building block
of how we think and communicate in any case.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.680
But the media that we carry with us these
days really affords distraction.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.280
And I really make the distinction; I don't
think that online media, social media compelled

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.390
distraction.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.390
But they afforded.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.810
And the difference of course is what we know,
and what we intend to do.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:10:01.960
&gt;&gt;Mamie: Hmm
And now, so in 2010 Eric Schmidt had this

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:07.960
crazy statistic that every two days humans
produce as much information as they did between

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:12.240
the era of cave paintings to 2003.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.920
And I know people including MG Siegler are
declaring e-mail bankruptcy.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:21.260
But this isn't the first time that humans
have suffered from information overload.

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.730
So I want to ask, how to we learn from history?

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:29.350
&gt;&gt;Howard: well firstly I'll quote Clay Shirky
who often says that there is no such thing

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.590
as information overload, it's just filter
failure.

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:39.680
And I will have to acknowledge, we all have
to acknowledge that Eric Schmidt's quote means

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.090
that the quantitative difference, and the
leap that we're taking today means a qualitative

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:46.090
difference.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:50.860
But when I was looking into this issue of
information overload in the book, I discovered

00:10:50.860 --> 00:11:02.860
that this is really not the first time that
we've dealt with new communication media exploding

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:03.860
dramatically.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.710
The amount of information that's available
to people.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:13.690
That little clay tablet there is one of the
artifacts that led Denise Schmandt-Besserat

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.510
to figure out where writing came from.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:20.820
Writing was originally about accounting, but
it was later exapted to use to encode other

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:21.870
kinds of knowledge.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:29.190
And I think that idea of exaptation that humans
tend to do both biologically and intellectually.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:35.760
To adapt something that was involved or invented
for one purpose to serve another purpose will

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.500
serve us well.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:44.040
The idea of information overload goes at least
back to the fourth century BC with Ecclesiastes.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:50.990
We also saw in the wake of the Gutenberg revolution,
this quote from Adrien Baillet, "The multitude

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:54.910
of books which grows every day in a prodigious
fashion will make the following centuries

00:11:54.910 --> 00:12:00.481
fall into a state as barbarous as that of
the centuries that followed the fall of the

00:12:00.481 --> 00:12:01.481
Roman Empire."

00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:05.760
Then of course there was Vannevar Bush's 1945
article, 'As We May Think' in which he noted

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.070
that the summation of human experience is
being expanded at a prodigious rate, but the

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:14.880
means we use for threading through the consequent
maze to momentarily important items is the

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.870
same as was used in the days of square rigged
ships.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:24.000
This article of course was an inspiration
to Doug Engelbart and others.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:33.060
Every time a new communication information
technology makes a flood of information available,

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.529
people have responded to that by inventing
new ways to cope with it.

00:12:37.529 --> 00:12:48.860
So when scribes hand wrote texts, we got libraries
and we got schools and we got scholars.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.180
The first schools are really to teach people
how to read and write.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:59.660
And of course the priesthood controlled who
had access to that literacy.

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.060
And the printing press really broke that open.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.610
Too much printed information led to many,
many things that we take for granted every

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.610
day.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:14.260
Alphabetization, indexes, subject headings,
authors, critics, editors.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:21.730
A whole ecosystem of human and technical means
for dealing with information emerge from that.

00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:27.400
Now this is a picture of Engelbart talking
about humans using language artifacts methodology

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.779
and training during the mother of all demos.

00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:34.820
&gt;&gt;Mamie: And you've coined terms like virtual
communities and smart mobs.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:40.530
And the word that seems to be defined in Net
Smart is info tension, so what do you mean.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:45.120
&gt;&gt;Howard: Well when I talk about attention,
I'll talk about learning to manage our attention.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.210
Maybe we'll get back to that in a little bit.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:48.210
&gt;&gt;Mamie: Yeah

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.880
&gt;&gt;Howard: But I think, in particular, for
us, for people in this room.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:57.050
Managing the way we pay attention to information
is particularly important.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:14:01.920
And I've looked at ways in which we could
do that.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.620
And I think it comes into really two different
categories.

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:10.970
But it comes down to developing a sense of
mindfulness.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.000
Of how we are deploying our attention from
time to time.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:20.500
And I'm sure that all of you are to some degree
experts in a way that many of my students

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.500
and others I speak to are not.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:29.620
Mindfulness means being aware of the content
of your consciousness at the moment.

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:31.279
What are you paying attention to?

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:33.410
That sounds a little spiritual.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:38.190
You can look at metacognition there's a good
Wikipedia entry about that.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:44.370
Metacognition expands out a little bit to
say that not only is this a skill a learnable

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.820
skill for recognizing where you are deploying
your attention.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.910
Developing an awareness of how you're using
your awareness.

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:58.029
But it also means knowing what all of the
different tools in your consciousness toolbox

00:14:58.029 --> 00:14:59.029
are.

00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:05.860
Focused attention, diffused attention, abstraction
and analysis.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.710
Picking out the one that's useful for the
moment.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:15.330
And I think that a lot of what click trances
about a lot of what people fear with distraction

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:21.480
online has to do with a lack of decision-making
about how you're going to spend your attention

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.480
from moment to moment.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:23.970
&gt;&gt;Mamie: So attention can be trained?

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.529
&gt;&gt;Howard: I think so and I've worked on it
with my students.

00:15:26.529 --> 00:15:28.050
I worked on it with myself.

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:30.399
I shared some of it with you.

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:36.680
I divide that into the cognitive part, and
the part that has to do with how you arrange

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.990
your information tools.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:44.310
Because we all need to make decisions on a
second by second, or microsecond by microsecond

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.310
basis.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:46.990
What are you going to pay attention to?

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:54.839
There is that, if it wasn't for the fact that
it was easy to change our attention from what

00:15:54.839 --> 00:16:00.470
we think we're supposed to be doing we would
not have to preponderance of cute cat videos.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.360
You will click on that link.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.750
You will look at that video.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:11.440
You will see the little red badge that tells
you you've got more e-mail or that tells you

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.690
that there's an update in Facebook or G+.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:19.160
And you're attracted to it without thinking
about it.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:24.340
So the first part of this training is to try
to make those decisions more deliberately.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.230
And at first, that's slow.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:29.650
Sometimes you open a tab, you're gonna check
it out later.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:33.990
Sometimes you tag it, bookmark it because
you may not check it out later but when you

00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:39.580
want to look for it you will be able to find
it more easily.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:46.640
So a method of training, that part of it has
to do with matching your attention to the

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.529
way your tools look on the screen.

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:51.040
And I'll get back to that and show you that.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:58.010
I developed this from what I learned from
Professor BJ Fogg at Stanford.

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.960
Who's got a course on developing new habits.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:05.100
And he says start small, find a place for
it and repeat.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:14.209
So I guess I don't have that other slide there,
but what I do is write down at the beginning

00:17:14.209 --> 00:17:22.100
of the day good old right brained hand writing
on a piece of 3 x 5 card maybe six or seven

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:23.100
words.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:24.770
What are my two or three goals for the day?

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.689
Sometimes there are no particular goals.

00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:28.740
I don't have a deadline.

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:33.360
Following each link where it leads is what
I'm supposed to do.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.990
That's I discover things.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:38.880
Some days I've done a deadline, I've got a
get a certain amount of words written by the

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:39.920
end of the day.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:46.790
So I put that piece of paper in the periphery
of my attention and when my eyesight wanders,

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:52.480
it catches sight of that and I ask myself
what am I paying attention to right now?

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.140
And is that going to get me any closer to
where I'm going?

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:58.490
I actually learned this technique when I was
trying to learn how to do lucid dreaming.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.580
Lucid dreaming is when you realize you're
in a dream and you begin directing the action.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.910
The way you learn to do lucid dreaming is
you write 'am I awake' on a little piece of

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:07.910
paper.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:11.860
You put in your pocket and you take it out
once an hour and you just develop the habit.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:14.980
Eventually you do that in a dream and you
do a little reality test--

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:15.980
&gt;&gt;Audience: [Laughter]

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:16.980
&gt;&gt;Howard: find out.

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.140
But the best way to do it is to try to fly
and if you can fly you're pretty much assured—

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.140
&gt;&gt;Mamie: [Laughing]
That you're dreaming.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.140
&gt;&gt;Audience: [Laughter]

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.140
&gt;&gt;Howard: You're in a dream.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:29.040
You know I think that the same thing applies
to metacognition of attention online.

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:35.180
In that putting this piece of paper in the
periphery of my vision is not meant to police

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:39.930
me, but to develop a kind of inner observer
that becomes aware of how I'm paying my attention.

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.930
What I'm paying attention to.

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:41.930
&gt;&gt;Mamie: Hmm.

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.650
So I know that you turn to Dana Voight often.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:50.410
And in this month's issue of 'Brown Alumni
Magazine', she's quoted as saying, "the goal

00:18:50.410 --> 00:18:56.510
is to be peripherally aware of information
as it flows by, grabbing it at the right moment

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:00.590
when it is most relevant and valuable entertaining
or insightful."

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:03.150
And that really resonated with me as I read
your book.

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:05.600
And so how do your literacies enable us to
do that?

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:12.260
&gt;&gt;Howard: You know I've discovered this when
I assign my students to follow Twitter and

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.000
to create some RSS feeds.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
And I came back the next week and they were
all panicked because they couldn't possibly

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000
keep up with it.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.210
And I realize that I had forgotten to frame
it with what I know, and what probably all

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:31.429
of you know which is that this is not a queue,
it's a stream.

00:19:31.429 --> 00:19:34.720
You don't need to check each thing off like
a to-do list.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.720
You can't.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.250
You learn how to sample the stream.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:41.650
You look at--
And a lot of the importance of RSS enables

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.450
you to scan headlines.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.530
Or when you search, you get snippets.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:55.130
So there are informational cues there in the,
our dashboards that we need to be able to

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.510
use more effectively.

00:19:56.510 --> 00:20:02.980
&gt;&gt;Mamie: So once we are aware of what information
we are paying attention to, we need to validate

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:05.360
and verify and filter that information.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.049
So tell us how can we all tune our internal
crap detectors?

00:20:10.049 --> 00:20:17.240
&gt;&gt;Howard: So politely you can call this critical
consumption of information.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.490
Hemingway used the term crap detectors.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:23.980
He said every good journalist needs an internal
crap detector.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:29.150
So I looked into the research on how people
search.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:33.350
I'm sorry Dan Russell isn't here, he was one
of the sources for the book.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:38.010
And I talked to Dan Russell, the search scientist
here.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.400
I looked at a lot of the research particularly
on how young people search.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.299
There's an extraordinarily large number of
young people who believe if it's on Google,

00:20:47.299 --> 00:20:48.920
it must be true.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:55.400
Of course when Mamie first started using search
engines, Google didn't exist it was AltaVista

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.100
and Infoseek.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.820
I used MartinLutherKing.org.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.470
Is everybody here aware, anybody here aware
of MartinLutherKing.org.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.540
Have you ever heard of it before?

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:11.679
It's a good site to train people.

00:21:11.679 --> 00:21:18.050
So it's one, two, third, it's the fourth hit
down on Google the last time I checked.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:22.210
It's called Martin Luther King Jr.: a true
historical examination.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.620
And it looks like a website about the civil
rights leader.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:31.870
If you look at the articles though it takes
a really pretty radically dim view of Martin

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.490
Luther King Jr.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.520
And there is an author here so when Mamie
said, "Well how do I know what's true and

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.520
what's not?"

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:42.530
I said, "Well you know, this is, you happen
to come along at a very unusual time.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:48.740
For the last thousand years, the authority
was vested in the text.

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.840
You could take the book out of the library.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.540
And you might disagree with this, it might
even be wrong.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:58.760
But for the most part given that there was
an author, editor and publisher who try to

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.350
check some of the facts in it.

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.660
Or the truth claims in it."

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:07.270
Of course you put a term into a search engine,
there's no guarantee that what you get back

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.220
is going to the good information.

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:13.360
So one thing to do is look for an author,
and search on that author's name.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.370
Which we were able to do here.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:17.520
But we couldn't find an author for the site
itself.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.820
So I told Mamie about WHOis.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.760
Tell my students about WHOis.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:29.040
Of course if you put MartinLutherKing.org
into WHOis it shows you someone by the name

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.260
of Don Black at Stormfront.org which turns
out to be a neo-Nazi community.

00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.280
This is what's known as a cloaked site.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:43.940
So I've developed a whole collection of sites
that I've shown to students to show them that

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.570
not everything you see online is for real.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:50.330
The free online pregnancy test was a lot scarier
at first.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:54.080
They didn't really clue you in to it being
a joke.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.290
Now they do.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:23:00.720
But if you enter a name and click on start
pregnancy test a little flash animation comes

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:05.830
up and says sit still while we scan you.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.140
I entered the name Joe, turns out that Joe
is with child.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.140
&gt;&gt;Audience: [Laughter]

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:15.040
&gt;&gt;Howard: I couldn't help but click on the
next one to find out that it's a girl of course.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.390
Then I ask "Who's the daddy?"

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.390
&gt;&gt;Audience: [Laughter]

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.320
&gt;&gt;Howard: and if you don't like that, you
can choose another one.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.660
But by this point you've probably figured
out that it's a hoax.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.030
But there are lots of sites like, this one
looks perfectly legitimate.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.820
Nicely designed website.

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.600
This is about a primate, a mandrel that's
been trained to understand English and respond

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.110
with the keyboard.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:36.780
Totally nonexistent.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.320
A lot of teachers use this one.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.780
There's the endangered Pacific Northwest tree
octopus a completely nonexistent species.

00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:50.110
So in the book I go into a lot of detail about
this, particularly when you're talking about

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:54.140
medical information, Googling your symptoms.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:59.049
There are tools that we can use to find out
whether the advice we're gonna get is gonna

00:23:59.049 --> 00:24:01.020
kill us or help cure us.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:05.100
But I think we have to start by thinking like
a journalist or thinking like a detective.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.390
And not assuming anything, and looking for
clues.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:13.860
I think searching to learn is very important
if you, not just looking for where's the nearest

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:14.860
pizza joint.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:20.500
You're trying to learn about something, don't
just stop at the first page of results.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:24.799
Look at the snippets that you get and refine
your search from what you see in the snippets.

00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:27.380
They often teach you about that.

00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:32.320
Look for authors and search on their names
and triangulate like any good journalist does.

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:38.490
I remember being online when a rumor came
across on Twitter that Egypt had shut down

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:40.080
Internet access.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.860
Which comes under the category of interesting
if true.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.320
But there was nothing on Al Jazeera, there
was nothing on CNN, there was nothing on BBC.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.950
So I put out an inquiry on Twitter about if
anybody could give me information that would

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.820
help me verify that.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:25:01.740
One person reminded me that someone I do know
is in touch with people in the Middle East

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.610
and was talking on the phone to someone in
Egypt.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.929
And I direct messaged them and he verified
it.

00:25:08.929 --> 00:25:10.419
Someone reminded me of Ping.

00:25:10.419 --> 00:25:14.679
I tried some websites in Egypt and they were
down.

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:17.590
Finally I saw a news report online.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:24.130
So with three, I was confident that I could
pass this information along without it being

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:26.090
a false rumor.

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.549
Not long before or after that was the Haitian
earthquake.

00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:33.890
And there was a rumor that also went around
on Twitter that if you texted a certain phone

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:38.480
number it would send money to send medical
personnel to Haiti.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.620
And that turned out to be a cruel hoax.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:47.550
So I think it's important for people to triangulate,
to crap detect themselves before they pass

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.610
information along.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:54.420
And I think also you probably heard Ellie
Pariser spoke here; speak here about the filter

00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.420
bubble.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:26:01.049
And some years ago there was Cass Sunstein
who wrote in the 'Daily We' about his fear

00:26:01.049 --> 00:26:05.679
that now that we can roll our own news we're
going to be paying more and more attention

00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:08.080
to sources that we agree with.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.450
And a lot of the social psychologist research
shows that groups of people who are more homogeneous

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:17.860
in opinion tend to make more radical decisions.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:24.480
So I make it, I make sure that there is someone
in my personal learning network whose blog

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.700
I follow or who I follow on Twitter or otherwise
pay attention to regularly.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:34.809
Someone who's intelligent and knowledgeable
but with whom I disagree strongly about a

00:26:34.809 --> 00:26:35.809
number of things.

00:26:35.809 --> 00:26:40.820
So if nobody in your network annoys you maybe
you're in an echo chamber.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:47.350
So I think we're really talking about a combination
of algorithmic social and cognitive tools

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.690
we need to use.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.330
This is not rocket science, it's not even
learning the multiplication tables.

00:26:52.330 --> 00:26:56.890
It's just that this has happened so fast,
you're not taught how to search and how to

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.760
crap detect in school before you do it.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.169
&gt;&gt;Mamie: And because you brought up search,
I just want, one question I want this audience

00:27:04.169 --> 00:27:10.500
to think about is it our responsibility not
only to give people answers but to teach them

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.770
how to ask the right questions?

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.570
And how to verify those answers.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.870
So something to think about.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.500
And you brought up news and journalism.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.450
And we do all have these broadcasting tools
in our pocket.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.240
So does that make us all journalist?

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.130
&gt;&gt;Howard: Well you know one of the things
I wrote in 'Smart Mobs' is that it's not hard

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:36.470
to predict that any day now there will be
a world changing news event that will be streamed

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.340
or sent directly to the Internet from someone's
phone.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:48.740
And I think the first real worldwide one was
the July 2007 tube bombing in London where

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.960
there is a very blurry picture from someone's
phone that was sent from there.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.500
So we now have hundreds of millions of reporters.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.440
And I would say that that's a great thing.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:05.100
And that we now are able to crowd source information
that you wouldn't be able to get a reporter

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.720
on-site to before.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:15.049
I think that if you take reports and you look
for ways to verify those reports you find

00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:18.059
what are the different points of view about
this report.

00:28:18.059 --> 00:28:20.810
Can I find a spokesperson for the different
points of view?

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:27.330
Can I put that all together into a short compelling
narrative that people are going to want to

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.290
pay attention to?

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:33.210
That's what journalists have always done whether
they were working with pencils and papers,

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.120
whether they were working with search engines
and smart phones.

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:41.919
And I think the difference between a reporter
and a journalist does have to do with that

00:28:41.919 --> 00:28:44.970
set of procedures that they do.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.630
Can more people do that kind of journalism?

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:48.630
Absolutely.

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:57.240
I don't think that we want to classify having
the ability to take a picture or stream video

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.440
as being a journalist.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.660
I think, you are reporting on something.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:07.910
&gt;&gt;Mamie: Hmm, so there is a theme throughout
the book that a firm grasp of these literacies

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:13.120
will allow you to multiply the value of a
public good, while also serving your own self-interest.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:19.340
And this is connected to what Tim O'Reilly
calls the architectures of participation.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.250
So tell us more about that—

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.250
&gt;&gt;Howard: I was—

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:23.250
&gt;&gt;Mamie: What does that mean?

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.380
&gt;&gt;Howard: I was struck by architectures of
participation when I wrote 'Smart Mobs'.

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:33.010
Because we've always used communication media
to do things together in new ways, whether

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:37.270
that's writing or print or the telephone.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:42.669
The particular architecture of the Internet
allows us to do things that weren't really

00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:43.800
possible before.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:52.830
I think, well obviously Google is billed both
on attention and in architecture of participation.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:57.800
If millions of people did not put links on
their website, you wouldn't have page rank.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:05.760
But essentially what page rank is doing is
it's taking that human judgment, that attention

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.730
that a blogger or anybody else puts a link
on the webpage.

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:12.830
They're saying if you're paying attention
to me you should pay attention to this.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:19.870
So add in the secret sauce of the formula
that attention aggregated becomes a very valuable

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.870
public good.

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.309
I don't think people appreciate what a miracle
free search is.

00:30:24.309 --> 00:30:27.240
And of course it's not free, were paying with
our attention.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:32.150
And you make some very good money by selling
that attention to advertisers.

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.430
And another great example was Napster.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:38.580
When Napster first came out, people didn't
download music from a server they downloaded

00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:44.289
music from other Napster users that had the
music on their PCs.

00:30:44.289 --> 00:30:50.120
By default the folder that you download all
your music to on Napster is open to everyone

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.930
else who's on Napster at that moment for them
to download.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:31:01.059
So this is a unique situation in which a population
is able to provision a resource, and the act

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:02.200
of consuming it.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:03.380
And I think that that is new.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.690
And it is afforded by the architecture of
participation.

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:12.000
Corrie Doctorow calls this in reference to
the tragedy of the comments problem, sheep

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.559
that shit grass.

00:31:13.559 --> 00:31:21.090
So I think that we are seeing a lot of different
ways that people are able to use online platforms

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.680
to coordinate all kinds of collective action.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.330
And that architectures of participation taken
together with our knowledge of how to use

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.309
them is going to enable us to do things that
are even more fantastic than what we're able

00:31:32.309 --> 00:31:33.309
to do now.

00:31:33.309 --> 00:31:35.809
&gt;&gt;Mamie: So what are the different forms of
participation?

00:31:35.809 --> 00:31:41.410
&gt;&gt;Howard: So participation, you know, there
are a jillion ways to participate.

00:31:41.410 --> 00:31:50.080
I just noted a few examples to draw these
people's attention to the importance of knowing

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.790
how to participate.

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:58.620
There was a Harry Potter website that was
shut down by Warner Bros. a few years ago.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:06.140
And Heather Lawver organized a worldwide boycott
of Warner Bros. and had the Warner Bros. lawyers

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:13.170
back off their injunction before they found
out that she was 16 years old.

00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:18.789
Bev Harris was a pretty obscure blogger before
she found the source code for the Diebold

00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:22.820
voting machines online, and circulated that.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.150
Some students at Swarthmore put it up on the
Swarthmore server.

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:31.180
They were sued by Diebold and federal court
found that Americans do have the right to

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.350
know how their voting machines work.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:40.460
She was an obscure blogger, she wasn't very
obscure for very long, that climbed the power

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:45.080
law curve to the A-list bloggers very quickly.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:51.610
You all know who this is, and there's a certain
amount of controversy about the role of social

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:57.140
media in the Middle East and North Africa
and what's sometimes called Arab spring.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.850
But there's no doubt that it played an essential
role.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:06.080
So talking about people who start multibillion
dollar industries when they're 19 or 20 or

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.520
21 years old.

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.650
I emphasize the youth of all these people
simply to emphasize that this new literacy,

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:19.350
the ability to know how to participate can
lead to real economic and political and cultural

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:20.350
power.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.059
We've got a huge number of ways to participate.

00:33:22.059 --> 00:33:28.240
And I love Ross Mayfield's power law of participation
in which he plots a threshold with a tool.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:33.540
How easy is it to do with the degree of engagement
of the community?

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:38.610
And you can start out by, if you are yet another
reader of somebody's blog or another follower

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.049
of them on Twitter.

00:33:40.049 --> 00:33:43.500
You're kind of adding to their installed attention
base.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:48.310
But you can plus things, you can like things,
you can begin tagging and commenting.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:53.860
You can climb that curve, and by the time
that you climb that curve you are engaged

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:58.679
in a lot of pretty sophisticated ways of participating
online.

00:33:58.679 --> 00:34:01.400
I call one out here.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.490
I talk about in my talks.

00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:07.460
In the book I get into a lot of detail about
the different ways of participation.

00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:14.960
But curation I think is a very easy lightweight
way for people to participate in filtering

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.529
the web for each other.

00:34:16.529 --> 00:34:19.259
Crap detection of course only eliminates the
bad stuff.

00:34:19.259 --> 00:34:22.499
How do we float the good stuff up to the top?

00:34:22.499 --> 00:34:24.710
And so page rank is one way to do it.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:27.990
But also socially, were beginning to curate
with each other.

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:32.229
And I know that Google is getting with that
idea as well.

00:34:32.229 --> 00:34:35.369
And we've got all kinds of platforms that
are popping up.

00:34:35.369 --> 00:34:37.659
Most people have heard of Pinterest.

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:44.169
But there's also Scoop.it, Pearltrees, Storify.

00:34:44.169 --> 00:34:46.539
This seems like a natural for Google.

00:34:46.539 --> 00:34:52.599
It seems to me that curation is a fundamental
literacy that is spreading through the population

00:34:52.599 --> 00:34:53.839
very quickly.

00:34:53.839 --> 00:34:58.910
So benefits, we all need to transform information
overload into useful knowledge.

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.779
We need to make those decisions about the
utility of all the information that comes

00:35:02.779 --> 00:35:04.249
across.

00:35:04.249 --> 00:35:10.869
The architecture of participation means that
there is no additional cost to make your decision,

00:35:10.869 --> 00:35:12.609
your private decision public.

00:35:12.609 --> 00:35:18.069
And in open-source programming it's called
scratching an itch.

00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:22.729
When a new printer is created and there's
no driver for it and you might as well write

00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:23.729
it yourself.

00:35:23.729 --> 00:35:28.009
You might as also contribute that to the public
code base.

00:35:28.009 --> 00:35:32.890
Not only are you signaling that you are a
person worth collaborating with, cooperating

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:33.890
with.

00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.190
But you are recruiting a team so that when
they change the hardware and that printer

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:39.789
you've got some people to help you change
that.

00:35:39.789 --> 00:35:43.880
So self-interest that adds up to a public
good.

00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.410
Again this is something that echoes a lot
in the book.

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:51.529
If you want to establish a reputation of knowing
which are talking about a subject then every

00:35:51.529 --> 00:35:55.849
day tell people I've looked at 100 different
websites.

00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:59.650
And if you are interested in this particular
niche these are the five that you ought to

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.269
pay attention to.

00:36:01.269 --> 00:36:04.410
If they are interested in that subject, they
will know whether you know what you're talking

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.329
about and spread the word.

00:36:06.329 --> 00:36:10.869
In fact I think this is like personal search
engine optimization.

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:17.180
If you are curating topics that you feel you
have some expertise on, people who are looking

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.759
for information on that topic, people who
are looking for experts, are going to find

00:36:20.759 --> 00:36:23.800
you that way.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:27.079
Now of course we've got knowledge sharing
as a form of participation.

00:36:27.079 --> 00:36:29.989
You've got stack overflow.

00:36:29.989 --> 00:36:32.170
You've got Quora.

00:36:32.170 --> 00:36:37.390
I think we are only just beginning to see
the different ways that people can participate.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:45.039
And Henry Jenkins calls the aggregation of
a sufficient number of knowledgeable participators

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:46.039
"participatory culture."

00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:53.219
It makes the point that a person who sees
themself as a passive consumer culture as

00:36:53.219 --> 00:36:59.019
a difference since of agency as a citizen
than someone who sees himself in however small

00:36:59.019 --> 00:37:02.270
a way as a producer of culture.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.400
Whether it's just that they're tagging or
commenting.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:08.369
And we've got a jillion different ways to
participate.

00:37:08.369 --> 00:37:11.119
And a new one coming up every day.

00:37:11.119 --> 00:37:17.779
So I think the proliferation of literacies
about different ways of participating are

00:37:17.779 --> 00:37:23.180
enabling people to make their own way personally
and professionally more effectively.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:27.499
But in the aggregate, they're adding up to
things that are useful to all of us.

00:37:27.499 --> 00:37:33.059
&gt;&gt;Mamie: So moving onto the next literacy,
I want to know how your thoughts about collaboration

00:37:33.059 --> 00:37:37.029
changed and evolved since Smart Mobs.

00:37:37.029 --> 00:37:43.789
&gt;&gt;Howard: So, well I've been thinking about
this since 1987 when I wrote about virtual

00:37:43.789 --> 00:37:44.789
communities.

00:37:44.789 --> 00:37:45.789
&gt;&gt;.Mamie: Hmm

00:37:45.789 --> 00:37:49.489
&gt;&gt;Howard: It was very exciting to me that
I could sit in my room which I'd been doing

00:37:49.489 --> 00:37:54.589
with a typewriter for years and communicate
with other people and share knowledge with

00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:55.589
other people.

00:37:55.589 --> 00:38:00.369
So now the forms of collaboration.

00:38:00.369 --> 00:38:01.690
Of collective action.

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:02.690
Of cooperation.

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:04.489
And there's slightly different definitions—

00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:05.489
&gt;&gt;Mamie: Yeah.

00:38:05.489 --> 00:38:07.079
&gt;&gt;Howard: for each of those.

00:38:07.079 --> 00:38:08.079
Are proliferating.

00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:12.640
And I think this is probably the most powerful
aspect of the cultural revolution we are going

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:14.200
through now.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:19.869
Just as the invention of speech was an extremely
powerful cultural revolution.

00:38:19.869 --> 00:38:23.259
The invention of writing was an extremely
powerful revolution.

00:38:23.259 --> 00:38:27.690
It was what literate people did with those
tools.

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:32.650
They invented civilization and democracy and
science.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.880
So I wrote about smart mobs 10 years ago.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.089
This picture was from Chile.

00:38:37.089 --> 00:38:42.109
When I went to Chile and talked about smart
mobs there, they said "Oh yes the Penguin

00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:43.109
Revolution."

00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:46.640
Students in Chile wear black and white and
gray uniform so they called them penguins.

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:52.170
They objected to the very poor funding of
public education in Chile by chaining this

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:56.630
schools shot and hitting the streets with
700,000 other Chileans.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:04.950
They are still leading a very active dialogue
about the role of education in that country.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:08.270
And of course we're seeing Arab Spring; we're
seeing Occupy Wall Street.

00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:13.339
All kinds of ways that people are able to
organize collective action with people they

00:39:13.339 --> 00:39:16.200
weren't able to organize with before.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:20.799
And at speeds and at scales and in places
they weren't able to organize before.

00:39:20.799 --> 00:39:22.779
And this is only beginning to play out.

00:39:22.779 --> 00:39:26.519
So, as I said I wrote about virtual communities
in 1987.

00:39:26.519 --> 00:39:35.280
It was pretty obscure then; in fact it took
me till 1992 to talk a publisher into backing

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:36.960
a book on this.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:42.319
I was told only electrical engineers will
want to use computers to communicate with.

00:39:42.319 --> 00:39:47.230
So it's kind of hard in retrospect to see
how odd it was to do that.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:54.400
But nowadays, whether you are a gamer or you
are a cancer patient you are probably connecting

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:59.619
with people that you didn't know before and
may never meet face-to-face, but who play

00:39:59.619 --> 00:40:01.749
a very important role in your life.

00:40:01.749 --> 00:40:05.740
Of course now we've got distributed computations
started with SETI@Home.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.069
I usually need to explain this to people—

00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:09.770
&gt;&gt;Mamie: Not this one, yes.

00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:12.510
&gt;&gt;Howard: but don't need to explain it here.

00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:13.510
Folding.stanford.edu.

00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:22.190
People can, in fact very recently Foldit the
game based on folding it home has enabled

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:29.769
a group of gamers to solve an important puzzle
about the way protease, the enzyme protease,

00:40:29.769 --> 00:40:32.309
very important in HIV research.

00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:37.140
There was a problem about how it folds that
had not been solved before gamers did that

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.859
using distributed computation.

00:40:38.859 --> 00:40:45.229
So we all know that in a few years most of
the human population will be walking around

00:40:45.229 --> 00:40:54.749
carrying or wearing supercomputers linked
at speeds much greater than we consider to

00:40:54.749 --> 00:40:55.749
be broadband today.

00:40:55.749 --> 00:40:59.089
So what kind of computation are we going to
be able to do voluntarily?

00:40:59.089 --> 00:41:06.260
You know when SETI@Home first started, they
were at some point the most powerful supercomputer

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.260
in the world.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.260
19 teraflops.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:11.180
And this was maybe close to a decade ago.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.989
Now we've got crowd sourcing.

00:41:12.989 --> 00:41:18.619
Who here knew Jim Gray, or knows the Jim Gray's
story?

00:41:18.619 --> 00:41:21.640
So I will just briefly repeat it.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:27.099
Jim Gray was a computer scientist at Microsoft
research working on distributed computation.

00:41:27.099 --> 00:41:32.219
And since he was working on that, he had a
lot of friends in the industry.

00:41:32.219 --> 00:41:38.049
He took his sailboat out one day in San Francisco
Bay a couple years ago and did not return

00:41:38.049 --> 00:41:39.049
that evening.

00:41:39.049 --> 00:41:44.319
His friends got the latest satellite photographs
from NASA from Google.

00:41:44.319 --> 00:41:48.970
And Microsoft engineers cut up into half 1
million different images.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.369
An Amazon put it up on Mechanical Turk.

00:41:51.369 --> 00:41:56.230
Got a couple of thousand volunteers to search
3500 square miles of ocean.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:58.229
They did not find Jim Gray.

00:41:58.229 --> 00:42:02.749
But what was particularly interesting to me
about it was that people put this together

00:42:02.749 --> 00:42:07.410
with ad hoc tools within hours of Jim Gray
being reported missing.

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:13.240
So crowd sourcing is not just about a business
getting its customers to do work for them.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:18.470
It's about any way that you can cut a task
up into a lot of small pieces and somehow

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:22.170
induce a population to engage in it.

00:42:22.170 --> 00:42:26.099
Now we've got crowd funding with this jobs
act.

00:42:26.099 --> 00:42:34.799
The SEC has now made it legal for startups
to take up to $2 million in kick starter type

00:42:34.799 --> 00:42:36.289
funding.

00:42:36.289 --> 00:42:38.869
Now we're hearing talk of collaborative consumption.

00:42:38.869 --> 00:42:42.349
There's a book about collaborative consumption.

00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:44.559
Probably a lot of you have used airbnb.

00:42:44.559 --> 00:42:47.470
The ability to share your apartment, share
your automobile.

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:51.529
These are all things that people weren't able
to do before because we weren't able to find

00:42:51.529 --> 00:42:54.619
out where's the nearest one and when's it
available.

00:42:54.619 --> 00:43:00.319
So again this architecture of participation
as it becomes more sophisticated, more location

00:43:00.319 --> 00:43:05.779
aware, more time aware, it enables people
to build on those platforms more things that

00:43:05.779 --> 00:43:07.359
they can do together.

00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:12.819
And of course collective intelligence, Wikipedia
is not the end of this.

00:43:12.819 --> 00:43:18.190
Any time that people can put a small piece
of the puzzle together and have that add up

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:22.759
to something that makes sense to a lot of
people I think is really important.

00:43:22.759 --> 00:43:28.510
And now we are seeing with You2Me and Khan
Academy and P2PU.

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:34.130
There are actually dozens of these platforms
for people to learn with each other.

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:40.430
You know you've, we've never had the ability
before to find out how to do things instantaneously.

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:47.950
You can learn how to configure a Drupal installation
or tie your shoes on YouTube.

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.880
Nowadays people are using those things to
learn cooperatively.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:53.630
And I think we're really just at the beginning
of that.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:56.959
All of these involve a certain know how.

00:43:56.959 --> 00:44:02.980
And people who have that know-how will be
able to summon these resources more effectively

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:04.289
than people who don't.

00:44:04.289 --> 00:44:07.789
&gt;&gt;Mamie: So jumping ahead to the last literacy.

00:44:07.789 --> 00:44:08.789
&gt;&gt;Howard: Yeah.

00:44:08.789 --> 00:44:12.779
&gt;&gt;Mamie: What does it mean to be a networked
individual and why are networks important?

00:44:12.779 --> 00:44:19.420
&gt;&gt;Howard: Well you know a lot of the terms
about network awareness.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:23.569
And a lot of the little pieces of lore come
from different disciplines.

00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:29.599
So there's people in sociology and a network
science.

00:44:29.599 --> 00:44:31.069
So network science is a new one.

00:44:31.069 --> 00:44:32.460
So we've learned about small worlds.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.920
We've learn about the power law.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.020
We've learned about the long tail.

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:39.630
These all have applications in many different
fields.

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:44.319
Biology and chemistry and astrophysics.

00:44:44.319 --> 00:44:51.250
But the lesson for everybody is that the structure
of networks influences the kinds of behavior

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:53.130
that can take place in those networks.

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:58.519
And the person who knows how a small world
network works is going to be more effective

00:44:58.519 --> 00:45:00.109
online.

00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:04.779
A lot of the ideas like the presentation of
self, Erving Goffman wrote about this decades

00:45:04.779 --> 00:45:06.619
before the Internet existed.

00:45:06.619 --> 00:45:10.599
We all give information to others about who
we want them to think we are.

00:45:10.599 --> 00:45:15.411
We all give off information to others about
that they are able to detect about who they

00:45:15.411 --> 00:45:17.559
think we are.

00:45:17.559 --> 00:45:26.059
A lot of these ideas about identity and individual
is network individualism moves from the kind

00:45:26.059 --> 00:45:32.900
of community centric era of the virtual community
where you found people who were sharing a,

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:37.109
their interest in a particular subject they
connected with the individuals.

00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:39.279
Now of course we carry our networks in our
pocket.

00:45:39.279 --> 00:45:44.180
We're able to summon our social networks and
were at the center of our social network.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.180
And they're intersecting.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:52.339
There's a difference between a group with
sociologists say is densely knit.

00:45:52.339 --> 00:45:55.309
Most of the people in the group know each
other and is tightly bound.

00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:58.109
There are very few connections with the outside
world.

00:45:58.109 --> 00:46:06.369
And a network which is sparsely knit there
are a lot of people in my network and in your

00:46:06.369 --> 00:46:08.709
network who don't know each other.

00:46:08.709 --> 00:46:09.749
And it's loosely bound.

00:46:09.749 --> 00:46:14.819
There are people from outside the network,
in fact that's how a small world network happens.

00:46:14.819 --> 00:46:16.720
A small number of connections in Italy.

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:23.369
If I know someone in Italy, I get information
to them much, much faster just that way.

00:46:23.369 --> 00:46:27.599
So a lot of these ideas that sociologists
have been looking at.

00:46:27.599 --> 00:46:30.660
Social capital is a particularly useful one.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:38.529
The idea that people can get things done together
outside the formal institutions of contracts

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:39.529
or laws.

00:46:39.529 --> 00:46:40.529
How do they do that?

00:46:40.529 --> 00:46:45.420
Well there's bridging capital, there's bonding
capital and there is reciprocity.

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:49.681
One of the things I discovered looking at
the sociology of reciprocity is that there

00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:54.920
is empirical research that shows that the
probability that someone will offer you help

00:46:54.920 --> 00:47:01.109
online is most strongly predicted by whether
you have offered help to others online.

00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:07.019
So I think, as I said this is not rocket science
or algebra but if you learn about the ways

00:47:07.019 --> 00:47:10.440
this strong ties and weak ties are important
to people.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:16.880
If you learn the way that social media and
viral media are adding up to what Manuel Castells

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.549
is calling a networked society.

00:47:18.549 --> 00:47:25.219
He has said with a lot of empirical backup
that it's not really accurate to say were

00:47:25.219 --> 00:47:26.239
in an information society.

00:47:26.239 --> 00:47:32.140
We are in a networked society and we've always
been involved in social networks.

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:38.769
But the technical network that connects us
today amplified that innate human sociology

00:47:38.769 --> 00:47:43.229
in ways that make all kinds of things that
used to be impossible possible.

00:47:43.229 --> 00:47:48.400
Networked publics and the connections between
these I think make for someone who's got network

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.400
know-how.

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:52.819
&gt;&gt;Mamie: So before we turn it over to Googlers.

00:47:52.819 --> 00:47:55.349
You know these are the people who are building
these tools.

00:47:55.349 --> 00:48:00.720
So I wanted to give you a chance to sort of
what your parting questions for this audience?

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.289
What you want these guys leaving with?

00:48:03.289 --> 00:48:09.690
&gt;&gt;Howard: So to what degree are you in the
know how business?

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:11.130
And how do you extend that?

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:16.670
I remember that Microsoft had a really famous
failure when they had the talking paperclip.

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:18.099
Remember the talking paperclip—

00:48:18.099 --> 00:48:19.099
&gt;&gt;Mamie: Clippy

00:48:19.099 --> 00:48:20.099
&gt;&gt;Howard: It's tremendously annoying.

00:48:20.099 --> 00:48:21.369
It's a hard problem.

00:48:21.369 --> 00:48:29.459
How do you, you've got a lot of data about
how people behave and you don't want to freak

00:48:29.459 --> 00:48:30.819
them out about that either.

00:48:30.819 --> 00:48:33.450
So I think that there is some Googlers who
like hard problems.

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:37.920
I think the hard problem not just how do you
improve search, how do you include more and

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.709
more information in the information you're
organizing but how do you enable people to

00:48:42.709 --> 00:48:45.200
climb that power law of participation?

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.039
How do you enable them to learn to search
to learn more effectively?

00:48:49.039 --> 00:48:58.140
One you know when I was looking at the crap
detection of medical information, the National

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:01.829
Institutes of Health do have a browser add-on.

00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:05.799
So when you are browsing to websites that
claim to have medical information, you can

00:49:05.799 --> 00:49:07.789
find out whether they approve or not.

00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:11.210
So I think, and I'm sure that you are thinking
about this.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:19.269
There's some combination of crowd sourced
social crap detection, social verification.

00:49:19.269 --> 00:49:23.609
And algorithmic ways of determining it that
we need to develop.

00:49:23.609 --> 00:49:28.660
The more bad information there is online,
the more crucial that information is.

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:35.789
The more effective we need to make the ways
we evaluate that information as individuals.

00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:39.849
&gt;&gt;Mamie: and we have a microphone so I want
to invite you guys to ask questions.

00:49:39.849 --> 00:49:43.729
&gt;&gt;male#1: I have a question related to the
concept of the filter bubble.

00:49:43.729 --> 00:49:48.369
You mentioned that a strategy for avoiding
that is seeking dissenting opinions or at

00:49:48.369 --> 00:49:50.589
least including some of those.

00:49:50.589 --> 00:49:55.709
I think there's a risk there that you end
up with not being able to tell what the truth

00:49:55.709 --> 00:49:58.880
is because you just hear two different sides
of a story.

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:02.711
And in a lot of recent current events there
definitely two completely opposing sides to

00:50:02.711 --> 00:50:06.410
the story and it's almost impossible to know
what the truth is.

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:13.239
So my question is what are your thoughts about
whether the filter bubble is sort of a human

00:50:13.239 --> 00:50:20.900
nature problem that people are going to gravitate
towards a position where they just vote based

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:22.000
on wishful thinking?

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.650
And what are some strategies that people can
use to avoid that and get to actual truth

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:31.109
as opposed to pleasing fiction?

00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:38.930
&gt;&gt;Howard: Well the actual truth of the melting
point of sodium is pretty easily determined.

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:42.999
The actual truth of did this person commit
a crime?

00:50:42.999 --> 00:50:50.849
We've developed this system where we have
advocates for both sides and we randomly select

00:50:50.849 --> 00:50:52.469
people to make a decision.

00:50:52.469 --> 00:50:54.719
So I think that there's really a continuum.

00:50:54.719 --> 00:51:02.200
The word truth, we tend to put a T on that
and think that there is a truth.

00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:12.279
You know I noted on, I noted this thing about
if there isn't someone in your network who

00:51:12.279 --> 00:51:16.849
you regularly disagree with or who regularly
annoys you then you're in an echo chamber.

00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:24.829
And someone else on Twitter said nobody in
their network disagreed about the Trayvon/Zimmerman

00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:27.289
case.

00:51:27.289 --> 00:51:34.059
And I said "Well, is nobody talking about
the rights of the accused here?"

00:51:34.059 --> 00:51:39.089
And the person immediately went off on an
advocacy of arresting this person.

00:51:39.089 --> 00:51:44.839
But of course the law is about protecting
the rights of the most despised.

00:51:44.839 --> 00:51:52.739
So we develop these institutions to deal with
some of the problems that have arisen from

00:51:52.739 --> 00:51:57.140
human natural capacities to believe what they
want to believe.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:58.140
Cognitive dissonance.

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:03.029
There's a whole psychological study about
how people will, and you can influence people's

00:52:03.029 --> 00:52:07.150
beliefs very, very easily by showing them
information in one way or the other.

00:52:07.150 --> 00:52:10.229
So the truth is hard to find.

00:52:10.229 --> 00:52:15.650
I think just knowing that you can't accept
all the information that comes across your

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:20.769
screen at face value is very significant.

00:52:20.769 --> 00:52:23.390
There's a difference there in terms of truth
seeking.

00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:28.069
I think the scientific method was a great
advance in truth seeking.

00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:34.499
We can argue theologically and philosophically
about things that can never be proven.

00:52:34.499 --> 00:52:38.079
But if we're arguing about the melting point
of sodium than let's just get that sodium

00:52:38.079 --> 00:52:40.839
out and a thermometer and find out.

00:52:40.839 --> 00:52:41.839
[Pause]

00:52:41.839 --> 00:52:43.019
&gt;&gt;male#2: Hi.

00:52:43.019 --> 00:52:50.069
One of the things that I find very disturbing
at work is that we continue to use e-mail

00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:52.029
in ways that seem inappropriate.

00:52:52.029 --> 00:53:00.650
I mean I think it's great for a conversation,
but we use it to indicate status changes in

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:01.700
all sorts of things like that.

00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:06.829
And I was wondering, but I can't think of
an alternative that would work as well because

00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:07.829
e-mail is so universal.

00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:14.460
I was wondering if you had any thoughts about
alternatives to e-mail that we should be working

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.650
on.

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:21.029
&gt;&gt;Howard: You know I ranted about this for
so long so long ago that I actually stopped

00:53:21.029 --> 00:53:22.249
ranting about it.

00:53:22.249 --> 00:53:25.940
But you know there's some basic literacies.

00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:30.789
How about having an appropriate subject line,
or a subject line at all.

00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:36.019
Or a subject line that doesn't say about your
e-mail.

00:53:36.019 --> 00:53:37.440
People here are more sophisticated than that.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:43.809
But believe me, most of the people in the
enterprise world are not.

00:53:43.809 --> 00:53:48.819
How about not CCing everybody in the world.

00:53:48.819 --> 00:53:54.709
I did a, there was something when I was doing
consulting for a company in Asia.

00:53:54.709 --> 00:53:58.900
And someone sent out a message saying the
Singapore office will be closed on Friday.

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.400
And I'm in California.

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:04.069
So I found out how many people receive that
message.

00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:11.019
17,000 people in the world had to know that
the Singapore office was closed on Friday.

00:54:11.019 --> 00:54:13.799
A lot of these things are best done with wikis,
and you know that.

00:54:13.799 --> 00:54:16.529
And Google Docs.

00:54:16.529 --> 00:54:19.630
It's a matter of training people to use them.

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:22.359
&gt;&gt;male#2: You gave me a couple ideas, thank
you.

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:23.359
&gt;&gt;Mamie: Cool.

00:54:23.359 --> 00:54:24.950
I think we are out of time.

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:27.859
But thank you for coming and you can buy books
in the back.

00:54:27.859 --> 00:54:29.309
&gt;&gt;Howard: And I'll sign them

00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.599
[Applause]
