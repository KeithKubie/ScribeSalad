00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.560
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Say hello
to Android Things 1.0,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.019
Google's managed
operating system

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:05.560
for building and
maintaining Internet

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.020
of Things devices at scale.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:09.730
I'm Wayne Piekarski,
and today I'm

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.720
going to explain what's new in
version 1.0, how it provides

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.130
long-term support for
production devices,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.410
and a new lineup of
system-on-module hardware.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.690
So what is Android Things?

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.480
Android Things is Google's
managed operating system

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.610
that enables you to build
and maintain Internet

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.800
of Things devices at scale.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.920
We provide a robust platform
that does the heavy lifting,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.680
with certified hardware,
rich developer APIs,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.900
and secure, managed
software updates using

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.060
Google's backend
infrastructure, so you can

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.310
focus on building your product.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.250
Version 1.0 is the first
release of Android Things

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.650
that is ready for your
production devices.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.290
We just recently completed
our developer preview,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.950
and the preview SDK was
downloaded over 100,000 times.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.570
Developer feedback
and engagement

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.120
has been critical in
our journey towards 1.0,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.925
and we're grateful to
the 10,000 developers who

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.430
have provided us feedback
through filing bugs,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.460
attending events, and
posting in our communities.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.880
A core part of our IoT platform
is the supported hardware,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.730
based on a System-On-Module,
or SOM, design.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.760
So what is this?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.940
A SOM is a fully
integrated component

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.690
with CPU, memory, wi-fi
Bluetooth, and flash storage,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.970
that you can just drop
into your final design,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.680
just like you would use a
library when writing software.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.640
The SOM is certified by Google,
and we provide a board support

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.880
package that includes the
kernel, drivers, and libraries

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.730
to support Android.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.970
With Android Things 1.0, we've
announced support for SOMs

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.510
based on designs from NXP,
Qualcomm, and MediaTek,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.910
and these modules are
certified for production use,

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.444
and available in quantities to
make real consumer products.

00:01:41.444 --> 00:01:43.860
If you want to try Android
Things right now without buying

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.860
a SOM, you can even use any
one of developing platforms,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.870
even the Raspberry
Pi 3, and this

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.260
highlights an important
feature of Android Things.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.160
It's quick and easy
for prototyping,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.720
and when you're
ready for production,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.430
there's a clear
path to buying SOMs

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.310
in small or large quantities,
depending on your needs,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.410
and then your software
is ready to go.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.380
You can then design your own
Printed Circuit Board, or PCB,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.960
to connect your
hardware to the SOM.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.449
When building IoT devices,
maintaining security

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.039
is very important.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.460
Providing timely software
updates Over The Air, or OTA,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.220
is a fundamental part of
that, and stability fixes

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.140
and security patches
are supported

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.060
on production
hardware platforms,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.670
and automatic updates are
enabled for all devices

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.610
by default. For each
Android Things version,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.700
Google will offer free stability
fixes and security patches

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.450
for three years, with additional
options for extended support.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.580
Even after the official
support window ends,

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.246
you'll still be able
to continue to push

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:40.200
app updates to your devices.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.630
Use the Android Things
console to upload Android

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.620
APKs with your updates so the
OTA mechanism can push them out

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.040
to your devices.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.610
You can initially experiment
with 100 active devices

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.367
for noncommercial use.

00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:53.950
When you're ready
for mass production,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.010
we'll provide you with a
distribution agreement,

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.718
and now you're ready
to sell your devices

00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:00.000
in large quantities
to the public.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.650
With Android Things,
you can build

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.040
apps using the rich framework
provided by the Android SDK

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.650
and Google Play services,
including the same UI tool

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.250
kit, multimedia support,
and connectivity APIs used

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.290
by mobile developers today.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.300
You can also easily
integrate your apps

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.750
with popular Google services,
like Firebase, TensorFlow,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.520
and Cloud IT Core.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.920
This is done using the many
existing Android client

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.120
libraries.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.830
And since it's
Android, you can use

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.980
Android Studio and all of its
languages and tools, right out

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.940
of the box.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.060
This means you can easily
program and debug in Kotlin,

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.020
Java, C++, or C,
depending on your needs.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.670
Who else is using
Android Things?

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.220
You may have seen the new
voice-activated speakers

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.370
from Polk, LG, and iHome,
as well as smart displays

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.070
from Lenovo, LG, and JBL.

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.440
These devices showcase
the powerful capabilities

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.380
of the Google Assistant, and are
coming soon to stores near you.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.160
There are also lots of startups
and design agencies using

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.010
Android Things to
prototype innovative ideas

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.100
for all kinds of devices
you're going to see very soon.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.820
We want to make it easy for
anyone to start building IoT

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.430
devices, without having
to own your own factory,

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.560
and without requiring
lots of funding.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.200
This is all part of our
efforts to democratize hardware

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.960
development, making it
accessible to more software

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.571
developers out there.

00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:19.529
If you want to get started
with Android Things,

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.390
we have a great
community website,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.880
AndroidThings.withgoogle.com,
where

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.520
you can see the developer kits
and the interesting projects

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.000
created by others.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.010
So what's next?

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.290
Get some hardware, check
out the documentation,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.260
download some sample source
code, and try it out.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.180
And join our community
to ask questions

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.130
and share your
ideas with others.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.160
Android Things 1.0 is
now open for business

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.690
and ready for production.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.340
I'm really looking
forward to seeing

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.310
all the exciting
products that you build.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.510
I'm Wane Piekarski, and
I'll see you next time.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.160
