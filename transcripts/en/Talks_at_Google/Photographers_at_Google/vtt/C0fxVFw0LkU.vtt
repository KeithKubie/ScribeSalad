00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.720
MARK: Welcome, my
name is Mark.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.690
And I'm here with the
Authors@Google program.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.150
And today we're here to welcome
Michael Clark, who is

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.320
an adventure photographer,
surfer, skier, climber.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.402
I don't know if I've missed
any, but you can certainly

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:18.440
fill us in on that.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.610
And he was here about two
years ago to tell us in

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.820
general about how he shoots
and sort of the

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.310
stories that he tells.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.880
And in the intervening time,
he's been doing a lot of

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.320
shooting for big name clients
out in the field, all

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.840
different kinds of adventure
and sports photography.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.740
And he's here today to go a
little bit more in-depth on

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.670
some of those stories behind the
image, and to get a little

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.890
bit more grungy about how they
come about, how you actually

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.380
construct them, and how you
actually get them to look like

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.200
they do when you actually see
them in print, online, or

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.630
wherever you encounter them.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.930
So with that, I'd like to bring
up Michael to tell us

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.595
some of those stories.

00:00:57.595 --> 00:00:58.375
Michael.

00:00:58.375 --> 00:01:04.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.849
MICHAEL CLARK: All right.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.670
Thanks for having
me out, guys.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.180
Thanks, Mark.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.625
Thanks for having me back.

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.270
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.280
And like Mark said, I'm an
adventure sports photographer.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.320
I live in Santa Fe,
New Mexico.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.890
I've been working for 16 years,
shooting for pretty

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.500
much any and every outdoor
client out there.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.780
Magazines like "Outside,"
"Men's Journal," "Sports

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.410
Illustrated," some stuff with
"National Geographic." Clients

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.500
like Red Bull, Apple,
Adobe, Nike.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.590
I work with Nikon a lot.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.110
I'm a Nikon shooter--

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.090
not to create a controversy.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.410
And over the last 16 years in
the adventure sports world,

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.550
I've had tons of adventures.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.770
So the reason I'm out here is
this book that I just wrote

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.640
and finished earlier this year
that some of you have gotten.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.460
And we'll give away a free copy
of this after the show.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.190
The book is "Exposed--

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.010
Inside the Life and Images of
a Pro Photographer." And my

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.990
last book was "Adventure Sports
Photography," kind of a

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.850
how-to for all the
different sports.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.910
This one's more of a revealing
book about what is the life of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.110
a pro photographer like?

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.440
And I'll talk about that during
the presentation.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.750
And it also talks about the
stories behind 16 of my

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.180
best-known images,
which are fairly

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.260
adventurous, the stories.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.710
And then it talks about how I
set those images up, how they

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.420
were shot, the gear used, and
then how the images were

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.750
processed, so that I could give
the reader a full view of

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.810
how does this work from
beginning to end?

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.060
How did he get into position?

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.040
How did he meet these people
that are really famous

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.200
athletes in the outdoor world?

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.620
And who was I working for,
and all that jazz.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.740
So we'll talk about that.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.790
Just to give you a little
idea of the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.920
book, there's the cover.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.120
There's chapters.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.090
This is "Keeping the Fire
Stoked." It's one of the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.431
chapters that talks
about four images.

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:52.620
I'll keep going here.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.270
And this just shows you
some of the chapters.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.900
There's even little lighting
diagrams to show you how I had

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.675
the strobes set up.

00:02:58.675 --> 00:03:00.610
I think pretty much every
picture in the book that has

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.790
strobes used in it of these 16,
there's a little lighting

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.960
diagram that shows you how the
lights were set up, and

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.820
describes in detail which lights
I had, which light

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.570
modifiers were on the lights,
and all the details.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.910
The other thing I didn't
say is that in

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.590
the back of the book--

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.940
in the book, it talks about how
the images were processed.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.260
But in the back of the book,
there's this DVD where you can

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.290
sit there and watch me
work up each of those

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.370
16 images as well.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.200
And some of them took four,
five, six hours to work up.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.790
So you don't see all
that, obviously.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.550
But there's like a five or
six-minute min piece and I'll

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.480
do a little bit of what I did
to work it up, and then show

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.580
you the finished product
on the DVD.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.140
Then these little vignettes--

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.290
some of these chapters talk
about what it was like out in

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.360
the field, being a pro.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.260
This was in Tahiti, and I'll
talk about this whole series

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.320
of images I produced
in Tahiti.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.910
Going to Tahiti to
shoot for 10 days

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.970
sounds pretty glamorous.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.100
But reality was quite
a bit different.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.220
So in terms of the job, I
have an office at home.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.010
I'll talk about percentages
and where I

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.040
spend most my time.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.420
It's probably 10% to 15% of my
time is spent shooting, having

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.110
these adventures.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.330
This is a shot a buddy of
mine took in Patagonia.

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.264
I was covering an expedition
race down there.

00:04:19.264 --> 00:04:21.360
It's like an adventure race,
where there are sea kayaking,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.670
mountain biking, climbing,
and trekking.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.420
One of most remote places
in the world.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.190
We're probably 600 miles
from the nearest

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.110
city at this point.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.615
And it's just like a swampland
that you're walking through.

00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:39.430
And I have my cameras around my
neck, because I don't want

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.220
them to get drenched.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.680
Anyway, we were following
the racers through

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.562
this muck and mire.

00:04:43.562 --> 00:04:47.860
Often it involves carrying a
bunch of really heavy packs.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.640
Oh yeah, I have a
clicker, too.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.700
I forgot about that.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.060
I started out as a rock
climbing photographer.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.310
When I first started out in
1995, I was living in France

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.770
and climbing two, three
months straight.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.670
I was on a bicycle tour.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.020
I'd quit my job in physics.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.005
I studied physics at the
University of Texas in Austin

00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:09.230
and worked for a year.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.650
Then I started rock climbing.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.830
And rock climbing's one of those
sports like surfing or

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.460
mountain biking.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.480
You just get obsessed.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.260
And I got obsessed.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.980
And I couldn't stay in the lab
doing physics anymore.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.150
I was working with grad
students, working like 14

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.330
hours a day.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.040
And I just quit.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.710
And I just took off, sponsored
by Visa and MasterCard, and

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.560
went climbing in South America,
Alaska, Mexico,

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.250
Europe, Thailand.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.320
And so after two years, I
decided, you know, well, my

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.330
images look about as good
as those images in

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:42.240
the climbing magazines.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.520
I think I can make
a go of this.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.280
And I just went for it.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.820
And after about three and a
half years, I had enough

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.650
clients built up that
I could go for it.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.800
It was still sketchy
for a few years.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.870
But I made it.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.070
16 years later, here I am.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.600
So this just gives you an idea,
in this picture, of what

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.440
it takes to shoot climbing.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.570
I'm not that far off
the ground here.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.740
But I just had a friend shoot
this so that people can see

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.210
what it looks like when you're
shooting from above.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.170
I'm pulled up the rope, so
there's no rope down here, to

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.470
get in the picture.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.620
And it's a fairly difficult
climb, if you're a climber.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.940
But it's not crazy.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.500
Here's a much higher off
the ground shot.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.000
Same technique used
to get this.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.530
It took us all afternoon to get
up here, probably four,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.900
four and a half hours, because
we're 600 feet off the ground.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.150
Whoops, let me go back.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.830
This is Devil's Tower in
Wyoming, if any of you guys

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:35.660
have ever been there.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:39.220
But pretty amazing position.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.210
Sharp rock.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.760
I've had some incidents with
sharp rocks and my ropes

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.020
getting cut, so I was pretty
sketched out in this place

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.880
because it was over a very
sharp rock when I

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.270
was hanging off here.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.620
But I'll get into that here
a little bit later.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.510
I'll just give you guys a little
bit of my work so you

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.490
can see what I do.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.000
This is another shot of a
guy named Chris Sharma.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.510
If any of you guys are climbers,
he's probably one of

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.990
the most famous climbers
in the world.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.140
And this is a new sport called
deepwater soloing.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.600
We're in Majorca, Spain, off the
coast of Spain, just south

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.820
of Marseilles.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.950
And he is 70 feet off the
water with no rope.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.590
So if he falls off from there,
he's going to hit the water.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.260
It's a 100-foot climb.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.090
It's 514.

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:19.660
At that time, it was one of
the hardest climbs in the

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.660
world, and this is the biggest
hold on the climb.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.540
He hung on that hold for
20 minutes, twice.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.195
So he'd climb in from the side,
go to this hold, and

00:07:27.195 --> 00:07:28.230
then he'd climb out.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.270
And then we'd do
it over again.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.900
It was at dawn.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.180
So the base of this route,
which you can't see, goes

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.340
underneath this roof.

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.840
And there's a 60-foot horizontal
roof, literally

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.310
here back to the door, that he
has to climb out to even get

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:43.000
to this position.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.050
And the hardest move is the one
off that hold to the next

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.060
hold, which is like
six feet away.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.560
He has to jump in this
dynamic move.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.540
So some pretty exciting stuff.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:54.810
I'm also an avid ice climber.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:58.590
I mean, I shoot pretty much all
facets of ice climbing, as

00:07:58.590 --> 00:07:59.760
you've seen.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.180
I started shooting mountain
biking after like four or five

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.090
years of just shooting
rock climbing.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.905
I realized I was going to be
really poor if I just kept

00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:08.210
shooting rock climbing.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.370
So I branched out into a bunch
of the other sports, and

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.570
mountain biking was one of the
first ones I started shooting.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.970
This shot may look like
it's at sunset, and

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:16.830
the rocks all gold.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.500
But this is a strobe.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.820
It was a cloudy, overcast day,
and I just had a huge

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.560
Elinchrome Ranger strobe that
I blasted into this with an

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.810
orange gel on it to get
this end-of-day look.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.100
This is actually an assignment
I shot for Adobe when they

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.440
came out with Lightroom, which
is where I met Mark, when he

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.530
was back at Adobe.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:41.419
I shot some of the first
pictures for Lightroom.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:44.140
And they wanted mountain biking
shots of people going

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.160
off huge cliffs and doing wild
stuff on mountain bikes to

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.030
download the software.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:51.950
So we went out to Moab, and my
good buddy Ryan, who's one of

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.780
the best mountain bikers
out there, that I've

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.510
known for a long time.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.490
This is a pretty classic jump
called a mushroom rock.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.690
It's only about a 35,
40-foot drop.

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:05.660
He lands right in here, even
just out of frame.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.575
But it's on rock, so if you mess
up, you're going to be in

00:09:08.575 --> 00:09:10.660
the hospital for a long time.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.520
So as you can start to see, one
of the coolest things of

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.520
my job is I get to see these
amazing feats of athleticism

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.810
happen in the outdoors.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.350
This one's not quite
so dramatic.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:23.510
But this is a shot
I shot for Nikon.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.030
It's the first time I'd ever
shot JPEG-only for an

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.910
assignment, because it
was with one of their

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:28.525
point-and-shoots.

00:09:28.525 --> 00:09:30.990
And so they asked me to go shoot
surfing and mounting

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.020
biking with their
point-and-shoots.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.560
It was difficult,
let's just say.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.790
I work with Red Bull
a lot as well.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.140
This is Danny MacAskill.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.400
You guys might know him,
because he's kind

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.130
of a YouTube superstar.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.260
Started his career.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.020
I'll tell you more about that
story, because there's a whole

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.410
set of images of
him, later on.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:51.570
And I just started shooting
surfing five years ago.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.470
When I wrote my last book on
adventure sports photography--

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:54.590
I live in New Mexico.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:56.030
So obviously I'm not doing
a whole lot of

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.330
surfing these days.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:01.310
We wanted to include a broad
variety of sports, and surfing

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.660
is obviously one of the big
adventure sports out there.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.750
So I went to California and
started shooting surfing, and

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.010
then a fellow photographer
friend of mine, Andrew Eccles,

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.390
who's a very famous portrait
photographer from New York,

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:14.790
suggested I call this
guy Brian Bielmann.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.180
So I called him up.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.490
And he answered the phone,
we had a conversation.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.950
I said, hey, can I interview
you for my book?

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.370
Because I don't really know
anything about surfing

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.030
photography, other than
just go stand on a

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.630
beach with a big lens.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.280
And so he was gracious enough to
give me all the details for

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.110
my book of what it takes to be
in the water and what lenses

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.010
to use and how to set it
up and the housings,

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:35.250
and all that stuff.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.720
And we hit it off.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.640
And he's like, hey,
you need some more

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.210
pictures for your book.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:41.652
Why don't you just flight out
here one of these days, and

00:10:41.652 --> 00:10:42.680
we'll go shoot at Jaws.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:46.180
And Jaws is like the mega-wave,
the 80-foot monster

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.230
off the north coast of Maui.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:50.700
So I was like going crazy.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:52.720
I was like, sure, I'll
do that right away.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.680
Whenever the next wave comes
up, I'll hop on a

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.450
plane to get out there.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.420
So Jaws didn't come up
for a little while.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.490
But he called me back the next
week and said, Pipeline's

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:05.085
going to be up at 20
feet next week.

00:11:05.085 --> 00:11:07.400
Or it wasn't next week, it
was a few days from then.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.930
So I hopped on a plane, I
was there in 12 hours

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:10.500
and shot with him.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.520
We hit it off, and we've been
close friends ever since.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.300
And he's kind of been my entree
into the surfing world.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.870
Because I'm not really competing
for his clients.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.440
I'm shooting surfing for these
other companies like Nikon and

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.040
Apple and other companies that
he doesn't really shoot for,

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.810
since he's shooting for,

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.060
specifically, the surf industry.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.220
But this just happens to be a
55, 60-foot wave in Waimea

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.200
Bay, the last Eddie Aikau.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.700
If anybody here's a
surfer, they'll

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.290
probably remember this.

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.900
The biggest surfing
competition in

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.960
the history of surfing.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.230
Amazing waves.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:45.630
And I went with him to Tahiti
last year, just shooting for

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:49.190
this book and also for
another client.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.290
And you shoot from
a boat there.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.370
The waves weren't
nearly as big.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.860
But it was pretty amazing
in terms of the

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.410
perspectives you could get.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:58.080
I've also shot a fair bit
of whitewater kayaking.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.580
Let's see what else
we got here.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.160
This is another shot
from the race.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.600
This is, again, in Patagonia in
southern Chile, hundreds of

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.440
miles from civilization.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:13.650
And that's in summer, with
still a lot of snow.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.690
A little bit of backpacking.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.800
I also have some shots, some
articles for clients where

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.100
basically, they just want a
photographer who can do crazy

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:24.970
stuff that other photographers
probably wouldn't do.

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.210
So for this, it was for "Men's
Fitness Magazine." And they

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:29.330
had me hanging off the bottom
of this helicopter, flying

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:32.660
over the ocean, and all kinds
of crazy shots, which I'll

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.601
talk about that in more
detail as well.

00:12:36.601 --> 00:12:38.740
And I'll talk about how this one
was shot as well, because

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.920
there was quite a few strobes
on this image.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.780
So a little bit of yoga.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.480
This was for Patagonia, a client
just down the way.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.590
And living in New Mexico, I've
shot at the Balloon Fiesta a

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.310
few times, and I've gotten
a few decent images.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.660
Little landscapes
here and there.

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.900
This was in the Waimea Bay,
shot at the same time that

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.190
60-foot wave was happening.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.570
This was the day before.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:06.400
So this is a little pie chart
that's in the book.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.150
And there was a few of these
that were running around

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.605
before I made this one up.

00:13:09.605 --> 00:13:11.710
But I just made this up to
give kind of the reality.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:13.700
Because everybody has this
perception that, oh, your

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:15.300
job's so glamorous.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.120
And I'm always flying
off to somewhere,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:19.440
this or that or whatever.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.150
So they have no sympathy.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.930
Which is OK.

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:22.950
They don't need to have
any sympathy.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:28.660
But it just gives you a much
better idea of how much time

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.640
goes into marketing, how much
time goes into working up the

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.860
images, networking and
accounting, all the other

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.500
little things we do
as freelancers.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.970
Definitely would say that
freelancing, it's an

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.320
up-and-down job.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.580
Some years, like the last three
years, I've been off the

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.740
charts busy, just flying from
here to there to there to

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:48.700
here, it seems, every
other week.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.950
And that's exhausting.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.310
Sometimes it slows down a little
bit more, so you're not

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.880
as busy and you need to start
doing some other stuff.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.330
So anyway, I'm definitely
not creating

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:02.180
images 65% of the time.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.310
Traveling to exotic locations,
every once in a while.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.345
Tahiti might be the first
truly exotic location.

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:07.410
I don't know.

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.750
Patagonia's fairly exotic, but
not quite the way people would

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:13.390
think, because it's usually
like 45 to 55 degrees and

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:14.170
raining sideways.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:17.180
So it's not very enjoyable,
necessarily.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:20.630
I don't know that I've ever
partied like a rock star,

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.125
maybe not since college.

00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:25.010
And even then.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.780
Before I go on a shoot,
I think one of the big

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:29.390
differences, I find--

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.170
because I teach some
photo workshops--

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:34.295
between amateur photographers
and professional photographers

00:14:34.295 --> 00:14:37.140
is the amount of preparation
they do before a shoot.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.670
That's not to say that amateur
photographers aren't doing the

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.660
same amount of preparation.

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:41.300
Some of them are.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.210
There's a ton of amateur
photographers out there

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:47.090
getting amazing images, as we
see on the internet every day.

00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:50.080
But the average professional,
I mean, for myself, I have

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.320
what I call a shot list.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.340
It's not always in a book or
not always handwritten.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.410
Sometimes it's typed out.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:57.170
Sometimes it's on my iPhone.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.010
And I've talked with a client
or I've talked with whoever

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.830
I'm going to be shooting
in that area.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.580
And I've seen what they can do
or what's going to happen, to

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.080
some degree.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.450
And I can start creating ideas
and think in my head, what

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:10.590
kind of shots do I want?

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.630
And I'll have a list of
20 to 30 shots of

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.690
things I want to get.

00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.370
I'm not going to get all them.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:19.090
I almost never get
all of them.

00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:22.900
It's just something to help
me plan out the image.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:25.530
So say it's a shoot
in New Mexico.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.630
I will sometimes go scout
the location.

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.470
If I can scout the location
at all, I'll do that.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:31.150
And that definitely helps.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.220
Because then I can be, like,
this is going to be the

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.500
perfect angle, and it has
to be here at sunrise.

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.070
And you can kind of plan out
your shot and figure out,

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.750
well, can I use my speed
lights for this?

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.885
Do I have to bring out the
big guns, a giant strobe?

00:15:43.885 --> 00:15:45.930
It's going to weigh a couple
hundred pounds with all the

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.320
other gear associated
with that.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.320
Will I need assistance?

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.040
That just kind of helps set
you up for success.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.680
And I do everything
I possibly can--

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.360
checking the weather.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.470
I can almost predict where
clouds are going to go, just

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:02.190
by looking on NOAA's website,
and figure out that stuff.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.170
So is it going to be crappy
weather that day?

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:05.980
Should we come back
a different day?

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.650
If I'm shooting in the woods--

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.290
like say, I'm showing up in the
redwoods here, I wouldn't

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.900
want a sunny day, because then
you have these bright patches

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.870
of light coming through these
into this dark forests.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.000
I would look for an overcast
day-- which probably wouldn't

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.090
be that difficult to find here,
some times of the year--

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.210
so that the light's a
little more even.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.260
Stuff like that.

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:28.490
And then I do a few shoots.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.875
This is actually probably the
most well-known athlete I've

00:16:31.875 --> 00:16:34.120
ever shot for the mainstream.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.620
This is Camilo Villegas.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.130
He's one of the top 20
golfers in the world.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.740
And it was shot for State Street
Global Advisors, which

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.470
is a financial firm.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.570
I had 45 minutes to
set up for it.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.420
And I shot 12 images in a
matter of 24 seconds.

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.100
The art director came over to me
and he whispered in my ear,

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.110
he said, you've got 10 shots.

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.400
Make them count.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.600
And he was watching, because I
was tethered to the laptop.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.620
He was watching every
image come in.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.310
So there was like this
insane pressure.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.310
They had the layout.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.270
They had everything dialed in.

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.340
Our lighting was dialed in.

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.930
For that 45 minutes,
we had a stand-in.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.099
So I wasn't worried about
the lighting.

00:17:08.099 --> 00:17:09.109
But it was just like--

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:09.660
[SNAP].

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.290
They were shooting a $4 million
commercial the same

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:13.030
day they were doing this.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:17.800
So I had seconds, literally, to
get the images before they

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.230
had to go off and keep shooting
the commercial.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:22.890
So there's a bit of pressure
sometimes.

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:25.420
This is a different version
of that image.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.639
And you can tell-- he does this
little spider pose to

00:17:27.639 --> 00:17:29.320
kind of assess the greens.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.140
Super cool guy.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.530
He's probably the fittest
golfer I've ever seen.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.870
He's basically doing like a
one-armed push-up there.

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:38.700
But you can see here
how that was shot.

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.670
So I'll just go back
to that image.

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:42.930
There's a light in
front of him.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:46.950
So there's a light coming in
from kind of this angle, and

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:48.570
there's two lights behind him.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.300
It was fairly windy that day,
but you can see there was

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.140
these clouds behind here.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:55.240
There was a storm moving in.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.950
The winds were starting
to pick up.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.270
When we got to the location--

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.530
I couldn't scout it first,
because it's on this really

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.140
fancy green.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.850
The Accenture Golf Tournament
happens there in Tucson.

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.585
It's some mega-tournament that
was happening that day, or

00:18:07.585 --> 00:18:09.330
later that weekend.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.000
And they wouldn't let us take
anything onto the greens.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.050
So no lightstands, no
tripods, no nothing.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.260
And so I was like, OK, what
are we going to do?

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.400
But well, I figured,
he's in this pose.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.100
We just laid everything
on the ground.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:23.560
Put soft boxes on the lights,
laid them on the ground.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.090
Had different people come hold
them, because the wind was

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.530
blowing everything away.

00:18:27.530 --> 00:18:28.850
Laid the laptop on the ground.

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.930
Put my jacket over it so the art
director could watch the

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.660
images as they came in.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.300
And we figured it
out on the fly.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.880
And the lighting diagram
is something like this.

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.090
Pretty simple set-up.

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:41.370
Just took a little time
to figure it out.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:45.950
Here's another image,
just to talk about

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.060
some of these images.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:48.410
This is the finished image.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.150
This was actually shot
not in a studio.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.220
He's a free diver.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.510
This was taken in New Mexico.

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:56.430
There's a place called
Blue Hole.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.100
And he had just dove to the
bottom of Blue Hole, which is

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.940
like 100 feet down, holding his
breath for, I don't know,

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.170
a couple minutes.

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:07.380
He works with the Cousteau
Society a lot, Nico Danan.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:08.700
He's on the cover of the book.

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:09.780
Good guy.

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.110
So I told him after the
dive-- the location

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:14.380
was not super scenic.

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:16.220
And the water was frigid.

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:18.390
And I didn't have an underwater
housing with me

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.920
that day, so I told him, look,
I'm going to set up this

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.860
little studio over here.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.130
Just get out of the water
and come straight over.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:26.870
And so the studio was set up.

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.200
I just basically taped a white
backdrop in the entrance-way

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.930
to the men's bathroom.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:31.685
So it was pretty hilarious.

00:19:31.685 --> 00:19:33.000
It was a tiny little area.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.900
I mean, in fact, the length
of the men's bathrooms is

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:39.640
probably not much longer than
the width of that image.

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.820
So it was a tiny little area.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.240
And I shot this.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.310
This is pretty much the
lighting diagram.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.900
There wasn't all this
other stuff.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:48.800
There were no stands
or anything.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.160
It was just taped to the white
background of the wall.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.940
There was a light behind him
that was shining onto the

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:55.570
background, to illuminate
the background so

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.920
it'd be pure white.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.160
And then I had a shoot-through
umbrella on a strobe.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.670
Basically it was right
above my head.

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:04.430
And literally, he was only
three feet away.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.360
This was shot with a
17 to 35mm lens.

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:11.390
So he was only like three feet
away from me, really close.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.670
And that's the shot that
came out of the camera.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:16.860
Which I have to say, as
a pro, that sucks.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.690
And that's not going to
win any awards at all.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.120
So I knew this technique was
what I was going for.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.010
It was a high-contrast
black-and-white technique.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.310
So I knew when I was shooting
what I wanted

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.860
to do in the end.

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.830
So that's why I shot
it this way.

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.830
And I knew it was going to
become this high-contrast

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.190
black-and-white image that
looks like that.

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:37.710
So with a little bit of
post-processing, this is what

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.312
I did to it in Lightroom.

00:20:39.312 --> 00:20:42.530
Basically, I converted it to a
high-contrast black-and-white.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.440
I cranked the contrast
up a little bit,

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.086
crunched the blacks.

00:20:48.086 --> 00:20:50.420
You can still see there's
like a few things.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.350
I think this is a hot pixel
from my camera.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.960
I can't remember what that is.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.030
I cleaned up his face a little
bit in Photoshop.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.710
And here you can see
the final image.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:00.790
So there's some cleaning
up of the face.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.670
I did a little stuff
down here.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:06.140
Did a little fancy footwork with
the unsharp mask to give

00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.460
it a little more crunchiness.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.520
This is before the clarity
slider in Lightroom.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:13.740
And this is what I came up with,
which is a pretty cool

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.600
portrait, I think, because it
catches a moment where he's

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.310
kind of in this weird
zone of just having

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:21.300
come out of the water.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.460
And the funny thing is, I took
a bunch of portraits of three

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.750
or four different
guys that day.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.800
And they all said I got them.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.010
Which you know, in the
parlance of portrait

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:33.010
photography, people talk about,
oh, we got their soul,

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:34.430
or whatever.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:35.045
That's total crap.

00:21:35.045 --> 00:21:37.000
You can't get anybody's
soul on film.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.770
It's just you can get a piece of
them, maybe, that they can

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.660
relate to, or they see a piece
of themselves in the image.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.870
And that's what they were
saying, that we could get a

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.350
piece of them in the
image somehow.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.480
Here's a rock climbing image.

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.310
And there was the lighting
diagram for this earlier.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.010
This is a climber named
Timmy Fairfield.

00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:57.340
This was shot probably an
hour and a half from my

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.260
house in Santa Fe.

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.280
And I had been to this location
a bunch of times

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.940
before, so I didn't
need to scout it.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:04.470
We'd been talking about
this image for years.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:07.870
So talk about preparation.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:09.710
We had been thinking about this
image for a long time.

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:12.640
He has been, historically,
one of the best

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.280
climbers in the world.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.030
He's an amazing climber.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.650
This is a super hard route.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.706
It was 98 degrees the day we
decided to do this in I think

00:22:18.706 --> 00:22:20.780
it was August.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.050
And I had to carry 200 pounds
of lighting gear

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:24.380
up into this cave.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.550
I didn't have an assistant that
day, because we were just

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:27.750
trying to do it--

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:29.230
it was just a portfolio shoot.

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:30.760
I didn't have a client
for this image.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.920
It was just something I went
out and wanted to do.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.740
And he's sponsored by a whole
bunch of companies I've worked

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.080
for, so I thought, oh,
after the fact,

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.070
we'll sell this image.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:39.200
No big deal.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.450
So we got up in the cave.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:41.050
We waited.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:43.070
The whole idea was to get a
set-up with the lights and

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.890
everything and then
wait for dusk.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:48.280
You know, that 15 minutes after
the sun went down and

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.300
the clouds are illuminated
in the

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.960
background is what we wanted.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.160
And we got it.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160
Didn't take that long to
set up the strobes.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.910
As you can see here, there's
just two strobes set up.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.890
All the strobes that I have
are battery-powered.

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.960
These are older Dynalite ones.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.910
And one of them had what's
called a spot grid on it.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:10.220
And that focuses the light
to a certain area.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.055
You see how that's carved out
up there and it goes black

00:23:13.055 --> 00:23:14.080
really fast?

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.050
That's kind of showing
you where the

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:16.610
spot grid is hitting.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.120
And this other one, I took the
spot grid off and just filled

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.680
in this area over here in
the cave that was dark.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.590
The other thing you probably
wouldn't know is this is shot

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.240
with a fisheye.

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.943
Because there's no straight
lines in the cave.

00:23:26.943 --> 00:23:27.900
The cave wasn't huge.

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.920
The cave was probably about the
size of this room, and the

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.490
opening probably not too much
bigger than floor-to-ceiling

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:34.520
over there.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.180
But with the fisheye, I could
make it look more voluminous

00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:40.370
than it actually is.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.580
And here's Danny MacAskill.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.460
I was talking to you
guys, he was the

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:46.170
backflip picture earlier.

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.620
Red Bull, one my first jobs for
Red Bull was with this guy

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.320
Danny MacAskill.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:52.780
And he had just signed with Red
Bull like the day before.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.690
His life turned over in
a matter of months.

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.850
Because he's from Scotland.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.630
He was working in a bike
shop as a mechanic.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.610
And he and his roommate decided
to make a video.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.620
And this kid's been riding
since, I don't know, two or

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:07.200
three years old.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.250
I don't know how long he'd
been riding a bike.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.200
But he did this video where
they're riding along a spiked

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.590
fence and doing all these
crazy things.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.120
You've probably seen it,
because everybody-- my

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.530
grandmother saw it and knew who
the guy was before I did

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.050
the assignment.

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.340
I was kind of blown away.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.090
But basically, he got like the
second-highest number of

00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.770
YouTube hits in two weeks,
at that point.

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:27.800
And next thing he knows,
he's on Oprah.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.490
"The New York Times" is doing
articles with him.

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.480
He does a Volkswagen
commercial.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.730
He's being asked to do movies.

00:24:35.495 --> 00:24:36.930
His life changed overnight.

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:37.860
He's the nicest kid.

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:41.050
So it's pretty cool to see
how that worked for him.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.565
In this example, we went on an
aircraft carrier in San Diego.

00:24:44.565 --> 00:24:46.280
He was visiting San
Diego, because his

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.800
sister lived there.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:50.240
And so Red Bull set up that we
could get on this aircraft

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.740
carrier by ourselves.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.440
And you know, as soon as we got
on the aircraft carrier,

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.270
it's like a museum.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:56.485
They wouldn't let
us do anything.

00:24:56.485 --> 00:24:58.320
So we were just taking pictures
of him hopping like

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.730
little security ropes, which
for him is boring.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.790
So he suggested, hey, can
I go up there and

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:08.610
stand on those boxes?

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:12.190
And the guy that was taking us
around was like, yeah, sure, I

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:14.510
don't think you can hurt
anything doing that.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.750
So he goes up there, and he gets
on top of this box over

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.250
here and he pops a wheelie.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.230
And he's told the guy and he's
told us earlier today, I'm

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.970
more comfortable on my bike than
I am on my own two feet.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:29.150
There's an 80-foot
drop right here.

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:31.740
And the boxes are
like this wide.

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.800
So he's sitting,
pops a wheelie.

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.030
And the guy's standing
like right here.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.740
And I'm not really shooting
too much, at this point,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.210
because it's like, is he just
going to sit there?

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:41.250
I mean, what are
we going to do?

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.060
So then he hops from one box
to the other and then

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.740
hops off the box.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.480
And the art director is standing
right next to me.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.140
And she says, his t-shirt, we
can't see any branding,

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:51.990
because he's wearing a helmet.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.840
And Red Bull's all about having
branding in their

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.660
images, as you saw with
the Red Bull Stratus

00:25:55.660 --> 00:25:57.230
project here lately.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.610
So she has a whole box full
of t-shirts and stuff.

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.600
She was like, we got to put a
t-shirt on him, so you can see

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.150
the Red Bull logo bigger.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.010
So to get up to this place,
you've got to go in here and

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.840
go up there and do
this and do that.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:13.390
So the guy had to come down to
help usher her up to there.

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.100
And as soon as he left, Danny
just started going nuts, just

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.370
like doing all these tail whips
and back-flips, and

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.020
going from box to box.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.190
And that's when I just blasted
away and start

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:25.220
shooting this stuff.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.990
You know, working this image up,
it looks exactly like this

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.680
in the camera.

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:33.300
So most of my images, I'd say,
they look like this, the way

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.080
I'm showing them to you
now in the camera.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.980
There's just a few I'll show you
that took these huge leaps

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:42.510
and bounds in terms of how
the processing is done.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:44.120
Later in the day, we
went to these.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:46.075
These were over by the
airport in San Diego.

00:26:46.075 --> 00:26:47.440
But we'd found the day before.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.020
I spent a whole day with Danny
scouting, because he'd never

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:51.950
been to San Diego before.

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.710
This is just an example of how
scouting can help you out.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.500
And we found these, because I
drove right by them when I

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.190
came into town.

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:58.900
I was like, wow,
those are cool.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.590
I wonder if he could do a
back-flip off of them.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.630
And there was literally cars--

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.090
it was like rush hour.

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:07.140
There were cars just packed
around this island, right in

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:08.610
front of the airport.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:09.985
And I thought, there's
no way they're going

00:27:09.985 --> 00:27:10.980
to let us do this.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:13.430
We're going to have the
cops on us in seconds.

00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:15.340
Anyway, we go out there.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:19.090
He does this like five
times to feel it out.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.400
He couldn't get it right
off the bat.

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.330
But after like five tries, he
could do it on command.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:24.763
And so we had him do it.

00:27:24.763 --> 00:27:26.960
I pulled back, shot
one like this.

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.360
And then I did a closer up.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.280
At one point, there was a cop
that pulled up over there.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.220
And I just put my camera own
and started walking away,

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:33.960
because I thought, that's it.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.860
We're done.

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.620
And Danny did it
one more time.

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.620
And the cop was like,
yeah, man!

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:39.350
That's awesome!

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.760
So I was like, OK, let's
keep shooting.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.350
MICHAEL CLARK: Earlier in the
day, we'd been kicked out of a

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.456
few places already.

00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:47.050
I mean, there was some--

00:27:47.050 --> 00:27:48.140
I think it was a retirement
home or something.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:50.350
We had him jumping off
the top of this--

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:52.280
I don't have the picture
of that one--

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.680
the top of this little gazebo.

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.650
And somebody went ballistic and
called the cops on us, and

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:57.610
we had a huge drama.

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.490
But anyway the nature of the
beast with that kind of stuff.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:04.190
One of the other Red Bull shoots
I did was this stuff

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.190
with the Red Bull Air Force.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.700
And most of the base jumping--
does everyone know what base

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.350
jumping is?

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:12.330
Base jumping is where you leap
off of some fixed thing, like

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:16.850
a bridge or an antenna
span or a huge cliff.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:18.560
This is in Utah.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.960
And I promised those guys I
wouldn't tell people exactly

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.890
where it's at, because this is
one of the most dangerous base

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.630
jumps in North America.

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.240
It's in very southern,
very remote Utah.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.470
I'll just say that.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.890
It's a 3,200-foot cliff.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:32.880
And we had a helicopter.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:34.040
It was a pretty big expense.

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.260
"ABC News," "Nightline" was
doing a piece on these guys

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.280
and how they deal with
danger and stuff.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.930
And so it was a huge kind of
thing. they had like seven

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.880
guys from "Nightline" out
there filming this.

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.340
There were three jumpers.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.510
If you've seen the last
"Transformers" movie, these

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.380
are the three guys that were in
"Transformers 3," jumping

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.470
through downtown Chicago.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.930
Anyway, these guys are
incredibly talented.

00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:59.770
They've done like
17,000 jumps.

00:28:59.770 --> 00:29:02.310
It's not like they just walk
out there and put a suit on

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:04.080
and jump off a cliff.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.170
So we get out there, and the
weird thing with this shoot is

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:08.640
I was going to be there
for three days.

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.520
We were supposed to
shoot at dawn.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:15.190
It was howling like 70 miles an
hour wind, all night, all

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:16.740
day the day before.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:18.890
And the morning we woke
up, it was like 60

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:19.440
mile an hour winds.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.660
This is not going to happen.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.500
You're not jumping off a cliff
in 60 mile an hour winds.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:28.730
So somehow the winds died down
to like five miles an hour at

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:29.980
10 o'clock.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:31.245
So we thought, let's
go for it.

00:29:31.245 --> 00:29:33.810
The helicopter came up
from Salt Lake City.

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:37.160
And we got up to the
top of the cliff.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:40.270
And they got three jumps in
each, which is pretty amazing.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:44.470
Then the wind started up
a couple hours later.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.810
The guys from ABC requested that
they use smoke canisters

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:49.850
so they could actually
see them.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:54.180
There was one ABC film
cameraman on top.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:55.640
And there were a couple
lying down at the

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.230
bottom, 3,000 feet away.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:30:00.355
So you can imagine, 3,000
feet away, it's a

00:30:00.355 --> 00:30:02.130
freaking dot in the sky.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.315
You can't see anything.

00:30:03.315 --> 00:30:05.920
And for me, there was really no
shot from the ground that

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.450
was going to be that exciting,
as a still photographer.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.100
So I elected to go up to
the top with them.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.140
They had another cameraman
shooting from a helicopter.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.180
But it was tough, because these
guys are moving so fast

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.100
after they fall off the cliff.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.130
They're going like 120 miles
an hour within a second.

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.190
So anyway, what I did
is, there's all

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.510
these little bushes.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.150
And being a climber, that's why
I went up top, because I

00:30:26.150 --> 00:30:29.140
thought I could rappel off the
top of the cliff and kind of

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.620
be underneath them
as they come over

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:31.400
the edge of the cliff.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.740
So we get up there.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.830
There's not a single
rock in sight.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:37.040
There's nothing to tie off
to, except for these like

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:38.960
two-foot-tall bushes.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.710
And they're like this thick.

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:42.540
So what did I do?

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.280
I tied off like 15 of them.

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.940
And I slowly down-climbed over
the edge of the cliff down to

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.690
a little ledge, never weighting
the rope fully.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.150
Because I was like, that's not
going to hold anything.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.630
Anyway, it was a little
exciting, in that respect.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:59.660
And they jumped with these
canisters, which the bad thing

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.400
about these canisters were,
they'd have to pull it before

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.340
they jumped.

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:05.430
And there's like this
little platform.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.270
It's like standing on the
edge of this table on

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:10.110
a 3,200 foot cliff.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.080
And they've got to kind of
compose themselves after they

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.330
pull the cork before
they jump.

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:16.550
And so they're just basically
jumping out of a cloud.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:20.750
So you can't even really tell
what's going on in the image.

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:23.430
They each went individually,
too, because it

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:24.580
was a little windy.

00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:26.500
So it wasn't one of those jumps
where they could all

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.900
three go at the same time.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.480
And hence, I didn't
mount any remote

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.440
cameras because of that.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.370
Let me back up for a second.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:35.820
The other fact is-- you can't
see it in this image,

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.840
necessarily.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.300
Like 1,000 feet down, basically,
the first thing

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.550
they do is they go to the edge,
they drop a rock, and

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.850
count how many seconds
it takes for the

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:46.480
rock to hit the ground.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.280
Well, this one, in five seconds,
hit a ledge that was

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.670
60 feet wide, flat,
1,000 feet down.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:56.590
So they're like, we've got to
start flying away from the

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.650
wall within five seconds.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.830
Otherwise we're going
to hit that ledge at

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:01.390
100 miles an hour.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.180
And then right after they
get away from the

00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:04.600
wall, it's the canyon--

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.545
you'll see from the
next picture.

00:32:06.545 --> 00:32:08.760
So the ledge is hard to see.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.160
It's down here.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.120
And the canyon looks really
wide at this point.

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.640
This is a fisheye shot.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.980
They had to make a 90-degree
left-hand turn right after

00:32:16.980 --> 00:32:19.180
they get away from the ledge
so they don't fly into the

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.260
other side of the canyon.

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.513
So super technical drop, which
is why they told me not to

00:32:24.513 --> 00:32:26.750
tell anybody the location.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:28.815
They only did it three times,
because it was so technical.

00:32:28.815 --> 00:32:32.800
They said it was like a triple
black diamond ski jump.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.520
Anyway, so the second time
around, after begging them not

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.890
to use the smoke canisters,
they didn't

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.340
use the smoke canisters.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:40.980
And that's when I
got this shot.

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.390
And to improve my odds of
getting shots-- because

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:45.120
literally for this assignment,
I had nine

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.040
seconds to get the images.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.620
Because after second,
they're gone.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.980
It's over.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.700
And they each went three
times, so three

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.330
times three, nine.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:59.110
So I had two remote cameras
set up on either side.

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:01.100
And then I would shoot with
one camera and had a

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.730
PocketWizard radio transmitter

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:04.010
triggering those other cameras.

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:08.510
So at least I would get three
angles of view on each jump.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.090
And this is the one I
got with my camera.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:12.350
And that seemed to be the
best shot of the day.

00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:15.870
But pretty amazing, going
out these guys.

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:18.850
I was trying to follow them with
a 7200 as they went down

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:20.570
the cliff line.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:23.930
I only got like 1 out of 12
shots where the guy was even

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.210
in the frame, because they
were moving so fast.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.860
And that just kind of shows
you the trajectory.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.890
This is the same guy
as he goes down.

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.030
So what ended up happening,
I think they got

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.320
90 seconds of air.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.580
And they landed somewhere
right out

00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:41.130
there on this riverbed.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:44.120
So you can see that it's crazy
with these guys are doing.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.450
It's amazing.

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:47.860
I mean, people ask me, like
all these extreme

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:48.610
sports that I do.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:50.740
This is the only sport I've
photographed that I would ever

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.350
call extreme.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.940
All the other adventure sports
seem pretty doable.

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:58.570
This one, as a climber,
I wanted to jump

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.160
off that cliff bad.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.430
I really thought, man,
this is so cool.

00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:04.570
But you know, I'd have to spend
the next three, four

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:07.940
years of my life dedicated to
that sport to do it safely.

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:12.090
And this is a shot of one of the
guys, Miles Daisher, being

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:13.030
interviewed.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.179
Super passionate guy.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.449
Interesting thing, these
guys are all married.

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:20.389
One of them has kids.

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:24.699
All their wives were base
jumpers or had done

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:25.620
parachuting at one point.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.710
So they understood the game.

00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:29.460
And they were basically asking
them all these questions

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.260
about, well, how do you
guys deal with risk?

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:33.909
Do you talk about this with
your wives and stuff?

00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:35.870
There's been a few of their
friends die in the last few

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:37.780
years at Red Bull as well.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.820
So it's dicey.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:43.210
But you know, these guys have
the experience to make it

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:46.830
safe, or at least deal
with the risks.

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:49.750
So on to surfing.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:53.810
As I said earlier, I met Brian
Bielmann through my book, a

00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:54.620
surf photographer.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.969
He's been shooting surfing
for 25 years.

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.130
Inside the surf world, they
call him the godfather of

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:01.700
surfing photography.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.010
Anybody and everybody he's
been on trips with.

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.140
He was close friends with
Andy Irons, who died a

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.300
couple years ago.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.940
This shot is a shot I got one of
the first times I went out

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.340
to Hawaii and shot
at Pipeline.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:19.480
And I have to say, Pipeline,
it's amazing, this wave.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.170
And it's not amazing that it's
so famous, because it's such a

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:22.780
perfect wave.

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.600
It's really close
to the beach.

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.690
This was shot at like
9 o'clock at night.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:28.700
It was practically dark.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:30.340
But I just used a really
long shutter speed.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.460
And I shot maybe 200, 300 images
to get this one, where

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.720
there's something just a
little bit sharp there.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.400
Another shot at Pipeline.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.990
This was during the Pipeline
Masters, or Pipe Masters

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.850
competition.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.270
Yet another shot at Pipeline.

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.810
And my second trip out to the
North Shore of Oahu, I got

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:52.980
really lucky.

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.120
Because I had scheduled this
trip like a month or a month

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:55.940
and a half in advance.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.116
So being that far in advance,
I had no clue if

00:35:58.116 --> 00:35:59.320
there would be waves.

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:00.280
I just thought, you know what?

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:01.230
I need more surf pictures.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:03.090
I'm going to go out there, stay
for two weeks, and see

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:04.190
what happens.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:06.460
And this was the day before.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:08.810
When I got there, I
got off the plane.

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:10.940
As I was driving to Brian's
house on the North Shore, like

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.430
an hour away, there were all
these warnings on the radio,

00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:19.430
like, we've never seen a storm
of this size coming in.

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:22.160
Board up your home if you
live on the beaches.

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:24.900
We're evacuating all beachfront
property, because

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:28.310
we're expecting 60 to 80-foot
waves in Waimea Bay.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.620
I was like, that sounds
horrific.

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.823
But it might be great for
surfing, so anyway.

00:36:32.823 --> 00:36:34.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:37.110
MICHAEL CLARK: As it happened,
you know, like four or five

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:37.570
days later--

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.610
I can't remember exactly how
many days after I got there--

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:44.720
there started getting 20 to
30-foot waves in Waimea Bay.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.100
And there's a contest
held every year.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.500
It's the Quiksilver In Memory
of Eddie Aikau.

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.380
And Eddie Aikau was a lifeguard
on the North Shore,

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:55.000
a very famous lifeguard,
Hawaiian lifeguard, who would

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.120
swim out in basically
any size waves.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.750
And he saved people in huge
waves that got caught in some

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:00.650
of these waves.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:02.990
So the whole event is named
after him, sponsored by

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.520
Quiksilver--

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.800
hence the strange name,
if you're not

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.430
familiar with surfing.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:10.730
And the deal with the Eddie
Aikau is the waves have to be

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.160
20-foot Hawaiian or bigger.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.810
So the way they talk about
waves in Hawaii, which is

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:18.470
different than everywhere else
in the world, is that they

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.440
measure the back of the wave,
not the front of the wave.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.900
So a 20-foot wave in Hawaiian
is 40 feet or more

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.120
front of the wave.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.940
So like, here in California,
you would measure the waves

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:28.970
from the front, so you would
have maybe a six or seven-foot

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:31.320
wave on an average decent day.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.330
For this event to even run, it
had to be 40-foot waves on the

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.770
wave faces.

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:40.100
So here's a good 30-footer
the day before the event.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.450
And just to show you how
this one was worked up.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:46.420
This is the final image.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.940
I'm with a 900-millimeter lens,
maybe 3/4 of a mile away

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.600
from the wave, standing
on the shore.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.200
Unless you're on a jet ski or
something out there, there's

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.450
not really any way
to get out there.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.970
You can swim out, but once the
waves start getting this big,

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:00.640
it gets a little exciting.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.170
So anyway, this giant wave.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:06.730
There's a ton of salt spray
between me and that.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:09.660
So this is how the image
came out of the camera.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.040
Again, nothing to write
home about.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.830
But I knew this was going to
happen, because there was just

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.510
so much water vapor between
me and the wave.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:21.260
So in Lightroom, this is how
I manipulate the image in

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:23.960
Lightroom, basically adjusting
the contrast sliders and kind

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.620
of bringing the contrast
and color saturation

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:28.070
back into the image.

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:30.190
And this is how it changed from
Lightroom to Photoshop.

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.300
So it's a very slight
difference from

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:32.700
Lightroom to Photoshop.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.890
If you know Photoshop, it's
basically just a levels

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:36.845
adjustment and a little bit of
fine-tuning on the saturation

00:38:36.845 --> 00:38:38.240
there to get that.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:42.540
But coming from that, that's a
pretty amazing difference.

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.750
Apple ended up using this
image a few years ago to

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:50.030
promote their MacBooks, I
think, on their website.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.170
So this is the actual day of
the Eddie Aikau event.

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.390
These guys-- this is a small
wave from that day.

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:57.670
This maybe only a 30--
or, I don't know.

00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:58.720
That's probably a 40-footer.

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.586
It's hard to tell, because you
can't see the bottom of the

00:39:00.586 --> 00:39:02.520
wave, because at this point, the
wave hasn't even formed,

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.980
just as he just took off,
the top of the wave.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.370
And you can tell, he's not
touching anything except for

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:09.180
the spray at the
back of there.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:11.630
He didn't hit the
wave until here.

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:14.460
So pretty much everybody that
was catching waves-- and they

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:16.560
weren't using jet
skis this day.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.090
There's no jet skis allowed
in the competition.

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.500
So they were paddling into
these waves, which are

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:22.450
technically some of the biggest
waves ever paddled

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.080
into by human beings.

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.510
So he free-fell off the top of
the wave for 15 to 20 feet

00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:29.290
before he even hit the water.

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:32.600
And at that point, the water was
pretty much vertical until

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:34.270
he got to the bottom
of the wave.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:37.000
And this is a smaller wave
from earlier in the day.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.990
So you kind of see, here's
a little bigger wave,

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.760
later in the day.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.510
This is like a 55-foot, maybe.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:42.670
It's hard to tell.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.720
55 to 60, 50 to 60 range,
somewhere in there.

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.330
It's Sunny Garcia.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:50.770
This is definitely one of the
biggest waves of the day.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.010
They were all kind of in that
50 to 60-foot range, for the

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.070
biggest waves of the day.

00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:59.270
But for paddling into a wave,
that's just monster size.

00:39:59.270 --> 00:40:02.910
Anyway, this is also shot
from the shore.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:04.260
Pretty much looked
just like this.

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.850
This was a little clearer than
the day before, so there

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:07.540
wasn't as much water vapor.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:11.590
I think I was using a is 500
f/4 with a 1.5 on it.

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.290
So it was basically
a 750 millimeter

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.780
lens, and a motor drive.

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.270
This is a shot of Andy Irons.

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:19.760
And this is kind of
a weird shot.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.010
The funny story with this--

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.470
we were sitting on one point
right in front of the wave

00:40:27.470 --> 00:40:29.580
when I was shooting some
of those earlier shots.

00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:31.940
And then at another part of
the day, I walked over to

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.690
completely the other
side of the wave.

00:40:33.690 --> 00:40:36.840
And there was only me and one
other guy, shooting video with

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.050
a giant red camera.

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:40.460
So I was the only
guy over there.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:44.000
And what would happen is, the
wave breaks about 3/4 of a

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.370
mile offshore, collapses,
then reforms, then

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.310
collapses, then reforms.

00:40:49.310 --> 00:40:51.920
And that last wave is basically
a beach break.

00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:54.480
And it's like 50 yards
off the beach.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.970
And those are very rare, to
catch a barrel doing that.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:40:59.010
So this is a picture of Andy
Irons catching that barrel

00:40:59.010 --> 00:40:59.740
right on the beach.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.300
He was one of only two guys
the whole day to catch a

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.100
barrel right on the beach.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:07.710
I was the only guy to
get the shot, so.

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:12.410
When I was editing 3,000, 4,000
shots later that night,

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.270
I was zipping through them,
and my friend Brian was

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:16.520
looking over my shoulder.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.530
And he saw this image.

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.150
And I'm like, that's horrible.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.800
Look at all that
jumbled water.

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.070
It's not very aesthetically
pleasing.

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:25.380
Like, Mike, you don't
understand.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:26.390
This doesn't happen!

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:30.250
This is Andy Irons on a beach
break wave in the Eddie Aikau.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.970
So he pimped out this image,
and it got published

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:34.470
all over the place.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:37.780
And because I'm not a surfer,
I didn't know that this was

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.260
like some iconic image.

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:42.360
I still look at it, and I'm
like, that's not very good

00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.740
compared to, you know,
one of this.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:48.190
But you know, that's just
not knowing this sport.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.530
So last year.

00:41:49.530 --> 00:41:51.470
While writing this book, I've
wanted to go to Tahiti for a

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.240
long time, and Brian told me,
Mike, if you want to get the

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:54.850
best surfing images you ever
going to get in your whole

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.380
life, go to Tahiti.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.290
Because you can sit on this
wave break, Teahupo'o--

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:02.270
or Cheo-pu is how the
locals call it.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:05.820
Breaks right off the shore,
it's like a mile off

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.060
the beach on a reef.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.900
The reef is literally like a
few feet under the water.

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.870
And it's right in front
of the wave.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:14.390
So if the wave's braking where
the wall is back there, 40

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.430
feet away, the reef's
right here.

00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.380
So if you make a mistake,
you're going to

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:19.940
pay for it big time.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.760
People have had their faces
ripped off there.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.800
A lot of people have
died there.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.900
"Teahupo'o" means "broken
skulls" in Tahitian.

00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:31.100
So those are some Tahitian
kayakers.

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.880
Kayaking is a huge
sport in Tahiti.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.450
When I got there, I was
basically writing the book

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:36.350
sitting on a beach.

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:38.510
You know, the beginning of the
trip was fairly glamorous,

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.380
because I was sitting on the
beach, writing the book,

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.490
whatever, doing nothing in
this tiny little fishing

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:45.360
village on the opposite side
of any tourist thing.

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:46.380
And you had to stay
with locals.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.990
There was no hotels on this side
of the island, so it's

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:51.230
very difficult to stay over on
that side of the island.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.115
But literally, the village
is named Teahupo'o too.

00:42:53.115 --> 00:42:55.580
And the wave is basically
right here.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:57.050
And you can see, it's
totally flat.

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.060
There was nothing happening
when I first got there.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.920
So I was just shooting
pictures of whatever

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.480
the first few days.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.730
And this is the wave.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.210
The wave isn't very big in this
picture, even though you

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:09.210
can't tell it.

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:10.850
This is probably a seven
or eight-foot wave.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.930
It just looked really cool
from that perspective.

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:15.440
And the deal was this wave is
that it's so far out to sea,

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:18.810
you're either on a jet ski, or
in a boat, or you're swimming.

00:43:18.810 --> 00:43:20.340
Because you can't shoot
it from shore.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.760
You can barely even see it from
shore, unless it's huge.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.850
So you're going over the
shoulder of the wave every

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:27.380
time it's coming by.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.550
And that's what was
happening here.

00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:30.570
I was in a boat.

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:31.430
And here's just an idea.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.770
You can see some of the
photographers swimming.

00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:35.310
And this is a little bigger.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:39.810
It's an overhead wave, maybe
8 to 12 feet tall,

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.400
decent-sized wave.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.550
The trick with this wave,
though, is it

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:43.800
moves incredibly fast.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:46.200
So even though it's not as big
as some of the bigger waves in

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.270
Hawaii, the back of the wave is
pretty much level with the

00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:52.330
top of the wave.

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:55.500
So it sucks it off the reef
and just snaps down like a

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.680
shark's mouth on top
of the surfer.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.720
So even catching the wave is
really difficult, because it

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.230
forces it up so fast.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:03.225
So it's a very hard wave.

00:44:03.225 --> 00:44:05.350
And there's not many people
surfing this wave, unless

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:09.230
they're pro surfers, when
it gets to this size.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.850
Also, being a photographer in
the water is pretty sketchy

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:15.890
here, because remember, that
reef's just in front of you.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.510
And if you get pushed
onto that reef, it's

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:18.410
going to be a bad day.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:20.610
I saw a few photographers crack
their camera housings

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.830
and come back bleeding.

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:25.520
Here's a little bigger wave.

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.760
The bottom of the wave is still
like five feet below

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.540
where he's at right there.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.130
This was another surfing
competition.

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:34.690
I shot these before the surfing
competition started.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:35.940
This was shot from the boat.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.560
And you can tell I'm above his
position, because we're

00:44:39.560 --> 00:44:41.350
already up on the shoulder
of the wave looking

00:44:41.350 --> 00:44:43.930
down into the wave.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.660
The day before the competition,

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:47.690
they had the top--

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:51.190
I think it's 36 surfers
in the pro series.

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:52.730
They had what they called
a free surf.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.720
It's the first time they'd
ever done it in Tahiti.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.520
So basically all the
pro surfers could

00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.010
come out and surf.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:58.910
And it was a decent day.

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.820
It was probably 20-foot
waves on the face.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:02.880
This is Kelly Slater.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.400
He put on an exhibition.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.990
It's like he barely
even touched his

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.680
surfboard that day.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.730
Everybody was just sitting
there, like,

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:08.710
how did he do that?

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:11.450
He was just cruising
all over the place.

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:13.810
Another picture of Kelly
on Teahupo'o.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:17.020
So you can see the back of the
wave just keeps going.

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.620
It doesn't like go down,
like you would

00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:20.730
normally see on a wave.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:23.305
There's an insane amount of
volume snapping over you.

00:45:23.305 --> 00:45:25.400
So if you mess up, there's
huge consequences on this

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:29.250
wave, even though it's smaller
than your average wave.

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:31.950
Now getting back to
land-based stuff.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:34.790
I did another shot for Red
Bull with paragliding.

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:37.424
And this guy--

00:45:37.424 --> 00:45:38.570
oh, what's his name?

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:39.662
I can't remember.

00:45:39.662 --> 00:45:45.020
He was training for the Transalp
Race in Europe.

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:51.060
And basically, we did the
shoot in Salt Lake City.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:55.550
For this race, you have to hike
or fly from somewhere in

00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:57.690
Austria all the way to southern

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.330
France, through the Alps.

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:01.260
So it's an insane race.

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:03.570
So he's super fit, and we
did this photo shoot

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:04.800
in Salt Lake City.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:09.150
This is the first strobed
image of a paraglider, I

00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:10.360
think, that's ever been done.

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:12.290
I'd never seen one before,
and we tried to do it.

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:15.100
So I'm standing on a ridge with
an assistant strobing him

00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.830
in early morning light.

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:18.850
And you can tell the
background's blurred, because

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:22.010
I'm using a long shutter
speed to bleed it in.

00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:22.960
This is another one.

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:26.070
Chris Santacroce is the other
paraglider we were shooting.

00:46:26.070 --> 00:46:27.470
He's doing what's called
a wingover.

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:29.910
So he's flying over the
top of his wave.

00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:31.860
Not recommended.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:32.990
He's one of the few guys
in the world who

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.400
could even do it.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.200
And we had all these problems,
just, you know, being a pro

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.750
again, it rained entirely
the first day.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.410
So that's why I shot
this portrait.

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:43.910
We just shot portraits the
entire first day, because it

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:45.100
was just pouring outside.

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.810
Then the next day, we got lucky
with some light and lots

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:48.860
of clouds and stuff.

00:46:48.860 --> 00:46:52.330
And then the third day, I got
to go up in a paraglider and

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:53.680
shoot from paraglider
to paraglider,

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:54.340
which was kind of fun.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.760
I'm not sure the image
was as good as some

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.010
of the other ones.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.520
And then we flew over some
of the mountains

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.140
above Salt Lake City.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.250
So just to show you
some variety.

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:06.140
I think I'm running
out of time here.

00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:07.790
So I'll go a little faster.

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.770
Here are some of the images
from this "Men's Fitness"

00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:11.610
article with a helicopter
search and rescue team.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:15.010
These guys are up in Santa
Rosa, the Henry One.

00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:16.500
And this is one of their
guys hanging 100

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:17.410
feet off the bottom.

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:19.340
They basically pluck people out
of the ocean, pluck people

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.320
off cliffs.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.560
So I positioned one of the
copilots on one of their

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.695
training runs on this little
cliff, and you know, inched

00:47:26.695 --> 00:47:29.500
him out a little more than he
was probably comfortable with.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.750
Then I hung off the
cliff below him as

00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:34.770
they picked him up.

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:35.950
This is an interesting thing.

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:39.360
I'd just gotten the new
Nikon D3 and D700.

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.920
And it was like 9:30 at night.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.870
There was basically
no light left.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:46.550
So I thought, these things are
supposed to be great, these

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:47.320
high ISOs,

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:47.950
let's try it Out.

00:47:47.950 --> 00:47:52.040
So I slapped my 7200 on there,
cranked it up to ISO 6400,

00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.000
shot like 50 shots of
this helicopter

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.050
going across the ocean.

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.420
And I had a walkie-talkie so I
could kind of control where

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.640
they were going to
some degree.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:03.840
And amazingly, I got a shot
that was in focus and not

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:05.650
completely blurred.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:09.220
And this image, I think
there's two strobes, a

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:12.170
headlamp, and a speedlight.

00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:14.160
I just saw this scene and they
were putting on their night

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:14.850
vision goggles.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:17.250
And I thought, let's go ahead
and get something here.

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:19.870
And 20 minutes later,
I had it set up.

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.400
And the last little piece was
that I couldn't really get

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.500
light to his face.

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.060
It was hitting this
pilot's face.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.280
So I just had him hold my
headlamp, which I pretty much

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.450
always have in my camera bag.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.450
And that's what this arm is
doing, holding a headlamp in

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:37.200
front of the heads-up display
to finish off the lighting.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.500
I think I'll zip through a
few other images here.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.610
There's a good story
with this one.

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:45.090
This is when I was shooting
the Patagonian Expedition

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:47.380
Race, which is the adventure
race I was telling you guys

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.980
about earlier.

00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:51.720
We ended up in the middle of
nowhere after hiking for four

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:53.790
days, raging seas.

00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:56.660
This fisherman and his son
were in this little bay.

00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.155
This is in the Magellan
Strait.

00:48:59.155 --> 00:49:02.420
It's at the very southern tip
of South America in Chile.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:06.070
And there were three of us--
myself, another photographer,

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.240
and a writer--

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.080
and then a Chilean guide
who was with us.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.040
We were all about to
go hypothermic.

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:14.360
Because they had pulled us out
into this bay, said, we'll

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.990
pick you up in this boat, we'll
take you to the end of

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:18.460
the race to cover this other
part of the race.

00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.820
Anyway, they never showed up,
but this boat was there, by

00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:21.430
some miracle.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:24.130
Because we're still 600
miles from anything.

00:49:24.130 --> 00:49:26.060
And so we call over
to their boat.

00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.290
They pick us up.

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:30.510
We end up spending 36 hours
with these guys.

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:34.720
And this is Angel, he's 54, and
his son Steve, who is 36.

00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:37.480
Both of them look like
they're about 83.

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.350
They were very weathered
faces.

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:42.910
He spent 15 hours a day under
the ocean in a one-inch

00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:46.020
wetsuit, which you can see,
cutting this stuff called

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.160
luga, in Spanish.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.450
I think it's red algae
is what it was.

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:50.600
We never really figured out
exactly what it was--

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.910
off the bottom of the ocean,
breathing out of a garden

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:55.720
hose, no compressor.

00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.370
They had a compressor
but I mean, no

00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:58.250
regulator or anything.

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:00.040
Just a cut-off garden
hose, that was

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.630
his breathing apparatus.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:05.980
So the second day, he went down
and got a king crab for

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.140
us for lunch.

00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:09.340
We wanted to photograph
these guys working.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:10.030
And they wanted lunch.

00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:13.030
So we're like, yeah, king
crab sounds great.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:14.950
So this is him hanging over
the boat, watching us

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:17.760
get the king crab.

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.170
All right.

00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:21.050
Let me go on here, show
the other images.

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:23.740
And just so you can see
how I market myself.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.860
Obviously the website's home
base to everything these days.

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.920
I also produce a newsletter,
which these are some of the

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.760
covers of the newsletter.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.180
It's a PDF newsletter.

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.877
They're free on my website,
michaelclarkphoto.com, which

00:50:35.877 --> 00:50:38.250
I'll show here at the end.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.320
You can go download those.

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.670
Those include equipment reviews,
stories behind the

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:48.290
images, kind of what I've been
talking about, digital tips,

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.880
editorial--

00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:50.530
a whole bunch of other stuff.

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:52.870
I started producing these 10
years ago as just like a

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:56.060
printed one-side, front-and-back
mailer to

00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.965
remind my clients I
still existed so

00:50:57.965 --> 00:50:59.540
they'd hire me for jobs.

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:01.900
And now it's exploded into its
own little mini-magazine.

00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.530
It's between 20 and 30 pages
every time I do it.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:06.180
It's quarterly.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.280
And it goes out to about
6,000 people now.

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.320
So it's just a way for me to
stay in touch with my clients

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.780
and also all the subscribers
that sign up for it.

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:16.120
And if you send me an email,
I'll put you on the list, and

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.730
you'll get the newsletter
whenever I get around to

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:20.590
writing it, which is
usually quarterly.

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:23.761
Sometimes it's only three
times a year.

00:51:23.761 --> 00:51:25.420
And This gives you an idea
of what's in it.

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:28.030
Like this is a little story
about that shot.

00:51:28.030 --> 00:51:32.020
There's equipment reviews of
some the Nikon lenses.

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:36.380
There's an interview with
"National Geographic" photo

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:39.670
editor Sabine Meyer in
one of the issues.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:41.195
This is my other book that I was
talking about earlier, the

00:51:41.195 --> 00:51:42.990
"Adventure Photography" book.

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:45.315
And I also have a Digital
Workflow e-book that you can

00:51:45.315 --> 00:51:47.600
purchase on my website if you're
needing some Digital

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.530
Workflow help.

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:49.430
And that's pretty much it.

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:50.832
Thank you for having me out.

00:51:50.832 --> 00:51:58.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:59.010
MARK: Thank you, Michael.

00:51:59.010 --> 00:52:00.360
That was a really good talk.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.665
I consider shooting a birthday
party with five-year-olds

00:52:02.665 --> 00:52:04.840
about as adventurous as
I get, so this is

00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:06.420
very, very, very humbling.

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.560
I appreciate it.

00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:10.530
So we do have a little bit
of time for Q&amp;A if folks

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:11.230
want to come here.

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:13.140
I know you have your book that
you want to give away.

00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.410
Not for free.

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:16.050
I think people are going to have
to work for it a little

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:17.890
bit, so maybe we'll work
that in as well.

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:20.400
But if you do have a question,
please come up to the mic.

00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.280
AUDIENCE: So how many pictures
do you actually

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:23.840
do Photoshop work?

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:29.010
Or what percentage of pictures
you don't edit at all?

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:30.500
Like how much?

00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:32.270
MICHAEL CLARK: It varies
with the shoot.

00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:34.010
So like some of those
surfing images.

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:37.880
Surfing, every time a surfer's
on a wave, you just hold the

00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:39.610
trigger down and you're blasting
at eight to ten

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:41.280
frames a second or more.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.420
And so you could
have thousands.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:45.140
I think the Tahiti trip, I had
12,000 images from 10 days of

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:48.480
shooting, which is the most I
had ever shot in 10 days.

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:52.990
Sometimes a portrait, I
might take 50 shots.

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:54.870
And I might only work
up one or two.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:55.460
So it depends on the shoot.

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:58.280
With the Tahiti thing, I think
I worked up maybe 100.

00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:01.550
So that trip to Tahiti, I only
worked up 100 images out of

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:05.170
12,000 or 11,000.

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:08.770
It's very small, like less than
1% probably, 1% to 2%.

00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:10.270
It depends on how good
the shoot was.

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:13.510
Like that Danny MacAskill shoot,
I think I worked up a

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:15.170
few hundred out of a
couple thousand.

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:17.280
So that was a bigger percentage,
just because we

00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.190
got more interesting images.

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:20.450
AUDIENCE: Hi, great talk.

00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:23.540
What percentage of the time do
you think you use like prime

00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.730
lenses, fixed focal
length lenses as

00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:27.110
opposed to zoom lenses?

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:30.220
And have you, in the situations
that would warrant

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:33.190
more of a prime lens kind of
approach, have you ever

00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:35.860
considered using different
cameras, such as rangefinder

00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:38.030
cameras, like Leicas and
things like that?

00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:41.060
Because personally, I've found
the optics to just be

00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:46.180
ridiculous on a Leica,
compared to a Nikon.

00:53:46.180 --> 00:53:48.010
MICHAEL CLARK: Back in the film
days, I used to have a

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:51.060
Hasselblad set-up, which I had
all fixed lenses on that.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.430
And I'd use that a fair bit,
sometimes even for action.

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:58.460
For my photography now, like
my fisheye is a fixed.

00:53:58.460 --> 00:53:59.610
I've got an 85 fixed.

00:53:59.610 --> 00:54:01.720
I've got some tilt-shift
fixed.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:04.210
Most of the stuff's shot with
zooms, just because it allows

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:06.500
me more freedom and to carry
less gear, which is sometimes

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.160
a really big deal.

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:11.830
Even the telephoto stuff,
I have a 200 to 400.

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:13.030
So I have a balance.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:16.985
But my zooms are my mainstays
for a lot of this stuff.

00:54:16.985 --> 00:54:18.370
The new Nikons are
pretty amazing.

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:20.640
I mean, they're not Leica
quality lenses, but they're

00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:22.325
not far off, from
what I've found.

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:23.852
I don't know.

00:54:23.852 --> 00:54:27.120
And most of my clients demand
digital, so shooting film is

00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.834
kind of a nightmare, because
then you have to scan the film

00:54:28.834 --> 00:54:29.090
and that takes forever.

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:32.870
AUDIENCE: But I mean, Leica
has had two generations of

00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:33.810
digital cameras.

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:35.230
And they're coming
onto their third.

00:54:35.230 --> 00:54:35.940
MICHAEL CLARK: And they're
great, for sure.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:39.100
But for action photography, they
don't have auto-focus.

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:40.140
They're not really
designed-- for

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:41.970
mountaineering, they're awesome.

00:54:41.970 --> 00:54:44.971
So it just depends on
the application.

00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:46.680
So anyway, thank you guys.

00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.987
[APPLAUSE]
