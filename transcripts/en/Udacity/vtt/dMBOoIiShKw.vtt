00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is we don't need to resort to proof by intimidation in this case.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We can prove this by dividing by P i.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So what happens when we divide by P i?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well the left side--we have this product of primes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So we're going to still have this product of primes, now removing P i from the product.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
plus the 1 which is now divided by P i

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and we divided P i out of P i times Q so we have Q here.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is our contradiction.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Q is an integer.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is an integer.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
P i cannot be 1 because it's a prime.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It must be some integer 2 or greater.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So that means that this is not a whole number.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So there's no way we could get an integer as Q by adding something

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that is not an integer to an integer.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Thus we've shown that there are infinitely many primes

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
by contradicting our assumption that there was a limited set of primes.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This isn't quite enough to be happy that we can generate large prime numbers when we need them.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We need to know how dense the primes are and how to find a large prime.
