Do you have any good your
mama's so broke jokes?

Your mama's so broke,
she got a sugar daddy.

Oh, sorry.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.554 size:63% position:31%
I just
only know reality.

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:23.623 size:63% position:69%
And mama's out there
just buying Kias.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.391 align:start size:91% position:9%
What the hell?

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:26.759 align:start size:59% position:41%
Are you all right?

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:28.428 align:start position:0%
No, I'm high as [bleep]

Well, Tiffany, you can have
a nice lay-down,

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.535 align:start size:72% position:28%
but tell me what to do.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.171 align:start position:0%
I would just be like,
"Girl, that's your mama."

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.739 size:78% position:39%
'Cause you got
to think about it like --

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:42.842 align:start position:0%
Okay, she stayed in that lady
for nine months, right?

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:46.012
Her mom was pregnant with her
for nine months.
Right.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:49.449 size:78% position:39%
Okay, now, if you just go
buy a womb -- okay? --

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:53.052 size:66% position:33%
it's like $10,000
for the insemination.

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:54.220 size:78% position:39%
Then,
once the person pregnant,

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:55.721
then I think
it's another $10,000 a month.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:58.091 size:81% position:59%
The first $10,000,
that was the move-in cost?

00:00:58.124 --> 00:00:59.225 align:start position:0%
That's the move-in fee.

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:03.496 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's the first
and last months.

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:05.064 align:start position:0%
It depends on the womb,

00:01:05.097 --> 00:01:08.101 align:start position:0%
but anywhere between
$2,000 and $10,000 a month.

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.602 size:66% position:67%
If the mom had to get
a C-section,

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:10.670 size:63% position:69%
does that mean
the daughter

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.005 size:78% position:61%
lost her security deposit
on the womb?

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:14.907
-That part.
-Right?

She messed that pussy up.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.448 size:78% position:39% line:83%
So then, she -- she don't
get that $10,000 back.

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.448 align:start size:44% position:56%
Oh, my God.

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.016 align:end position:100%
She doesn't get it back
because of damages?

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.519 align:start position:0%
Yes, you're not getting that --
You don't get that back.

a little home wrecker.
