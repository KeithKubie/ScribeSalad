00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.820
Let's construct the route for
our new menu item.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.800
Now when I visit /restaurant and
pass in an integer, and then /new,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.320
this integer will get passed in as the
new restaurant_id for the newMenuItem

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.880
function and successfully return
that task one is complete.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.557
The editMenuItem takes
in two parameters, so

00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:22.085
we need to make sure our route also has
two parameters, the restaurant_id and

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:24.420
the menu_id and then /edit.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.800
Now, we'll see that
this page also works.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.300
Similarly to the edit route,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.250
the delete route looks just about
the same except it has /delete.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.400
Now our final route is also working.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.980
The solutions for this challenge
are available in the instructor notes.
