00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.800
Before discussing the standards,
we need to differentiate

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.580
between a declarative versus
a procedural specification.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.910
To do this, we'll use baking a cake.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.070
Well, you know how to do that,
don't you?

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.120
The declarative statement
expresses the desired results, but

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.740
does not say how to achieve it.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.548
The procedural statement provides
a recipe for achieving the goal.

00:00:25.548 --> 00:00:29.650
Think back to the to the curly braces
problem with the Arden Syntax.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.835
It's really the same thing.

00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:37.660
Arden provides a declarative
standard but the procedure would be

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.900
different depending on the system
that is the source of the data.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.280
The hQuery Gateway similarly receives
a standard query on one side,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.440
but knows how to get
it done on the other.
