00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.370
Complete mediation actually comes about,
or we have that,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.140
because of one other thing
the operating system does.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.250
So at user level,
we have what we call virtual resources.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.290
We don't have physical resources.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.200
There is no way for
user code to actually name or be able to

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.660
target a physical resource, or
ask for a physical resource.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.580
There you have only virtual resources,
and the operating system actually

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.250
gives you an API in how those
virtual resources can be used.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.150
An example of this is that for
storing persistent data, we have file

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.800
abstraction, or virtual resource for
storing persistent data is a file.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.760
So you don't access a disk lock.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.970
The operating system does disk IO, and
schedule requests to read the blocks,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.700
and services interrupts,
and things like that.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.495
It can interact through
the disk controller.

00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:57.711
Through those instructions
we're talking about.

00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:00.141
But you cannot from user space.

00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.299
You can only ask for
access to files either opening them or

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.960
reading them or writing them.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.810
And things like that.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.190
So at the user level,

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.770
we don't have ways of directly
talking to the disk controller,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.740
the low level hardware functions
that operating system has access to.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.050
We only have these virtual resources.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.520
As a result of that, remember virtual
resources are what the name says.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.290
They are not the real resources,

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.400
they have to be implemented
using physical resource.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.990
The file has to be implemented
with a bunch of disc locks

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.908
where the file data is stored.

00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:41.370
So the virtual resource has to be
translated to physical handles or

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.560
resources.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.570
For example, buffers or
file data is stored on things like that.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.750
And this translation is done,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.710
from virtual to physical, implementation
is done by the operating system.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.390
If you want to access a disc block or
a phase of memory,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.400
you have to start with
either a file descriptor, or

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.560
you start with a logical address we're
talking about, or the virtual address.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.220
And the translation from
virtual to physical

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.520
is the first step before you
can get to the physical.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.320
Only the operating system
knows how to do that.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.180
Or has the metadata, or has the control
information, that can be used for

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.320
this translation.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.010
So this level of sort of indirection
that we add where you have

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.360
one kind of namespace and the underlying
resources have a different namespace.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.890
And the translation can only be
done by the operating system, or

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.095
the trusted computing base.

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:39.170
Well that helps you get
complete mediation,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.230
because you first need to go
have the translation done.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.250
Okay, then you have to go to
the trusted computing base,

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.970
so the complete mediation gets
implemented right then and there,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.050
because you're coming to it, and
asking for a physical resource.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.820
So it could be the reference monitor.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.480
It can check at that point,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.780
that whatever that you are asking for,
do you have access to it?
