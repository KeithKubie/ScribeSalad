00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.490
It 
was a weak ground ball to third base that

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.640
ended over a century’s worth of baseball
futility.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.720
On November 3, 2016, the Chicago Cubs won
their first World Series in 108 years.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.390
Much like the Red Sox win in 2004 that also
put the brakes on a similar streak, it propelled

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.070
the Cubs into another stratosphere in terms
of popularity.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.120
The following April, according to the Los
Angeles Times, four of the top five player

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.260
jersey sales were Cubs.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.910
Players appeared on talk shows and late night
comedy sketches.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.360
Even the backup catcher had his moment in
the sun, with a second-place finish on Dancing

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.410
with the Stars.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.600
Despite this popularity, many people don’t
know why the Chicago Cubs are named after

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.850
a baby bear.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.400
After all, there are no longer any wild bears
in Illinois.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.290
Here’s the story of how they got that name
and the sad story of their real life bear

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.100
mascots who used to join them in the dugout.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.990
Cap_ansonIn February of 1876, Chicago businessman
William Hulbert (known for grocery stores

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.250
and selling coal) formed the National League
of Professional Baseball Clubs.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.950
His Chicago White Stockings – called such
because of the color of their uniforms and

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.390
socks – were one of eight charter members,
along with teams from Boston, Cincinnati,

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.780
Louisville, New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis
and Hartford.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.990
Play began in April that year with A.G. Spalding
(yes, of ball fame) as player/manager.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.840
Later that year, the White Stockings would
become the first National League champions.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.590
For the next decade and half, the Chicago
White Stockings dominated the league.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.200
They were lead by baseball’s first superstar,
Adrian Anson.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.420
In 1879, he was also named their captain and
manager, forever earning him the nickname

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.420
“Cap.”

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.030
The team continued to win pennant after pennant
with Anson gaining more and more influence

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.030
with the club.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.850
By 1890, he even owned 13% of the Chicago
White Stockings.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.670
That same year, a whole slew of players from
every National League team left the league

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.290
to form a more player-friendly one they dubbed,
rather unimaginatively, the “Players League.”

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.770
Because of this, Anson was forced to fill
his roster with young, inexperienced players.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.649
So, the newspapers mockingly dubbed them the
“Anson’s Colts.”

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.510
It’s important to emphasize here that at
this point in baseball history, team names

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.439
weren’t necessarily created by anyone involved
with the team.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:22.239
They were often, as we would call it, “crowdsourced”
– perhaps a newspaper writer or a fan noticed

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.020
a particular trait about the club and would
conceive a nickname based on that.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.489
Unsurprisingly from this, they could be known
by several different names.

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.989
As for “Anson’s Colts,” the name got
shortened to simply the Chicago Colts.

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.609
Anson continued to manage and play for the
Colts during the 1890s, but his numbers dwindled

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.379
slightly from his insane peak, and his arrogance
(like insisting that he play every day despite

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.629
being 45 and somewhat past his prime) rubbed
players the wrong way.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.670
His contract finally expired on February 1,
1898 and the team refused to resign him.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.950
Anson was mad, but his great playing career
was finally over.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.030
As a snide joke, local newspapers began calling
the team the Chicago Orphans in that they

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.870
lost their “father” Anson.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.879
That name, too, stuck for several years.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.739
They were also sometimes called the “Rainmakers”
because a number of their games were rained

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:09.739
out that year.

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.560
The Orphans (though, they were still called
the Colts at times) were not a particularly

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.530
memorable team from 1898 to 1901, even though
they did feature a young Frank Chance (of

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:19.530
“Tinkers to Evers to Chance” fame).

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.329
In 1901, the upstart American League raided
talent from the National League, leaving Chicago

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.680
media to again joke about their ball club’s
nickname.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.719
They now called them the “Remnants.”

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.669
By 1902, they were earning a reputation for
filling the holes left by the American League

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:37.110
with young players or, as veterans sometime
called them, “cubs.”

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.150
In a Chicago Daily News article published
on March 27, 1902 about the upcoming season,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.700
the writer referred to the team as the “Chicago
Cubs,” with the title of the piece being

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.480
“Selee Places His Men – Manager of the
Cubs is in Doubt Only on Two Positions.”

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.489
It goes on, “Frank Selee will devote his
strongest efforts on the team work of the

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.999
new Cubs this year…”

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.079
Now, it was common at this time to call young
baseball players “cubs,” but what made

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.700
this a little different was the choice to
capitalize the “C”– making it a proper

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.700
noun.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.409
There has been some speculation that this
wasn’t intentional, but perhaps a typesetting

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.099
error, given that the article content seems
to refer to the young players on the team

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.290
as the “cubs” and not the whole team.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.790
However, the sub-headline of the piece would
seem to refer to the whole team, so perhaps

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.859
it was intentional.

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.060
Either way, this caught on and for the next
several years, “Cubs” became one of the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.640
accepted names of the team, along with “Colts,”
“Orphans,” “Remnants,” and “Microbes,”

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.980
with the latter originally intended as an
insult because of the ongoing dispute between

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.250
St. Louis and Chicago about the flow of the
bacteria-filled Chicago River.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.280
However, by 1907, the team was almost universally
referred to as the Chicago Cubs.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.310
chicago-cubsThe next year, in 1908, the team
embraced the name and started taking it literally.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.540
Despite having won the World Series in 1907
and the year previous in 1906 setting a record

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.810
of winning 116 games (a mark only matched
in baseball history by the 2001 Seattle Mariners),

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.510
they thought it was necessary to have a good
luck charm in the form of a mascot.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.940
(At the time, team mascots were taken very
seriously as genuine good luck charms, rather

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:11.560
than just a marketing move for kids and the
like.)

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.420
Thus, they brought aboard a Boston bull terrier
puppy named Bud.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.220
However, fans didn’t take to a dog being
the mascot of a team commonly called the Cubs.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.880
So, the team got a person and put them in
a weird-looking polar bear suit.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.590
Fans liked that a lot more, though history
wasn’t kind to the photos of the team with

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.590
the polar bear.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.670
In 1910, the team got a real live cub to be
their mascot.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.240
That didn’t work out so well, however.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.310
At the beginning of the season, they had a
baby black bear shipped from Spokane, Washington

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.520
to Chicago.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.740
Predictably, the bear was cranky and liked
to bite the players in the dugout.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.940
So, the team took the bear cub and put him
in the dugout of their hated rivals, the Giants.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.700
Their intentions for the bear were not kind.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.940
Chicago baseball writer Charles Dryden wrote
at the time, “We hope [Giants manager John

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.420
McGraw] kicked the stuffing out of the little
beast to get even, for it has been biting

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.920
the regular Cubs on the ankle and we have
enough cripples on the team.”

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.730
chicago-cub2A few years later, the team brought
in an Alaskan black baby bear named Clara

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:06.730
Maduro.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.840
Despite the cute photos, the Chicago Tribune
reported that the bear was “too strong and

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.060
determined in its ways to be among peaceable
people.”

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.180
They were forced to send the bear to the Lincoln
Park Zoo.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.860
In 1916, a Montana bear that was on its way
to the stadium to entertain fans escaped its

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.470
crate and made its way into a tailoring factory.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.980
It was promptly shot.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.470
But the team was undeterred and got another
bear mascot, named Joa, who lived in a simple

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.810
circular cage outside of the Weeghman Park
(later, renamed to Wrigley Field).

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.560
As you might imagine from the conditions in
which he lived, he was surely, once clawed

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.840
a player and was often seen chewing his steel
chain in an attempt to free himself.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.530
Nearly a century later, the Cubs debuted another
bear mascot – his name was Clark and he

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.600
was animated.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.400
The origin story the team concocted was that
the cartoon Clark had heard stories growing

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.970
up of his great-grandfather Joa’s exploits
as the Cubs’ mascot and was inspired to

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.639
follow in his footsteps…

00:06:58.639 --> 00:07:02.620
Of course, had he actually known anything
about Joa’s sad tale he might have run the

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.620
other way instead.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.930
Nevertheless, after the team’s World Series
win, Clark the Cub was seen partying with

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:48.360
the team and marching in the celebration parade
with them.
