- Today, the young people
have their futuristic things.

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:07.906 align:start size:84% position:16%
But I'm still
about, not the past,

00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:10.209
the quality and craftsmanship.

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:12.379
Ned's antiques offers
things for your home

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:14.881 align:start size:94% position:6%
that you'll character
while keeping your roots.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.251 align:start size:81% position:19%
Check out this
spoon young fella.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.553 align:start size:88% position:13%
This was hand made 1658
in London, England.

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:23.856
- No way, does it still work?

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:27.360
- Oh yeah, come down
and see for yourself.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:33.600
- Mmmmm.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.073
- That's it?

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:43.609 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, I know
it's not a lot but.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.046 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Okay, listen, I get you're
new to Hollywood, right?

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.782
But your resume consists of
community college theater,

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:54.787 align:start size:97% position:3%
and one line, in a local spot,
and your costar is a spoon.

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:56.088
- Right.

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:58.425
- It is very hard to
take on a new client.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:02.294
Although I do, I do trust
my sister's instincts.

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:03.930
- She said I was good, right?

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.799
- She did, yeah, she said you
were one of her brightest.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:08.634
And that was, that
was 13 years ago

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:12.105 align:start size:84% position:16%
so you've been in Iowa
the whole time or?

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:17.609
- I ran into your sister
Louise and she was like,

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.979
oh my God, Gary, you
know you were so good,

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.782 align:start position:0%
you didn't move, you didn't
go, you didn't go to Hollywood?

00:01:22.782 --> 00:01:24.650
And I was like no and she
was like ah you were so,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.820 align:start size:84% position:16%
you should've and I
was like I know, fuck!

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.089
I fucked up, fuck!

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:32.791 align:start size:97% position:3%
But I didn't, I stayed
there, and I should've come

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.293
but now I'm here.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:38.131
I saved up all my money and
I'm ready, I'm ready to act.

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:41.434
- Let me see your headshot.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.136
- Yeah, check it out.

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.340 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's not a
professional headshot.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.443
- No, but these are
shots of my head.

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:54.514
(hip hop music)

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:09.462
- I thought you said
it was a headshot.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.030 align:start size:84% position:16%
Isn't that just a
picture of your head?

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.364 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I mean that's just
what it's called

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:14.834
but they do full body,
they do half, waist up.

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:16.336
I mean they do all of it.

00:02:16.336 --> 00:02:19.838
- Wow, you went full LA on
me, only took three months.

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:22.308
- Well Rick, if by full LA
you mean I have a manager

00:02:22.308 --> 00:02:24.810
now that's in charge
of my career, then yes.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.478 align:start size:88% position:13%
I know we can't all
just eat cereal all day

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:28.681
like a child or a drug addict.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:33.553
Okay, I just, I gotta focus
on the shoot right now dude.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:34.887
- Turtleneck?

00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:36.389
- It's universal.

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.657 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah well it makes your
head look like it's shitting

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.325
out a frosting turd.

00:02:42.327 --> 00:02:46.199
(heavy bass, electronic music)

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:55.574
- Woah.

00:02:55.574 --> 00:02:56.543
- Woah.

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:57.543
- This is huge.

00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:58.877
- This is palatial.

00:02:58.877 --> 00:03:00.580
- Dude this is so Hollywood man.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.881
- So sick.

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:04.717
- Oh my gosh, Todd,
Todd, we're here.

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.221
- Yes, thank you, love it.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:13.192
Finally my girl
Amy came through.

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:15.561
You must be Gary, hi
I'm Todd Phillipes,

00:03:15.561 --> 00:03:18.031
and welcome to my work space.

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:23.436 align:start size:88% position:13%
I could already tell
that we're going to have

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:25.438
some really nice images.

00:03:25.438 --> 00:03:28.941
Gary, ready to book some
job, you fucking asshole!

00:03:28.941 --> 00:03:31.610 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, I'm Rick,
that's my buddy Gary.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.778
He's getting the shots.

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:34.246
- I'm Gary.

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:37.750 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Hi, great, right, okay,
let's go at it Gary.

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:41.087
- Alright you fucking asshole.

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:44.957
- Did you bring a change
of wardrobe by any chance?

00:03:44.957 --> 00:03:47.593 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I didn't because I
felt the black turtleneck

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:50.229 align:start size:97% position:3%
was very universal and I
saw an old picture of Brando

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:52.265 align:start size:84% position:16%
with it and he
looked very powerful

00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.733
and it was very dramatic
and that's kind of what

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.635 align:start size:84% position:16%
I want to exude
through these photos.

00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:58.804
- Yeah, I bet, hey I'm
on a tight schedule.

00:03:58.804 --> 00:04:00.940
So we're just going to pop
these bad boys out real quick

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.309
and then you could head
down to the waterfront.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.276
Right Rick?

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:05.111
Rick!

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:06.779
Okay.

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:12.085
(camera clicking)

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:15.621
Done, great job sexy.

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:17.123
Good job.

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:19.625
- Oh wow, that was fast, I
wanted to do some other ones.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:22.294
Like, is my neck okay
like how does it look?

00:04:22.294 --> 00:04:24.130
- Thick and doughy babe.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.798
- Ick I don't want that.

00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:28.501
- Hey, idea, why
don't you jump in.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:30.169 align:start size:88% position:13%
We'll have a fun little
quick photo shoot.

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:31.837
Gary out, Rick in.

00:04:31.837 --> 00:04:33.105
- I thought you were
on a time schedule.

00:04:33.105 --> 00:04:35.507
- I am, we gotta get
moving babe, come on!

00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:38.611 align:start size:88% position:13%
Hustle, hustle,
hustle, hustle, hustle.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:39.511
- Alright.

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:40.846
- There you go, smile for Todd.

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:42.315
- Sure.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.817 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Come on, Rick, yeah
Rick, give it to me Rick.

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:46.518
- Duck face or no duck face?

00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:48.487
- Hmm, duck face.

00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:50.155
- A fucking turtleneck?

00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:51.690
You look like you have diarrhea.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.359
- Yeah it's universal.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.827
- In what universe?

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.862
- We have to do re-shoots
or how does this work?

00:04:56.862 --> 00:04:59.164 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, no, no, no it's
alright, I can work with this.

00:04:59.164 --> 00:05:00.966
You can always play
a serial killer.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:03.202
Oh, by the way, who is Rick?

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:05.638
- Rick is my roommate,
he drove me to the shoot.

00:05:05.638 --> 00:05:07.807
Todd did a couple
shots with him.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:10.343 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well Todd said that
Rick's body turned his penis

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.544
into a mayonnaise volcano.

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:14.547 align:start size:84% position:16%
Anyway, Todd's a
bit crass, but still

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:16.181
I'd really like to
see those shots.

00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:17.683
- Uh, okay.

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:18.517
- Great.

00:05:18.517 --> 00:05:19.352
- Bye.

00:05:21.053 --> 00:05:22.688
Can you email me the
photos that Todd took?

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:24.490 align:start size:84% position:16%
Amy wants to see
them for some reason.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.893
- Yeah, he sent me like 40.

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:28.027
Check it out.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:31.064
That one's pretty cool.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.399
- Why did you let him do that?

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:38.904
That guy just doesn't,
that's not professional.

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:41.874
(heavy bass music)
