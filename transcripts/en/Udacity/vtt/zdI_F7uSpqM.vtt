00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.640
I'm just going to give you guys a brief
overview of what Jasmine is and

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.190
how we are going to be
using it in our project.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.084
So I'm going to be screen
sharing right now.

00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:13.940
&gt;&gt; Yep, there you go.
&gt;&gt; Okay,

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.470
as you can see I am in our
GitHub repo for feed reader.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.792
So, whenever you go into,
you have this master branch where

00:00:22.792 --> 00:00:27.221
you have a bunch of different
folders index.html, readme.

00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:33.590
You go into Jasmine, and then you go
into spec where you see feedreader.js.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.063
This is the file that you're going
to be writing your test soon in.

00:00:36.063 --> 00:00:37.015
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:37.015 --> 00:00:40.257
&gt;&gt; So, as you can see,
this file only has some stuff in it.

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:43.550
So, it has a bunch of
documentation which is really good,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.718
you guys have to go through it, since
all the tests that you will be writing

00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:50.025
are listed under To-Dos, right here.

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:53.090
So let me just sort of, yeah.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.110
Let me zoom into it.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.290
Okay.
So you have all these To-Dos.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.965
So all these To-Dos are the tests
that you need to be writing.

00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:06.155
So about that, if you can see, there is
one little sort of code that is written.

00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:11.285
And it's actually written
using Jasmine documentation.

00:01:11.285 --> 00:01:16.535
So what they describe is
actually [INAUDIBLE] is it's

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:21.780
defining a suite, and the name of
the suite is going to be RSS feeds.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.400
So, this is going to be the start of
your test suite for RSS feeds for

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.813
testing RSS feeds.

00:01:27.813 --> 00:01:28.320
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.365
&gt;&gt; And then you have these

00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:30.355
documents in here,
&gt;&gt; [COUGH]

00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:32.153
&gt;&gt; That specifies this is our first

00:01:32.153 --> 00:01:36.147
test and a test to make sure that all
feeds variable have been defined and

00:01:36.147 --> 00:01:37.780
that it's not empty.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.620
And you have to experiment
with this before you

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.390
get started with your project.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.560
So what happens when you change allFeeds
and upload gs to be an empty area and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.030
refresh the page?

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.486
As you can see, this is what Jonathan
was talking about in his last office

00:01:52.486 --> 00:01:53.360
hours-
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.580
&gt;&gt; Where he actually deleted
the allFeeds variable, made it empty and

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.870
then he sort of tried running
this code and it failed.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.452
So, what I'm going to do is,
the next part, line 24 is it,

00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:09.294
our defined function.

00:02:09.294 --> 00:02:14.790
So, what it is, is the it function
inside, is called a spec.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.588
So, what is a spec?

00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:20.897
A spec is a JavaScript function
that says what some piece

00:02:20.897 --> 00:02:23.790
of your program should be doing.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.240
So as you can see,
RSS feeds need to be defined.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.340
That is essentially what you
have to do in this code.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.940
And It is just a function that's
going to define your specs.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.570
So, a test sweep can have a zillion
specs that define a zillion tests.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.730
The next line when you go,
is the expect function.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.190
So, what does the expect says?

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.845
So, the expect function acts on
the allFeeds variable and it says,

00:02:54.845 --> 00:03:00.400
toBeDefined, so
you need all the feeds inside

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.640
your JSON object to be defined and
the length should not be zero.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.050
So as you can,
see this is fairly readable.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.775
And if you want to explore all these
functionalities, the toBeDefined and

00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:17.300
toBeZero functionalities,
what you can do is you can go

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.026
back to the Jasmine folder, and
then go into the your Jasmine2.1.2.

00:03:22.026 --> 00:03:26.005
And when you open Jasmine.js,
what you can see is,

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.190
I'm going to be searching toBeDefined.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.701
So, as you can see,
there are four instances.

00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:35.872
So, the first one is actually
providing you a matchers, so,

00:03:35.872 --> 00:03:38.852
as you can see,
these are called matchers.

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:41.222
So, whatever goes into your expect, and

00:03:41.222 --> 00:03:44.680
all these functions
are called your matchers.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.150
So, you go down and you can see
that this is how the toBeDefined is

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.980
defined and
it's going to either return, I think,

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.930
a variable that is going to say,
no, is it true or is it false.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.230
So that's what it's sort
of going to give you.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.290
And you have a lot of other functions
called toBeFalse, toBeGreaterThan,

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.550
toBeLessThan.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.910
You can make use of any of
these inside your test suite,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.570
depending upon what sort of
tests you want to act on.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.172
So yeah, that was a very quick and
short summary.

00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:24.070
But if you have more questions on p6,
feel free to post on the forums.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.900
And I'm sure your peers or the
instructors will be glad to help you.
