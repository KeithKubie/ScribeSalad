00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.946
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.600
SPEAKER: Today we are so excited
to have Dr. Francesca Gino here

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.380
joining us.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.300
She is a behavioral scientist
and the Tandon Family Professor

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.080
of Business Administration at
HBS, Harvard Business School.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.180
And she will be talking
to us about some

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.370
of her recent
research, which is also

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.490
represented in her new
book, called "Rebel Talent."

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.550
And I am told that one of the
rebels she'll be talking about

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.970
is a fabulous Italian
chef, among others.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.100
So we have lots of
good stuff in store.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.620
So Francesca, come on up.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.390
She's going to talk
for about 45 minutes--

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.429
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:42.512
FRANCESCA GINO: Thank you.

00:00:42.512 --> 00:00:44.480
SPEAKER: --thank you--
45 minutes of content.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.290
And save your questions.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.670
If you're on the Livestream,
please feel free to ping them

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.250
to Al-Rahim Merali whose
LDAP is A-L-R-A-H-I-M.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.010
And we will go from there.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.010
FRANCESCA GINO: Perfect.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.670
SPEAKER: Thank you so much.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.540
FRANCESCA GINO: Welcome.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.340
Thank you so much for
having me, and thank

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.450
you so much for all of you to
show up and come to the talk.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.340
As you heard, we are
going to talk about some

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.394
of the ideas in the book.

00:01:08.394 --> 00:01:10.310
And I want to share some
stories, a little bit

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.330
of the research
behind the scenes,

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.030
and hopefully
you're going to feel

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.510
as inspired as I felt when I was
working on this book project.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.680
And I want to start with
a story that I heard

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.740
and I was told by, going
back to the restaurant,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.430
by the person who works at
this three Michelin star

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.300
restaurant in Italy.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.070
It's called Osteria Francescana.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.410
They are in Modena.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.960
And his name is
Giuseppe Palmieri.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.860
And this is actually the
story of a family of four

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.190
who visited the restaurant
on a Friday night.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.810
So imagine a father, a
mother, an eight-year-old boy,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.640
and a 14-year-old boy.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.400
And Palmieri helps
them find their table,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.310
and then shows up
to take the order.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.960
And the father,
incredibly happy,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.740
makes an order for each
one of the four of them

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.910
for a tasting menu
that has 13 dishes

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.650
and is called Sensations.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.150
And it's almost
lunchtime, so I want

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.700
to give you a sense
of the type of dishes

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.150
that are part of this menu.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.020
So quite creative in the
way they're assembled.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.550
That's eel.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.490
Another dish that is part of
this 13 course tasting menu

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.960
is the one that you see here.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.520
It looks like a funny ice
cream, but that's foie gras.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.210
So not the type of dishes the
growing boys would hunger for.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.730
Now, the father was so eager
to eat at the restaurant

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.370
that not only made the
reservations for Friday night,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.740
he also made the reservations
for Saturday night.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.050
So it's now 24 hours later.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.170
The same family is
back at the restaurant.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.400
And Palmieri again welcomes them
in, brings them to their table,

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.860
and then shows up
to take the order.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.060
This time, again very
happily, the father goes

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.940
for a 10-course tasting
menu called the Tradition

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.842
in Evolution.

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:59.300
And again, I want to give you
a sense of the type of dishes

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.590
that are part of the menu.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.100
One of them is called
snails under the earth.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.620
It's served as a soup,
but there actually

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.720
is snails at the
bottom of the plate.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.770
And they're hidden under a
foam of raw garlic and potato.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.610
And the earth part of the
dish stands for black truffle,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.440
coffee, and nuts.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.780
Now, when Palmieri
was taking the order,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.450
he noticed that the boys almost
had a face of desperation,

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.720
as if they were not
sharing the eagerness

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.140
and excitement of their father
to have another gourmet meal.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.680
And the boys were keeping
quiet, but Palmieri

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.580
turned to the
eight-year-old at the table

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.110
and said, what would
you like to have?

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.560
Pizza, said the
eight-year-old boy.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.030
Now, Osteria Francescana
is no pizzeria.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.970
There is no way you could
find pizza on their menu.

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.890
And it's a rather serious place.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.920
Fresh flowers are brought
into the restaurant every day.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.910
The tables are put together
with surgical precision.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.290
The dishes are arranged with
a lot of attention to detail.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.680
And this is a restaurant that,
back in 2016, became the best

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.070
restaurant in the world.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.820
And in fact, also
this year, in 2018,

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.010
they were back at
the top of the list.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.389
But despite all of that,
when Palmieri heard pizza,

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.660
he excused himself,
ran to the phone,

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.560
called up the best pizzeria in
Modena, and ordered the pizza.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.390
And sure enough, about 15,
20 minutes later, a pizza

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.600
showed up at the door
in a taxi, and pizza

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.027
was served to the boys.

00:04:35.027 --> 00:04:36.860
Now, I'm telling you
this story because it's

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.580
a perfect example of what
rebel talent is all about.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.100
Even in situations where
there are lots of rules,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.380
as in the case of
fancy restaurant,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.810
Palmieri was able to
keep his mind open,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.150
look at the problem from
a different perspective,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.710
and come up with a
rather creative solution.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.700
So what I want to suggest
is that we all probably want

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.140
to be people like Palmieri.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.680
If we think about our
leadership, broadly defined,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.620
the people that we influence in
our different spheres of life,

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.250
whether at work or
in our personal life,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.430
I would say that we
want to have people

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.130
who would order the
pizza like Palmieri

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.900
did in that particular instance.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.180
Now, what's interesting is
that I would call Palmieri

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.130
a rebel for this behavior, for
many other behaviors that he

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.560
engages in on a regular
basis in his work,

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.520
but rebels usually
have a bad reputation.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.260
I spend a lot of time
in organizations,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.540
and I've collected all
sorts of words for them.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.140
They're called the show offs.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.230
Sometimes they're called the
jerks, or the annoying people

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.670
who slow you down in your
decision-making processes.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.280
The troublemakers, the outcasts.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.350
In fact, I think that we
often have a very precise idea

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.210
of the rebels in the business.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.900
We think about people like
Apple visionary Steve Jobs.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.290
So people who are incredibly
innovative and creative, but--

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.180
at least the stories
go-- not the type

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.760
of people you want to work
with, or have as a boss

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.807
or as an employee.

00:06:04.807 --> 00:06:07.140
And what I want to do in the
time that we have together,

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.223
and it was a big motivation
for writing this book,

00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:12.040
is try to shift that
thinking, and suggest

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.580
that people who I call rebels
are not people who break rules

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.570
just for the sake
of breaking rules,

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.860
they are not people
who are arrogant,

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.410
they are people who break rules
who hold them and others back.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.120
And they break
rules in a way that

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.550
is very constructive
and productive

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.065
and positive for
their organizations.

00:06:30.065 --> 00:06:32.890
So with that said, let me
share a few stories that

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.720
are going to allow
us to talk about what

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.374
are the ingredients
of their success.

00:06:37.374 --> 00:06:39.040
And the first story
that I want to share

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.410
comes from the domain of sport.

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.810
Now, some of you
might know this guy

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.780
is a rather well-known coach.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.720
His name is Maurice Cheeks.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.490
And I want to tell you in
particular about the evening

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:54.400
of April 23, 2003.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.110
This was a big night for him.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.650
It was game three of the
first round of the 2003 NBA

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:00.970
championships.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.700
And I'd like you to
imagine being there.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.570
You're in a very big arena.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.250
20,000 fans ready
to watch the game.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.520
You're there with them, ready to
cheer up your team to success.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.610
Millions of viewers from home.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.860
And before the game
started, a girl

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.860
who is about 14
years in age stepped

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.400
into the arena ready to
sing the national anthem.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.340
And what I'd like you to
do is watch a video clip

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.620
that I brought with
me of that moment.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.120
And I'd like you
to pay attention

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.695
to what this coach does.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.600
Why don't we do the following?

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.760
We'll come back to that.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.130
And I'm going to talk about
a different ingredient first,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.190
where we don't need to look
at the video quite yet.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.590
The second ingredient
that seems to be something

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:56.050
the rebels do quite well
is having a great desire

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:58.127
for challenge and for novelty.

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:00.460
And I wanted to introduce
this ingredient by telling you

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.180
about a personal story.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:06.260
It is Christmas time a few
years back at our house.

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:13.380
And this is not
what happened there.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.957
I had what I thought was the
perfect gift for my husband.

00:08:17.957 --> 00:08:20.040
And the only thing that
you need to know about him

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.748
is that he's the type
of person who would

00:08:21.748 --> 00:08:25.020
be super-happy to work here.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.280
So he's a complete geek.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.350
So always loves the new piece of
technology, the latest gadget.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:34.380
Everything that is
interesting and playful

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.140
when it comes to technology
is the perfect gift for him.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.840
And so on Christmas
day, he runs downstairs.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.820
There is a big tree
in the living room.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.700
And under the tree,
he finds a big box

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.530
that I prepared for him.

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.330
And he takes the top off.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:52.530
And then he starts taking some
pieces of paper out of the box.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.470
There was this card at the
bottom of the box letting

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.680
you know that they signed us up
for a 10-week, two-hour a week

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.260
course in improv comedy.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.350
Now as it turns
out, improv comedy

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.420
taught me all sorts of
interesting things that

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:10.199
are really good lessons for
life in thinking about the work

00:09:10.199 --> 00:09:12.740
that we do and thinking about
the relationships that we have.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.820
And in the spirit of
bringing to bear something

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.950
that I've learned by
taking this class,

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:22.560
I thought that we could
do an exercise together

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.870
that is one of the
exercise that we did quite

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.610
a few times throughout improv.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:30.450
Now just to close
the story, my husband

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.200
wasn't too happy when I
signed him up for this class.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.330
He really wanted the
latest gadget in his hands.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.710
But I thought he was wrong.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.700
And by the end of the
first two-hour class,

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.340
he actually told me
that he hated it.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.370
But things started
to change as we

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.070
went on and on for
our weekly classes.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.290
And he started really
enjoying having this date

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.370
with the unexpected.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.495
So I'm going to ask each
of you, if you don't mind,

00:09:55.495 --> 00:09:58.080
to stand up for this exercise.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.660
I'm going to ask each of
you to find a partner.

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:04.890
So a person who is
standing close to you

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.020
that would work well.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:07.950
Perfect.

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:13.590
And I'm going to put
myself up here so that you

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.800
can see the directions.

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.190
So this is not too difficult.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:22.200
OK I'm going to ask you to
stand about this distance

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:22.965
from your partner.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:31.060
There is somebody over
here who needs a partner.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.082
Since you're working in pairs.

00:10:34.082 --> 00:10:36.540
And if you don't have a partner,
you can also work with me.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.940
I'm fine with that.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.440
OK.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.360
So here's what I'm
going to ask you to do.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.640
From that position, you're
going to be standing

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.440
in front of your partner.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.750
I'm going to ask you to
spend the next 20 seconds--

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.670
and I'm going to keep
the time for you--

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.340
staring in the eyes
of your partner.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.560
OK?

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.020
And there are a few more
rules before you get started.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.670
No laughing.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:59.260
No talking.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.550
No anything.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.030
No really expression of
any emotions on your face.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.570
OK?

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.050
So that's the exercise.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.600
As I said, I'm going to
keep the time for you.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.675
And when there is
silence, you can start.

00:11:31.834 --> 00:11:32.815
And time.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.640
How did that feel?

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.780
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.738
AUDIENCE: It was great.

00:11:38.738 --> 00:11:40.152
FRANCESCA GINO: It was great?

00:11:40.152 --> 00:11:42.924
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.936
Your face is like, meh.

00:11:46.936 --> 00:11:50.595
OK, for some of you,
maybe slightly awkward.

00:11:50.595 --> 00:11:55.890
A little bit weird,
uncomfortable.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.580
As it turns out, if you felt a
little bit awkward or slightly

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.070
uncomfortable, that's OK.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.640
It means that you're human.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.250
Because our brain knows
that if we stand that close

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:09.120
to a person looking in their
eyes for that amount of time,

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.830
one or two things
usually happen.

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:14.612
One, we're going
to kiss the person.

00:12:14.612 --> 00:12:16.620
Two, we're going to
punch them in the face.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.110
And I don't want any of
that to happen at Google.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.640
So you can go to your partner,
shake their hands and say,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.765
I'm not going to punch you.

00:12:22.765 --> 00:12:24.697
I'm not going to kiss you.

00:12:24.697 --> 00:12:28.550
OK, now that that
is out of the way--

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:30.830
no, no, no, stand up.

00:12:30.830 --> 00:12:31.740
Not sitting yet.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.060
There is the second
part to the exercise.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.940
Now a beautiful
principle of improv

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.660
is the idea of always working
on scenes with a partner

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:42.210
and shifting the
attention from us to them.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.280
Our goal in scenes is
always trying our best

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.100
to make our partner feel
good about what they're

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.590
doing, or feeling as
confident as they can

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.790
feel about what they're doing.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.480
And again, what a beautiful
lesson about life more

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.031
generally.

00:12:55.031 --> 00:12:57.030
And so to practice that,
we are going to go back

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.600
to the same position.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.210
Again, I'm going to ask you to
engage in this 20-second period

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.720
of staring.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.620
But this time, you're also
trying to pay attention.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.380
So what is their eye color?

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.990
Is their haircut
an interesting one?

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.830
Or are there ears shaped in
a slightly different way?

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:18.160
Whatever you want to do.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.254
You're trying to stare
but pay attention

00:13:20.254 --> 00:13:21.170
to what they're doing.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.140
OK?

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.380
Same rules as before.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:28.300
So not talking, no laughing, no
facial expression of any kind.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.620
OK?

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.850
Perfect.

00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:32.440
If you're ready, let's go.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:48.752
And time.

00:13:48.752 --> 00:13:49.640
OK.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.489
We're going to test whether you
were paying attention or not.

00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:53.030
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.738
FRANCESCA GINO: Seems
like that you were.

00:13:54.738 --> 00:13:55.700
I know, oh.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.950
That sounds like a
comment from my husband

00:13:57.950 --> 00:13:59.930
as we were going
through classes.

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.050
You're going to turn
around 180 degrees.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.740
So each one of you.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.940
So this time it's not your
face looking at their face,

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.160
but it's your back
looking at their back.

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.590
Perfect.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:14.390
And what I'm going to ask you
to do is, each one of you,

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.604
to think about two big changes.

00:14:16.604 --> 00:14:17.270
So I don't know.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:19.811
If you have glasses, you might
want to take your glasses off.

00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:21.260
Or rough up your hair.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.480
Be as creative as
you want to be.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.326
And then make those two
changes on yourself.

00:14:27.326 --> 00:14:27.826
OK?

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.330
No taking off clothes.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.410
Just-- perfect.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.030
OK.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.230
If you have your two
changes, when you're ready,

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.570
you can turn around.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:48.270
And each of you can
guess the changes

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.568
that you see in your partner.

00:14:50.568 --> 00:14:53.556
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

FRANCESCA GINO: OK.

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.120
Were you able to
figure them out?

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:33.620
Yeah?

00:15:39.332 --> 00:15:42.970
Again, it's quite nice
to be able to shift

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.940
the attention from ourselves
to the other partner.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.680
So hopefully, most of you
were able to see the changes

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.720
the other person actually made.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.390
Now I'm going to do a final
part of this exercise.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.980
And do we have music?

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.190
Are we good with audio?

00:15:58.190 --> 00:15:58.690
Yeah?

00:15:58.690 --> 00:15:59.661
Perfect.

00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:00.160
OK.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.340
We're going to do the
final part of the exercise.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.860
And this is what I'm
going to ask you to do,

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.890
if you don't mind.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:10.197

Oh, if I were to find
you on a dance floor,

what would you be doing?

show me one of your moves?

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.406
and like--

00:16:25.406 --> 00:16:27.160
FRANCESCA GINO: OK.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.260
This is what I am seeing.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.590
So something along-- sorry.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:33.410
It's much better
than what I'm doing.

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.240
But it's something around that.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:34.840
OK.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.020
So your role as-- and
again, each of you

00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:40.350
is going to do this in the pair.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:43.630

about their favorite dance

00:16:43.630 --> 00:16:44.494
move.

00:16:44.494 --> 00:16:45.910
And I'm going to
put on some music

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:49.275
and ask you to actually try it
out in front of your partner.

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:51.400
And then you are going to
switch when I say switch.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:54.400
But here's the very important
role of the partner.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.940
Since your task is to make your
partner feel as good as they

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.770
can feel about their dancing--

00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:01.720
in this case, or as
confident as they

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.490
can feel about their dancing--

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.880
you're mirroring,
but exaggerating.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.510
OK?

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:09.335
So whatever it is.

00:17:09.335 --> 00:17:10.960
I don't know what I
would do this here.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:13.390
But in a way, that really makes
them feel good about the way

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:14.109
they're dancing.

00:17:14.109 --> 00:17:14.952
OK?

00:17:14.952 --> 00:17:17.410
As I said, I'm going to put up
some music since it's easier

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.369
to dance that way.

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:20.635
You can decide who's
going to go first.

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:32.572

first person can start.

in this room, I have to say.

to the first exercise when

you were staring?

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.270
It's interesting that
once we put ourselves

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.770
out there in situations where
we feel challenged where we're

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.710
always doing something
new, it becomes easier

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:49.520
to feel comfortable
with the uncomfortable.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.670
That's what rebels often do.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.320
Now I was obviously
very interested

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.240
in studying this idea in
the case of businesses.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:58.720
And so I went to
businesses to try

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:00.850
to see how is it
that they injected

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.640
this idea of challenge
and novelty in the work

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:04.420
that people do.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.400
And one of the
businesses I visited,

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.880
where I expected not to
find any rebelliousness,

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.090
is a fast-food chain in the
middle of Tennessee and West

00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:13.734
Virginia.

00:19:13.734 --> 00:19:14.650
They looked like this.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:18.820
They are drive-through big
blue boxes with French fries

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.725
and hot dogs on their roof.

00:19:20.725 --> 00:19:22.600
But they're quite
successful at what they do.

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.360
In fact, if you look at
any measure of performance,

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.950
revenue per square--

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.980
you name it, they beat
the competition by far.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.740
And we're talking about big
brands like McDonald's, Burger

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.590
King, Wendy's.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.030
Now they also invest in
people quite differently.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:41.500
So if at a place like
McDonald's you receive an hour

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.020
and a half, two hours of
training per stations,

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:49.360
at Pal's, they give you 135
hours of training per station.

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.670
So they're really all about
making you an expert such

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:55.180
that you have the free
space in your mind

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.630
to think about how to improve
on the work that you do.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.200
Now when I was there, I was
in the middle of the store

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.310
actually at rush hour.

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.710
And so you see people
working at their stations

00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.664
almost like machines.

00:20:07.664 --> 00:20:09.580
And I started thinking
that maybe work becomes

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.725
monotonous or even boring.

00:20:11.725 --> 00:20:14.830
And yet, the general managers
have thought about this.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:17.260
And so it's more ways
that they inject novelty.

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:22.810
One way in which they do this
is the idea of letting people

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.330
know the order
that they're going

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.230
to follow throughout the day--

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:29.590
the stations that
they're moving from, to--

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.600
when they show up for work.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.090
So they create a little
bit of unpredictability,

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.740
a little bit of
novelty that allows

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.990
them to stay on their feet.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.675
And what's also
interesting is that they

00:20:39.675 --> 00:20:41.800
have all sorts of challenges
for the people working

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.460
in the stores.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.860
My favorite to
date is a challenge

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.170
for the person working
at the windows.

00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:48.960
So the person who
takes the order.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.750
An interesting statistic
about Pal's is that they

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:54.230
have a lot of repeat customers.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.590
So people who eat there
five to six times a week.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.414
And they have a simple menu.

00:21:00.414 --> 00:21:02.080
And so people who are
creatures of habit

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:04.850
tend to make the same order
whenever they show up.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:07.060
And so the challenge for
the person at the window

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.110
was, if you can remember
100 orders in a row,

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:12.534
then there is this reward.

00:21:12.534 --> 00:21:14.950
And it was really interesting
to see how the person really

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.890
experienced it as being pushed
in the work that she did.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:21.370
And she was very happy
when she actually completed

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.390
the challenge successfully.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.930
So what is very
true about rebels

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.670
is that they have this
desire for novelty.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.660
They're not afraid of putting
themselves in situations

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.760
that makes them uncomfortable.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.430
Now let's go back to the first
ingredient with the video

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:38.290
that I wanted to
show you earlier.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:39.925
So you know the setup.

00:21:39.925 --> 00:21:41.560
And as I said, the
idea is for you

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.210
to think about how
you'd feel if you were

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:48.130

FRANCESCA GINO: Now let
me ask you a question.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:10.700
Does this guy have a good voice?

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.320
Absolutely not.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.290
And yet it took
him no time to step

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:18.200
in the middle of the
arena and start singing,

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.180
helping the girl
who needed help.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.420
What is impressive about him is
that he has no problem making

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:28.070
himself vulnerable even when
that means showing everybody

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.860
that clearly singing is
not one of his strengths.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.630
But rather it's a weakness.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.330
And that's what rebels seem
to be doing quite naturally.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.810
They make themselves
vulnerable in a way that

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:42.060
is not backfiring, as
we often think it will.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.960
But rather it buys
them a lot of respect.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:50.090
In fact, if you didn't feel
moved in a little way at least

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.730
watching that, I think
you have no heart.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.130
Because it really creates
an emotional connection

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:56.960
by doing what he does.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.360
So as I said, rebels
are people who

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:04.670
seems to be quite happy
to jump in and to help.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:06.980

people, as I said,

interesting desire for novelty.

FRANCESCA GINO: Now this
little guy is very impressive.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:31.080
We all tend to dwell
on our weaknesses.

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.300
We often over-invest
in our weaknesses.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:36.890
And instead, he shifts his
attention to his strength.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:39.120
And as it turns out,
that's what rebels do.

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.835
They play to their strengths
on a regular basis.

00:26:41.835 --> 00:26:44.460
And that's something that makes
them feel authentic in the work

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.315
that they do.

00:26:45.315 --> 00:26:48.210
Now I was very curious about
this idea of authenticity.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:52.410
There is a lot of talking
in the world about the power

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:53.370
of authenticity.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:57.056
And I was interested in looking
at whether a lot of the things

00:26:57.056 --> 00:26:58.680
that we say about
authenticity are true

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.830
and so with my colleagues, we
went to all sorts of contexts

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.270
to look at whether authenticity
is in fact a powerful driver

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.630
in the work that we do.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:09.690
So one of the contexts
that we explored

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:12.090
is entrepreneurial competitions.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:14.190
So imagine entrepreneurs
showing up,

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:16.380
pitching their ideas
to venture capitalists.

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:19.260
And what we found is
that when entrepreneurs

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:21.740
are authentic and genuine
in their pitching,

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:26.430
they are three times more likely
to get money for their ideas.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.950
Now authenticity is
also an interesting part

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.310
of the story of the chef
and owner of the restaurant

00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:34.440
that I mentioned earlier,
Osteria Francescana.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.850
You can see him here.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.890
His name is Massimo Bottura.

00:27:37.890 --> 00:27:42.400
A really interesting
person and leader.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.135
In fact, it is a person
who went to a context

00:27:45.135 --> 00:27:49.127
of traditional Italian
dishes and reinvented them.

00:27:49.127 --> 00:27:51.210
Now I don't know how much
you know about Italians,

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:54.190
but there are two things
that are very true.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:57.960
One is that there are lots of
rules when it comes to cooking.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.250
And we cherish our old ways.

00:28:00.250 --> 00:28:02.070
And he went to a
context where there

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:05.880
are lots of traditions
where recipes

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.970
have been passed on for
centuries, from generation

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.170
to generation.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.650
And he basically
messed up the tradition

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.235
and came up with something new.

00:28:15.235 --> 00:28:16.860
So he studied traditions
very carefully

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:18.276
and then started
asking questions.

00:28:18.276 --> 00:28:21.660
Well maybe it made sense
cooking this dish this way

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.980
20 years ago, but not today.

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.250
Let's do something different.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.360
So if you have ever
had lasagna, this

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.550
is his version of the lasagna.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:31.850
It's called the crunchy
part of the lasagna.

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:36.430
It looks nothing like the
type of dishes I grew up with.

00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:40.730
Now what is interesting is that
when he opened the restaurant,

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:42.600
traditional Italians
weren't too happy.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.930
In fact, he talks about it as
actively fighting against him.

00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:50.550
And when I asked him what
allowed him to stay persistent,

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.070
he told me about the
power of authenticity.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.950
And in fact, he told me
about the story of the summer

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.800
that he spent at Eboli, at the
time, quite a famous restaurant

00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.860
in Spain.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.597
And what he learned
from the chef there.

00:29:02.597 --> 00:29:04.680
And it was really a message
of feeling the freedom

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.400
and expressing the freedom
of playing to your strengths

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.520
and staying authentic.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:10.600
And so this is the quote.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:13.440
He said, "What changed me
was the message of freedom

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:16.260
that Ferran gave me, the
freedom to feel my own fire,

00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.130
to look inside myself and
make my thoughts edible."

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.970
And sure enough, after the
summer, he back to Modena.

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:23.990
He sold everything that he had.

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:26.430
He borrowed money from
his wife's family.

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:28.600
And then he invested
the money and the time

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:29.580
in the restaurants.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.350
He came up with new recipes.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:33.450
And a few months later,
the first Michelin star

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.520
arrived, and the second
one, and the third.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.010
And as I told you in
2016, the restaurant

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:40.920
became the best
restaurant in the world--

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.660
a moment of Italian
pride, since it

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:45.180
was the first time when an
Italian restaurant reached

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.000
the top of the list.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.070
Now again, his story
is interesting.

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:52.620
But as a scientist,
I was curious to know

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.690
whether this story is more
generalizable-- the idea

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:58.180
of authenticity is
really powerful to help

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.580
us persist through challenges.

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:03.840
So one of the studies that
we conducted to look at this

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:09.200
is by bringing Red Sox
fans into HBS campus.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:14.340
And what we did, we gave
them one or two types

00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.020
of wristbands to wear--

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:19.860
either the wristband of their
favorite team, the Red Sox,

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.740
or the wristband of
the New York Yankees.

00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:26.040
And then we put them through all
sorts of challenges in the hour

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.470
that we had with them.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.790
And at the very end,
one of the challenges

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.340
was to ask them to put
their dominant hand

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.810
in a bucket of ice.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:35.670
And so we were paying
them the longer

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.040
they kept their hand
in a bucket of ice.

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:40.710
We were interested
in seeing whether you

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.700
see more persistence when people
experience authenticity, even

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.360
in the case of tolerance to
pain and physical persistence.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.090
And sure enough, across all
the different challenges

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:54.900
we put them through, people
who felt authentic just

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.120
for wearing the wristband
of their favorite team

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.150
were much more likely to
persist through challenges,

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.300
even when it came to keeping
their hands in the bucket

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.710
of ice at the end of the study,
suggesting that authenticity

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.500
is really quite
powerful in helping

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.230
us resist through challenges.

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.150
Now what this tells us, and
the reason why I'm telling you

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.150
this story is that
they are quite

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.270
interesting in showing
one of the talents

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:23.710
the rebels seem to have.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.850
They are people who play to
their strength quite often.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.490
But they also help
others do the same.

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.770
A few years back, I
came across a quote

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.740
of an Italian sculptor
and artist that

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.790
really stayed with me.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:39.490
You probably know
some of his work.

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.200
His name is
Michelangelo Buonarroti.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.530
Here's what he wrote about
the sculpting process.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:49.570
He said, "Sculpting is a process
whereby the artist releases

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:53.410
an ideal figure from the block
of stone in which it slumbers."

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.630
To me, that's very
powerful because it

00:31:55.630 --> 00:32:00.220
raises the question of, what
if we were to look around

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:05.110
in our professional lives, at
work, or in our personal lives,

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.320
and started with the assumptions
that fundamentally, everybody

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.830
has talent, and that our role--

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:17.140
as colleagues, as leaders,
as parents, as friends--

00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:19.480
is to help them bring those out.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:21.670
So I bought into
this idea and then

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:24.959
I started asking questions of
how do we do that concretely?

00:32:24.959 --> 00:32:27.250
And so I'm going to leave
you with a couple of examples

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.410
that maybe might
trigger some suggestions

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:31.270
or ideas in your head.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:34.100
The first story comes
from Ariel Investments.

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:37.020
This is a Chicago-based
money management firm.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.612
And the president
of Ariel Investments

00:32:39.612 --> 00:32:41.320
is the woman that you
see in the picture.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.810
Her name is Mellody Hobson.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:47.380
Remarkable woman,
really successful.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.380
Really interesting what she does
to bring a lot of this talent

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.260
into her organization.

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.880
And when I asked her to
tell me a little bit more

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:56.710
about her career,
she told me that she

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.320
started working at
Ariel at the age of 22,

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.660
right after graduating
from college.

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.240
No working experience.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.280
And she's been quite successful.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.280
So what was the
secret to her success?

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.850
She referred to the advice
that she received directly

00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:17.200
from the CEO at the time
on the first day of work.

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.120
And this is what
the CEO told her.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.830
"You are going to be
in rooms with people

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:23.530
who have a lot of money
and have big titles.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.420
But it doesn't mean
that your ideas are not

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:26.980
as good or even better.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.690
I want to hear your ideas.

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.460
It is incumbent on
you to speak up."

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.340
So from the very
first day, she had

00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:36.400
the license of bringing
her contributions forward.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.830
And this is advice that
she shares with everybody

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:43.510
at the firm, or everybody
that she brings into the firm.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.780
Now back in 2011, I
had an opportunity

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.500
to think about how
to apply these ideas.

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.420
I was working with a company
called Wipro Technology.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.887
They are based in India.

00:33:54.887 --> 00:33:56.470
And in particular,
my colleagues and I

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.240
were working with
their business process

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.920
outsourcing side
of the business.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.340
So imagine people
working in call centers.

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.700
Now as you might imagine,
it's a tough job.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.820
And in fact, what
Wipro was experiencing

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:14.050
was investing a lot in people,
bringing them in, and then

00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:16.540
45 to 60 days into
the job, most people

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.199
were leaving the organization.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:20.300
So not the greatest investment.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.020
And so we did an
intervention with them

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:28.030
where we gave people who joined
a half hour of reflection.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.159
We asked them to think
about their strengths,

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:32.020
to think about what's
unique about them,

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:35.139
and how they could play to their
strengths more often at work.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:39.250
And since we wanted to test
the ideas, some of the people

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:43.250
actually went through this
revised welcoming process.

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.250
Some of them went through
the regular welcoming process

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.750
at Wipro.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.730
And then we looked
at turnover rates

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.830
seven months after
the intervention.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:54.400
And what we found is that
moments of reflection

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.650
where people had the
chance to think about what

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:58.420
makes them authentic--

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.270
and how they could bring
that out into work--

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:02.860
was quite powerful.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.390
So people were more likely
to be with the organization

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.520
seven months later.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:10.090
They were also much
happier in their jobs.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.670
And they performed better,
as we know from the ratings

00:35:12.670 --> 00:35:14.860
on customers' calls.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.574
And what is
interesting, I think,

00:35:16.574 --> 00:35:19.240
about this study is that it's in
a context where the job is very

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.750
scripted, suggesting
that even there, there

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.839
is an opportunity for us
to rely on this talent.

00:35:26.839 --> 00:35:28.630
So what these different
studies and stories

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:32.350
tell us is that rebels
play to their strengths

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.560
on a regular basis, but they
also help others do the same.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:39.370
And again, I felt very
inspired by learning

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.590
about this in a way
that made me think about

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:43.560
work a little bit differently.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.980
So let me share a
final ingredient

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.040
and then we're going to
open it up for questions.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:53.530
This is I think, at the moment,
one that really puzzles me.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:56.980
And it's a talent for curiosity.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:00.200
And it puzzles me because
we're all born with it.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.590
In fact, if you
look at the data,

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:05.470
curiosity peaks at the
age of four and five.

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:08.200
And then it declines
steadily from there.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.600
I think that that's a
sad finding and a missed

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.770
opportunity.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:14.380
And I don't know if
you can still remember

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:15.770
the time you were a kid.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:17.170
It's way too long ago for me.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:21.650
So I think about my children who
are at the age where curiosity

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.090
is really coming out.

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.582
And it's constant questioning.

00:36:25.582 --> 00:36:28.040
Just before I left for this
trip they were asking questions

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.660
about, why is the sky blue?

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.760
Or why is it that we
need to wear clothes

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:33.380
when we leave the house?

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:36.044
It's constant exploring
and a sense of wonder

00:36:36.044 --> 00:36:36.710
and questioning.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.534
We seem to be losing that.

00:36:38.534 --> 00:36:39.950
And in fact, when
I looked at this

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:42.614
in the context of
organizations, I

00:36:42.614 --> 00:36:44.030
looked at people
who were starting

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:47.090
new jobs across a different
set of industries.

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:51.006
And it seems like curiosity
is pretty high, as you start.

00:36:51.006 --> 00:36:52.630
But when you go back
to the same people

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:54.660
six to eight months
later, curiosity

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.220
had dropped across the
board by at least 20%.

00:36:58.220 --> 00:36:59.750
It doesn't have to be that way.

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:02.540
And in fact, rebels are people
who keep their curiosity alive

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.400
and also encourage it in others.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.780
So I'll give you a
couple of examples.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.930
One comes from Intuit.

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:11.740
Every year they have
innovation awards.

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.910
And these are for
people who have

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:19.910
random explorations that led to
new products or new processes.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:22.130
But they also have
failure awards.

00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:24.650
And these go to people
whose explorations did not

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:29.220
end up in a new product, but led
to good learnings for the team.

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.610
And what's most exciting
about this example

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:34.580
is that the failure awards
come with a failure party.

00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:36.620
So you're really
creating an atmosphere

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:41.360
where exploration is, in
fact, supported and valued.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.040
Now we started with a
story about the restaurant,

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:45.000
Osteria Francescana.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.910
So we are going to end with a
story about this restaurant.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.630
This is a very busy night
at Osteria Francescana.

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:54.890
And one of their sous chefs that
is known internally as Taka,

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.870
was working on the last
dessert of the night.

00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:58.490
And it was a lemon tart.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:02.900
Taka is known for being obsessed
with precision and attention

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:03.410
to detail.

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:04.910
And so he was working
very carefully

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.460
arranging the different
pieces on the plate.

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.820
And all of a sudden, the
plate dropped to the floor.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.640
And now he had a
smashed lemon tart.

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.390
Now Taka was starting to
panic, trying to understand

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:18.770
and figure out what to do.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:23.360
And as he was feeling this
way, chef Massimo Bottura

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.470
walked into the kitchen and
saw the plate on the floor.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:31.730
And rather than yelling,
as I bet a lot of leaders

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:35.060
would do in fancy restaurants,
he looked at the plate

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:39.000
and said, I think we have
a new item for our menu.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.450
And sure enough, they came
up with a new dessert.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.460
It's now one of their
most popular desserts

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.720
at the restaurant.

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.490
And it looks like this.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.230
I took a picture
when I was there.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:52.450
It's smashed on the plate even
in the way that it's prepared.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:57.340
And the name for it is Oops,
I Dropped the Lemon Tart.

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.740
And it's just a
great example of how

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.770
curious people, or
curious leaders like him,

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.830
are able to even look
at accidents or mistakes

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:11.120
and turn them into a
source of inspiration.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.210
So it seems as if
these rebels do

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:17.480
have a recipe to their success.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.800
And if you look at how
they use their talents,

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:24.200
there are all sorts of
behaviors that they engage in

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.850
on a regular basis.

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:28.820
And there are many of them
I write about in the book.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.700
I just captured a few
of them on these slides.

00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:33.290
And it's not for
talking through them.

00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.620
But just to give you the idea
that a lot of these things,

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.600
a lot of these
behaviors, are not

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.630
requiring a complete
restructuring

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:44.090
of the organization or
rethinking over what

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:47.270
we're doing, but they
require some thoughtfulness

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:49.430
on our part.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:52.190
Now these rebels share
five talents, no matter

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:57.080
what industry or job they do.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.210
And we talked about some
of them in more detail.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:01.940
They have this talent
for authenticity.

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.766
They have a talent for novelty.

00:40:04.766 --> 00:40:06.890
Rather than going with the
familiar and comfortable

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:08.810
they challenge themselves.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:11.430
There have a talent
for curiosity.

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:13.430
They have a talent
for perspective,

00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:17.000
a little bit like what Palmieri
did when looking at the problem

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.880
rather than being stuck
on the obvious answer.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.750
He looked at it from
multiple perspectives.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:25.160
And finally, they have
a talent for diversity.

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:28.370
So they are people who really
do reject social rules that

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:30.650
are passed on to us by society.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:33.260
And they think about
surrounding themselves

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.740
with people who think
differently and can challenge

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.210
their way of thinking.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:42.220
And they really
leverage differences.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:43.149
So let me stop here.

00:40:43.149 --> 00:40:44.690
I have many more
stories to tell you.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:46.880
But I'm kind of
curious to see what

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.840
questions are on your mind.

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.560
SPEAKER: Before
we get into that,

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:55.670
let me just remind you, if
you're on the Livestream,

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.500
feel free to ping
Al-Rahim Merali.

00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.270
So he's A-L-R-A-H-I-M@.

00:41:02.556 --> 00:41:03.680
We can start with the room.

00:41:06.535 --> 00:41:08.076
AUDIENCE: Francesca,
thanks for that.

00:41:08.076 --> 00:41:09.825
Oh, thanks for that great talk.

00:41:09.825 --> 00:41:12.110
I'm just curious, so the
literature on creativity

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:13.670
shows that people
are most creative

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:14.990
under some level of constraint?

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.420
Total freedom is not great
for the creative process.

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:19.520
Similarly, do rebels
depend on there

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:22.427
being some shared assumptions
for them to question

00:41:22.427 --> 00:41:23.510
and break, to some extent?

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:25.130
And does that mean
not everyone can

00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:26.690
be a rebel in an
organization, right?

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:30.290
There has to be some
kind of shared culture

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.872
or structure or something like
that for them to operate best.

00:41:32.872 --> 00:41:33.830
FRANCESCA GINO: Mm-hmm.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:37.000
So in one of the
chapters in the book that

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.850
comes a little bit later,
I talk about the principles

00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:42.710
that rebels live by.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:47.120
And it was something that was
inspired by going potentially

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.310
to a strange place.

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.060
So one of the organizations
that I studied

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.180
as I was working on this
book was pirate ships

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.530
in the 16th century.

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:55.940
They're fascinating.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.730
And I had all sorts of
wrong ideas about them.

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.340
And the ships, the
crews actually,

00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:04.700
had principles that everybody
agreed upon before they

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:07.670
left for their journeys.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:12.210
And similarly, rebels
have principles.

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.990
One of them is finding
freedom in constraint.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:19.010
So you're right in saying
that the fact that there

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:23.210
our structures, norms, rules
allows them to bring out

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.280
some of their creativity.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.370
Now to your question
of does that

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.170
mean that affects
the number of rebels

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.830
that we have in
the organization?

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.500
I usually receive the
question in the form of,

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.405
what's the exact
percentage of rebels

00:42:36.405 --> 00:42:38.030
that I should have
in the organization?

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.710
And my answer is
always the same.

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:41.450
It makes people
feel uncomfortable.

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.700
It's 100%.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.370
And the reason is that, if
you look at these talents,

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:50.480
there is nothing threatening
about them other than requiring

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.950
a little bit more openness to
people that bring into work

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:56.700
different perspectives.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.300
And one of the things
that is true about rebels

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.210
is that, you get to
be more innovative,

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:05.230
to perform better in your job,
to have better relationships

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:07.790
at work because you're
fully engaged in the work

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:08.980
that you do.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:13.970
And so I've been struck by the
data that is very well known

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:18.590
about engagement across
the globe and the fact

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:23.420
that there are 2/3 of
workplaces full of people

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:26.630
who are disengaged, or
actively disengaged.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.460
It's just puzzling and strange.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.890
And I met some of those people
and really the experience

00:43:31.890 --> 00:43:35.010
is, the work sucks
for many of them.

00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:37.910
And so I think that
encouraging rebelliousness,

00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:41.820
you also get the engagement that
leads to all sorts of benefits.

00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:42.485
So 100%.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:46.010
Yeah.

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:52.150
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that
rebels play to their strengths.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:54.800
And so I wanted to ask a
question related to growth

00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:56.602
mindset and fixed mindset.

00:43:56.602 --> 00:43:58.310
So if they're playing
to their strengths,

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:00.518
does that mean that they're
not improving or building

00:44:00.518 --> 00:44:02.570
on their weaknesses?

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.840
I'm wondering if you
think that it's not

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.626
useful to do that and just
focus on building more strength?

00:44:08.626 --> 00:44:09.500
FRANCESCA GINO: Yeah.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.860
So I actually think that if
you look at the two talents

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.090
that I talked about,
capture this idea

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.730
of learning and growing.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:20.000
So novelty means putting
yourselves out there

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.890
in situations that
challenges in a way

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.230
that allows you to
develop new skills.

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:26.570
And so that's the part
of the growth mindset.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:29.720
But there is also
this idea that you

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.510
focus a lot of what you do
on what gives you energy.

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:34.640
That is what I mean by
playing to your strengths.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.431
It's the way that makes
you feel authentic.

00:44:36.431 --> 00:44:38.660
So I don't see the
two in contradictions.

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:43.020
It seems like rebels
do both quite well.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:46.920
And one of the things
that, across the board--

00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.990
I don't use that the label
growth mindset as much.

00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:55.370
But I use thirst for learning,
which in a sense, it's similar.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.920
And this willingness
to grow in their job

00:44:57.920 --> 00:45:01.280
is quite important for rebels.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.500
In fact, some people say,
what about arrogance?

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:08.520
Arrogance is not part of their
playbook, but humility is.

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.490
I'll give you a quick
story, if you don't mind.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:13.390
And it's in one of the chapters
where I talk about perspective.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:17.330
The person I mention there
that really surprised me is,

00:45:17.330 --> 00:45:18.950
a captain that you
probably all know

00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:20.242
is Captain Sully Sullenberger.

00:45:20.242 --> 00:45:21.950
This is the captain
who ditched the plane

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.770
with 155 passengers
in the Hudson River

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.100
back on a cold evening of 2009.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.570
And when I found myself
reading the accident report,

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:32.600
I was amazed by what he did.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.330
He had 208 seconds
to make decisions.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.910
That's the time that he had
when he discovered that there

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:39.720
was no thrust in the
engines and the time

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.480
in which the plane
in the Hudson River.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:46.670
Most of us under such
time pressure and stress

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:49.800
would narrow our
thinking and options.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:52.280
He instead was broadening
his perspective.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.650
He kept considering what it
is that we could be doing.

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:57.710
And I reached out
to him, since I

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:59.090
was curious about his approach.

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:01.464
And what I've learned is that
by the time of the accident

00:46:01.464 --> 00:46:04.340
happened, he had a
ton of experience--

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:07.100
over 30,000 hours of
flying under his belt.

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.750
He had served in
the military, so he

00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:11.850
had all sorts of experience
flying all sorts of planes.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.720
He had served as a volunteer
in previous accidents,

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.400
so he knew a lot about
what can go wrong.

00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:20.000
But every time he
walked into the cockpit,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.220
he would ask himself
what it is that could

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:25.010
be different in this case,
what it is that he could learn.

00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:27.362
And so he kept that
intellectual [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:27.362 --> 00:46:28.820
that I've seen a
lot of rebels that

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:33.500
allows them to keep looking at
their experience as a signal

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.960
not that they know it all,
but that there is more

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.170
to grow and learn.

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:41.260
AUDIENCE: We have a question
from the Livestream.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:45.160
Most of the examples you've
shared involve men as rebels.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.530
How do you think that
rebellious behavior

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:49.360
is treated when those
rebels are outside

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.087
of the gender or
ethnic majority?

00:46:51.087 --> 00:46:52.420
FRANCESCA GINO: Very good point.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:54.970
And I tried in the
book to actually

00:46:54.970 --> 00:47:01.300
be much broader in the sense
of not only going outside

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.280
of the United States,
but also having

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:08.720
both examples of men and women,
as well as different groups.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.380
Now I collected
some data on this,

00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.440
since one of the questions
that I always receive is,

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:20.470
can women or minorities break
rules as much as white men?

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:24.550
And the answer is that
we perceive they can't.

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.680
But actually the
benefits of embracing

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:31.540
these talents are
equal for men and women

00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:34.060
and for all sorts of
groups, which I think

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.370
is quite refreshing.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:39.550
For gender more specifically,
after the book came out,

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:42.460
I ended up writing
a blog post for HBR

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.730
where I talks specifically--

00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:49.540
drawing on a chapter on the
book-- on gender issues.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.630
And sort of giving tips out
of the book of why is it

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:55.466
and how is it that
women can break rules.

00:47:55.466 --> 00:47:56.965
Well yes, so we
have the perception,

00:47:56.965 --> 00:47:59.120
but it is the wrong perception.

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:01.927
And we can all
break rules equally.

00:48:01.927 --> 00:48:03.760
SPEAKER: I think we
have time for one more--

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.343
FRANCESCA GINO:
Within the legal line.

00:48:12.184 --> 00:48:13.600
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:16.920
I'm curious about the
downsides of being a rebel.

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.550
So all the examples you
give are about the upsides

00:48:20.550 --> 00:48:21.450
and the rewards.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:23.890
But obviously, there's
a lot of inherent risk

00:48:23.890 --> 00:48:29.310
as you make yourself more known,
take bigger risks and more

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:29.890
decisions.

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:32.550
So what research have
you done in that area?

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:35.460
FRANCESCA GINO:
So part of it is,

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.750
the fact that you're pushing
for something different.

00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:40.110
And so I think the
case of Bottura

00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:43.410
is a great example
where you might

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:47.730
have to fight some resistance
before getting accepted.

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:51.780
But in terms of, when is it
that they could really go wrong,

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.660
or when the costs
are really high,

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.660
I think that for that
it happens for rebels

00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:58.720
that are not effective.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.845
And what I mean by
this is that often,

00:49:00.845 --> 00:49:02.220
especially in
organizations where

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:04.890
you feel that maybe the
top leadership is not

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:08.220
supporting this approach,
people get frustrated.

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:12.720
And that frustration often
turns into the wrong delivery

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.304
as you're trying to
use these talents.

00:49:14.304 --> 00:49:16.011
I'm going to give you
a concrete example.

00:49:16.011 --> 00:49:18.130
So after the book came
out, a student of mine

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:21.930
wrote me in a message
and said, I saw the book.

00:49:21.930 --> 00:49:22.680
I bought the book.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.770
I read the book.

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.220
I think that you need
to change your subtitle.

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.110
I was like, OK, it says,
why it pays to break

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:29.670
the rules at work and in life.

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:31.080
And we are scientists.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:35.200
So I obviously always want to
learn and I might be wrong.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.410
So I called him up and we had
a conversation for two hours.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:42.364
And basically his argument
was, I'm the perfect rebel,

00:49:42.364 --> 00:49:44.280
based on your descriptions,
but things are not

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.840
working out for me.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.540
And from what he was saying, I
couldn't quite figure it out.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:51.170
And as it turns out, his job
is right outside of Boston.

00:49:51.170 --> 00:49:53.670
So I said, why don't
I come for three days

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:56.880
and follow you at work,
like a neutral observer

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.890
in the background.

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:00.056
I thought it would be a
great experience for me just

00:50:00.056 --> 00:50:01.540
to learn about his approach.

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:06.000
And after the first half a
day, I was like, OK, I get it.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.190
And it was the delivery
that was wrong.

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:13.680
I think he was really frustrated
by what the top leadership was

00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.490
encouraging.

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:17.070
And so he was using
a lot of arrogance.

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:18.980
So for example, in a meeting--

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:21.120
this was just priceless.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:23.310
The group was talking
about a decision

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:24.840
that the company
was considering.

00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.842
And everybody who talked before
him was agreeing on the fact

00:50:27.842 --> 00:50:30.300
that it was the right approach
of looking at this decision.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:32.130
And he was raising his hand.

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:33.150
He was super-angry.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:36.300
And then when he got
called on, he said,

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:38.820
I understand what
you all said and why

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:42.330
you might think that way, but
it is actually the wrong way

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:43.780
of approaching the decision.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.666
In fact, I cannot even think
of an even more wrong way

00:50:46.666 --> 00:50:47.790
of looking at the decision.

00:50:47.790 --> 00:50:49.350
What I suggest we do
instead-- and then

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:50.460
he blurted out his answer.

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:54.750
And I was just in between crying
and laughing in seeing that,

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:56.830
because the approach was wrong.

00:50:56.830 --> 00:50:58.830
So I think that
that's often when

00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:02.229
things get a little bit
difficult for people

00:51:02.229 --> 00:51:03.270
and they encounter costs.

00:51:05.627 --> 00:51:06.710
SPEAKER: Great, thank you.

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:08.293
I'm sure we have a
lot more questions.

00:51:08.293 --> 00:51:10.250
But unfortunately
we are out of time.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.832
So--

00:51:10.832 --> 00:51:12.540
FRANCESCA GINO: I'll
leave you with that.

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:14.090
So that if you have
extra questions

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:15.506
you should feel
free to reach out.

00:51:15.506 --> 00:51:17.490
I'll also leave you with
the following thing.

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:22.980
Some of you might feel, maybe,
not at ease with the idea.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:27.382
And so to get started on
this wonderful journey,

00:51:27.382 --> 00:51:29.090
you might want to go
to the book website.

00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:30.920
It's called rebeltalents.org.

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.291
And there is a little test that
tells you which type of rebel

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:34.790
you are.

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:38.320
So which type of talents come
more easily or less easily

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:38.820
to you.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:40.528
And so you're going
to receive some tips.

00:51:40.528 --> 00:51:43.820
And if you come out as a
pirate, it's a good thing.

00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:46.140
It's actually quite
a very good thing.

00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:47.460
So thank you so much.

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:49.560
MODERATOR: Thank you
so much for being here.

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:50.060
Thank you.

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.110
[APPLAUSE]
