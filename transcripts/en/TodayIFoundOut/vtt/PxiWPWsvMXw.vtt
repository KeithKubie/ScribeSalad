00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.160
When it comes to war, innovation is key and
WWII saw more insane ideas and weapons of

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.880
war developed than perhaps any before it.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.670
One of the more surreal was the Antonov A-40,
colloquially known as the tank that could

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.670
fly!

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.500
Known in Russia as the, крылья танка
(literally, “Winged Tank”), the Antonov

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.720
A-40 was the end result of one, Oleg Antonov,
wondering how Russians could get a fully laden

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.190
tank onto a battlefield without exposing a
plane to enemy fire on the ground.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.540
Previous to this, they had already experimented
with strapping T-37 light tanks and T-27 tankettes

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.860
to bombers as a means of transporting them
as early as 1935.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.640
However, both tanks were simply too small
to do much damage in combat and risking an

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.810
entire TB-3 bomber to put one of these tanks
into battle simply wasn’t worth it.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.340
The Russians also experimented with simply
dropping tanks (with and without parachutes)

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.770
out of planes to see what would happen.

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.609
As you might have guessed, that didn’t exactly
work out.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.200
In these cases, the crews were required to
parachute down separate from the tank, then

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.710
hopefully get to it before enemy troops and
without being killed in the process.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.950
A better plan was needed.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.080
In 1940, Oleg sketched a design for a set
of glider wings that could be outfitted on

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.121
a much larger tank, enabling it to fly if
towed behind an aircraft that could get it

00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:23.220
up to speed.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.680
On paper the idea was genius, since it solved
the problem of exposing the transporting aircraft

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.560
to enemy ground fire as well as the weight
limit of the TB-3 that had restricted what

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.540
it could transport to very small tanks.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.840
However, it would take another 2 years and
a German invasion before anyone asked Oleg

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.580
to actually build and test his design.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.860
Once he did, he attached a pair of custom
built wings to a modified T-60 tank.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.600
After the tank glided down to the battlefield,
the wings were designed to be ejected upon

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.600
landing.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.620
If you’re wondering how the tank’s pilot
steered the thing, that too was a work of

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.810
simplistic genius.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.710
Its wings were controlled by the movements
of the tank’s own turret.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.900
Moving it up and down, for example, would
allow it to adjust pitch; moving it left or

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.250
right would allow it to bank, left or right.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.371
While this might sound good in theory, because
of the extreme weight of the tank and the

00:02:12.371 --> 00:02:16.790
limited lift the wings could actually provide,
armaments, fuel and even armour needed to

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.400
be removed from the T-60 to get it into the
air for the test flight.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.230
That said, according to the Russians, the
A-40 had a successful test flight, though

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.890
“successful” is maybe too strong of a
word.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.340
During the A-40’s only flight in history,
the pilot at the tank’s helm was Sergei

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.340
Anokin.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.790
Sergei was a test pilot by trade and had to
take a crash course in tank driving prior

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.340
to the “flight.”

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.610
As for the flight itself, the Tupolev TB-3
bomber towing the tank had its engines overheat

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.319
and they nearly failed almost immediately
after take-off.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.099
Because of this, the TB-3 had to cut the tank
free earlier than expected.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.110
Even still, Sergei was able to guide the tank
in and reportedly landed “very smoothly”

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.110
in a nearby field.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.560
He was even able to drive the tank back to
headquarters to report on the success personally.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.989
While he reported a smooth landing, it was
pretty tricky business.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.959
It required Sergei to start the tank’s engine
and engage the tracks just before it hit the

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:12.959
ground, along with actually landing it.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.969
Questioned about the experience afterwards,
Sergei was apparently very excited about the

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.749
ordeal, but was skeptical about how it would
have turned out had the tank been fully loaded

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:23.709
as it would need to be in battle.

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.099
With the TB-3 struggling to pull the slimmed
down tank; the fact that project was eventually

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.889
set on making the significantly heavier T-34
tanks fly; and a good number of TB-3 planes

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:33.959
needed to tow the contraption had been destroyed
by the war, the project was scrapped.

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.950
That’s not to say some officials didn’t
see the benefit of flying tanks raining death

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:54.659
from the sky; it was just agreed that it was
a much better idea to use 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:00.569
the limited resource of bombers at their command
for a more conventional purpose… like bombing

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.150
things.
