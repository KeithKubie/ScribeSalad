00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.340
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Well, good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.180
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.480
I'm John Cole.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.070
I'm the Director of the Center
for the Book for the Library

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.210
of Congress, which is the
library's reading and literacy

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.950
and book promotion arm, and we
promote books, reading, libraries

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.110
and literacy here at
the Library of Congress

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.360
and also throughout the country.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.270
We hinge our program, in part, our
national program, onto networks.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.640
State centers for the book,
which are affiliates which work

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.620
with state writers largely in
promoting books and reading

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.830
in states and also nonprofit
organizations that partner

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.130
with us in various projects.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.560
One of the biggest projects
that we are involved

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.440 position:56%
in is the National Book Festival,
which I hope some of you know about,

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.760
and if not, I can just
let you in on a secret.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.550
It looks like we're going to be
moving to late September this year

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.460
after a couple of years of Labor
Day weekend, but we'll still be

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.750 position:56%
in the Washington Convention Center.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.330
We also have programs here at the
library such as Books and Beyond,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.960
and thank you for joining
us today on such a cold day.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.100
I know that a number of you are
in town for professional reasons,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.630
but we have members of the public
and you have a treat in store,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.530
because we are talking
about a very special book.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.500
The Books and Beyond Series is
a noontime lecture program based

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.610
on brand-new books that
have been published

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.170
that have a special connection
with the Library of Congress,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.370
and boy do we have a
special connection today.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.330
Often, the authors have
done their research here,

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.670
but sometimes the books are based
on projects that have been produced

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.580
by the library for
the last few years.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.190
There are several, lots of
seats in the middle kind

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.630
of if people would
like to step across.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.320
That would be great.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.640
The program works like this.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.620
We will have the book talk.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.850
Then we also will have a
question-and-answer period.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.950
The show is being filmed not only
by the Library of Congress but also

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.260
by C-SPAN, so you will have an
opportunity to see it later.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.840
There will be a question-and-answer
period.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.750
I would like to remind you to
turn off all things electronic,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.120 position:56%
and then we will have a book
signing starting at about 1 o'clock.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.980
But I get a big kick out of being
able to hold up beautiful books

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.650
in anticipation of learning not
only the story about the book,

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.720
but a good deal about Lewis
and Clark and a good deal

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.200
from two gentlemen who will
be introducing themselves

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.890 position:56%
who are experienced and have a great
deal of knowledge about the period

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.970
and a great deal of knowledge about
their respective institutions.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.930
They are Ralph Ehrenberg, who
currently the Chief of Library

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.060
of Congress's Geography
and Map Division.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.580
Ralph was the chief from 1990 until
1998, and we had the good luck

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.750
of having him return as Chief
of the Division in 2011 in 2011.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.540
His partner in crime
today is Herman Viola,

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.260
who also is a veteran employee.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.140
Your program is being brought to
you by veterans, including myself.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.190
I've known Herman and Ralph
for a number of years.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.130
They initially met when they
worked at the national archives

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.190
in the mid 60s, which was
when I came to the Library

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.270
of Congress in that period.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.550
Herman had a long career
with various positions

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.740
at the Smithsonian, but he's
been brought back, he told me,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:23.430
today after retiring from the
Smithsonian to work half-time

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.560
at the National Museum
of the American Indian

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.540
on another exciting project.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.300
So it's typical that we
don't let our veterans

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.850
or our experts get away, and
we're lucky enough to have two

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.010
of them here today who are going
to not only tell us about the book,

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.180
but share their knowledge of this
period of American history with me.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.090
They'll tell you more about
themselves at all about the book.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.510
Let's welcome Ralph
Ehrenberg and Herman Viola.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:59.510
[ Applause ]

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.410
[ Silence ]

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:03.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, thank you, John.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.600
Herman and I are going to
act as a tag team today.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.590
We've been doing that
for mean years.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.080
We did the Lolo Trail
together a number of times.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.230
Herman started that going over
the Bitterroot Mountains following

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.910 position:56%
in the footsteps of Lewis and Clark.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.300
The 80-mile trip over the
Bitterroots, and he initiated

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.500
that for the Smithsonian and
then carried that on himself,

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.290
and I was lucky enough to be
involved in a number of those.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.880
So that's how we really became
interested in Lewis and Clark, and,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.800 position:56%
of course, he's a historian and
he's a historian of American Indian,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.860
so he came at it from that point
of view, and I'm a historian

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.470
of cartography, and I
came at it from that side.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.920
So together we put
this book together,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.360
and as far as we know it's the
only book that focuses primarily

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.310
on the maps of Lewis and Clark.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.670
There are, of course, huge number
of books since the bicentennial

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:14.370
of Lewis and Clark and on them
and on the various activities,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:21.270
and some touch on maps, and there's
fine atlas that was put together

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.100
on Lewis and Clark maps, but we're
trying to correct this imbalance

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.560
of examining maps that
guided them in the field

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.750
and documented their route.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:36.280
Before I continue, I do want
to thank a number of people

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.940
that were involved
with this production,

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.760
beginning with Levenger
Press and Mim Harrison,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.130 position:56%
who is a great publisher of that
press and has done a number of books

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.910
with the Library of Congress,
and I took this idea to her

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:57.000
about two years ago, I guess, and
she was very interested in it,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.820
and then we met with Peggy Wagner,
who is one of the publishers

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.440
in our publishing office, and
she carried on from there.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.990
So I want to thank both of them.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.200
I want to thank Peggy
particularly and Peter Devereux

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.800 position:56%
from the publishing office and Diane
Chugg-O'Neill from the Geography

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.760 position:56%
and Map Division, who made a
special effort to scan all the maps.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.900
We have over 100 maps in the
book, and each one of them had

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.590
to be specially scanned from
the Library of Congress.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.200
The majority are from the
Geography Map Division.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:35.420
I also want to thank Jackie
Nolan our cartographer

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:40.290
in the Geography Map Division,
who compiled a number of the maps,

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.780
and our reference section,
particularly Ed Redman,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.870
who helped a great deal while
I was working on the book.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:53.730
The theme of our book
is a biography of Lewis

00:07:53.730 --> 00:08:00.550
and Clarke's great 1814 map,
and it measures 12 x 28 inches.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.850
This is the original.

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.910
This is the original copperplate
engraving, and it's the size.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.430
There's an American edition
and a British addition,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.080
this was published in 1814.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.940
So the book is really
the background,

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:22.780
the stories behind this story,
and this map was first published

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.270
with Lewis and Clark's journal,
The History of the Expedition

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:29.760
under the Command of
Captains Lewis and Clark

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.570
and was edited by Nicholas Biddle.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.570
Thomas Jefferson was
the inspiration.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:40.130
He wrote the specifications
for the map for Lewis,

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:43.000
but much of the mapmaking was
actually done by his co-leader,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.850
William Clark, who
was the cartographer.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.990
Military training,
self-educated in mapmaking.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:57.830
Over 200 maps survive, 30 by
American Indians, and the majority,

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.890
although one was compiled
by William Clark.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.080
Although Jefferson wrote, "I
cannot live without books."

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.250
He also wrote, "An inspection
of a map will give a better idea

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.140
of geography than any
description in writing."

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.650
And Thomas Jefferson
himself was a cartographer.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:22.940
He published his map of Virginia
in 1787 for his notes on the State

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.600
of Virginia, and he comes
from a family of mapmakers.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.070
Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson
published the first accurate map

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:35.200
of the State of Virginia
in the 1750s.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:41.420
Today, Lewis -- I've
got to move ahead here.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.980
Okay, this is a map that Dr. Mullen
[assumed spelling] is showing you,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.330
and it's biography of this
map that we're focusing on.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.800
Today, the Lewis and Clark map
can be produced in a few hours

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.870 position:56%
or actually, probably, a few minutes
using simple programming language,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:09.570 position:56%
basic GIS techniques, and geographic
data downloads from onboard earth-

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:13.740
orbiting satellites, or obtained
from digital elevation models,

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:20.490
and the one we see here was done in
2003 by the US geological survey,

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.290
and it took three hours
at that point.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:29.940
Today it would be much faster,
but 200 years ago, the production

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.130
of this map required a team of
some 50 explorers, soldiers,

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.430
American Indians, mountain
men, cartographers,

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.240
copperplate engravers, printers,
and an American President,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.700 position:56%
and an American Secretary of State,
and it took this group some 10 years

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:51.680
to produce and publish the map
that Dr. Mullen just showed you.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:57.000
So our book is focused on the story
of this map, and its backstory.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.220
Dr. Viola will begin with a
short overview of the expedition.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.000
Then we will share several
map stories of vignettes

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.080
within the story and
conclude with a description

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:11.840
of several special
features of the book.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.710
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola:
Okay, thank you, Ralph.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.960 position:56%
Okay, I'm Herman Viola, I'm a
Curator Emeritus at the Smithsonian.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.320
Ralph and I have been
friends since, what?

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.400
'66, I guess, and we've
done a lot of Lewis

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.990
and Clark adventures together.

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.380
We did the Lolo Trail on horseback.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.840
I think I did it 20 times, and
so that we really got into it,

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.060 position:56%
and my specialty is American Indians

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.550
and that's why I got particularly
interested in this story,

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.050
because they interacted
with so many Indian tribes.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.200
Now, most of you probably know
more about this than we do,

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.670
and we're not telling you the
history of the expedition here.

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:52.410
We're really focusing on the
story of that map, but, you know,

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:58.840 position:56%
the expedition started out in 1804,
ended up in St. Louis again in 1806,

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:02.030
and it was Jefferson's inspiration.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:06.990
He wanted to know what was
beyond the Mississippi River,

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.200
and so he wanted to do this several
times, couldn't figure it out.

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.590
He actually hired a scientist
to come to the West Coast by way

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:20.980
of Russia, and the Cossacks
stopped him, and so, anyhow,

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.830
once he became President,
and was reality

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.720
and he picked Meriwether Lewis,
who was a neighbor, young man.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.680
He knew the family quite well, and
talked Lewis into coming on board,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.680
and so they planned this thing for
quite a while, and so, you know,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.860
theoretically, I mean,
these were probably,

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.160
I don't want to offend anybody.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.820
These were probably
Republicans at that time,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:50.920
and so the Congress didn't want
to waste any money, and so they,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.720
so anyhow, Jefferson
had to convince Congress

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.610
that this was actually an economic
adventure that would pay off

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.190
for the United States, and he
need to have a few dollars,

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:06.760
$2500 or so to fund a few soldiers
to go West, and he said, you know,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.070
"We're doing this so
that we can make contact

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:12.180
with the native peoples
who live out West.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.820
We don't know anything about them.

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.410
We don't know how many warriors
they have in these tribe.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.590
They had already had a couple
wars with Indians to begin with.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.190
Last thing we want to do is go
west find out we're going to do

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:26.430
with people we can,
you know, cope with.

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.880
So Congress thought that was a
very good idea, but of course,

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:35.750
Jefferson secretly was hoping
to discover new animals.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.170
You know, there were all these
stories about extinct creatures,

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.290
and he was hoping that some of
those creatures were still alive.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.490
He's the only president, I think,
who had a mastodon skeleton

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:50.720 position:56%
in the White House, and so he
wanted to make sure that the fellows

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:54.890
who did this really kept good
notes, docket of the plants,

00:13:54.890 --> 00:14:00.400
documented the animals, and, of
course, but priority make friends

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.920
with the native peoples they met.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.080
The last thing we want to do is
have a conflict with people all

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.310
across the American West, and
so anyhow, the expedition set

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:13.580
out from St. Louis
in 1804, May 1804,

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:16.890
and you can see this wonderful
chart which gives you an idea

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.570
of the route, back and forth.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.180 position:56%
The reality is, and this is
something most people don't realize,

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:27.890 position:56%
is that they actually thought there
would be a ship on the Pacific Coast

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.400 position:56%
that these poor devils wouldn't
have to walk all the way back again,

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.410 position:56%
and there would be a vote that would
take them, because there was a lot

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:39.500 position:56%
of shipping going on in the
Pacific Coast, and is it turned out,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.400 position:56%
Lewis and Clark spend the winter
out there, and there had been a boat

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.210
about 50 miles up that they
never got contact with.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.130
So then they just had
to tighten their belts

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.800
and go all the way back again.

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.520
So they actually ended up making
about, I'd say, about 8000 miles

00:14:55.520 --> 00:15:01.200
on foot, and -- I mean, on
water, and 800 miles on foot,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:05.970
and so they tried to use boats
primarily because the goal was

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:09.770
to find a water route
across the continent

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.450
that would really simplify
making contact with the Pacific

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:17.000
and doing international trade,
and so they set out, you know,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.410
with a keelboat and then they
got up to the Mandan villages,

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.280
and they sent the keelboat
back with stuff

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.460
that they had already collected,
and then they went back into canoes

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.670
and went further upriver,
and the one drawback,

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.410
which none of them planned on.

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:37.620
Jefferson thought this thing
through very carefully,

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:39.070
but they never dreamed
they were going

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:44.090
to need horses to cross
the mountains.

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:48.940 position:56%
Lewis and Jefferson walked along the
Alleghenies, and the theory was --

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.890
they knew that there was a
mountain range out there,

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:53.430
but they thought it was just a
parallel mountain range to what was

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:57.320
in the East, so these
fellows could just roll over

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.820
and take their boats down,

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.570
so here is poor fellows suddenly
see these huge mountains,

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.770
snow-covered mountains, and they
had something like 3000 pounds

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.780 position:56%
of supplies that they were carrying.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:15.970 position:56%
A lot of ammunition, lead, gunpowder
paper for all the notes they took,

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:21.600
presents for the Indians, and
so they really had a challenge,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.290
and then they knew then they
need horses, and who had horses?

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:30.650
The Indians, and fortunately,
they had with them Sacajawea,

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.120 position:56%
who was a Shoshone girl, and really,

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.330
only Hollywood could
write script like this.

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:41.640
She was along because she was
married to this Frenchman,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.610
who was kind of a rascal.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:49.990
We won't go into that, Charbonneau,
so anyhow, she said, "Well, look,

00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:52.200
this is where I used to live."

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:54.400
She recognized places where
she had been as a girl.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.570
She was kidnapped she was
like 12 years old or so,

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.550
and then she said,
"My people are here."

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:03.330
And sure enough, they bump
into a Shoshone village,

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:05.450
and the chief of the
village was her brother.

00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:11.000 position:56%
And they met, and I can't spend too
much time with this, but it was said

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.500
to be a pretty emotional
meeting when she's interpreting

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.400 position:56%
and with this man, and they suddenly
realize that they're brother

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.140
and sister, and they hadn't seen
each other in all these years,

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.670
and we hugged each other and
cried, and Lewis and Clark

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.630 position:56%
in their journals, you know, to give
you an idea of what they thought

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.550
of Indian people, at the time about
Indians, they're just like us.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.210
They have emotions just like us.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:38.440
I mean, there's so many interesting
depth into the story, but anyhow,

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:42.040
thanks to that reunion,
they got their horses,

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.900
and then they were able to go over
the Lolo Trail, which I urge all

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:48.590
of you to try and do
this if you can.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.370
There's a highway of course you
could take now, and still say,

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.940
"Oh, that's where they were."

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.580
But there are some people
out who, wranglers and stuff,

00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:01.240
who will take horseback people,
and you'd be amazed the campsites

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.910
that they documented in their
journals are there to this day.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:08.450 position:56%
When we go there, we take the
journals out and say, and we'd read,

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.150
and we'd say, "This
is where they stood."

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.240
I mean, it's just astounding
so anyhow, then they made it

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:18.250
to Pacific Coast, and the boat
was there to take them home,

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.940
and so they had to come
all the way back again.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.470
Now the one myth about this story
is that Lewis and Clarke went off

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.310
into an untracked wilderness.

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.960 position:56%
You know, they were the first people
to see it, and no one knew anything

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.210
about it, but the reality
is they had AAA Trip Tik

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:42.040
from the American Indians,
and it's just, you know,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.440
hard for us to believe but the,
you know, Canadians had been

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.760 position:56%
up there earlier, the Hudson's Bay
people, and they had collected a lot

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:58.120
of geographical data from
native peoples, and so anyhow,

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.620
Lewis and Clark, when they go
out there, they're supposed

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.870
to make friends with
these native peoples,

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:05.210
and so they did that very well.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:08.540
They encountered, it's documented

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:12.440
that they met 55 different
native groups.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.110
Now some of them were
complete bands of people.

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:19.140
Some were just individuals from
tribes that bumped their way,

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:23.690
but they had made contact with
about 55 different tribal peoples,

00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:26.040
and their mission was
to say, you know,

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.150
we're the new people on the block.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:33.950
You may have been loyal to Spain or
to Russia or to France or England,

00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:37.650
but now the United States
is here, and we have a boss

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.440
in the East whose going to be
very kind to you, and he's going

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:43.010
to be a great father,

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.160
and now another myth is the Indians
called him The Great White Father,

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.580
and that was nonsense.

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:50.470
They never called him
The Great White Father.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.650
Was The Great Father, the
person who gives gifts.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:55.900
Indians were colorblind that way.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:58.240
So anyhow, here you'll
see one of the engravings,

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.540
the early ones showing Lewis

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.080
and Clark meeting with
the native peoples.

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.410
So anyhow, they carried gifts
to give to native peoples.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:11.330
One of the big things they
carried, ribbon, colorful ribbons,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:17.380
and lightweight -- but the most
important gifts were metals

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.020
and uniforms and things that
gave military significance,

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.530
and these are called peace metals,
and they're called peace metals

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:28.680
because on the obverse of these
coins, you see the clasp hands

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.400
of friendship nonliterate
peoples can easily understand,

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.930
them and Lewis and Clark carried
about 100 of these with them,

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.090
and so they would give,
there were three sizes,

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.710
and they gave the biggest one,
supposedly, to the head chief,

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.900
even though most tribes didn't
have such thing as a president,

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.030
and the middle sizes were
the kind of the lieutenants,

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:51.550
and the small ones like the
ordinary members of the community,

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.520
but these Indians valued
these things greatly,

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.770
and they'd keep them
their whole lives.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.910 position:56%
They'd be buried with them, and they
still show up in graves occasionally

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:05.350
out West when they do road
work and stuff like that.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.860
Now I mentioned AAA Trip Tik.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.990 position:56%
Anyhow, the Hudson's Bay people had
been out there before us, of course,

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:16.890 position:56%
and there is a fellow named Peter
Fidler, who worked for Hudson's Bay,

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.980
and he managed to get
Indian information,

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:24.780
geographical information, that
is just remarkably accurate

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:29.350
and significant, and you're
looking at this one map,

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:34.390
and on this one map, which was
done in 1801, he had recorded

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:38.940
for the Hudson's Bay people, the
locations of the Indian tribes

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.870
in that part of the world.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:46.650
In the Rocky Mountains
are this horizontal line,

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.820
and then he's got the
rivers that feed into it,

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:56.190
and then he's located all these
different Indian villages, and he,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:01.680
on this map, has documented the
locations of 32 Indian tribes.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.680
So the CIA would have loved a map
like this going into Afghanistan.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:12.130
I mean, here is this amazing
network of information, and then,

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.940
he then did a year
later another map,

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:16.780
got another map from this chief.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.310
The man's name is Ac ko mo ki.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.450
He was a Blackfeet Chief.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:23.440
A very knowledgeable person
about the geography in this part

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:30.120 position:56%
of the world, and so this you see
is what he did here as he simplified

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:36.690 position:56%
by the map and he took the people,
he put in the geographical features,

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:42.570 position:56%
and what's really astounding to
Ralph and myself is that these names

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.900
of these features that that Indian
recorded are still the names we use

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.680
today for these geographical
features,

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.500
the Tetons, the Bear Tooth.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.680
King Mountain today
is Chief Mountain.

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.330
Heart Mountain, near Cody,
Wyoming, and so there they are.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:03.050
These have transferred down
200 years, and so again,

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:08.010
you can see what this is such
an important bit of information,

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:17.830 position:56%
and so here, thanks to the geography
map that folks, you have showing

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.220
that the red line here
is the Missouri River,

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.810
and then you see the
rivers that feed into it,

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:28.480
and this is all compiled from
Ac ko mok ki Ki's information.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:37.590
Now this information went to
England and then was transferred

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.690
to the first real geographical
map of North America

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:45.450
by a scientific cartographer
named Aaron Arrowsmith,

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:50.390
and what to me is the most
significant thing of this map is

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:54.660
that you saw Ac ko mok
ki had filled that map

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:58.690
of his all these tribal
peoples all over West,

00:23:58.690 --> 00:24:03.060
and then when this is composed
and compiled in England,

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:08.050
all that Aaron Arrowsmith put in
were the geographical features,

00:24:08.050 --> 00:24:11.800
and he erased all these thousands
and thousands of people who lived

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:16.030
out there, and that's why I'm
convinced, people in the East said,

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.410
"Well, that's an empty landscape.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.610
It's ours for the taking
because nobody's there."

00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:25.610
And all done with the stroke
of a brush that thousands

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:28.110
of people are gone, and so to me,

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:32.230
this is a very significant
historical document, and of course,

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:37.880
though, Lewis and Clark, is they
go West, encounter these people,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.050
and the retail at the reality is

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:43.570
that expedition could not have
succeeded without the help

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.730
of those Indians they encountered,
and I like to tell folks

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:52.210
that what Lewis and Clark did was
go follow a chain across the West,

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:56.220
and each link in the chain
is an Indian community,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.330
and so they welcomed them and then
said, "Now you want to make friends

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.080
with these folks next-door."

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.380
And so that's how it worked.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.470
It was a chain of friendship, and
I don't want to go too long here,

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.550
but anyhow, just I work
a lot with Indian people.

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:10.570
Just to give you an idea.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.680
When they get over the Lola
Trail and they're starving.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.680
They think they can't get
anywhere, and they are looking

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.420 position:56%
for people, they meet the Nez Perce.

00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.600
The Nez Perce had heard of
white people, never met them,

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.660
and so here Clark is going
ahead with about six of his men.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:29.590
They see a village in the distance.

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:33.060
They've got to get food, and that
the three little boys jump up

00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:36.710
and start running like crazy,
and so Clark gallops up.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.010
He's on his horse.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.860
Grabs one of the kids.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:41.160
Takes him.

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.460
Says, "Stop, don't run.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.760
We're friends.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.060
We're here to help you."

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.360
Now remember, Clark
has flaming red hair,

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.330
and Indians at that time had never
seen anything except black hair

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:54.500
and brown eyes, and some of the
guys with Clark were blue-eyed,

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.700
and one of them had
a beard, but no hair,

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.750
and so they gave the boys
yellow ribbons and said,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.320
"Tell your families, we're going

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:08.380
to have extra people
for dinner tonight."

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.340
And we'll be there shortly.

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.340 position:56%
So these boys go running into the
village, and this is all documented.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.790
The Nez Perce still have the
oral history to this day.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.160
And these boys run into
the village yelling,

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.830
"We've seen monsters in the woods.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.320
Monsters in the woods!"

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.560
And the parents tell
them to calm down.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.160
What do you mean monsters?

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.460
"Yes! Yes!"

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.080
he says, "Some of them
have blue eyes."

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.610
And of course, only fish had blue
eyes out there, and they said,

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:36.510
"And one monster, his
head upside down."

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:39.110
[ Laughter ]

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:46.440
And they said, "But the worst
monster, his head is on fire!"

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:50.720
So anyhow, long story short, they
said to the kids, "Calm down,

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.670
and we'll see what the
monsters are really like."

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:57.360 position:56%
They welcomed the Lewis and Clark
Expedition, and the rest is history.

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.660
Thank you very much.

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.460
Here, now if you can take over.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.170
[ Applause ]

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:04.820
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg:
He's not done yet.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:06.290
So this was a very important map.

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:12.300
So this is Aaron Arrowsmith's
map of 1802, and actually,

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.120
there are two 1802 maps,
and were just lucky enough

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.540
to acquire the second
one just recently,

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:22.480
which really relates more directly
to the Lewis and Clark Expedition,

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.560
but this map then, this
map, not his particular map,

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.740
but one just like this was
purchased by Jefferson,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.920
and as part of the planning
then for Lewis and Clark,

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:37.850
Jefferson put together a
team to plan the expedition,

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:42.600
and this one of the primary
sources, and he worked very closely

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.540
with Gallatin, the
Secretary of Treasury,

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:54.450
and Gallatin had Nicholas King
then pull all this data together.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.870
Nicholas King was the
British surveyor,

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:03.060
immigrated to the United States
in the 1790s, and then ended

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:04.360
up here in Washington DC.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.720
His father also, and they both
worked in the Surveyors Department

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.810
of the City of Washington
at that time, and in 1803,

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.560
King was named the first Surveyor
of the City of Washington.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:22.810
So he was surveyor of the
city Washington 1803 to 1812,

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:27.420
and he really implemented
Lafont's plan on the ground,

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.870
but he also worked part
time for the War Department.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:34.750
He worked six hours a day for
the city and the two hours a day

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:39.020
for the War Department,
and he did a number of maps

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.790
for the War Department
and for Jefferson,

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.330
and this is the most important.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.520 position:56%
This is a map then that he compiled.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.890
Let's see if I can work this again.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:57.610
So he, in this part of it, he from
Arrowsmith's map, which was based

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:03.120
on the British surveyor's,
primarily the Hudson's Bay Company,

00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.790
and then Vancouver's map
provided the West Coast outlines,

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:11.720
the coastal outlines, and
the interior was taken off

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:19.630
of the Arrowsmith map, which is,
in essence, Ac ko mok ki's map.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:24.490
Then one of the nice things that
the designers did for this book,

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:29.450 position:56%
they did insets for the larger maps.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:32.420
It's always hard to reproduce
a large map in a book.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.050
You can never read the details.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:39.300
So I asked them if they would --
I told them I wanted to do insets,

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.770
and then they came up
with this great inset map.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.520
So we have three of these in the
book, but this shows the detail,

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.130
then, of the upper Missouri River.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:55.080
This is actually the Milk
River and the Missouri,

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.750
and then the same mountains.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.580
The King Mountain,
which Herman mentioned.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.910
Heart Mountain.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.310
Boar's Tooth Mountain.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.140
That really should be Bear's Tooth.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:11.420 position:56%
It was miscopied, and that shows
problems in transferring information

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:17.710
from one map to another, and this
is The Great Bend of the Missouri

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:24.140 position:56%
around Bismarck in North Dakota,
and Mandans had their villages here.

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:35.840 position:56%
And this part of the map was taken
from Thompson, David Thompson, 1798.

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:40.060
Thompson was a surveyor for
the Northwest Fur Company,

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:42.520
and he had visited the area
and had actually surveyed it.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.840
He was a trained surveyor, and he
made a small map, which was copied

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:52.820
by the British diplomat, Edward
Thornton, and through Thornton,

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:54.560 position:56%
Nicholas King got a copy of the map.

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.540
So we have a lot of
British information,

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:01.630
but it's primarily an Indian map.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.340
So this was the objective of
Lewis and Clark, and it's based

00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:14.730
on an Indian map, and what's
interesting to just follow,

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.480
this is a diagram that
shows the exchange of Indian

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.940
and fur trappers data at that time.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:27.110
So this is the Ac ko mok ki map.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.160
This is David Thompson's map,
the fur trader, mountain man.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.900
So American Indian
and the mountain man.

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.290
This information makes
its way back to London

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:43.600
where Aaron Arrowsmith gets access
to it, and then he compiles his map

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.270 position:56%
of North America, which is purchased
by Jefferson, and it's copied

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:53.320
by Nicholas King, and this map
is then actually carried by Lewis

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.640
and Clark to The Great
Bend of the Missouri,

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.170
so it makes a complete circle.

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:02.690
It's just a fascinating example
of international exchange

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:07.120 position:56%
at a very early time in our history.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:09.750
These two maps are
in our collection.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:13.460
The original Nicholas King
map is in our collection.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:29.710 position:56%
The second great map that relates to
the final map is this one by Clark,

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:34.660
and this was prepared by Clark
during the first winter oversight

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.420
in Fort Mandan, which near
Bismarck, North Dakota,

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:45.630 position:56%
and the Mandans had several villages
up here, and from the winter of 1804

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:51.150
to 1805, Lewis and
Clark stayed here,

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:55.650
and then sent information
of the Lower Missouri.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:59.970
This is St. Louis, and
here's the Missouri River.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.960
So now for the first time,
this is been mapped in detail.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:07.150
The French and Spanish knew
of this part of the river.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.330
They knew of the river from
St. Louis to Fort Mandan,

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.090
but they had mapped it in detail.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.590
Louis and Clark were
the first to do that,

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:19.390
and this information was sent back
in the spring of 1805 when Lewis

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:24.790
and Clark set out on the second
leg of their expedition out west,

00:33:24.790 --> 00:33:30.230
and they sent back, I don't know,
seven or eight men with them,

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:34.930
and Lewis and Clark are
very good commanders.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:41.140
They sent back the
malcontents, along with this data,

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:45.290
and data reaches Washington DC, and
Nicholas King, the first surveyor

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:50.980
of the city of Washington, the
British-trained cartographer

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.710
and Thomas Jefferson sit on
the floor of the White House,

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:58.400
then the President's House, and
pull all this information together.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.790
So Jefferson was intimately
involved with this,

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.760
and Nicholas King then
compiles his map.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.360
He compiles four copies of this.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.950
This is in our collection here.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:12.600 position:56%
This was, he compiled one for the
State Department, one for each house

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.660
of Congress, and one
for War Department,

00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:20.020
and this is the State Department,
and the War Department copy is

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:21.320
in the National Archives.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.450
The other two have disappeared.

00:34:24.450 --> 00:34:26.760
But it really shows three
layers of information.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:33.460
One we've already talked about
is the first relatively accurate

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.490
rendition of the Lower Missouri.

00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:39.600
The second relevant information.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:44.100
Well, here's the Missouri
a detail from it.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:51.490
And the second relates to a census.

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:54.660
This being a census of
Indian military power,

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:55.990
and you can't probably read it.

00:34:55.990 --> 00:35:01.950
But it's 300 tents, 800 men, and
I added these all up one time,

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:04.520
and it comes to 16,000 warriors.

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.210
Now the warriors could
have been young boys.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:08.510
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola:
Yeah, they were, yes.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.670
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg:
Probably, as well,

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.120
but that was the count, 16,000.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:20.570
U.S. Army, at that time, was 3000
generously, and on the frontier,

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:25.530 position:56%
probably 300, you know, in St. Louis
and along the Mississippi River.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:29.470
So when they saw this, they were
probably a little concerned,

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:35.880
but that was one of the purposes
of this map, and the final layer

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.750
of information is the West.

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:41.810
The second leg of the expedition,
which was really a planning map,

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:46.900
which is unknown, as we saw in
that earlier map by Ac ko mok ki,

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:50.860
and during the winter, they
debriefed Indians returning

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:54.410
for war parties, from
trading parties,

00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:57.000
and they add this new information.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.880
They extend the Missouri River.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:04.220
They, for the first time, they map,
they have a map of the Yellowstone,

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:09.040
which I'll go into a
little later, and these --

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.370
Ac ko mok ki's mountain
is still here,

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:12.790
and they don't quite know
what to do with them.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:14.460 position:56%
So they just push them to the north,

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:16.770
because they have also
other information.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.250 position:56%
Cartographers are very conservative,

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:29.790
and they try to retain all their
information somewhere on the map.

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:33.050
Now how is a map compiled?

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:36.800
And all of the later maps
are compiled this way,

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:42.580
and so the Lower Missouri,
then, was based on this survey,

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:46.110
it is basically an
open and traverse,

00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.830
which simply involved measuring
the straight line distance

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.670
between each major
turn during the journey

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.330
and recording each compass
bearing of the next turn.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:56.160
They had five separate
compasses with them.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:01.030
The compass relied on
this 300 years earlier.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.620
So nothing changed much.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:04.000
It's also called dead reckoning.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.530
So from this, as they're
going up the river,

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.570
they're taking these compass
bearings, and then summary

00:37:21.570 --> 00:37:23.710
in the boat, Clark is
taking the bearing,

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:29.690
and somebody in the boat is writing
it down, and courses and distances,

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:36.530
July 26, 1805, May 1805, so
each turn, and as Herman said,

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:41.420
that was an 8000 mile trip,
and 4000 miles one way.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:45.610
Each turn they recorded
this information,

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:48.430
the compass and distance.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:55.260
So 45 degrees west of south,
45 degrees west of south.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:38:01.130
This book by Martin Plamondon
is a tremendous true volume work

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:05.930
on the entire trip, and they took
readings, they took front readings,

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:08.670
and they also took reverse
readings, depending where they were

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.480
in the board in the corner,
and so there were errors,

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.020
but the errors seem to cancel
themselves out, as they were only

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.830
about 20 miles off at the end of a
about 4000 mile trip from St. Louis

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.220
to the mouth of the Columbia River,

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:28.010
and here we get the other
information, 45 degrees west

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:32.180
of south, which is this
one right here to the point

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:35.920
of an open plane on
the opposite bluff.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:37.220
So here's the open plane.

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:42.970
Here's the opposite bluff.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:49.180
Then in the evenings, when they
had some time or an extended stay

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:54.250
at a campsite, Lewis and Clark
plotted their daily courses

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.470
and distances on a gridded
paper that they took with them

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.210
to provide a rudimentary base map

00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:03.420
to which additional geographic
information could be added.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.570
So that's how the sectional
maps and these river maps,

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:09.370
these river sheets, were made.

00:39:09.370 --> 00:39:16.880
And then when they had a long stay
at Fort Mandan or Fort Clatsop,

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:21.220
then they pulled all the old sheets
together and made a composite map

00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:31.370
that we see here, and
this is a detail,

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:35.380
one of the river sheets
along the Missouri River,

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.180
and it's very interesting because
this one says, "This placed called

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:44.160
by the Indians Hill
of Little Devils."

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.880
And that has a very long
history in Indian mythology,

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.420 position:56%
and I think Herman's going to add --

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.130
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: How
much time do we have?

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.510
&gt;&gt;Ralph E. Ehrenberg:
Just -- this is worth it.

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:59.040
[ Laughter ]

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.340
I'm pretty sure.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.380
So anyhow, we're talking
about the little devils.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:06.740
The truth is, they're
the little people,

00:40:06.740 --> 00:40:13.620
and Northern Plains people still
see them and still believe in them,

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.700 position:56%
and they're harbingers of good luck.

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:21.180
If you see one, that means they're
helpful, and so, but, you know,

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.110
you don't want to cross them.

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.990
One of my Indian friends
said, "You know, Herman,

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:27.350
it's like Irish with
their leprechauns."

00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:33.080
They are. They're about that size,
and I have met, in all candor,

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.050
a number of people have seen
the little people, and in fact,

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:40.610 position:56%
one time, I was going to read a book
about it, and my Indian friend said,

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:44.570 position:56%
"Please don't, because the last
thing we want our all these tourists

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:48.490
coming through our reservations
looking for the little people."

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:51.100
But I'll tell you one story,
if you want to hear it

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.090
that I got, and this was a family.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:57.610
These are Northern Plains people.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:01.050
I won't tell you what reservation,
in the family, their little boy,

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:04.740
was quite sick, and
relatives were there

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.640
in the kitchen drinking
coffee, praying.

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.520
They thought the boy
was going to die,

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.080
and they were there during
the night, and suddenly,

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.760
here the boy pops out of the
bedroom and comes into the kitchen,

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.810
and everybody says, "You're up!

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:19.110
Are you okay?"

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:21.600 position:56%
"Yeah, what's all, what's going on?"

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.920
He said, "And where's that
little man was next to my bed?"

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:28.610
And so these are the stories
that, you know, are out there.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.530
And so it's interesting that Lewis

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.090
and Clark documented the
existence of these people.

00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.350
Okay? Thank you.

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.410
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: So you
can find us in the journals,

00:41:40.410 --> 00:41:43.940
and the journals are online now.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:47.840
The original journals
are at Yale University

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.730
in the Americana Collection,
but they're online,

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:55.680
and they're just fascinating
to read if you have time,

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.780
but they did capture a lot
of this social and cultural

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.050
and religious information
along the way.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:08.300
As I mentioned, going west of
Fort Mandan, then it was all based

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:13.600
on Indian information, and this
is one of the pages from our book,

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:19.340
and then this shows one of the
documented cases very nicely.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:26.630
This is Sheheke, White Coyote,
and he visited the camp,

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:30.820
and it's well documented,
and he showed them this map,

00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:32.530
Lewis and Clark of the Yellowstone,

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.520
and this is the first
reasonably accurate map

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.820
of the Yellowstone River.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.020 position:56%
They heard about the Yellowstone
River, but they didn't have any maps

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:43.700
and didn't know about it,
and there's see it then

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:45.580
on the Nicholas King maps.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.980
You can see it was copied directly,
and the place named, as well,

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:57.080
and then here's the larger Upper
Missouri, but all of that west

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.200
in Fort Mandan then on the
Fort Mandan map is based

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.530
on Indian information.

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:02.950
So it's a marvelous map.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:05.490
It's in our division, and if you'd

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:10.910
like to see it, we
will show it to you.

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:13.390
Then at Fort Clatsop, where
they spent the winter,

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:16.570
at the end of the trip, the
mouth of the Columbia River,

00:43:16.570 --> 00:43:21.210
they compiled another
map, and again,

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:26.510
Nicholas King when this was brought
back, Nicholas King copied this

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:33.620
and put it together, and so here's
Fort Mandan area, St. Louis,

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.240
the Lower Missouri
we just talked about.

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:40.380
Now everything here is new
information, and along the route

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:43.510
of the expedition it's
based on Lewis and Clark.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:48.380
Here's the Upper Missouri, and
then here's the Yellowstone,

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:52.940
and because of that information,
they found from White Coyote,

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:55.220
Clark came back along Yellowstone.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.520
They wanted to explore
the Yellowstone,

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.590
as well as the Upper Missouri, and
a lot of this, the 30 Indian maps

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:02.970
that we have and that
we describe and discuss,

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:07.120
you have to buy the book now
to see it, but I want to talk

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:14.370
about how they communicated, and
they communicated by sign language.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:22.950
Drouillard, one of the hunters,
was expert in Plains sign language,

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:29.880
and he also spoke eight Indian
languages, but another --

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:35.520
and they had members with them that
could speak the various language,

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:37.490
and this shows that
Lewis and Clark had to go

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:43.730
through to get an answer
outside of sign language,

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:47.210
and it was a translation chain.

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:50.460
Meriwether Lewis what a route
to the pierce-nosed Indians?

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.760
That was in Nez Perce.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.320
That was just before the
start crossing the mountains.

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:57.410
So that's taken right
out of the journal,

00:44:57.410 --> 00:45:02.720 position:56%
and then François LaBiche
translates from English into French,

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.650
and Charbonneau, Sacajawea's
husband, translates from French

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:11.400
into Minitari, and then
Sacajawea translates from Minitari

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.530
to Shoshone, and that's
how they spoke.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:18.650
The others spoke with her
brother, and there's one example,

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:22.870
there was five different
languages in one chain, and then,

00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:25.670
of course, it has to be reversed.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:27.090
So it was very difficult.

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:30.230
I mean, was very time-consuming,

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:32.430
and it affected the
way the maps were made.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:36.530
Some of the maps took
a day, two days to make

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:37.830
because you're doing this.

00:45:37.830 --> 00:45:40.400
You're back and forth,
and they're also talking

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.810 position:56%
to different generations of Indians.

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:45.170
So they're generational
maps in many cases.

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:51.140
Where's John?

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.310
Do we want to --

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.350
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: I think
he wants you to do questions.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.030
Tell them the rest of
the story [inaudible].

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:01.540
&gt;&gt;Ralph E. Ehrenberg: Yeah, I
guess we're ready for questions.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:05.370
The rest of the story's in
the book, as Herman says.

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:15.640
[ Applause ]

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:18.640
We can't see the clock
from here in this room.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.940
Yes?

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.240
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker:
In your one map.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.540
I think it was the King map.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.000
That showed the West was
basically [inaudible].

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.300
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: Right.

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.600
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: There was
a long line between down --

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:29.170
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg: Yah,
the Arrowsmith map, yeah.

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:31.370
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: was that
to indicate the mountain range.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:32.820
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg: Yeah,
the Aaron Arrowsmith map

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.880
in that indicates the
idea that mountain range,

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.940
and it was a single range,
and that was a long concept

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:46.100
in European traditional
view of the American West

00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:49.390
because they compared
it to the Appalachians.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:54.970 position:56%
As Herman said, you go through a
valley, and you're at the next site.

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:56.270
Yes?

00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:57.570
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker:

00:46:57.570 --> 00:46:58.870
Thomas Jefferson was very
interested in natural history.

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:01.820
What were the most
interesting new species

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:05.500
of animals that they discovered?

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: Well they really
encountered so many different ones.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:12.420 position:56%
I mean, they saw, for example, well,
a great one is the grizzly bear.

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.950
The Indians warned them when
they were in the Mandan villages,

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:19.150
they said to them, "You
know, you better be careful

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:23.220 position:56%
because once you get past us, the
monster bears are going to get you."

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.340
And they laughed, and they
wrote in their journals,

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.640
they said, "These are Indians.

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:27.950
You know, we have guns.

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:29.580 position:56%
We don't have to worry about bears."

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.210
And then at the end of the trip,

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.900
that was the worst problem
they had with grizzly bears.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:36.430
They chased some of their
soldiers open to trees.

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:38.240
The chased them into the rivers.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.300
They would shoot these
bears five and six times,

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:42.320
and it didn't kill
them, and so, yeah,

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.100
the grizzly bear was probably the
most significant natural history

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.380
specimen they encountered.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.680
Yes?

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.810
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: I'd
like to know something

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:59.350
about how the various
native peoples used maps.

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:02.470
What did they do before, perhaps,

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:09.980
the French came and
sort of [inaudible]?

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.020
Did they draw on the
ground [inaudible]?

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:17.110
The indigenous part [inaudible].

00:48:17.110 --> 00:48:18.410
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg:
They did draw the ground.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:20.730
In fact, there's an
example in the book.

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:26.980
We begin a book with that just
before they crossed the mountains

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.430
going West, and they'd
draw it in the ground.

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:35.610
They'd use stones and they pile up
to show mountains and draw lines

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:40.030
for rivers, and these would be
copied by Lewis or by Clark.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:41.480
Many of the maps that exist.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.000
Let me show you one.

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:52.910
Here's the final printed
map that we showed you.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:55.000
This is the Indian app
from which it came.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.950
So you can see they
followed it very closely.

00:48:56.950 --> 00:49:02.580
This is Lewis River, which
is now the Lower Snake,

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.840
and here's Lewis River here,

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:10.780
and Clark's fork here,
and it's shown here.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.620
So they'd sketch it in the ground.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:21.500
We have a 1756 map
in our collection,

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.200
which looks like it was drawn
on some kind of animal skin.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.630
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Oh,
so that's how they --

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.930
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg:
Right, and birch bark.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:35.450
There are maps on birch bark,
but most of them are memory maps.

00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:39.540
They're drawn on the ground,
and, they're passed along.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:47.400
Indians used maps to not show you
something new, but to remind you

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:51.490
where you been before or
something you had forgotten.

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.410
So they're going over the same
area, you know, the same trails,

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:58.430
the buffalo trails across The
Rockies for the Nez Perce,

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:01.910
and they might sketch a
map to help you remember

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:04.550
where you are your
family has been before,

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:08.210
but unlike the European
tradition of cartography

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:09.820
where we're creating a new map you

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.510
to learn something
new, that didn't exist.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:17.260
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:21.190
Probably just to Europeans.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.510
Yes, there's one back here.

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:42.790
[ Inaudible Speech ]

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:48.180
Yeah, Clark was, after Lewis died.

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:53.630
I won't say committed
suicide, but he died,

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:57.160
Clark took over his position as
Superintendent of Indian Affairs

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.960
in the West, and then he
interviewed, debriefed,

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:06.340
all of the traders and trappers
coming back from the West,

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:14.690
and he had this large map
in his office in St. Louis,

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:18.280
and the base of this map is the
Lewis and Clark Expedition map,

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:21.410
and then he added this
new information,

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:25.210
and he starts this in 1809.

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:32.880 position:56%
It's sent to Washington in 1810, and
then it's returned to him in 1814

00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.350
after his map is published, and he
continues to add new information.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:40.730
He makes corrections to it.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:45.780
We were just looking at one before
relating to Cody, Wyoming area.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.050
So he really used that map
from -- what did I say?

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:55.660
1809 to after 1814-1815.

00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:56.960
He kept adding to it.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:01.670
The Zebulon Pike's expedition
in the South, he added,

00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:08.150
and let me just talk a second,
and he had this information

00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:11.610
from John Coulter, and
John Coulter is one

00:52:11.610 --> 00:52:13.530
of the great explorers
of the American West.

00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:17.190
John Coulter was a hunter along
the Lewis and Clark expedition,

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:20.200
and on the way back, they already
met some trappers coming upriver

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.910
from St. Louis, and
John Coulter asked

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:25.080
if he could be discharged
and join them.

00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.720
So he didn't return to
St. Louis until 1810.

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:32.000
He was out there that
whole time, and

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.900
Coulter was the first revenant.

00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:48.580
How many have seen the movie?

00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:51.070
Well, John Coulter was the first.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:54.030
He was out there for six years.

00:52:54.030 --> 00:53:01.630
He beat Hugh Glass and Leonardo
DiCaprio by 20 years and 200 years.

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:03.050
Coulter had three encounters

00:53:03.050 --> 00:53:06.480
with the dreaded Blackfeet
during their continuing effort

00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.630
to drive trappers from the country.

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:12.530
On one of these occasions,
his partner, John Potts,

00:53:12.530 --> 00:53:16.630
was killed and dismembered.

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.660
The Blackfeet then stripped
Coulter bare and told him to run

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:24.420
for his life, assuming erroneously
that he could not outrun them.

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:28.170
During his escape, Coulter managed
to kill one of his pursuers,

00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:29.690
and in a great feat of endurance,

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:32.260
he covered some 300 miles
before reaching the safety

00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.390
of Manuel Lisa's Fort
seven days later.

00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:38.530
So that's a story that
should be told.

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:40.240
John Coulter.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:44.310
But after that, Manuel Lisa, who
was the head of the fur trading

00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:49.820
out there, sent him
on a 500 mile tour,

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:54.250
trip around what is today
Yellowstone National Park

00:53:54.250 --> 00:53:58.350
to establish a network of
trading with The Crows,

00:53:58.350 --> 00:54:02.570
and he did it in the middle
of winter on snowshoes.

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:10.390
So to commemorate him really, he
came back and he was debriefed

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:14.840
by Clark, and then Clark adds
this new information to the map,

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:19.980 position:56%
and we see his trip here around what
is today Yellowstone National Park.

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.770
Here's Yellowstone Lake.

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:25.390
Called Lake Eustis today after
the head of the War Department,

00:54:25.390 --> 00:54:26.690
because Clark was still hoping

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:29.840
that the War Department
would publish this map,

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:35.940
and it says Coulter's Route
1807, and here's Lake Riddle.

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:40.260
Initially, it was Lake Biddle, and
he named it after his publisher,

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:41.600
which you always want to do.

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:45.720
You know, good graces with
your publisher, but again,

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:49.390
there was an error by the engraver,
and it comes out Lake Riddle,

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:54.210
but a great story, and there are
many more of these in the book.

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:58.000
I don't know if I answered
your question.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.300
John?

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.160
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Just
to go into the irony.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:04.940
Clark got all this information from
the Indians and relied on them,

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:08.000
and then the superintendent,
he's responsible for one

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.960
of the largest dispossession
of Native American land.

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.260
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg:
Well, know if Herman.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:17.560
Do you want to take that?

00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.660
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: I don't
think you want to go there.

00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:20.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg: Well, I don't
know if he was -- I don't know.

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:22.860
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: You
don't want to be responsible.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:24.790
He was the head of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs --

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:27.120
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg: Yeah,
he had very good relations

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.750
with the Indians personally.

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:32.490
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: yeah, they
call him the red-haired chief,

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:35.680
and they really admired
him a great deal,

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.840
and he really admired
the Indian people.

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.420
So no, but, you know, you're right.

00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:44.530
The Trail of Tears all occurred
in this time period because,

00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:47.760
as I said earlier, they thought
the West was an empty place,

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:51.220
and people in East, running
the Bureau of Indian Affairs,

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:54.810
for example, said let's --
and they did that really

00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:57.230
because they thought Indians
were getting destroyed

00:55:57.230 --> 00:55:59.790
because of alcoholism and
other problems in the East,

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:03.530
and the head of the Bureau at that
time, a man named Thomas McKinney,

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:07.630
very Quaker, very Christian, he
said, "Let's set Indians out there

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:11.490
in that empty landscape where
they can start all over again.

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:15.710 position:56%
And that's where the Trail of Tears,
that whole concept got started.

00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:18.280
So it was really to help
Indians, but instead,

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.230
it helped destroy their
culture and their traditions.

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:24.950
&gt;&gt; John Cole: We have time
for two more questions.

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:32.880
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: Lewis
and Clark began [inaudible]

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:37.470
and they acquired maps
along the way.

00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:38.770
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: Oh, absolutely.

00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:41.610
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker:
[inaudible] I'm gathering

00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:46.690
that there were maps showing
routes across The Rockies,

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:49.970
but they had no idea of the
magnitude of The Rockies.

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:51.270
Am I correct in that?

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:52.650
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg:
Correct, they had no idea.

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:56.390
&gt;&gt;Audience Speaker: But they did
have maps showing, okay, see,

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:59.350
I'm reading another --
one of my simple accounts,

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:03.520
and it makes it sound like it was
really kind of unknown territory,

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:06.600
but obviously, it wasn't.

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:09.800
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg: The
distances were unknown.

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.510
The distances were unknown.

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:18.910 position:56%
The Indians kind of, on their maps,
they don't have miles and distances.

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:23.040
They have a number of nights or
days that it took, and actually,

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:29.710
on the first Lewis and Clark
map, 1805, which they copied off

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:33.270
of an Indian map from the Rockies
to the mouth of the Columbia,

00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:36.620
it's written right on
the map, eight nights.

00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.660
Eight nights.

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:39.960
I forget exactly how it says it.

00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:44.930
But it puts it in terms
of nights traveling.

00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:48.420 position:56%
So, and that's beyond the mountains.

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:50.440
There isn't anything
about the mountains,

00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:54.110
and I'm not sure the Indians
did that much in the mountains.

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:57.790 position:56%
I mean, they're in the front ranges
of the mountains where the game was.

00:57:57.790 --> 00:58:02.320
I mean, the crossed the mountains
of Buffalo, the Nez Perce,

00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:06.670
and then there were the
Indians on the western side,

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:09.030
and that's where the fishing was.

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:10.700
So within the mountains themselves,

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.030
I'm not sure they did
much in that area.

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:14.330
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola:
know, they wanted to go

00:58:14.330 --> 00:58:16.480 position:56%
to Florida just like everybody else.

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:19.170
They didn't want to be up
there in that tough country.

00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:20.750
One last thing I'll tell you.

00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:24.460
Remember I mentioned that Lewis
and Clark gave those boys ribbons.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:27.180
Would you believe that the
Nez Perce have a museum

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:29.680
on their reservation [inaudible],
and they still have one

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:34.030
of those pieces of
ribbon in that museum?

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:35.330
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg: Last one.

00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:37.860
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: You
mentioned the Medals of Peace.

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:39.160
Where are some of them?

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.820
How many have survived?

00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:43.120
Where are they?

00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:46.160
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: Well, The
Smithsonian has a good set of them,

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:49.600
but if you want to get copies of
them, you can go to the US Mint.

00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:53.720
Still have the original dies for
these metals, and they were given

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.790
for George Washington, which
were, these were handmade ones,

00:58:56.790 --> 00:58:59.420
but only when we learned how
to make coins by the time

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:03.040
of the Jefferson Administration
are they those stamped ones,

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:07.030
but they were made until the
Benjamin Harrison Administration,

00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:11.580
and then the government stopped
issuing them because by then,

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:15.400
the purpose of them has so devalued
that they were giving these to kids

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.580
at Indian schools if
they got a good grade.

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:20.610
So they said, "We don't need
to have these big tokens.

00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:22.580
You know, they have
solid-silver metals."

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.320
They were so significant,
but it's funny how --

00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.820
they were in existence
for about 100 years,

00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:31.390
but The Mint has copies
of all of the coin ones.

00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:36.020
Not the stamped ones that were
created for Washington and,

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.880
you know, Adams and stuff,
but every president from them

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.120
until Harrison had those metals.

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.590
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg: And you
can buy them at the Union Station.

00:59:44.590 --> 00:59:46.500
&gt;&gt; Herman J. Viola: Yeah, they
have a shop at Union Station.

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:49.300
&gt;&gt; Ralph E. Ehrenberg:
Yeah, the smaller ones.

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:51.270
&gt;&gt; John Cole; Well, thank
you, Ralph and Herman,

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:53.510
I'd like to thank them
not only for a great --

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:58.040
[ Applause ]

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.870
Really, a wonderful presentation,
but also, a wonderful book,

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:04.910
which we learned about, and I
want to say a word as the director

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:07.890 position:56%
of the center about the book itself.

01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:10.720
It is filled with a lot
of the beautiful maps

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.890
that you saw on the screen.

01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:17.460
It also has two, as Ralph,
reproductions of maps,

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.280
which come with the book.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.110
I'm leading up to the fact
the book sells for $99,

01:00:23.110 --> 01:00:27.440
but you can get it today at
the staff discount price of $90

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.240
at The Library of Congress, and I
hope you'll take advantage of that,

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.600
and one more time to thank Ralph
and Herman for not only the work

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.950
but sharing their stories
and their knowledge with us.

01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:40.750
Let's give them a final
round of applause.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:46.070
[ Applause ]

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:50.470
And will be signing the book
at this table, and finally,

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:53.580
I just want to say, I want to
congratulate the publishing office,

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:58.730 position:56%
Peggy Wagner, who's the Managing
Director, for negotiating this deal,

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:01.770
and bringing this book to
us, as did the two authors.

01:01:01.770 --> 01:01:05.130
Thank you, Peggy, and see
you at the next presentation.

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:07.500
Please join us.

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:12.160
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
