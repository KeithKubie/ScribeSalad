&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.960
&gt;&gt; Mary Quattlebaum: Hi everyone.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.680
I'm Mary Quattlebaum.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.183
I'm the regular reviewer of
middle grade and teen fiction

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.723
for the Washington Post Book World.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.550
And I'm here to welcome you
to the National Book Festival.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.610
The Washington Post
is a charter sponsor

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.690
of the National Book Festival
and has been a big supporter

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.526
for all 10 years of its existence.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.906
I know that you're
going to be excited

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.386
about asking the author questions
and I just wanted to remind you

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.490
that there's going to be a Q and
A session at the end of their talk

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.110
and there are mics right here.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.516
So rather than trying to
stand up at your seats

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.703
and shout our your questions
you can actually go to the mic.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.660
So as I said, the National
Book Festival has been going

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.746
on for 10 years.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.813
And it just keeps getting
more and more amazing.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.343
And what makes the festival
amazing is you guys, the attendees,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.943
and of course the authors.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.780
I'm about to introduce two people

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.716
who together have an
incredible story to share.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.916
Phillip Hoose has published a
number of books for young people

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.756
that shine a light on
overlooked parts of history.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.196
We Were There Too is about young
people in United States history.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.870
It was a finalist for
the National Book Award.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.080
Other titles include It's Our
World Too, about youth activism

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.206
and the Race to Save
the Lord God Bird

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.086
which made the Washington Post's
best book for young people in 2004.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.100
Phillip's most recent book
is Claudette Colvin Twice

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.610
Toward Justice.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.410
And it garnered big awards.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.486
A Newbery Honor, a National
Book Award and a place

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.690
on the Washington Post's best
books for young people list.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.610
It's a book that explores two
wrongs done to Claudette Colvin

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.403
in this segregated
south of the 1950's.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.666
And we actually very happily
have Claudette here today with us

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.436
to share her experiences.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.770
[Applause].

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.036
So I just want to say a
few words about Claudette.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.293
She grew up in Alabama.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.693
When she was 15 and arrested
on a segregated bus she shouted

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.163
that her Constitutional
rights were being violated.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.940
And indeed they were.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.503
Claudette later became
a nurse's assistant

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.106
and recently retired
from that career.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.273
She now lives in the Bronx
and is recognized as a pioneer

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.233
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.060
So let's welcome Phillip
Hoose and Claudette Colvin.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.530
[Applause].

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.996
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: Thank
you very much.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.946
I will start and then
turn the microphone

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.846
and the show over to Claudette.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.926
First of all, I want to thank
you all for coming and I want

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.740
to thank the sponsors

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.816
of this fabulous event
for inviting us to come.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.930
I mean, imagine 150,000 book
lovers in one place all at once.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.046
I mean that's, that's -- there's
the shout out right there.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.060
[Applause].

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.263
I -- just to tell you a
little bit about myself,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.176
I grew up in Indiana very --

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.903
very much convinced that there
was nothing good about me.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.126
You know, that there was nothing
I could do that I had no talent,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.946
I wasn't very big, I was --
you know, not very hefty,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.390
girls didn't seem to pay
any attention to me at all.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.043
I wasn't very athletic.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.330
And in eighth grade I think it was
I wrote a theme in English class

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.323
that my teacher Mrs. Hilderbrandt
praised and in fact put

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.673
out in the glass case out beside --

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.096
out in the hallway
and during open house,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.866
during parent teacher
night my parents saw that

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.316
and something clicked, the idea

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.866
that maybe I had some little
knack of being a writer.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.616
And I think it was that right there
that made me get started with this.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.860
I started out in my career writing
a number of books for adults.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.166
I wrote a book called Hoosiers,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.980
about high school basketball
in Indiana.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.380
[Applause].

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.380
Thank you.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.880
And I wrote a book
called Necessities

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.706
about racial barriers
in American sports.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.723
My career really took a bend
when I started having daughters

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.263
and I began to, you know, just
listen to what they had in mind.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.186
I wrote a book called,
It's Our World Too

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.036
about young social activists

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.506
when my elder daughter Hannah did
something really good at school

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.900
and I thought there must be, you
know, dozens and dozens of stories

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.020
like this and I collected
them into a book.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.130
I then wrote a book -- you know, I
interviewed a girl named Sara Rosen

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.320
who was a 13 year old girl
from South Bend, Indiana during

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.333
that process and we were talking

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.843
and she said you know
what the real crime is?

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.196
I said, no, what's the real crime?

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.583
She said, the real crime is
that there's nobody my age

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.010
in my United States history book.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.000
I said, that can't be true.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.076
She said, go find a middle school
history book and see for yourself.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:07.120
So I did. I borrowed a book, took it
home, it took me a while to read it.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.926
And she was almost right.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.526
There were two teens in a
676 page book, Sacagawea

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.313
and Pocahontas both teenage girls
who guided whites you kept journals

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.226
and thus they got into history.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.786
I went back to Sara and
said, you know, you're right.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.946
How does that make you feel?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.613
And Sara said, it makes me
feel as though I'm not real

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.203
and I won't be real
until I'm about 20.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.793
And I -- something about it got
to me and I wanted to change that.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:49.006
So I spent the next six
years reading and researching

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.780
and writing a book
entitled We Were There Too,

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.640
young people in U.S. history
trying to restore or bring

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.053
to the national story the
experiences, the bravery,

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.543
the courage, the muscle,
the hope and righteousness

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.780
of youth into the national story.

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.080
[Applause].

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.150
Thank you.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.383
When I was doing this
research it occurred to me

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.416
that there was no episode
in United States history

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:26.683
in which young people played
a stronger role or made more

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.883
of a difference than the
Civil Rights movements.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.130
And if you think about
it it makes sense

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:33.026
because the first major episode in
the Civil Rights Movement was all

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:36.393
about -- all about young people.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.330
It was about students, it
was the Supreme Court ruling,

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:44.923
Brown versus The Board of Education
of Topeka in 1954 that said

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:45.210
that public school had to be
segregated -- had to be integrated,

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:49.840
rationally integrated with as
they said all deliberate speed.

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:52.976
And some communities sure took
there time, some up to 20 years

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.450
to integrate their schools.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:02.813
And during my research for that
I found all sorts of stories

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.613
about young people who
had been courageous

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.086
and who had really stuck
their necks out for --

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.690
for equal rights and for justice.

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:17.196
And I started looking
for a character,

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.480
a person that I could
write one book about.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.943
You know, just one single person
out of all those really dozens

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.656
and dozens of young people
and I came upon this story

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:32.780
about a girl named Claudette
Colvin who as a 15 year old growing

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.780
up in Montgomery, Alabama
took the stand

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:43.093
that Rosa Parks became famous for,
but did it nine months earlier.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.440
That is she refused to surrender her
public bus seat to a white passenger

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.146
when ordered to do so
by a bus conductor.

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.396
And according to the story she,
you know, caught the worst of it.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.030
She was treated very, very
roughly, arrested by police,

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.393
dragged off the bus, thrown
into a police car, jailed.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:08.230
But I had really never
heard anything about this.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.816
I began to research
it and became more

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:15.350
and more intrigued for
a couple of reasons.

00:09:17.950 --> 00:09:21.416
One was not only did she
refuse to surrender her seat

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.883
and take a private stand
on this public bus system,

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:30.226
but she had the guts a year later
and almost nobody knew this,

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.910
to join a lawsuit, a
class action law suit,

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.516
claiming that the segregation
laws on the buses

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.570
of Alabama were unconstitutional.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.926
It violated the Constitution
to separate people by race.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.306
When I was doing this research I
came across a couple of articles

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.386
and a chapter in a children's
book that made it seem as though

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:56.536
if I could find Claudette
Colvin if she were still alive

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:00.060
and I could find her and she would
agree to be interviewed by me

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:03.706
that it would be a terrific story.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:05.520
Because I don't think a story is any
good really unless the person inside

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.493
it really comes out.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:12.553
And I thought from what I had read
that you could still find the girl

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.966
in that story, that -- how she felt
about this, what made her so angry,

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.746
why she did what she did, what did
that do to her popularity at school.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.460
Did she get in trouble
with her parents?

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.260
The kinds of things that young
readers want to know and that I want

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.933
to know I felt would be available
if I could find Claudette Colvin

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.673
and she would agree to work with
me on a story about her youth.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.123
Finding Claudette Colvin was not

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:52.423
and is not the easiest
thing in the world to do.

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:58.193
Claudette lives in New York City,
has an unlisted telephone number

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:02.526
and I tried for quite some time
to find a way to reach her.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:07.283
Finally I read an article
in USA Today by an author --

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.496
a journalist who I kind of hope
is here today, Richard C. Willing

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:19.203
in 1995 did a retrospective
on the Montgomery bus boycott

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:25.090
and included what two teenage
girls had done, Claudette

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.263
and Mary Louise Smith,
another bus protestor.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.340
And when I read the article

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:33.670
that Richard Willing had written
it was clear that he had talked

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:36.943
with Claudette Colvin so
she must still be alive

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.930
and this person must still
know how to reach her.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.516
So I called USA Today and found
Richard Willing and talked with him.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.386
And I said, would you be willing to
relay a message to Claudette Colvin

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.063
if you're still in touch
with her and he said --

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:55.930
you know, and I said
that I would like to work

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.730
with her on a book project.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:00.263
And he said I would.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.196
And a couple of months
later I got a response back

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:03.310
from Richard Willing saying I
have talked to Claudette Colvin

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.016
and her answer is maybe
when I retire.

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:14.026
So I made a little
note in my calender

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.213
to ask the same question
six months later.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.633
So I did this twice a
year for four years.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:23.016
And always Richard
relayed this message back

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.376
that Ms. Colvin says
maybe when I retire.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.803
I was never going to give up,
but I certainly didn't want

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.416
to harass Claudette
Colvin and even indirectly.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.820
And I had really lost much hope
that this project would ever occur.

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.703
And one night I think it was
in the fall of 2006 I came home

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:49.276
from something and the
red light was beeping

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.136
on my telephone answering machine.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.500
And it was a message from Richard
Willing, the reporter from USA Today

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.566
and his message was very brief.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.223
It said Claudette Colvin
says she'll talk with you,

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.100
here is her telephone
number, good luck.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.116
Well, I couldn't sleep that night.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:17.006
You know, I stayed up
scribbling questions and so forth.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.493
And the next day, the next
morning I called the number

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.813
that Richard Willing had
given me and a woman answered

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:28.416
and she said yes indeed she was
Claudette Colvin and we talked

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.556
for I guess about an hour and at the
end of the conversation, you know,

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.690
we -- I thought it was
a great conversation

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.656
and I said may I come visit you to
talk further about whether we'd want

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:42.446
to do this together and
she permitted me to do so.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:45.426
Maybe a month later I went down
to New York City and we met

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.826
in a restaurant and spent gosh,
you know, most of the day talking

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.383
and agreed to do this
project together,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.586
to write this book together.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:05.293
I asked her -- I asked
Claudette at that time --

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.850
we had a big decision to make.

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.556
Do we want this book
to be mainly for adults

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.550
or did we want the book mainly
to be for young readers.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.806
And Claudette said very
emphatically I would

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.783
like this book to get into schools.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:25.383
So that was the answer to
the question right there.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:28.910
[Applause].

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.990
You know, so we launched and the
process of writing this book took,

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.476
I don't know, maybe
about a year and a half.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:49.070
It involved a number of interviews
with Claudette, long interviews.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.340
Some in person, some over the phone.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.146
And it also involved
Claudette was wonderful

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.093
in that she encouraged people

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:04.183
who were important to
her to talk with me.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.933
So I had full access
not only to Claudette

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.970
who has an incredible memory
for detail how she felt

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:13.086
and what happened during those years
which were, you know, a while ago.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:17.610
But also I was able to talk to some
of her friends, I was able to talk

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.676
to other characters who were
important and I did a fair amount

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.796
of traveling during this time too.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.693
I went to Montgomery, Alabama where
this story was staged a couple

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:33.473
of times and talked with people.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:35.436
And I also went to the
Library of Congress right here

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:39.296
which had a great deal of
information and some photographs,

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.656
some images that we
included in the book.

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.400
And it was quite wonderful to
work with the Library of Congress.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:55.130
And you know as the story developed,
as I learned more about Claudette

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:56.063
and what she went through
and the courage that it took

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.156
to do the things that she --

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.156
that she did, my eyes
really, really opened.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.686
For one thing I worry that the
memory of how Jim Crow felt,

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:11.633
you know, how it felt to
live in segregated society

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.303
with all those rules and all those
horrible signs and all the customs

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:19.440
and all the demeaning
traditions and so forth.

00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:24.113
I'm worried that the
feeling of it will be lost.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.350
You know, that yeah we'll
have Dr. King day every --

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.310
once year and yes we'll
have Black History Month,

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.183
but the same stories will get
told over and over and over again

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:38.250
and the same heros will shrink and
congeal and curl up at the edges

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.383
and that the day to day
memory of what it was

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:43.443
like for people will be lost.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:48.530
The feeling, the feelings of
humiliation, the feelings of anger,

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:49.513
just what it felt like
day to day would be lost.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.946
And that was one thing that
I as an author wanted to do.

00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:56.356
That was one aim of mine to do
what I could through this story

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.530
to restore and refresh
how horrible that --

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:06.330
and unjust that indignity was.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.606
And of course, you know, as
I went through it and I went

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:16.246
through the process of it my
respect and admiration for Claudette

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.126
and the enormous courage that it
took and the enormous contributions

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.200
that she made grew and grew
and grew almost by the day.

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.656
I mean, imagine being 15 and
taking the stand that she did,

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:36.036
that is refusing to get up,
being hauled off to jail,

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.926
having that cell door close.

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.210
And then having the
courage, you know, I mean,

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.943
she can tell you herself what the
reaction was to the stand she took,

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:48.696
but then having the
courage to do round two.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:53.626
Very little is known about Browder
versus Gayle which is the lawsuit

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.473
that really ended the Montgomery
bus boycott and it's really curious.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.380
I have no idea why this is the case.

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:02.100
I really do think that
most people who care

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:04.283
about the Montgomery bus boycott
see it as something that ended

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.090
in quite a different
way than it did.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:10.506
I think most people think
that, you know, Dr. King

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:12.503
and all the boycotting
and all the days

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.333
of not riding the bus just wore the
bus company down until they gave up.

00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.553
That's not true at all.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:21.486
I mean, they weren't
going to give up.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:23.220
They were digging in their heels.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:28.086
And the boycott itself
was in a bit of trouble.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:32.653
That boycott was ended by a
lawsuit called Browder versus Gayle

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:37.630
in which four plaintiffs
representing the ridership,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.560
the African American ridership of
Montgomery, Alabama lodged a suit

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:46.516
in Federal court claiming
that segregation on the buses,

00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:52.396
the public buses, interstate
buses was unconstitutional.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:53.176
Well, I mean, the odds
weren't really very good

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.003
that they would win
something like that

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.973
because the Federal Courthouse was
down in Montgomery, but the people

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.126
who organized the lawsuit
thought that because it was

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:03.646
in a Federal jurisdiction,
the United States

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.040
and not a local jurisdiction, you
know, they just might have a chance.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:10.490
But the big problem that they
had was getting anyone to be

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:18.563
on the lawsuit, to sign up for the
lawsuit publicly, to put your name

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:20.686
on a lawsuit as the plaintiffs.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.736
After all the trying that they
did they only found four people

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:25.013
who had the guts to put
their name on that lawsuit.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:32.793
All four were women and two of them
were teenagers, Claudette who was 16

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.673
at the time of the lawsuit
and Mary Louise Smith

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.190
who I think was 19 by then.

00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:43.043
She was probably --
I think she was 19.

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.486
Claudette's testimony, what she
said to the three judge panel,

00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.583
the questions she was asked,
the responses that she gave are

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:56.110
in this book Claudette Colvin Twice
Toward Justice, but I can tell you

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.973
that it couldn't have been easy.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.100
And I don't think you
can read what she did

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.263
without just swelling
up in admiration.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:08.566
It was just an incredible
contribution to U.S. history and one

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:14.340
that just we couldn't
afford to lose.

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:19.273
And I'll just conclude by saying
you know as an author I was --

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:19.743
I was really worried about
two things when I finally came

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.733
to understand Claudette's
story a little bit.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:25.816
I was afraid first of all that
the story itself would be lost.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.863
That, you know, we wouldn't -- we
wouldn't know about this person.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:33.370
I mean, I don't know if a story
and I've researched this as much

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:40.756
as anybody where one single teen,
one single young person made

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.213
as much a difference as
Claudette Colvin did.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:47.900
I don't think there's a --
there's a parallel to it.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:52.510
But in addition to just being
ignored and overlooked a lot

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.410
of the mainstream, the big deal
history books would include her,

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:00.776
they did include her in a paragraph,
but it was the wrong paragraph.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.073
She was in danger of
being portrayed wrongly,

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:08.630
as the person who was not Rosa
Parks, as somebody who was,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.030
you know, sort of mouthy
and a teenager and somebody

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.913
that you really kind of
didn't have to take seriously.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.266
And, you know, the more I talked
to her and the more I understood

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.390
who she was and what she had done I
realized what a terrible injustice

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:21.483
it would be if that
were the last word.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.150
If it were left to that.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:25.896
So not only did I want to restore
her story, but I kind of wanted

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.043
to straighten out the
picture on the wall,

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.896
you know, to make a right picture.

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.420
[Applause].

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.223
I have to say that it's been one
of the great pleasures of my life

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.256
to get to know Claudette.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:59.356
I mean, not only do I admire her
and thank her for sharing that part

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:03.403
of her life with me, but
she's just a wonderful friend

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.016
and that's been a great joy.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:09.276
So I will leave the stage

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:09.900
and without further ado I will
introduce you to my partner

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.186
in literature Claudette Colvin.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.620
[ Applause ]

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:47.350
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin:
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:52.250
It is an honor to be invited to
participate in this festival.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.140
And to share my story with you
although Mr. Phil Hoose has

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.850
explained everything
in full details.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.516
But I'm going to give you a
little of the emotional side

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.100
of it going back to
March the 2nd, 1955.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.673
It was an impulsive act, it
wasn't staged and I told most

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:34.850
of the reporter ask me I just
want to try to answer one question

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.816
that reporters have asked me

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.620
and that is why didn't
you move when asked?

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.906
And my answer is I tell them all
the time history had me glued

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.960
to the seat.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.460
[Applause].

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:11.896
And you know what they
say, now how is that?

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.493
I say, well, remember March --
February month is Negro history.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:18.493
Well, we wasn't exactly celebrating
the whole month, but because we went

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.920
to segregated school we did it
for a whole month because most

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:31.003
of the teachers felt
that we had been left

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.776
out of the American history.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.510
And only two men was
in the Encyclopedia

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.233
and that was George Washington
Carver and Booker T. Washington.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.716
That was no history books --

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.516
I'm going to say no
books in our library.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.513
Maybe other cities,
but not Montgomery.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.873
So that month Mrs. Geraldine Nesbit

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:58.190
and Mrs. Josie Laurence
[assumed spelling].

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.903
Mrs. Josie Laurence
was my history teacher

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:06.496
and Mrs. Geraldine Nesbit
was my literary teacher.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.423
And we discuss all the
injustices that was perpetrated

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:20.370
on the black community in Montgomery
City and then we discussed the heros

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:28.843
and amongst them some of the heros
two of my favorite are females.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.226
That was Harriet Tubman
and Sojourner Truth.

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.843
Then we discussed other heros

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:39.110
like Jackie Robinson
breaking a baseball barrier.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.270
Then we go into W.E.B.
DuBois and Frederick Douglas.

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.980
What we did we did the whole
thing, the whole month.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.480
So I said that's why
I said it was --

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:57.273
it felt like Harriet Tubman was
pushing me down on one shoulder

00:25:58.700 --> 00:25:58.843
and Sojourner Truth were pushing
me down on the other shoulder.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:03.690
[Applause].

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.623
I was embarrassed spiritually
by the struggle

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.113
and the bravery of these two women.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.786
So I said they picked the wrong day
to pick on me, the bus motorman.

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:20.296
But anyway he told you this story,

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:25.483
but as a child past experience
my being able to go in the store

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:31.543
and [inaudible] in those days,
not today, but in those days.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:36.700
The popcorn, the peanuts and then
we couldn't sit at the lunch counter

00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:37.326
where white children would sit.

00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:39.330
And then they made it where you
couldn't pass by that aisle anyway.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.656
So if I was -- as a little girl
I would look across that aisle

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.063
and see the white kids and I
don't know whether they was eating

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:52.763
anything any better.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:56.096
But my momma said,
honey, are you hungry?

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.716
She said I will take you to
get you a hot dog that is

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.943
in the back section where only
a little counter for Negroes.

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.300
So anyway those childhood
experiences

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:11.253
and furthermore you
couldn't [inaudible] hats

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:14.663
and -- but may I demonstrate.

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.286
Let me take off my shoes.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:22.943
Now do you think a white person
would try on a pair of shoes

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:23.863
that you -- a black person
has taken their feet out of

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:29.036
in 1950, do you think so?

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:31.966
So that's what we went through.

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.620
That was one of the things
-- that was while I --

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.620
that's the reason I said history.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.140
The history of how we was
treated had me glued to the seat

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.740
and I wasn't going to move that day.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.226
Nothing. I refused.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.160
They said, oh, my God you refuse?

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:54.450
I refuse to walk off the bus so
two policeman they manhandled

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.753
and pulled me off the bus.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:03.420
Put me in the patrol man car and
handcuffed me and took me to jail,

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.463
booked me and everything and a
horror that I said I really went

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.470
through what some of Edgar
Allan Poe poems and explain.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.466
I really went through
[inaudible], but when that door

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:19.810
of the jail went [noise]
I knew I was shut in.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:22.310
But you know what?

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.376
I hate to say that.

00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.930
I feel like one of those
sisters in a Baptist Church

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:27.900
after Barack Obama became
president I said I feel good.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080
[Applause].

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.280
That God Almighty.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.480
Martin Luther King is not
here and all the people --

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.866
first of all I was crying tears

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:55.710
because [inaudible] were
murdered because of equal rights.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:58.323
So I feel good Barack Obama became
president of the United States.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:06.623
So I don't care whether he's a --
come out as being a good president,

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:11.816
a bad president he
broke that barrier.

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:17.776
He went in the front door of
the White House and thank God.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.040
[Applause].

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:34.373
I think that I played a significant
role in the beginning of that.

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:44.636
Thank you, Lord.

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:46.570
[Applause].

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.836
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: We would be glad

00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:49.886
to answer any questions
that -- that we can.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:56.320
And I think you go to the -- there
are microphones in the aisle.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.166
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:01.213
&gt;&gt; My question what happened
the next day at school

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.253
when you got back to class --

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.120
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin:
I didn't -- excuse me.

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:08.920
I didn't go back to
school the next day.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.786
I was too traumatized.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.786
I was too traumatized.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.500
Ah, but when I did go back the
parents had -- the other parents,

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.033
not my parents, but the student
parents had convinced oh,

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:20.883
my God that Claudette
Colvin that girl is crazy.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.276
Stay away from her.

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:26.076
&gt;&gt; That's funny.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.343
I was just about to ask
you, like, how did everyone

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:30.906
in your neighborhood,
like, react or we got it.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.880
&gt;&gt; I [inaudible] yet, but
what happened after you --

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:40.086
how did you get out of jail?

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.170
Did your parents come get you?

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.263
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: My mother
and Reveren H.H. Johnson came

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:48.836
and got me out of church.

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:49.703
&gt;&gt; And what did your
mother say to you?

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:51.940
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: Well, I
had been discussing that because

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.600
or before this happened this --
this is just one of the stories.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:05.390
When I was in the ninth
grade one of the students --

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.933
a male student was arrested for
allegedly raping a white woman,

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:12.010
but he was actually
having consensual --

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:16.556
I cannot say it -- consensual sex.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.670
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: Consensual sex.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.803
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: Consensual sex

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:23.780
with this white woman,
but they had him.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.560
They demonized him and said

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.426
that he was a serial rapist
during the summer and he was

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.750
on death row when I was arrested.

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:36.710


00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.076
So my parents they said --
they wanted to remain seated,

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.440
but my mom said I just
couldn't ride that bus.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.963
She would have just
gotten off the bus.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you for what you did.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:54.323
&gt;&gt; How did they treat
African Americans in jail?

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:56.086
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: Did
you hear that, Claudette?

00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:58.853
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: Beg pardon?

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.853
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: How did they
treat African Americans in jail?

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:02.986
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: I don't know.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.053
I don't know really.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.376
I didn't say -- I didn't
spend the night.

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:08.780
But you know I never -- you know,

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.146
there if a white person got fair
treatment then you know they got

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.036
worse than the white person.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:24.176
&gt;&gt; So were there people who were
not surprised that you did this?

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.310
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin:
People were not surprised --

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:28.310
&gt;&gt; Were there people who knew you

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.870
who were not surprised
that you had done this?

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:33.670
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: Yes, everybody
was surprised that I didn't remove

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.030
when a policeman asks you to get up.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.556
&gt;&gt; But was there anybody
who knew something about you

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:41.943
that would help explain --

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.276
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: They
knew that I was going

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:45.386
through this what they call -- I
had [inaudible] because I was study

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:49.966
for pre nursing so
I know [inaudible].

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:54.450
The identify crisis that I was
going through right as a teenager

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.763
where the role that I fit in and
the first process was when I went

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.400
to school without straightening
my hair.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:08.830
[Applause].

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.600
&gt;&gt; I have a question about how
the writing collaboration worked.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.633
Claudette, did you read the
chapters as they were being written

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:21.780
or did you read it at the end?

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.006
How did it work where the two
of you were working together?

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:26.073
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: Interviews on
the telephone and in my apartment.

00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.753
&gt;&gt; And then did you read just --

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:34.916
you didn't read it
until it was finished?

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.856
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: At the end
when I had a draft finished

00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:42.430
that I felt was getting there
I went to Claudette's apartment

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:43.790
and read the entire thing to her.

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:49.463
It took one afternoon and
then we took a break that --

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:54.023
you know, and then the following
day and we had a tape recorder

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.506
on the table, on her kitchen table
in between us and I, you know,

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.693
encouraged her to stop me any
time anything seemed wrong either

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:10.836
factually wrong or wrong in emphasis
or just, you know, got it wrong

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.106
and so we'd stop and, you
know, she'd try to correct it,

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:17.260
make it right, you know, and
then I kept a recording of it

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:19.523
so that I could, you know,
sort of fix it later.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:24.236
But that's what happened.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:25.450
I ended up reading these
manuscripts or this manuscript

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:30.756
which really helped me to
hear it out loud so that --

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:35.370
anyway that's how it happened.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:37.970
There are people over here.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:39.170
I'm sorry.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.370
&gt;&gt; What changes would you
like to see take place,

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.503
realistic changes, in this country?

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:45.690
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin:
What realistic change?

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:51.616
My goodness that is too big
a question for me to answer.

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:54.930
There are so much going wrong now

00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.660
and realistically first
I want all children

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:05.123
to get a good education,
that's the first thing.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:12.970
[Applause].

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:15.903
&gt;&gt; My question is you kept --

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:20.370
you kept saying that you wouldn't
tell your story until you retired

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:22.623
and you might tell
it when you retired.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:25.623
What changed your mind?

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:26.203
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: Oh,
well, what changed my mind is

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.376
that I did a interview
with Richard Willings

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:36.513
from USA Today he did a story

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.343
and that was I think
November the 28th, 1995.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.873
And our -- my working
environment is mostly immigrants

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:51.980
and when then they saw the
picture, this Filipino nurse said,

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:59.513
oh my goodness Ms. Colvin I didn't
know that you would do that.

00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.860
The [inaudible] because
I am a softy.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.200
It's not that I'm a softy, but
I have this southern attitude.

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:12.286
Not that I'm not a softy.

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:17.326
So they wanted to know the
story and so I said, well,

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:21.843
then my [inaudible] said
you should tell the story.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.733
Because everyone thought
that Ms. Colvin just sit down

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.973
and that ended the
desegregated the buses.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:36.643
So I said well I wait til I
retire because it's unionized

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.900
and I didn't want no more
labors on me being a --

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:46.716
and that was being too much
tension on the job you know.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.093
So I said wait until after I retire

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.560
so I can give you details
like I wanted.

00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:56.116
&gt;&gt; So are you retired?

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:57.116
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin:
Yeah, four years.

00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:00.183
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.823
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: Yes, ma'am.

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:06.556
&gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about
writing an autobiography?

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.373
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: Have
you ever thought

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:10.906
about writing an autobiography?

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.166
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: Yes.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.100
Right now I have --
wait one more thing.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:23.133
My grandson is in medical
school and I want him to get

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:25.150
out of medical school before I do it

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:30.350
because what I would write
we're going to be criticized

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:38.233
because I would write stories
that happened in the 1950's --

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.880
from 1939 when I was
born up until the '50s

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:52.096
and these are not beautiful
stories and I want to thank all --

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:57.020
I don't like to use this
label, please I don't like.

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:02.223
White liberals for helping us end
change this flaw in our country.

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.440
They march with us and
they help the world see

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.313
that African American was
discriminated against.

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.990
So I'm not going to do it until I --

00:38:21.390 --> 00:38:24.390
until my son graduate
that's what [inaudible].

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:26.190
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: Yes, sir.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:30.930
&gt;&gt; Can you tell us what you did
between the time of the incident

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:32.790


00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:36.670
through the time you were named
the plaintiff on the suit.

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:41.543
How active were you in the movement
during that period and especially

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.620
after the Rosa Parks incident?

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.843
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: Be real brief.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.110
I was not active at all.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.110
I wasn't active at
all physically active

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:59.543
because I was [inaudible]
into that movement.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:00.846
I wasn't active.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.446
I was busy trying to
support my children.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.016
I have two boys.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:07.550
I'm a single mother
and I have two boys.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.216
I was busy working.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:14.216
&gt;&gt; And how did you become
a plaintiff on the suit?

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.066
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin:
They had no other --

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.333
they didn't have anyone else.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.400


00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.936
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: They -- just to
elaborate they tried, you know,

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:29.636
to find people, but the stakes were
too high, the price was too high

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:34.253
to pay to put your name on a law
suit against those bus laws then was

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.323
to expose your family, you know,

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:38.646
the people that you
knew, your neighborhood.

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:40.893
And I talked to Fred Grey
[assumed spelling] interviewed him

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.000
about that, the lawyer who
put that lawsuit together

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:49.766
and it was hard sledding
tyring to find anybody

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.536
who put their name on it.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.913
And as I say, in the end
he found only four people,

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:56.960
Claudette and three others.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.420
Yes, ma'am.

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.953
&gt;&gt; Ms. Colvin, thank you so
much for coming here today

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.353
to share your aspiring story.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:04.820
I love you and you're
one of my heros

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.146
and thank you Mr. Hoose
for writing this story.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.810
What advice would you have for
young people today who want to stand

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:12.576
up for something that
they believe in?

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.110
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin: To do it.

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.643
Stand up if you have
to stand up alone.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:24.850
[Applause].

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.920
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: Any
further questions?

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.120
Yes.

00:40:31.620 --> 00:40:32.620
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:42.076
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: The question was

00:40:43.810 --> 00:40:48.076
who was supporting the bus company
financially during those times

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.006
because they must have
been losing money.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:53.970
And they were losing money.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:56.206
They were losing a ton of money,
but there was such cultural support

00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.176
in the city that they just
wouldn't let them go down.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.546
I mean, I don't know where the money
was coming from to keep them going

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:02.260
because they had -- in the end --

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:04.413
first of all, at the beginning
of the Montgomery bus boycott

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:11.600
about 75 percent of all the
ridership was African American

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:12.403
and the boycott really
did work in that sense

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:16.963
in that not many African
Americans rode the bus.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.523
So they were losing a ton of money,

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.893
but I suspect that they were getting
some subsidy from the cities,

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.473
from the -- you know, the
business elite in the cities

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:30.700
who wanted that to keep going.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.600
Because it was a symbol,
if they went down,

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.933
if they stopped operation
that was a concession.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.813
So that's the way -- may I leave

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.403
with a brief reading so
you can -- oh, sorry.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:47.703
&gt;&gt; Were you surprised that you
could actually be arrested by that?

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.926
&gt;&gt; Claudette Colvin:
No, I wasn't surprised.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.520


00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:55.140
&gt;&gt; Phillip Hoose: We'll
leave with --

00:41:56.740 --> 00:42:01.006
I have a brief reading from the
book and it's about what happened

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.280
on the bus and what
happened afterwards.

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:09.050
So it goes like this.

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:14.550
This is in Claudette's voice, so
just so you can have some sense --

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.840
some more sense of just
what she went through.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.546
One cop grabbed one of my hands
and his partner grabbed the other

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.200
and they pulled me
straight up out of my seat.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.003
My books went flying everywhere.

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:28.916
I went as limp as a baby.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.250
I was too smart to fight back.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:31.910
They started dragging me backwards
off the bus, one of them kicked me.

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.856
I might have scratched
one or two of them

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:38.273
because I have long nails,
but I didn't fight back.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:43.373
I kept screaming over and over
it's my Constitutional right.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.860
I wasn't shouting anything profane,
I never swore, not then, not ever.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:48.006
I was just shouting out my rights.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.140
It just killed me to leave that bus.

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:52.850
I hated to give that
white woman my seat

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:55.000
when so many black
people were standing.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:42:58.260
I was crying hard.

00:42:59.060 --> 00:42:59.826
The cops put me in the back of
a police car and shut the door.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.326
They stood outside and talked
to each other for a minute

00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:05.326
and then one came back and told me

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:07.526
to stick my hands out
the open window.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:09.663
He handcuffed me and then
pulled the door open and jumped

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:13.856
in the back seat with me.

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.736
I put my knees together
and crossed my hands

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.843
up over my lap and started praying.

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:22.803
All ride long they swore
at me and ridiculed me.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:23.136
They took turns trying
to guess my bra size.

00:43:25.830 --> 00:43:25.833
They cracked jokes
about parts of my body.

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:28.710
I recited the Lord's Pray and
the 23rd Psalm over and over

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:34.810
in my head trying to
push back the fear.

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:36.266
I assumed they were
taking me to juvenile court

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:42.220
because I was only 15, but we
were going in the wrong direction.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:42.616
They kept telling me I was going
to Atmore the women's penitentiary.

00:43:46.290 --> 00:43:50.623
Instead we pulled up to the police
station and they led me inside.

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:51.073
More cops looked up when we came in

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.653
and started calling
me thing and whore.

00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:55.700
They booked me and
took my fingerprints.

00:43:58.260 --> 00:43:59.193
Then they put me back
in the car and drove me

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.460
to the city jail, the adult jail.

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:03.020
Someone led me straight to a cell

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.086
without giving me any
chance to make a phone call.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:08.646
He opened the back door
and told me to get inside.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:10.913
He shut it hard behind
me and turned the key.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:13.956
The lock fell into place
with a heavy sound.

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.380
It was the worst sound I ever heard.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.453
It sounded final.

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:21.786
It said I was trapped.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:22.720
When he went away I
looked around me.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:24.530
Three bare walls, a
toilet and a cot.

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:27.593
Then I fell down on my knees
in the middle of the cell

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.626
and started crying again.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.276
I didn't know if anyone knew where
I was or what had happened to me.

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:34.440
I had no idea how long
I would be there.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.106
I cried and put my hands
together and prayed

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.586
like I had never prayed before.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.423
Meanwhile -- this is my voice --

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:44.623
schoolmates who had been
on the bus had run home

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.930
and telephoned Claudette's
mother at the house

00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:49.890
where she worked as a maid.

00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:51.540
Girls went over and took care of
the lady's three small children

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.303
so that Claudette's
mother could leave.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:55.366
Mary Ann Colvin called Claudette's
pastor the Reverend H.H. Johnson.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:44:59.826
He had a car and together they
drove to the police station.

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.346
Now back to Claudette.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.813
When they led mom back
there I was in a cell.

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.493
I was crying hard and
then mom got upset too.

00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:11.820
When she saw me she didn't
[inaudible] she just asked are you

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.920
all right?

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.040
Reverend Johnson bailed
me out and we drove home.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:18.690
By the time we got to my
neighborhood, King Hill,

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.310
word had spread everywhere.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.443
All our neighbors came around

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:25.176
and they were just
squeezing me to death.

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:30.176
I felt happy and proud, but
I was afraid that night too.

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.336
I had stood up to a white bus
driver and two white cops.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:35.790
I had challenged the bus laws.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:36.233
There had been lynchings
for that kind of thing.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:43.353
Wetumpka Highway that led out of
Montgomery ran right past our house.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:44.750
It would have been easy for the Klan
to come up the hill in the night.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.813
My dad sat up all night
long with is shotgun.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:50.833
We all stayed up.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:52.246
The neighbors facing
the highway kept watch.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:57.020
Probably nobody on King
Hill slept that night.

00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.493
But worried or not I felt proud.

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.550
I had stood up for our rights.

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:05.810
I had done something a
lot of adults hadn't done.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:05.990
On the ride home from jail coming

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:08.373
over the viaduct Reverend
Johnson said something

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.100
to me I'll never forget.

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:12.806
He was an adult who
everyone respected

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.926
and his opinion meant a lot to me.

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.530
Claudette, he said,
I'm so proud of you.

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:22.080
Everyone prays for freedom.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.203
We've all been praying and praying
and praying, but you're different.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:28.610
You want your answer
the next morning

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:29.620
and I think you just brought
the revolution to Montgomery.
