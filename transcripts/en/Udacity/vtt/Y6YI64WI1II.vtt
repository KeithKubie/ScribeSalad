00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.860
Now, today's internet is experiencing considerable problems. And

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.740
growing pains and it's worth bearing some of these

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.170
in mind and thinking about them, as many

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.810
of them give rise to interesting research problems to

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.650
think about as we work through the material

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.910
in the course. One of the major problems is

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.110
that we're running out of addresses. The current

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.740
version of the internet protocol, IPV4, uses 32-bit addresses.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.128
Meaning that the IPV4 internet only has 2 to the 32 IP addresses. Or

00:00:31.128 --> 00:00:34.770
about 4 billion IP addresses. Furthermore, these

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.060
IP addresses need to be. Allocated hierarchily

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.670
and many portions of the IP address

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.350
space are not allocated very efficiently. For

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.720
example the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.850
one two fifty sixth of all the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.230
Internet address space. Another problem is congestion

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.080
control. Now congestion control's goal is to match

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.670
offered load to available capacity. But one

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.610
of the problems with today's congestion control algorithms

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.010
is that they have insufficient dynamic range.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.970
They don't work very well over slow and

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.530
flaky wireless links and they don't work

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.720
very well over very high speed. Intercontinental paths.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.600
Now, some solutions exist but change is hard

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.930
and all solutions that are deployed must interact

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.360
well with one another. And deployment in some

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.660
sense requires some amount of consensus. A third

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.480
major problem is routing. Routing is the process

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.500
by which those on the internet discover paths

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.670
to take to reach another destination. Today's interdomain

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.790
routing protocol, BGP, suffers a number of ills,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.670
including a lack of security, ease of misconfiguration,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.030
poor convergence, and non-determinism. But it sort of works

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.020
and it's the most critical piece of the internet

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.610
infrastructure in some sense because it's the glue that

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.910
holds all of the internet service providers together. Another

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.570
major problem in today's internet is security. Now while

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.050
we're reasonably good at encryption and authentication, we are

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.910
not actually so good at turning these mechanisms on.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.620
And we're pretty bad at key management. As

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.540
well as deploying secure software and secure configurations.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.240
The fifth major problem is denial of service.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.060
And the internet does a very good job of

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.220
transmitting packets to a destination. Even if the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.830
destination doesn't want those packets. This makes it easy

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.780
for an attacker to overload servers or network

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.550
links to prevent the victim from doing useful work.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.750
Distributed denial of service attacks are particularly commonplace on

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.290
today's Internet. Now, the thing that all of those problems

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.450
have in common is that they all require changes

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.810
to the basic infrastructure. And changing basic infrastructure is really

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.380
difficult. It's not even clear what the process is

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.450
to achieve consensus on changes. So as we work our

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.190
way through the course, it will be interesting to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.680
see the problems that we encounter in each of these

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.420
areas, various solutions that have been proposed, and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.140
also to think about ways. In which new

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.250
protocols and technologies can be deployed. In later

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.500
parts of the course we'll learn about a new

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.430
technology called software defined networking, or SDN. That

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.810
makes it easier to solve some of these problems

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.500
by rolling out new software technologies, protocols, and

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.400
other systems to help manage some of these issues.
