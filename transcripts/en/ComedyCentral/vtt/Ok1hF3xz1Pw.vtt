00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:02.169
Opposers, I want
to talk about tests.

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:05.506
They're how we found out which
kids to wedgie in high school,

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.443
and which imaginary
school we fake go to.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.614
But, the most
important test in America

00:00:13.614 --> 00:00:16.550
is the NRA loyalty
questionnaire.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.252
Where politicians
answer questions

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:20.354
about their commitment
to gun rights,

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:22.589
and then the NRA judges
them on a scale

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:27.027
between 'A' for 'all guns,
all day' down to

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:31.331
'F' for '(bleep) this guy.'

00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:33.433
That's how they decide
whether to give you money

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.869
or grind you into the ground
with attack ads

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.604
until the only job
you'll be able to get

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.206
is Flint Michigan water taster.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.876
So fun.
And...

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.445
The latest test is being
conducted down in Florida,

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:47.948
our most gun-shaped state.

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.852
The NRA is sending out these
questionnaires to lawmakers

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.588
asking where they stand
on the gun issues. -Questions

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:55.956
on the survey
asked lawmakers

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:58.425
whether they would consider
repealing many provisions

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.595
in the Marjorie Stoneman Douglas
High School Public Safety Act

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.363
including the ban
on bump stocks,

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:04.965
the three day waiting period,

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:07.234
and the new age restrictions
on purchasing a gun.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:09.836
Yes, you had four months

00:01:09.836 --> 00:01:12.372
of extremely meager
gun control laws

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:14.007
passed after
the parkland shooting

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.842
but school's out for summer
baby.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:19.846
That means students need
to chill with the gun control

00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:23.417
and teachers need to focus on
their third and fourth day jobs.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.090
But, some Libs are going
to find any reason to get upset

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:33.327
Anna Eskamani, a Democrat
running for an Orlando house

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:35.395
seat shamed the NRA on Twitter

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:37.197
for sending the questionnaire
just two weeks

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:40.434
before the two year anniversary
of the post nightclub shooting.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.835
OK.
OK.

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:44.538
It's a little close
to the anniversary of Pulse.

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:47.007
But to be fair, they wanted
to do it in May

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:50.510
until the Santa Fe shooting
happened and April wouldn't work

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.047
because that's Columbine season
and July is all tied up

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:55.816
with the anniversary
of the Aurora shooting.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.618
It's just so hard
to schedule around mass

00:01:58.618 --> 00:02:00.654
shooting anniversaries
for some reason.

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:04.157
Anyway back to how
we need more guns.

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:07.661
This questionnaire is perfect.

00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.030
You're allowed to fill out
the test with a black pen,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.299
a number two pencil,
or a 22 magnum.

00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:16.770
And don't even think
about not answering

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.439
because the NRA won't just
mark them incomplete,

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.576
they'll mark them an attack
on freedom, you dirty communist.

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:24.811
There's a line
right at the top

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.547
that says "unanswered
questions will be graded

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:30.717
as a response against
Second Amendment rights."

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.522
But the questions
are totally easy like:

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:38.425
will you support
the right to bear arms,

00:02:38.425 --> 00:02:41.128
look to repeal three day
waiting periods,

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:45.332
and push to finally let people
bring guns to church preschools?

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.502
You know. No brainer stuff.

00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.076
But this is just the test
that got leaked to the press.

00:02:56.076 --> 00:02:58.679
There's a whole other NRA test

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.681
with the tough questions.
Like this math question:

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.584
A train is traveling 100 miles
per hour going west.

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:08.522
Another train is
traveling 85 going east.

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:11.491
Should people be allowed
to have guns at the DMV?

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:16.763
And would you
support legislation

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:18.632
called The Bazooka Law?

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:20.634
No questions asked.

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:27.007
So listen up NRA politicians.
Work hard, study up, and relax

00:03:27.007 --> 00:03:28.909
If you can shrug off
the teenage victims

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.077
of school shootings,

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.778
you're truly capable
of anything.
