00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now you're probably itching to write some code by now--so let's get started.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What I want you to do first is write these two action functions, hold and role,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which take a state and return a state.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here the state that results from holding.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Here the state that results from rolling and getting a d.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
A state is represented by this four tuple of p, the player.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's either zero or one.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The subsequent state would remain the same if the player continues

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and would swap between one and the other otherwise.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Me and you, two integers indicating the score, the score of the player to play

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and the score of the other player, and then pending,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
which is score accumulated so far but not yet put onto the scoreboard.

00:00:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Go ahead and write those functions.
