00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.990
In short, when we render images to the screen.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.310
A pixel layout dimensions may well not equal a pixel

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.920
in real device terms. And that relationship isn't a

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.530
fixed one either. Here, we have the same page on

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.430
two different devices. But even though the image is

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.320
approximately the same size on both devices, this image only

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.830
needs less than half the pixels of this image

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.600
to be rendered at one to one. Rendering an image

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.290
at one to one gives the best quality. But even

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.610
more important, you don't want to be pushing a lot more

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.060
bits down with the network than the device can use, and

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.150
you don't want to have poor image quality because you're not

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.620
pushing anywhere near enough high resolution imagery either. The best

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.790
way to think about this is that it's much like the

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.500
difference between standard definition tv and high definition tv. For most

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.640
of my life I watched standard definition tv, but now that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.990
I watch most shows in HD, when a show

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.260
is broadcast in standard def, I defininately feel like

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.600
I'm living like an animal. You need to deliver

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.530
an HD experience when the user's device supports it.
