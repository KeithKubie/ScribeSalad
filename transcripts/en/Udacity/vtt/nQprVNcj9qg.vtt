00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.280
The problem is that in some sense, the threat

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.870
is implausible. And it, and it, in a very

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.640
kind of real sense. So what's happened is that if you do fake out on me, if you

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.040
do cross that line, the idea that I will

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.370
then spend the rest of my days punishing you,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.550
forgoing reward myself, right? Not taking the best response

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.220
against you, seems kind of crazy. Do you agree?

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.130
again, my ex-girlfriend. Yeah, I totally get this.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.046
&gt;&gt; No, but no, I'm saying that nobody would do that.

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:32.930
&gt;&gt; Right, so it, it would be like being in a elevator with a stick of

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.060
dynamite and seeing that someone has a hundred

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.060
dollars and saying, give me your hundred dollars

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.230
or I'll blow us both up. That's not

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.670
really a reasonable threat because the alternative to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.630
me not giving you a hundred dollars is,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.080
you die, which seems probably not worth it.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.780
&gt;&gt; That's right, so you could think about

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.430
the possibility of, okay, I'm going to not

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.520
give you the $100, you say that you're going to blow me up,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.940
but you will hurt yourself more than you hurt me, so it won't

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.705
be a best response. Not blowing me up and just not getting the

00:00:58.705 --> 00:01:02.658
$100 and leaving the elevator is better for you than blowing me up.

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:03.830
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.190
&gt;&gt; So that is an implausible threat. So the

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.740
way we formalize this idea, in the game theoretic

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.150
context, is to say that we're interested. A plausible

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.995
threat corresponds to something that's called a subgame perfect equilibrium.

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:17.003
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:17.003 --> 00:01:20.520
&gt;&gt; So subgame perfect means that each player is always taking a best

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.210
response, independent of the history. All right,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.670
so let's actually look at a concrete

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.336
example here, let's imagine playing Grim Trigger,

00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:29.920
against Tit for Tat. So my first

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.060
question to you is, are these two strategies in nash equilibrio with each other.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah I guess so.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.030
&gt;&gt; And why is that?

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.630
&gt;&gt; Because, the fact, if I'm playing Tit,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.680
if one player is playing Tit for Tat

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.930
then the Grim Trigger thing doesn't matter anyway because both of you

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.522
are going to cooperate forever and it doesn't make any sense to deviate.

00:01:46.522 --> 00:01:49.830
&gt;&gt; Right, so any strategy that I could choose that's different than

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.920
Grim Trigger is going to on average do no better, possibly worse.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.250
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.510
&gt;&gt; So I might as well stick with Grim Trigger

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.490
and Tit for Tat has the same kind of feeling about

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.050
it, that, it's cooperating with Grim. And any, it can't

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.640
really do anything better so it might as well do that.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.030
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.310
&gt;&gt; So the next question to ask is.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.722
Are these two strategies in a subgame perfect equilibrium with

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:15.440
each other? And the way that you actually test that, is

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.150
you say, well, they are not subgame perfect. If there's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.280
some history of actions that we could feed to these machines,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.280
so that, so that, you know, here's, here's what Grim

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.020
is doing. It's, it's some, some sequence of cooperates and defects,

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.200
and here's what Tit for Tat is doing. It's some sequence

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.910
of cooperates and defects. And once we've reached some particular point.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.690
Is it the case that one or the other of these

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.230
machines is not taking a best response that it could actually change

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.040
it's behavior away from, what the machine says and do better then

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.170
what the machine says. If that is the case then it's not

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.400
subgame perfect but if it's the case of all histories. They're

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.850
always taking a best response. Then, it is subgame perfect. So, so

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.810
do you see a, a sequence of, of moves that these two

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.360
players can take where one or the other of them is not

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.730
going to be doing a best response?

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.920
&gt;&gt; It's, can take, right? As opposed to, will take.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.720
&gt;&gt; I don't understand.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not sure I do either. That's

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.460
why I asked the question. It's not a, you know

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.400
made up history, it's like an actual set of

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.620
moves that are consistent with Grim and Tit for Tat.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.266
&gt;&gt; No no, no no, so it is, it is not necessarily. So we know that

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:20.227
if we actually play these against each other

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:22.290
the only history that we're going to see, is.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.060
&gt;&gt; Cooperate forever.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.140
&gt;&gt; Right, Grim

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.630
is going to do cooperate cooperate cooperate cooperate,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.230
Tit for Tat is going to do cooperate cooperate

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.550
cooperate cooperate. And so they are, and

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.650
everything's fine. The question is, can we actually

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.950
go in and alter, the history, so that one or the other in the machines

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.980
could take a better action than the one that the machine tells it to take.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah if Tit for Tat, ever does defect.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.250
&gt;&gt; Alright, so let's take a look at that. So, let's say,

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:57.150
on the first move Grim cooperates and Tit for Tat defects. Okay, so let's

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.610
say that, that's the moment in time. What will the machines do at this point?

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.360
&gt;&gt; Well, at this point the and next time

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.810
step, Tit for Tat will cooperate and Grim will defect.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.940
&gt;&gt; Good and then thereafter.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.440
&gt;&gt; Grim will always defect.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.960
&gt;&gt; And then Tit for Tat will always defect.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.090
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.300
&gt;&gt; So the

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.720
pay of that Grim gets at this point is

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.450
going to be, well initially high but then very very low.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.450
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.560
&gt;&gt; On the other hand could Grim have

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.610
changed it's behavior to do better than this?

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Just by doing just, by choosing to cooperate.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.760
&gt;&gt; By choosing to cooperate, so it sort of

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.870
ignore the fact that, that Tit for Tat did the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.270
defect, and instead do a cooperate here, then Grim would

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.460
do better. So the idea is that Grim is making

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.850
a threat, but when it comes time to

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.320
actually follow through on that threat, it's actually doing

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.380
something that is worse for itself. Than what

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.090
it would do otherwise. Do, do you see that?

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.610
&gt;&gt; I do.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.690
&gt;&gt; So is it subgame perfect? No. And the proof

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.620
of that is exactly, exactly what you said, Take, take

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.460
a look at this history. Here's a history where Grim

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.370
would not be willing to actually follow through on its threat.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.490
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:02.760
&gt;&gt; So it's an implausible threat, and that's

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.520
bad. So maybe we've now just undone all

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.910
the awesomeness that we had done.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.410
&gt;&gt; No.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.460
&gt;&gt; Well maybe. I mean the awesomeness was hey look we can actually

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.010
get machines that are in nash

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.250
equilibrium and they're cooperative in, in prisoner's

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.920
dilemma so they're actually kind of doing the right thing. And, turns out well

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.870
they are but they're, depending on this notion of implausible threats to do it.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.560
&gt;&gt; Mm, how should I feel about that?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.210
&gt;&gt; Well, let's see if we can fix it.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.630
&gt;&gt; Okay.
