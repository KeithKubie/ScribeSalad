Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab. And today today we are trying to figure out how to make a deal with yourself when most of you doesn't want to do what the rest of you wants to do. Right. And we've talked about these kinds of deals when it comes to avoiding the sirens, quitting smoking, figuring out what to do with the balance of your life. Now we're going to change things a bit. Let's say instead of being an addict, let's say you're just a writer. Yeah. And you want to be inspired. You want the words to come. And this is very typical situation. They're not coming. No, no words to the question is in that kind of situation, what kind of deals could you make with yourself to get the words out? This is a, this is fanciful. My friend Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and the writer, he made a deal, which frankly, I find this kind of astonishing [inaudible] bargain with creativity.

Speaker 1:          00:52          I will tell you all the, I probably shouldn't, uh, the first book I wrote, Migraine, um, was very obstructed. And then by obstructed he means he just got stuck. Yes, day after day he, she tried to write something down and it just didn't come and I was getting desperate on the matter. And finally on September the first of 1968 I said to myself, you have 10 days to write this book. If it is not done, then you commit suicide. Whoa. And under the imagined threat, which seem to tell lie me in a way because you're, you're what the, the other half of you thought that the first half of you meant it. Yes. Did the first half of you mean it? I don't know,

Speaker 1:          01:47          but there was a lot of, this was that after months of, of stewing and not doing anything, I started work and what started as a, as a fearful task soon became a joyful task with this own momentum. And suddenly he had this feeling that there was something inside him. Some engine inside me, a wonderful associative engine, which we've sourced together, brings unexpected things into our position. It had kicked into gear and I'm just kind of pulling things out of him and putting them right there under the page. I felt like who's being dictated to me healing? Uh, I, I was passive. I was the bridge, I was the transmitter. Um, and in fact, I finished the book a day early. That's a strange way to kick yourself in the pants, I have to say. Yeah. Well, um, for me a deadline sometimes is felt homeless literally as such.

Speaker 1:          02:48          This is not an easy way to go to work everyday. I wouldn't think. I don't think corn can make bonk and it's like that definitely not too often. And it would have a cost. I'll never of course did that only once, but the story told got us thinking, is there a bargain that you can make with yourself, your creative self? It somehow avoids this terrible cost. Yeah. That as long as this led me generally in front too late a woman who just does it differently. I have this fascination with trying to figure out how you can live a lifetime of creativity without cutting your ear off. You know what I mean? And who is, who is that? Oh, I'm Liz Gilbert and well, just something a little bit not which Liz Gilbert rd. I'm the Liz Gilbert who wrote the book called the pray love. I guess that's the way she described myself because that's how my obituary will read, eat, pray, love in case you were born under a rock or raised by wolves is one of the most popular books ever, ever, ever in the world. It became even more popular when the book became a movie and Guess who played Liz?

Speaker 2:          03:49          Liz Gilbert is remarkable. Roberts or courage in the way

Speaker 1:          03:54          America's sweetheart and the success was great, but she says, you know, it was also kind of frightening because there she was back at home in front of the same old blank page with a new question. How will you ever outdo what you did last time? Suddenly she's back where Oliver was obstructive. She didn't think that that success was going to be there the last time. So was the last time a flute, do I even have another big book in me? Dangerous Recipe for madness madness. But then she thought back to a conversation that she once had with hope. Who? Tom. Wait,

Speaker 2:          04:28          Tom [inaudible]. Where this all began was that I was, I was a journalist for she Q and I did an interview with him and he spoke about the creative process, I think more articulately than anybody I have ever heard. Um, and he was talking about how every song has a distinctive identity that it comes into the world with and it needs to be taken in different ways. And he said, you know, there are songs that, that you have to sneak up on, like you're hunting for where rare bird.

Speaker 3:          05:01          And there are songs that come fully intact, like a dream taken through a straw. And there are songs that you find little bits of like pieces of gum underneath the desk and you scrape them off and you put them together and you make something out of it. And there are some,

Speaker 2:          05:16          cause he said that needed to be bullied, um, where he said he's been in the studio working on a song and the whole album is done and this one song won't give itself over. And he said, you know, everyone's gotten used to seeing him do things like this. He'll march up and down the studio talking to the song saying the rest of their families in the car, we're all going on vacation. You coming along or not, you got 10 minutes or else you're getting left behind, you know, and he's like, you got to shake it down. Some

Speaker 1:          05:42          Times lists as that interview was maybe the first time she thought of inspiration as as a, as an it.

Speaker 2:          05:48          And I remember feeling my own center of gravity shift and thinking, wait, you're allowed to talk to this thing

Speaker 1:          05:54          that the source of her ideas was outsider than she could get

Speaker 2:          05:58          some distance from it, maybe negotiate with it, even fight with it instead of beating yourself up all the time. Right. And this, the story that I loved that he told me about where his artistic anxiety ended and his sort of new artistic liberation began is when he's driving along the freeway in Los Angeles and like eight lanes of traffic one day. And this little fragment of a beautiful song comes into his head

Speaker 4:          06:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          06:27          and he has no way to record it. He's gotten no pencil, he's got no tape recorder and he's in eight lanes of stressful track.

Speaker 4:          06:32          So coma, it was blue,

Speaker 5:          06:36          and he immediately starts to feel all the old pressure that he's felt his whole life of, I'm not good enough. I, you know all the artistic struggle, right? I can't do it. I'm not good enough. I'm going to lose it. I, it'll haunt me forever. And then he just backed off from it

Speaker 2:          06:50          and instead he established that negotiating distance between him and the melody. And he looked up at the sky and he said, excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving if you're serious about wanting to exist, I spent eight hours a day in the studio. You're welcome to come and visit me while I'm sitting at the piano. Otherwise leave me alone and go bother Leonard Cohen. Oh, that's very bold. It is. I think that's what she wants. She wants you to push back and she wants you to set some terms and some boundaries. She doesn't want you to go to the Leonard Cohen Concert two years later. Very kind of you to come to this. Now this idea that somehow the creative act comes from outside you, you get a visit from a somebody, this isn't a new idea. This is a very old idea. You know the Greeks would call it the muse

Speaker 4:          07:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          07:47          the Romans called it the ingenium the genius, which was an interesting idea because it's not the way we use genius today, right? Today we say that it person is a genius and back then they would've said a person had one. Um, and again it's the separation so that the creative person has this externalized collaborator. So this is a tinker belly kind of a thing. It sprinkles you has little wings. And I think it depends. I think it depends on the process. I mean it's got a lot of names because it takes a lot of forms, right? And, and we're talking about all this as though these are actually kind of believe it cause I don't think it would work otherwise. But I kind of do believe that the world is being constantly circled as though by Gulf stream forces ideas and creativity that want to be made manifest and they're looking for portals to come through and people, and if you don't do it, they'll go find someone else.

Speaker 2:          08:39          You know? And and so you have to convince it that you're serious and you have to show it respect and you have to talk to it and let it know that you're there. Like for the last few years there's been a novel that has been sort of stirring in me and I haven't had time to give it the attention it wants me to give it. But every day I talk to it and I have a little conversation with it and I say, listen, I'm in April, I will be with you. I want you to stay. Don't let me wake up and read in the New York Times that someone else wrote you and stay here with me. I'm calming the Golden Retrievers. I mean you have to keep passing it. Actually, that's probably as good a metaphor for me as any because I would relate to that being half golden retriever myself and, and liking dogs.

Speaker 2:          09:23          That's great. And when you say you talk to it and its golden retriever form, that's our producer pat Walters. Like do you actually talk to it? Yeah I do. I talk. That's why I have to work alone in a quiet room because I talk to it all the time and I ask a questions. I say, what do you, what is it that you want me? What does you want me to be doing here? Because you seem to be resistant to what I'm trying to do here. Like show me, give me a clue. Um, like I uh, the title of eat, Pray Love was the last thing that came of that book. And, and the book was about to be published in it had any number of ridiculous stupid titles that I'm going to tell you cause they're so embarrassing and they're so not what that book was meant to be titled.

Speaker 2:          10:00          And I ended up writing an email to all my friends and saying the subject heading was title search. And I said, my book won't tell me its name and can I, can all of you help me? And a friend of mine wrote back and said, um, if you're going to talk to it like that, it's not going to tell you anything. Um, right. So I really did that night. I said it back and sweetheart, listen, I respect you, I love you. I honor you. I have defended you these last few years. I want to bring you into the world, but you have to tell me your name and the next day eat, pray, love.

Speaker 6:          10:38          And you know it. Because I know the difference between something I thought of and something that I was given. I can, I can tell the difference. She says sometimes it's the whole scene. Sometimes it's just a word, may be a phrase and then you have the job to make it into something.

Speaker 2:          10:55          Wait it. But if I, if I say to you two roads diverged,

Speaker 7:          10:59          well two roads diverge. Any yellow water.

Speaker 2:          11:03          So you can write that down. Two roads diverged in the yellow one, then you're done. Do you know how that poem got written?

Speaker 7:          11:09          Two roads.

Speaker 2:          11:10          So he was working for, I may be exaggerating this cause I tend to, but I'm going to tell it my way. How I heard it. Uh, he was working for months and months and months on, on what was going to be the greatest epic poem of his life. It was the biggest challenge that he was taking on. He was going to be up there with the masters with this, I couldn't name the prison we were talking about. Yes, this would be Mr. Frost. And, um, and, and, and he worked on it for, um, you know, forever and ever. I mean, perspiration, perspiration, perspiration. Right. And it was 20, 30 pages long and it was, I don't know what the meter was, whatever it was. It was the most ambitious thing he'd ever done. And it was arduous and it probably had sweat all over it. Um, put it down, went to sleep, woke up, sat down and wrote two, two roads.

Speaker 2:          11:54          And all of a sudden in one setting, this tiny, perfect, immaculate thing was created that had nothing to do with what he had just done. He earned it. I think the angels reward people who are at their desk at six o'clock in the morning working right. And he earned it by showing his, his intent to be a great poet. And they said, okay, cool. You showed your intent. That thing you just wrote was crap. I'm going to give you this one. Here's your reward. So then what evidence do you have for this of justice? Except for that. It's a great story. And I liked the idea and I feel like I really do feel like when they see me working, they take pity on me and they say, you look, you're showing a real commitment to this. You've been up at five o'clock every morning for the last year working on this novel. I'm just going to give you the ending, you know, um, or I'm, I'm going to spare you from that really bad idea. You just having, you know, I always think of it as like Henry Ford's famous line about how creativity is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration, which is a very mechanical way to divide it up. But it also assumes that those two things have equal weight, that they're the same quality. Right. I agree with 99% perspiration, 1% inspiration, but it's 99% oyster 1% Pearl

Speaker 4:          13:05          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:05          you can't even compare the, the matter like it's a bargain to get 1% inspiration. You know, it's, it's a miracle.

Speaker 4:          13:26          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:30          I could get with the muses sort of. What do you mean? Well, I think it's interesting that you can hear it at one point she says that she believes actually kind of believe in, and another point she says, it just makes a good story. That's a great story. And I like the idea so you can hear her negotiating with the idea. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          13:50          Gosh, she's a little bit between the two thoughts, which is interesting. I mean, you know, you know, a serious neuroscientists would tell you that it's all in your unconscious and it's all you. All the time. But another way to think of it is, uh, is to say that you got a gift and, and therefore it's not all about you would, it's bad and it's still about you when it's good, but it's not all about you. It's just this business of all. Okay, this is a form of well organized and modesty.

Speaker 2:          14:21          It's a nice phrase. I'm just going to, just going to go with that. Yay. It's time for us in our ferries to go to break.

Speaker 8:          14:29          No.
