00:00:00.318 --> 00:00:01.670
Voiceover: What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.019
is to give a not-too-math-y explanation

00:00:05.019 --> 00:00:09.684
of why bond prices move

00:00:09.684 --> 00:00:13.367
in the opposite direction
as interest rates,

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.933
so bond prices versus interest rates.

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:21.701
To start off, I'll just start
with a fairly simple bond,

00:00:21.701 --> 00:00:24.033
one that does pay a coupon,

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:25.233
and we'll just talk a little bit about

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.900
what you'd be willing to pay for that bond

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.966
if interest rates moved up or down.

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:32.546
Let's start with a bond from some company.

00:00:32.546 --> 00:00:34.800
Let me just write this down.

00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:39.767
This could be company A.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:41.166
It doesn't just have to be from a company.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.566
It could be from a municipality

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.833
or it could be from the U.S. government.

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.566
Let's say it's a bond for $1,000.

00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:53.333
Let's say it has a two-year maturity,

00:00:55.368 --> 00:00:58.435
and let's say that it has a 10% coupon,

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:01.266
10% coupon

00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:04.100
paid semi-annually,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.733
so this is semi-annual payments.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.654
If we just draw the diagram for this,

00:01:12.654 --> 00:01:13.654
obviously I ran out of space

00:01:13.654 --> 00:01:15.506
on the actual bond certificate,

00:01:15.506 --> 00:01:18.966
but let's draw a diagram of
the payments for this bond.

00:01:18.966 --> 00:01:20.167
This is today.

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:22.066
Let me do it in a different color.

00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:23.500
That's today.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.868
Let me draw a little timeline right here.

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:29.509
This is two years in the
future when the bond matures,

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.433
so that is 24 months in the future.

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:34.756
Halfway is 12 months,

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:37.335
then this is 18 months,

00:01:37.335 --> 00:01:40.101
and this right here is six months.

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:41.500
We went over a little bit of this

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.966
in the introduction to bond video,

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.695
but it's a 10% coupon paid semi-annually,

00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:51.079
so it will pay us 10% of
the par value per year,

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.701
but it's going to break it up
into two six-month payments.

00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:56.900
10% of $1,000 is $100,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.133
so they're going to give
us $50 every six months.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.033
They're going to give
half of our 10% coupon

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:04.900
every six months,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.734
so we're going to get $50 here,

00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:10.400
$50 here,

00:02:10.566 --> 00:02:11.982
these are going to be our coupon payments,

00:02:11.982 --> 00:02:13.532
$50 there,

00:02:13.532 --> 00:02:16.366
and then finally, at two
years, we'll get $50,

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:18.940
and we'll also get the
par value of our bond,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.812
and we'll also get $1,000.

00:02:22.118 --> 00:02:26.901
We'll get $1,000 plus
$50 24 months from today.

00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.033
Now, the day that this,

00:02:29.033 --> 00:02:30.817
let's say this is today
that we're talking about

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.366
the bond is issued,

00:02:32.366 --> 00:02:33.688
and you look at that and
you say, you know what?

00:02:33.688 --> 00:02:35.634
For a company like company A,

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:37.387
for this risk profile,

00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:39.366
given where interest rates are right now,

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:43.034
I think a 10% coupon
is just about perfect.

00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:45.634
So a 10% coupon is just about perfect,

00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:46.367
so you say, you know what?

00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:49.634
I think I will pay $1,000 for it.

00:02:49.634 --> 00:02:51.767
So the price of the bond,

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:53.500
the price of that bond

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.166
right when it gets issued
or on day zero, if you will,

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:59.236
you'll be willing to pay $1,000 for it

00:02:59.236 --> 00:03:01.902
because you say, look, I'm
getting roughly 10% a year,

00:03:01.902 --> 00:03:02.966
and then I get my money back.

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:05.535
10% is a good interest rate
for that level of risk.

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:09.966
Now, let's say that the moment
after you buy that bond,

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:11.367
just to make things a little bit ...

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:14.034
Obviously, interest rates
don't move this quickly,

00:03:14.034 --> 00:03:15.900
but let's say the moment
after you buy that bond,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.566
or maybe to be a little
bit more realistic,

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:19.100
let's say the very next day,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.200
interest rates go up.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.300
If interest rates go up,

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.268
let me do this in a new color.

00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:28.000
Let's say that interest,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.199
interest rates go up,

00:03:33.234 --> 00:03:34.768
and let's say they go up in such a way

00:03:34.768 --> 00:03:36.433
that now that they've moved up

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.833
for this type of a company,

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:40.100
for this type of risk,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.833
you could go out in the
market and get 15% coupon.

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.835
So let's say for this type of risk,

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:52.600
you would now expect a 15% interest rate.

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:55.819
Obviously for something less risky,

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.434
you would expect less interest.

00:03:57.434 --> 00:03:59.301
For a company just like company,

00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:01.234
you would now expect a 15% interest rate.

00:04:01.234 --> 00:04:03.300
Interest rates have gone up.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.701
Now, let's say you need cash

00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:06.700
and you come to me and you say,

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.102
"Hey, Sal, are you willing to buy

00:04:09.102 --> 00:04:10.500
"this certificate off of me?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.035
"I need some cash.

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:13.367
"I need some liquidity.

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:15.433
"I can't wait for the two years

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:17.238
"for me to get my money back.

00:04:17.238 --> 00:04:21.266
"How much are you willing
to pay for this bond?"

00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:22.633
I'll say, you know what?

00:04:22.956 --> 00:04:25.766
I'm going to pay you less than $1,000

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:29.300
because this bond is only giving me 10%.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.442
I'm expecting 15%,

00:04:31.442 --> 00:04:34.166
so I want to pay something
less than $1,000,

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:36.968
that after I do all of the
fancy math in my spreadsheet,

00:04:36.968 --> 00:04:39.968
it will come out to be 15%,

00:04:39.968 --> 00:04:41.234
so I'm going to pay,

00:04:41.234 --> 00:04:42.400
so the price,

00:04:43.653 --> 00:04:45.704
so in this situation,
the price will go down.

00:04:45.704 --> 00:04:47.567
I'll actually do the
math with a simpler bond

00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:49.776
than one that pays
coupons right after this,

00:04:49.776 --> 00:04:51.166
but I just want to give
the intuitive sense.

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:52.500
If interest rates go up,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.967
someone willing to buy that bond,

00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:56.168
they'll say, "Gee, this
only gives a 10% coupon.

00:04:56.168 --> 00:04:59.433
"That's not the 15% coupon I
can get on the open market.

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:02.433
"I'm going to pay less
than $1,000 for this bond."

00:05:02.433 --> 00:05:06.100
So the price will go down.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.568
Or you could just essentially say

00:05:07.568 --> 00:05:11.068
that the bond would be
trading at a discount to par.

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:18.634
Bond would trade at a discount,

00:05:18.634 --> 00:05:24.000
at a discount to par.

00:05:24.234 --> 00:05:25.573
Now, let's say the opposite happens.

00:05:25.573 --> 00:05:28.139
Let's say that interest rates go down.

00:05:28.168 --> 00:05:31.534
Let's say that we're in a
situation where interest rates,

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:35.907
interest rates go down.

00:05:35.907 --> 00:05:38.833
So now, for this type
of risk like company A,

00:05:38.833 --> 00:05:40.833
people expect 5%.

00:05:41.002 --> 00:05:44.800
People expect 5% rate.

00:05:45.233 --> 00:05:48.100
So how much could you sell this bond for?

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.239
If you were there and if I had to just go

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:52.166
to companies issuing their bonds,

00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:54.300
I would have to pay $1,000,

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.566
or roughly $1,000,

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:59.033
for a bond that only gives me a 5% coupon,

00:05:59.033 --> 00:05:59.903
roughly, give or take.

00:05:59.903 --> 00:06:01.233
I'm not being precise with the math.

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:03.100
I really just want to
give you the gist of it.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.633
So I would pay $1,000 for
something giving a 5% coupon now.

00:06:06.633 --> 00:06:08.719
This thing is giving me a 10% coupon,

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:09.967
so it's clearly better,

00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:12.200
so now, the price would go up.

00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:20.933
So now, I would pay more than par.

00:06:21.366 --> 00:06:24.466
Or, you would say that this
bond is trading at a premium,

00:06:25.034 --> 00:06:27.199
a premium to par.

00:06:30.566 --> 00:06:32.033
So at least in the gut sense,

00:06:32.033 --> 00:06:33.702
when interest rates went up,

00:06:33.702 --> 00:06:36.243
people expect more from the bond.

00:06:36.243 --> 00:06:37.633
This bond isn't giving more,

00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:39.502
so the price will go down.

00:06:39.502 --> 00:06:41.633
Likewise, if interest rates go down,

00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:43.766
this bond is getting
more than what people's

00:06:43.766 --> 00:06:45.100
expectations are,

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.702
so people are willing to
pay more for that bond.

00:06:47.702 --> 00:06:49.302
Now let's actually do it with an actual,

00:06:49.302 --> 00:06:50.367
let's actually do the math

00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:51.768
to figure out the actual price

00:06:51.768 --> 00:06:52.833
that someone,

00:06:52.833 --> 00:06:55.568
a rational person would be
willing to pay for a bond

00:06:55.568 --> 00:06:57.714
given what happens to interest rates.

00:06:57.714 --> 00:06:58.567
And to do this,

00:06:58.567 --> 00:07:00.567
I'm going to do what's
called a zero-coupon bond.

00:07:00.567 --> 00:07:02.711
I'm going to show you zero-coupon bond.

00:07:02.711 --> 00:07:04.166
Actually, the math is much simpler on this

00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:05.033
because you don't have to do it

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:06.633
for all of the different coupons.

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:08.103
You just have to look
at the final payment.

00:07:08.103 --> 00:07:09.633
So a zero-coupon bond

00:07:09.633 --> 00:07:14.833
is literally a bond
that just agrees to pay

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:17.233
the holder of the bond

00:07:17.233 --> 00:07:18.301
the face value,

00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:19.833
so let's say the face value,

00:07:19.833 --> 00:07:24.366
the par value is $1,000
two years from today,

00:07:24.366 --> 00:07:29.166
two years from today.

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:30.300
There is no coupon.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.578
So if I were to draw a payout diagram,

00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:34.638
it would just look like this.

00:07:35.344 --> 00:07:36.233
This is today.

00:07:36.233 --> 00:07:37.050
This is one year.

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:37.900
This is two years.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:42.200
You just get $1,000.

00:07:42.366 --> 00:07:45.166
Now let's say on day one,

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:47.302
interest rates for a
company like company A,

00:07:47.302 --> 00:07:49.506
this is company A's bonds,

00:07:49.506 --> 00:07:52.533
so this is starting off, so day one,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.669
day one.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:57.900
Let's say people's expectations
for this type of bond

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:04.933
is they want 10% per year interest.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.768
So given that, how much
would they be willing to pay

00:08:08.768 --> 00:08:10.768
for something that's
going to pay them back

00:08:10.768 --> 00:08:13.700
$1,000 in two years?

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.909
The way to think about
it is let's P in this ...

00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:17.433
I'm going to do a little bit of math now,

00:08:17.433 --> 00:08:19.946
but hopefully it won't be too bad.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:21.700
Let's say P is the price

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.070
that someone is willing to pay for a bond.

00:08:24.233 --> 00:08:25.566
So whatever price that is,

00:08:25.566 --> 00:08:28.634
if you compound it by 10% for two years,

00:08:28.634 --> 00:08:31.167
so I do 1.10,

00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:32.500
that's one plus 10%,

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.700
so after one year,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.966
if I compound it by 10%,

00:08:34.966 --> 00:08:36.500
it will be P times this,

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.100
and then after another year,

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.933
I'll multiply it by 1.10 again.

00:08:40.966 --> 00:08:44.967
This, essentially, is how much
I should get after two years

00:08:44.967 --> 00:08:48.033
if I'm getting 10% on my initial payment

00:08:48.033 --> 00:08:50.518
or the initial amount that
I'm paying for my bond.

00:08:50.518 --> 00:08:52.467
This should be equal to,

00:08:52.835 --> 00:08:56.000
this should be equal to the $1,000.

00:08:56.166 --> 00:08:58.333
Let me just be very clear here.

00:08:58.633 --> 00:09:02.566
P is what someone who expects 10% per year

00:09:02.566 --> 00:09:03.700
for this type of risk

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.166
would be willing to pay for this bond.

00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:09.766
So when you compound their
payment by 10% for two years,

00:09:09.766 --> 00:09:12.200
that should be equal to $1,000.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.000
If you do the math here, you get

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:21.766
P times 1.1 squared is equal to 1,000,

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:27.712
or P is equal to 1,000
divided by 1.1 squared.

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:29.433
Another way to think about it is

00:09:29.433 --> 00:09:32.033
the price that someone
would be willing to pay

00:09:32.033 --> 00:09:34.367
if they expect a 10% return

00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:38.167
is the present value
of $1,000 in two years

00:09:38.167 --> 00:09:40.233
discounted by 10%.

00:09:40.233 --> 00:09:43.700
This is 1.10, or one plus 10%.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.333
So what is this number right here?

00:09:46.633 --> 00:09:48.268
Let's get a calculator out.

00:09:49.373 --> 00:09:51.200
Let's get the calculator out.

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:59.268
If we have 1,000 divided by 1.1 squared,

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:03.100
that's equal to $826 and ...

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.233
well, I'll just round down,

00:10:04.233 --> 00:10:06.200
$826.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.466
So this is $826.

00:10:10.767 --> 00:10:14.366
So if you were to pay
$826 today for this bond

00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:16.166
and in two years, that company

00:10:16.166 --> 00:10:18.500
would give you back $1,000,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.966
you will have essentially have gotten

00:10:19.966 --> 00:10:24.734
a 10% annual compounded
interest rate on your money.

00:10:25.033 --> 00:10:27.766
Now, what happens if the
interest rate goes up,

00:10:27.766 --> 00:10:29.600
let's say, the very next day?

00:10:30.366 --> 00:10:32.033
And I'm not going to be very specific.

00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:34.367
I'm going to assume it's
always two years out.

00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:35.901
It's one day less, but
that's not going to change

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.500
the math dramatically.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.033
Let's say it's the very next second

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:40.771
that interest rates were to go up.

00:10:40.771 --> 00:10:43.066
Let's say second one,

00:10:43.169 --> 00:10:45.166
so it doesn't affect our
math in any dramatic way.

00:10:45.166 --> 00:10:47.610
Let's say interest rates go up.

00:10:47.634 --> 00:10:49.267
So now all of a sudden,

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.099
so interest, people expect more.

00:10:52.099 --> 00:10:53.301
Interest goes up.

00:10:53.301 --> 00:10:57.300
The new expectation is
to have a 15% return

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.435
on a loan to a company like company A,

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:03.834
so now what's the price
we're willing to pay?

00:11:03.834 --> 00:11:05.734
We'll use the same formula.

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:10.767
The price is going to be
equal to $1,000 divided by,

00:11:10.767 --> 00:11:12.766
instead of discounting it by 10%,

00:11:12.766 --> 00:11:15.233
we're going to discount
it by 15% over two years,

00:11:15.233 --> 00:11:20.933
so one plus 15% compounded over two years.

00:11:21.702 --> 00:11:23.266
We bring out the calculator.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.368
We bring out the calculator,
and I think you have a sense

00:11:26.368 --> 00:11:28.669
we have a larger number
now in the denominator,

00:11:28.669 --> 00:11:29.966
so the price is going to go down.

00:11:29.966 --> 00:11:31.500
Let's actually calculate the math.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:38.966
$1,000 divided by 1.15 squared

00:11:38.966 --> 00:11:42.700
is equal to $756, give
or take a little bit.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.838
So now, the price has gone down.

00:11:45.838 --> 00:11:49.264
The price is now $756.

00:11:49.264 --> 00:11:50.833
This is how much someone is willing to pay

00:11:50.833 --> 00:11:53.033
in order for them to get a 15% return

00:11:53.033 --> 00:11:55.033
and get $1,000 in two years,

00:11:55.033 --> 00:11:56.767
or get $1,000 in two years and essentially

00:11:56.767 --> 00:11:59.801
for it to be a 15% return.

00:11:59.966 --> 00:12:02.048
Now, just to finish up the argument,

00:12:02.048 --> 00:12:04.933
what happens if interest rates go down?

00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:06.867
Let's say interest,

00:12:08.033 --> 00:12:11.900
the expected interest rate on
this type of risk goes down,

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.100
and let's say it's now 5%.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.933
What is someone willing to
pay for this zero-coupon bond?

00:12:18.166 --> 00:12:23.433
The price is, if you compound
it two years by 1.05,

00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:24.500
that should be equal to 1,000,

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.653
or the price is equal to 1,000

00:12:26.653 --> 00:12:31.933
divided by two years of compounding at 5%.

00:12:31.969 --> 00:12:34.068
You get the calculator out again.

00:12:34.367 --> 00:12:41.966
We get $1,000 divided by 1.05 squared

00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:44.966
is equal to $907.

00:12:44.966 --> 00:12:47.434
So all of a sudden, we're willing to pay,

00:12:47.649 --> 00:12:51.114
price is now $907.

00:12:51.114 --> 00:12:54.367
You see mathematically when
interest rates went up,

00:12:54.367 --> 00:12:58.701
the price of the bond
went from $826 to $756.

00:12:58.701 --> 00:13:01.033
The price went down.

00:13:01.033 --> 00:13:03.166
When interest rates went down,

00:13:03.166 --> 00:13:05.233
the price went up.

00:13:05.233 --> 00:13:06.433
I think it makes sense.

00:13:06.433 --> 00:13:07.766
The more you expect,

00:13:07.766 --> 00:13:09.500
the higher return you expect,

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.233
the less you're willing
to pay for that bond.

00:13:12.233 --> 00:13:14.600
Anyway, hopefully you found that helpful.
