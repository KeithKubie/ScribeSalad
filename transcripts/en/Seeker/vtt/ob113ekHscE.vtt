00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.580
Yes, apps like Tinder have changed the way
we hook up, but Craigslist?

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:16.129
I go on there to get a new lawnmower not to
get lawnmowed… you know what I mean?

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.300
Okay people, this online dating thing is getting
out of control.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.199
We've got apps for everything and now people
are taking to Craigslist to hook up too.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.769
Don't you start thinking this is beyond the
purview of science…

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.189
Science LOVES to study sex and trends.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.250
Who doesn't?

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.320
Researchers from University of Minnesota wondered
if Craigslist has changed sexual behavior

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.790
in the United States, and according to their
results, reported HIV cases increased 15.9

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.890
percent after they broke on the scene.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.480
That's new 6,000 HIV cases in the States every
year…

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.519
This is especially heavy considering the non-news
of New Yorkers flocking to Craigslist looking

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.429
to get boo-ed up during the recent snowstorms.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:55.359
Wear condoms, everybody.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.030
Social media facilitating sexy-fun-time isn't
exactly surprising news.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.030
Another study published in the journal Sexually
Transmitted Infections looked at Los Angeleno

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.549
men who used social apps like Grindr to find
a hookup; versus those who met in-person or

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.090
in a combination of in-person and a website.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.509
Those using an app for a hookup were 25 percent
more likely to be infected with gonorrhea,

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.840
and 37 percent more likely to get chlamydia!

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.410
Side note: in 2011, the CDC said though syphilis
infection is decreasing in straight men and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.440
women, it’s on the rise with gay men -- though
they don't speculate as to its connection

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.310
with social apps; it's possible!

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.140
In the era of on-demand internet sex education
and the universal availability of condoms

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.340
it's pretty surprising that curable bacterial
infections are on the rise.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.500
The internet is obviously changing how we
meet partners, but the news isn't all bad.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.259
A 2009 study looked at using the internet
to find an escort or prostitute… also something

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.579
people use Craigslist for… and when they
surveyed these online sex workers they found

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:02.070
workers who "solicit online engage in lower
risk behavior than street-based workers."

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.470
In Boston, healthcare officials are working
on apps for the youths to facilitate sexual

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.300
education, and a study from UCLA and USC found
that most people on Grindr used the internet

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.190
to look for safe-sex information!

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.310
Social media and apps can be a force for education.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.440
A 2013 study of Latino and African-American
men found participants who used a private

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.110
HIV prevention Facebook group were 11 times
more likely to request a testing kit than

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.000
those in a public health group, and even the
researchers from the Craigslist study, which

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.890
prompted us to do this story, say "Health
care practitioners and policymakers have to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.910
look more closely at online platforms to assess
how its usage may facilitate the spread of

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.540
HIV and STDs across the country."

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.760
Safe sex is important regardless of HOW you
meet your partner.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.250
If you're looking for info on safe sex you
can always ask us on DNews, or go check out

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.630
my friend Laci Green's channel.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.500
She's fantastically fantastic.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.500
What do you think?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.930
Do you feel like Tinder and Grindr and online
hook-up apps are making it gross out there?

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.080
Or better?
