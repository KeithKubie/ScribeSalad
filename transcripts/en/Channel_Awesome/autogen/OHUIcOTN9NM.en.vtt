00:10:22.329 --> 00:10:22.339 align:start position:0%
say we'll make it you know it's he had a
 

00:10:22.339 --> 00:10:24.910 align:start position:0%
say we'll make it you know it's he had a
plan<00:10:22.670><c> so</c><00:10:23.389><c> I</c><00:10:23.660><c> like</c><00:10:23.990><c> that</c><00:10:24.259><c> I</c><00:10:24.290><c> mean</c><00:10:24.560><c> that's</c><00:10:24.680><c> a</c><00:10:24.889><c> very</c>

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
plan so I like that I mean that's a very
 

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.379 align:start position:0%
plan so I like that I mean that's a very
minor<00:10:25.339><c> thing</c><00:10:25.519><c> but</c><00:10:25.759><c> I</c><00:10:25.939><c> thought</c><00:10:26.149><c> that</c><00:10:26.269><c> was</c>

00:10:26.379 --> 00:10:26.389 align:start position:0%
minor thing but I thought that was
 

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:27.009 align:start position:0%
minor thing but I thought that was
pretty<00:10:26.540><c> cool</c>

00:10:27.009 --> 00:10:27.019 align:start position:0%
pretty cool
 

00:10:27.019 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
pretty cool
um<00:10:27.639><c> but</c><00:10:28.639><c> aside</c><00:10:28.850><c> from</c><00:10:28.910><c> that</c><00:10:29.209><c> yeah</c><00:10:29.449><c> I</c><00:10:29.480><c> thought</c>

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:29.930 align:start position:0%
um but aside from that yeah I thought
 

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
um but aside from that yeah I thought
this<00:10:30.110><c> was</c><00:10:30.259><c> like</c><00:10:30.290><c> a</c><00:10:30.410><c> really</c><00:10:30.800><c> weak</c><00:10:31.220><c> episode</c><00:10:31.850><c> um</c>

00:10:32.079 --> 00:10:32.089 align:start position:0%
this was like a really weak episode um
 

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:34.179 align:start position:0%
this was like a really weak episode um
it<00:10:32.839><c> had</c><00:10:32.990><c> a</c><00:10:33.019><c> good</c><00:10:33.199><c> climax</c><00:10:33.709><c> I</c><00:10:33.829><c> liked</c><00:10:34.009><c> that</c><00:10:34.040><c> little</c>

00:10:34.179 --> 00:10:34.189 align:start position:0%
it had a good climax I liked that little
 

00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:36.370 align:start position:0%
it had a good climax I liked that little
thing<00:10:34.699><c> in</c><00:10:35.360><c> the</c><00:10:35.509><c> middle</c><00:10:35.750><c> there</c><00:10:35.930><c> and</c><00:10:35.959><c> I</c><00:10:36.110><c> like</c><00:10:36.259><c> my</c>

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:36.380 align:start position:0%
thing in the middle there and I like my
 

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.759 align:start position:0%
thing in the middle there and I like my
the<00:10:36.439><c> father's</c><00:10:36.889><c> alive</c><00:10:37.220><c> um</c><00:10:37.569><c> and</c><00:10:38.569><c> the</c><00:10:39.319><c> Bounty</c>
