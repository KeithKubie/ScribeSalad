00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.600
Okay, here's what I do. Since the constructors are pretty similar, I'm going to

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.425
copy and paste. Now I can keep these statements because I still want to

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:15.060
initialize the miles driven as the gas in tank is 0. And I still want the miles

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.400
per gallon to be the parameter that was passed in. But over here, I don't want

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.450
this fixed picture. Instead, I want this one, and that's the answer. Now I can

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.620
construct a current two ways. I can specify the fuel efficiency and get the

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.350
default picture. Or I can specify both the fuel efficiency and the name of a

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.560
picture file, and then the second constructor is chosen.
