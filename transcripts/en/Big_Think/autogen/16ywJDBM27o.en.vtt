I'm a big fan I have a question about

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760
I'm a big fan I have a question about
 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.720
I'm a big fan I have a question about
climate change if the photons from the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730
climate change if the photons from the
 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.230
climate change if the photons from the
Sun are are trapped in our atmosphere by

Sun are are trapped in our atmosphere by
 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.200
Sun are are trapped in our atmosphere by
our greenhouse gases then how come those

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
our greenhouse gases then how come those
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.210
our greenhouse gases then how come those
same greenhouse gases don't block

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220
same greenhouse gases don't block
 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.310

the most important idea of right now in
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.850
the most important idea of right now in
climate science when you say photons

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860
climate science when you say photons
 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.619

from the Sun come in through the
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.470
from the Sun come in through the
atmosphere that's absolutely true and

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
atmosphere that's absolutely true and
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.650
atmosphere that's absolutely true and
they go out to the atmosphere but not

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660
they go out to the atmosphere but not
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.270
they go out to the atmosphere but not
all of them get out at the same energy

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280
all of them get out at the same energy
 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.729
all of them get out at the same energy
now here's here's the strange thing

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739
now here's here's the strange thing
 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.790
now here's here's the strange thing
about light and electromagnetism now

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
about light and electromagnetism now
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.590

bear in mind we are humans trying to
 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.840
bear in mind we are humans trying to
understand nature and if we can't get

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850
understand nature and if we can't get
 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.660
understand nature and if we can't get
our heads around this it's our problem

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670
our heads around this it's our problem
 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.780
our heads around this it's our problem
but basically if you do experiments on

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
but basically if you do experiments on
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.240
but basically if you do experiments on
waves of light or electricity

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.010
of light or electromagnetism you will
find particles you can either detect

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
find particles you can either detect
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.490
find particles you can either detect
particles or waves so both of these

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500
