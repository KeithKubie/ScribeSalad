00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:03.339
Man 1: The second paragraph
of the declaration

00:00:03.339 --> 00:00:08.686
is one of the most amazing
set of phrases ever written.

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:12.686
It is the creed of what
makes America and now,

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:14.537
what makes the aspirations of many people

00:00:14.537 --> 00:00:15.736
around the world.

00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:17.404
Let's just read that first sentence

00:00:17.404 --> 00:00:20.768
of the second paragraph,
which is just awesome.

00:00:20.768 --> 00:00:23.805
It's, "We hold these
truths to be self-evident

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:26.601
"that all men are created
equal, that they are endowed

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:30.471
"by their Creator with
certain unalienable Rights,

00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:34.349
"that among these are Life,
Liberty, and the pursuit

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:36.267
"of Happiness."

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:38.805
Man 2: "All men are created
equal, that they are endowed

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.603
"by their Creator with
certain unalienable Rights,

00:00:42.603 --> 00:00:45.685
that among these are Life,
Liberty, and the pursuit

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:46.870
"of Happiness."

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.601
Let's start even with the word "we".

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:49.518
Who's "we"?

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:55.736
"We", it says, is the American
colonies, now gathering

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:59.405
as the United States of
America, but they're basically

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:01.473
white males.

00:01:01.473 --> 00:01:04.268
Everybody at that
convention is a white male,

00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:06.337
most of them landowners.

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:09.603
So, what the arc of American history shows

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:14.245
is that word "we" begins,
over the course of decades

00:01:14.245 --> 00:01:17.869
and then centuries, to
include more and more people.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.162
Eventually, it includes freed slaves,

00:01:20.162 --> 00:01:23.337
eventually it includes
women, but that's a narrative

00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:26.936
of American history, is who are we

00:01:26.936 --> 00:01:28.805
that have these truths as self-evident,

00:01:28.805 --> 00:01:30.605
that we're all equal?

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:34.670
Now, it's also interesting,
the phrase "self-evident".

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.203
This is something that
comes from the rationality

00:01:41.203 --> 00:01:43.746
of the scientific era we were in.

00:01:43.746 --> 00:01:47.273
This is an age right after
Isaac Newton has made

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.495
everything in the universe rational

00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:52.871
through scientific laws
and it also comes from some

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:55.605
of the philosophers,
especially David Hume,

00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:59.002
that there are just certain
things that are self-evident.

00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.671
That's an important concept,
that they're not appealing

00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:05.081
to anybody else to say,
"What are these truths?"

00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:08.001
They're saying, "This is
just our rationality tells us

00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:11.495
"this is true," but then they say,

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:14.745
"all men are created equal."

00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:16.244
Now, they say men.

00:02:16.244 --> 00:02:19.579
Back then, men was supposed to be a phrase

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.736
that was more inclusive than just males.

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:22.870
Man 2: For man.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.271
Man 1: Right, it's like
mankind, to some extent,

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:31.880
but then again, at least
Jefferson, he owned slaves.

00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:36.744
Women, they weren't necessarily
given the right to vote.

00:02:36.744 --> 00:02:40.163
Even though they mean
"man" sort of like mankind,

00:02:40.163 --> 00:02:43.829
they also really generally
mean men, at this point.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.745
Once again, this is where the
American narrative starts.

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:50.900
Fortunately, that phrase
gets expanded over time

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.318
as to what they mean.

00:02:52.318 --> 00:02:53.900
Man 2: Right.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.984
Man 1: Look at the phrase "created equal".

00:02:55.984 --> 00:02:57.818
What does that really mean?

00:02:57.818 --> 00:03:00.849
First of all, it doesn't mean
that people are always equal.

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.715
At a certain point in life,
Jefferson owns a whole lot

00:03:03.715 --> 00:03:06.819
of property and Franklin
is quite rich as a printer

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.319
and different people have
different statuses in life,

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.382
but they're saying that in a
fundamental, political way,

00:03:16.382 --> 00:03:19.850
we all start off created equal.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.052
We have certain rights that
you just can't take away

00:03:22.052 --> 00:03:24.901
from us whether we're
rich or poor or whatever.

00:03:24.901 --> 00:03:26.651
Those unalienable rights
are Life, Liberty,

00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.286
and the pursuit of Happiness.

00:03:29.286 --> 00:03:31.130
Man 2: I'm guessing it's
also a ding at the King,

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.366
because royalty ...

00:03:34.662 --> 00:03:36.932
One underlying assumption
is that it's inherited

00:03:36.932 --> 00:03:40.532
and that you are created better off.

00:03:40.532 --> 00:03:42.865
Man 1: Right and Thomas Paine,

00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:47.916
who is a pamphleteer, has
just written this document

00:03:47.916 --> 00:03:51.579
Common Sense and that's
helped inspire everybody.

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.803
At the heart of the document Common Sense

00:03:54.803 --> 00:03:57.731
is that there's no divine right of kings.

00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:59.745
Divine right of kings
was a British concept,

00:03:59.745 --> 00:04:02.933
which meant God made
certain people more equal

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:08.493
or better than others, and
the king, by divine right,

00:04:08.493 --> 00:04:12.662
had these powers and we're
saying, "No, the kings don't

00:04:12.662 --> 00:04:13.830
"have any more powers."

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.799
Ben Franklin was very much of that way,

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.598
which was he hated the
notion of aristocracy,

00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:20.661
that some people were
born noble and some people

00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:23.662
were born aristocratic and
some people were born royal

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:27.077
and whatever, but think
about it for a moment.

00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:29.870
What was Thomas Jefferson thinking?

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.831
A guy who owns a lot of
slaves, what was he thinking

00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:35.197
when he writes this amazing phrase,

00:04:35.197 --> 00:04:37.898
"all men are created equal"?

00:04:38.267 --> 00:04:40.161
I think he was very conflicted.

00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:43.267
Here's a guy who did
not end up even freeing

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:48.162
most of his slaves in his
lifetime and yet, he could write

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:50.131
these inspiring words.

00:04:50.131 --> 00:04:53.661
If you read about
Jefferson, you know that was

00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:57.245
the fundamental conflict
and it's a conflict that we,

00:04:57.245 --> 00:05:00.386
as a nation, have been wrestling with.

00:05:00.386 --> 00:05:03.386
Man 2: As a slaveowner, he
also knew them very well.

00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:05.186
He knew them as human beings, perhaps.

00:05:05.186 --> 00:05:07.316
Man 1: Right, well he fathered children

00:05:07.316 --> 00:05:09.018
with one of the slaves.

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:12.102
Ben Franklin is interesting,
because early on in life,

00:05:12.102 --> 00:05:14.451
he had two household slaves,
who he didn't really treat

00:05:14.451 --> 00:05:17.119
as slaves, but they were
his household servants

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:20.352
and he had allowed the
advertising of slavery

00:05:20.352 --> 00:05:22.652
in the Pennsylvania Gazette, the newspaper

00:05:22.652 --> 00:05:27.268
that he published, but he
realized, after he writes

00:05:27.268 --> 00:05:30.922
these words, "created equal",
he realizes how abhorrent

00:05:30.922 --> 00:05:33.383
that is, to his own notions,

00:05:33.383 --> 00:05:34.987
that people are created equal.

00:05:34.987 --> 00:05:37.453
Of course, he's by then, freed his slaves,

00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:40.936
but becomes a president of
the Society for the Abolition

00:05:40.936 --> 00:05:43.936
of Slavery in Pennsylvania,
as a way of trying

00:05:43.936 --> 00:05:47.453
to make up for the fact that he'd erred,

00:05:47.453 --> 00:05:51.319
he had been wrong when he was young,

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:55.321
to tolerate the institution
of slavery and he becomes

00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:56.436
an abolitionist.

00:05:56.436 --> 00:05:59.186
Of course, John Adams,
from the very beginning,

00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:00.385
was an abolitionist.

00:06:00.385 --> 00:06:02.119
Man 2: This is important
for people to realize.

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:04.453
When you take an American history class,

00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:07.250
it seems like obviously
everything comes to a head

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.417
leading up the Civil War,
but this was already starting

00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:11.988
to become an issue, a moral issue,

00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:13.921
a philosophical issue,
even at the founding

00:06:13.921 --> 00:06:14.787
of the country.

00:06:14.787 --> 00:06:16.083
Man 1: And a political issue, as well,

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:19.255
because if you want Jefferson
and you want Virginia in,

00:06:19.255 --> 00:06:21.415
the reason John Adams ...

00:06:21.415 --> 00:06:23.522
He was a great abolitionist,
but there were no plantations.

00:06:23.522 --> 00:06:26.162
There was no cotton being
grown in Massachusetts,

00:06:26.162 --> 00:06:31.121
but if you were a cotton
farmer or a plantation owner

00:06:31.121 --> 00:06:35.003
in Virginia, you tended to
own slaves and it becomes

00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:39.076
a great political issue
where the slaveholding states

00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:41.186
have to be brought into this union.

00:06:41.186 --> 00:06:45.433
We see that conflict when
the constitution is written

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.596
11 years later.

00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:51.931
They're still having this
conflict on what do we do

00:06:51.931 --> 00:06:52.938
about slavery?

00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:54.069
Man 2: Yeah and it will continue

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:57.146
for another 70-something years.

00:06:57.146 --> 00:06:58.005
Man 1: Yeah, if you want to say

00:06:58.005 --> 00:07:00.231
that it was totally
resolved by the Civil War

00:07:00.231 --> 00:07:02.404
and there will be some who will say that

00:07:02.404 --> 00:07:04.938
that was the original stain on

00:07:04.938 --> 00:07:07.562
this unbelievably beautiful phrase,

00:07:07.562 --> 00:07:10.403
which is that "all men are created equal."

00:07:10.403 --> 00:07:12.862
Man 2: Yeah, very cool.
