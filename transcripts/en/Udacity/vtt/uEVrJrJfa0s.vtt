00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.560
So there was this guy named Hu,
and he created a set of moments.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.020
And what was really cool about
the moments that he created,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.630
is that they were rotation,
translation, and scale invariant.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.180
And you'll see I, I put scale in green
here, because for what we're about to do

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.100
the translation part is taking
account by just using central moments.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.990
We don't really need rotation and
variant that much,

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.420
because people don't tend to do
their aerobics at 45 degree angle.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.470
But we do get scale differences, right?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.210
If things are closer to the image,
or, or closer to camera or

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.770
farther from the camera,
things get bigger or smaller.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.010
So we want to create some
descriptors that are invariant, and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.880
Hu moments are, are of that type.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.060
And we're going to use 7 of them, and
that's what these 7 Hu moments are.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.730
And I'm going to show you
the equations for them.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.670
You would never write these down.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.160
You would go get an implementation
of them because otherwise,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.210
you'll make a mistake et cetera.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.950
But, but here they are, okay?

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.899
And in fact, they're so ugly that
they don't even all fit on one page,

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.445
so you see it says this is h1,
and that's mu20,

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:11.923
remember mu are the central moments,
okay, plus mu02.

00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:18.470
And then they continue, h6,
and then h7 is even more ugly.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.890
There they are, they're just that
sort of that complicated ugly thing.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.060
All you need to know is we now have
a translation, and rotation, and

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.150
scale invariant system.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.450
So the details of what the,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.490
the features do are not that important
except that they behave the way we want

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.100
them to behave under particular
types of transformations.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.070
What matters is, I'm going to compute
these features on both the MEI and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.220
MHI, so the binary version and
the grayscale version, and

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.380
that's going to give
me a feature vector.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.190
And given a feature vector,
I can build classifiers.
