00:00:00.561 --> 00:00:03.874
- What we're going to do
in this video is talk about

00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:05.874
the incumbent advantage.

00:00:06.844 --> 00:00:09.043
And, this is the idea
that the person who is

00:00:09.043 --> 00:00:11.411
already in power, the incumbent,

00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.598
has an advantage in elections.

00:00:13.598 --> 00:00:15.589
And, in particular,
we're going to focus on

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.113
Presidential elections,
although this idea is pretty

00:00:19.113 --> 00:00:22.271
common across different offices.

00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:25.079
Now, it turns out that if
you go back over, roughly,

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:28.621
the last 100 years, in
Presidential elections that had

00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:31.682
and incumbent, that had a
sitting President running

00:00:31.682 --> 00:00:34.895
for a second term or maybe
a third, or a forth term

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:39.603
in the case of FDR, you have
more than 80% of the time,

00:00:39.603 --> 00:00:42.267
it goes to the incumbent.

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:44.016
And this right over
here is a picture of the

00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:48.020
Presidential Debates from
C-SPAN and this in 2012

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.141
between President Barack
Obama and Mitt Romney.

00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:53.952
And President Obama, of
course, was the incumbent

00:00:53.952 --> 00:00:55.803
and he went on to win.

00:00:55.803 --> 00:01:00.045
And, once again, not unusual,
this happened 80% of the time.

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:03.424
The last time that a challenger
was able to unseat an

00:01:03.424 --> 00:01:08.174
incumbent was in 1992 when
you have President Clinton was

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:13.550
able to beat President George H. W. Bush,

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.286
George W. Bush's father.

00:01:15.286 --> 00:01:18.619
George H. W. Bush and the time before ...

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.818
and this is 26 years ago,
26 years before the time

00:01:21.818 --> 00:01:23.654
of the making of this video.

00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:26.544
And, to go even before that,
the last time before 1992

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:30.791
would have been 1980, when
Reagan is able to beat Carter.

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.756
So, this is a very unusual
thing for a challenger

00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:35.913
to be able to beat an incumbent.

00:01:35.913 --> 00:01:37.670
Now one thing that I would like you to do

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.972
is pause this video.

00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:43.972
Think about why incumbents
might have such an advantage.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.553
Okay, so there's many
scholarly papers written about

00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:50.184
the idea of the incumbent
advantage, both at the

00:01:50.184 --> 00:01:52.449
Presidential level and at other levels.

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:55.192
But we can come up with
some ideas as to why

00:01:55.192 --> 00:01:57.288
the incumbent has the advantage.

00:01:57.288 --> 00:02:00.893
One is people already imagine
that individual as President

00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:03.642
because they are the President.

00:02:03.642 --> 00:02:07.307
On top of that, because
they are already President,

00:02:07.307 --> 00:02:10.689
they've had many years of being
in the national spotlight.

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.729
And even during the
Presidential campaign, they are

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.373
still the President and so
they have that bully pulpit

00:02:15.373 --> 00:02:19.153
that President Roosevelt,
Theodore Roosevelt talked about.

00:02:19.153 --> 00:02:23.016
Bully pulpit, where they
can get people's attention

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:24.554
when they want to.

00:02:24.554 --> 00:02:26.763
Even though the challenger
might be well-funded, and

00:02:26.763 --> 00:02:28.493
the press is definitely
going to pay attention to the

00:02:28.493 --> 00:02:30.311
challenger and give them a lot of voice.

00:02:30.311 --> 00:02:33.601
Because the President is
the President, they have the

00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:36.390
State of the Union Address,
they can call Special Sessions

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.125
of Congress, they have
regular press briefings,

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:43.231
and so they have a much
larger voice even compared to

00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:45.564
a very prominent challenger.

00:02:46.517 --> 00:02:50.192
On top of that, there might
be some notion of experience

00:02:50.192 --> 00:02:53.223
and this idea of experience
can go in many directions.

00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:56.630
No matter which candidate
has more life experience,

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.014
which one is older, one could
argue that no one has ever

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.647
really ever been the President

00:03:02.647 --> 00:03:04.330
unless they are the President.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.599
And, so someone who has been
in that job for four years

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.345
has been able to build
some experiences that maybe

00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:13.095
they'll be able to build
on for their second term.

00:03:13.095 --> 00:03:15.219
While, the other person might have to,

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:17.124
no matter what they've done
in the rest of their life,

00:03:17.124 --> 00:03:20.154
being the President is
fairly new experience.

00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:23.661
The other idea is that they
are experienced campaigners.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.287
That they have already run
a successful Presidential

00:03:26.287 --> 00:03:29.825
campaign and this is
their second time around,

00:03:29.825 --> 00:03:32.647
which could help in winning that campaign.

00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:34.867
Another idea that might
help an incumbent...

00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:37.297
and once again, this is
me thinking about it,

00:03:37.297 --> 00:03:38.921
I encourage you to think
about it and see if you

00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:40.796
buy these or could come up with others...

00:03:40.796 --> 00:03:43.833
is maybe there is a sense of patriotism.

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:46.558
That people are used to
thinking of the incumbent as

00:03:46.558 --> 00:03:48.954
their President for the last several years

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:51.883
and so they feel some
sense of loyalty to them.

00:03:51.883 --> 00:03:54.248
This could even be
supercharged if maybe it's in

00:03:54.248 --> 00:03:57.734
wartime or if the country
is facing some type of

00:03:57.734 --> 00:04:00.371
foreign policy crisis that
they want to stand behind

00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:03.249
the person during that time of crisis.

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:04.555
They don't want to change
who is in charge in

00:04:04.555 --> 00:04:07.362
the middle of a war or
something like that.

00:04:07.362 --> 00:04:08.940
So, I will leave you there.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.723
These are just some ideas
why we see this phenomenon

00:04:12.723 --> 00:04:14.949
of an incumbent advantage.

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.364
I encourage you to think
about why this is happening.
