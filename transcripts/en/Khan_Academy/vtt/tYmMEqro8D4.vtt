00:00:00.134 --> 00:00:01.780
- [Tutor] Let's see if we can

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.640
give ourselves an intuitive understanding

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.340
of why the current account balance

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.320
and the capital account balance nets out

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.220
and over here I have simplified versions

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.050
of the current account
and the capital account

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.882
for the US in 2007.

00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:18.060
We'll just go line by line

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.610
and think about what this is saying

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.330
and also think about the big picture

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.670
in terms of the actual
transfer of US dollars.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.690
So first right over here
on the current account,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.271
we see that we have a balnce of trade

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.730
or we have a trade
deficit right over here,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.540
the US is importing much
more than it is exporting

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.857
and so for net basis, you're
importing a bunch of stuff,

00:00:37.857 --> 00:00:41.170
you have to pay the foreigners
for the stuff you imported

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.680
and so you have an outflow of funds

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.630
and this dominates the
current account right here,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.931
it's the great majority of
the current account balance.

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:52.240
This right over here, this 95.7 billion,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.650
this tells us that in that year, in 2007,

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.290
Americans got 95.7 billion more in income

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.540
from assets that they owned abroad

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.300
than foreigners got in income
that they had from US assets,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.370
so this was an inflow of funds,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.640
a net inflow from that income,
but then the US gave away

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.437
more than that to the rest of the world,

00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:17.380
now this could be foreign
aid from the US government

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.060
or it could just be American citizens

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.900
sending payments to their family members

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.970
in other parts of the country

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.610
or also doing some type of a donation

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.860
for some type of aid
program or whatever else,

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.680
but we see that the balance of trade

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.350
is really what's dominating.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.120
So if you really were to look

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.773
at the current account
in very rough terms,

00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:37.960
especially if you were to
focus on the balance of trade,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.890
we see what's happening
is, what's coming to the US

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.821
and so let me write over
here, this is the US

00:01:43.821 --> 00:01:46.953
and right over here let
me write, rest of world.

00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:51.270
So the US for the most part,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.720
the story that this is telling us

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.720
is that the US is getting a bunch of stuff

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.241
and then it's paying for that stuff

00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:03.250
and then also giving away
a little bit more than that

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.830
and so what the rest of
the world is getting,

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.430
the rest of the world is getting

00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:13.510
is net 710.8 billion in US currency,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.520
so 710.8 billion

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.564
times so in US currency.

00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:24.540
But we know that that's
not the entire picture,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.339
we also have the change
in ownership of assets

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:28.510
and so what I'm gonna do

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.150
is I'm just gonna focus
on the top two lines

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.830
of the capital account right over here,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.630
which focuses on change,
foreign purchases of US assets

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.880
and US purchases of foreign assets

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.712
and oftentimes when people
talk about the capital account,

00:02:41.712 --> 00:02:43.970
they're really just talking
about these two lines,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.820
although technically the capital account

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.160
is all three of these lines

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.484
and the way some people differentiate it,

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:51.059
this is kind of the narrow
definition of the capital account

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.000
and then the broader definition
of the capital account

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.554
would be all three of these lines.

00:02:55.554 --> 00:02:58.210
But let's just focus on these
two lines right over here,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.100
the foreign purchases of US assets

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.170
and the US purchases of foreign assets.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.281
So we see that foreigners are
buying many more US assets,

00:03:05.281 --> 00:03:06.922
than Americans are buying abroad,

00:03:06.922 --> 00:03:08.460
but we could actually net it out

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.410
and let's get our calculator to do it.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.680
So if we net it out, so
foreigners are buying

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.978
two trillion worth of US
assets, so that's an inflow,

00:03:16.978 --> 00:03:20.620
they have to pay us dollars
to buy our real estate

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.360
and our stocks and whatever else,

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.127
but then Americans are going out there

00:03:24.127 --> 00:03:25.700
and they're using those dollars

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.738
and they're converting
it to foreign currency

00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:29.060
and they're buying other
foreigners' assets as well

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.498
to the tune of about 1.3 trillion,

00:03:31.498 --> 00:03:34.357
so that's an outflow, so
let's subtract that out,

00:03:34.357 --> 00:03:37.600
1289.5,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.680
so if we just net out
these first two lines,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.279
we have 768.2 billion, so
one way you could view this,

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:48.480
if you were to net this
out, on a net basis

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.209
foreigners are buying
768.2 billion of US assets,

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.923
so let me write it this way.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.930
So foreigners are getting US assets,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.940
US assets,

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.427
and in exchange Americans,
Americans are getting,

00:04:06.427 --> 00:04:11.427
what was that, 768.2 billion of currency,

00:04:12.546 --> 00:04:14.970
now this is an interesting thing,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.420
Americans are shipping
this currency abroad

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.860
to buy mainly stuff, some
of it's a kind of giveaway,

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.870
but mainly to buy stuff, 710.8 billion,

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.980
but more than that is coming back

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.481
for foreigners buying US assets

00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:31.770
and so it leads to an
interesting question,

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.360
how is this possible?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.650
How is more coming in than going out?

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.098
And the only way that this is possible,

00:04:37.098 --> 00:04:39.770
that foreigners are able
to ship more dollars to us,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.160
than we're shipping to
the rest of the world

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.720
is if the foreigners had a
pile of currency to begin with.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.640
So if they had a pile of
currency to begin with,

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.162
so let's say that they had
this in their central bank,

00:04:52.162 --> 00:04:55.970
so they have a pile of US dollar reserves,

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.680
well, maybe we'll have time
to go into the details,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.600
but you can imagine there's a pile

00:05:00.544 --> 00:05:03.520
of dollar currency in
the rest of the world

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.950
and the only way that
they're going to be able

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.920
to ship us some more dollars
than we've shipped to them

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.633
is if they dig into their
reserves of US currency

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:13.621
and how much are they going

00:05:13.621 --> 00:05:14.989
to have to dig into the reserves?

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:16.070
Well, it's just going to be

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.340
the difference between these two,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.250
let's see how much they
have to dig into it.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.250
So we are sending, this is how
much they're shipping to us,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.320
we're shipping back to them

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.870
mainly because of the balance of trade,

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.534
but in general because of
the current account deficit,

00:05:30.534 --> 00:05:35.340
710.8 billion

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.430
and so that leaves, there's 57.4 billion

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.470
that's not accounted for by
what we're shipping to them,

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:42.450
so essentially they're going

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.330
to have to dig into their reserves

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.807
by 57.4 billion to make up the difference

00:05:47.807 --> 00:05:50.190
and that's what we have right over here,

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.800
the foreigner's reserves
are going to have to go down

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.649
by 57.4 billion, so let me
write this, this is net,

00:05:56.649 --> 00:06:00.450
let me make it clear, we could
do this as our net change,

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.920
net change in official,
and I'll write it here,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.540
foreign,

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.750
foreign, foreign reserves

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.130
and in general we view this

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.170
as the central banks of other governments,

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.085
they had some piles of dollars around

00:06:14.085 --> 00:06:16.390
and for whatever reason,
they decided to use

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.100
some of those dollars in
foreign exchange markets

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.930
mainly probably so their
own people could go out

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.000
and buy US assets or to buy US things

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.290
or transfer money in some way to the US

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.000
and also we'll go into more detail,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.280
so it doesn't affect the
exchange rates too much.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.245
But this is essentially why
these two things add up,

00:06:35.245 --> 00:06:37.820
any amount that these
two things don't add up,

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.200
any amount by which the
current account balance

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.760
and the narrow definition

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.415
of the capital account
balance do not add up,

00:06:44.415 --> 00:06:47.182
then that's going to have
to be a change in reserves,

00:06:47.182 --> 00:06:50.060
there's going to have to
be in this case more net,

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:53.600
more money US dollars
are being sent to the US,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.349
so someone's pile of US dollars

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.160
some place in the rest of the world

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.160
had to be depleted to the
effect of $57.4 billion.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.630
In future videos we'll talk a lot more

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.173
about central banks' reserves of dollars

00:07:07.173 --> 00:07:09.191
and even interesting things
about how George Soros

00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:12.683
made a lot of money by kind of
gaming that and all the rest.
