We definitely need to define 
fragment detail

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.840
in the base layout folder, 
then we override it

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.170
in the layout-land folder, 
so that we can achieve

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.266
this layout on phone 
landscape orientation.

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.222
Tablet landscape view would work fine
because of this folder,

00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:15.100
but then tablet portrait
would fall back to this layout

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.680
so we should just define it 
in the layout sw600dp folder

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.280
so that all tablet's,
regardless of orientation,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.000
use this layout.
