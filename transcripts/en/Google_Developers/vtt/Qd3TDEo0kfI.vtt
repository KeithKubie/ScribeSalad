WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Hi
I'm Wayne Piekarski

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.170
for "The Developer Show."

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.450
And this is your update on
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.010
from Google in the last week.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.680
The latest Android
Emulator release

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.740
can now run Excite 6-based
Android virtual devices

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.127
on computers that
use AMD processors.

00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:18.210
Head on over to the post
linked in the description

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.970
below for getting started
instructions and the download

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.280
link.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.390
The TensorFlow
Object Detection API

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.940
is an open-source framework
built on top of TensorFlow

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.090
that makes it easy to construct,
train, and deploy object

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.310
detection models.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.020
And we recently released
several additions to the API,

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.630
including support for
accelerated training of object

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.170
detection models via cloud TPUs,
improving the mobile deployment

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.660
process, and several new model
architecture definitions.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.890
A link to the new
tutorial is on the post.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.610
Over 130 Googlers attended the
35th International Conference

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.760
on Machine Learning last week
to present publications and host

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.870
workshops.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.150
You can learn more about
the research we presented

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.640
and download the papers
with the links on this post.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.600
Jib is an open source Java
containerizer from Google

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.640
that lets you build
containers using the Java

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.020
tools that you know.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.600
It's fast, simple, and
handles all the steps

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.050
of packaging your application
into a container image.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.490
Head on over to the post for
more details and examples

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.340
on Maven and Gradle.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.770
And the Los Angeles Google
Cloud Platform region

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.720
is now officially
open for business.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.780
You can now store data and build
highly available performant

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.584
applications in
Southern California.

00:01:27.584 --> 00:01:29.500

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.619
Thanks for watching and
we'll see you next week.

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.160
SPEAKER: I'll throw
out some emotion.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.660
Excited.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.710
Shocked.
