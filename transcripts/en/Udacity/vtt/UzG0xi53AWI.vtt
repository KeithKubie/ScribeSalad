00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:02.951
So up to this point, we've actually talked quite

00:00:02.951 --> 00:00:05.214
a bit about the non-coding regions of our genome.

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:07.592
&gt;&gt; Promoters, enhancers, and silencers are just

00:00:07.592 --> 00:00:09.390
a portion of the non-coding piece of

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.851
the pie. There's a lot of other ways that gene expression can be regulated.

00:00:12.851 --> 00:00:15.175
&gt;&gt; Exactly. There's some really cool ways, like how

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:18.894
DNA wraps around histone proteins. Remember histones are actually those

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:22.266
proteins that organize DNA into chromosomes. You can modify those

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.866
histones that, in a way that actually promotes or inhibits

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:29.664
transcription of a gene. There are also these small RNAs called micro

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:33.460
RNAs that can bind to an MRNA transcript and target it for destruction.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.020
&gt;&gt; Now if you're interested in learning more about this topic we

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.930
strongly encourage you to seek out a higher level genetics class or

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.580
do some reading on your own. But for us, I just want

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.920
you to focus on the non-coding

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.690
regions called promoters, enhancers, and silencers.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.050
&gt;&gt; And regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors.
