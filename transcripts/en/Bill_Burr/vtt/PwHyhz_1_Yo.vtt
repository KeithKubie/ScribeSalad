1
00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.190
Yeah.

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.060
<v 1>Hey,
what's going on?</v>

3
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.550
It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

4
00:00:04.551 --> 00:00:07.970
November 5th,
2018 what's going on?
How are you?

5
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.790
Oh,
that's phenomenal.
Isn't that wonderful?

6
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.430
Hey everybody,
I don't know if you've heard,

7
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.390
I don't know if you've been on a TV or near a TV.

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.600
I don't know if you stream your thoughts at this point through some sort of

9
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.080
algorithm on a worldwide network.
Um,

10
00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:34.400
I dunno if you've heard this is for Americans only by the way,

11
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.700
people from the United States of America,
everybody else,
you know,

12
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.500
if you're in Australia,

13
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.430
just go stick a beat on something and fucking eat it during this time.
All right?

14
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.610
Cause this has nothing to do with you and that giant fucking can of Foster's

15
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.440
lager,
whatever the fuck it is that none of you constrict down there.

16
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.790
It's why you stick it in a little fucking powder keg like you just trying to get

17
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.600
rid of it,
sending it our way.
Right.
Um,

18
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.820
that beer,
that's the Busch light of Australia anyways.
I've never had one.
I just,

19
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.930
I just judge it by the size of the can.
I'm like,
oh,
what's that fucking good.

20
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:15.530
Why are you giving it away by the bucketful anyways

21
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.850
for the people that this podcast truly represents.

22
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.200
And that would be the greatest people on this planet,

23
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.090
the people of the United States of America.
Um,

24
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.700
particularly the white people.
Fuck with you going on.

25
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.410
Trump on here.
Sorry,
I'm reading a Trump speech.
Um,

26
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.810
it's a first draft of a Trump speech.
Um,
evidently tomorrow,

27
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.590
and I didn't know this,
I don't know if you aware of this,

28
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:54.591
but I was not aware that tomorrow is evidently a very important day in politics.

29
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.470
Quite possibly the most important

30
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.410
political day in history.
And you know something I had no idea,

31
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:09.411
but thank God all of these celebrities have taken time out of their day to let

32
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:14.100
me know how important it is.
You know what I mean?

33
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.430
Just when you think of celebrity cannot give more of themselves on screen after

34
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:25.260
they'd been driven over in a golf cart and add their fucking hair foof to buy

35
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:29.540
some fucking poor bastard in a trailer,
right.
Food,
poof.

36
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.710
Whatever the fuck it is.
Thank God you know something.

37
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:36.711
And I've been so inspired by all of these celebrities letting me know what is

38
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:42.680
going on in my country.
You know what I mean?
Why would I listen to,
to,

39
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.470
to people who I don't know are in that business for living?

40
00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:50.730
Why would I listen to them when I can listen to somebody who's on a sitcom?

41
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.353
<v 0>MMM.</v>

42
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.950
<v 1>And you know what?
I've been so inspired.
I actually think that going to,
uh,</v>

43
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.480
I'm going to you,
oh,
look who's calling in here.
Little face time here.

44
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.230
My kiddo.
Hey Buddy.
Hi.

45
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.800
Hi.
Hey need,
I'm doing the podcast.
Oh,

46
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.780
Tom Lily recording right now.
You guys are on the podcast.

47
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:18.950
<v 2>Say Hi Dada.</v>

48
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.570
<v 1>Hi Sweetheart.
Hey.
Do you know tomorrow is a very important election day?</v>

49
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.160
<v 2>I did.
I'd be getting text messages round the clock about it.</v>

50
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.770
<v 1>I had no idea.
And then somebody,</v>

51
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.820
uh,
the third lead in a x man movie,

52
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.940
let me know that I need to get out there and vote.

53
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.150
<v 2>I got an email from an actor as well.</v>

54
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:46.620
<v 1>Yeah.
I don't know why they're doing that.</v>

55
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.780
I have a bad feeling that it's going to drive it the other way.
I was just in,

56
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.900
I was just in a a car service coming over from the airport and the guy goes,

57
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.570
I'm voting no red tomorrow.
All red.

58
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.050
All right.
I gotta get back to the podcast.
I'll see you guys later.
Bye Buddy.

59
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.110
Bye Sweetheart.
All right,
I'll see you in a minute.
Okay.

60
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.670
Um,
yeah.
Anyways,
so what I think I'm going to do,

61
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.730
I am going to loan my podcast celebrity to try and inspire some of you to get

62
00:04:21.241 --> 00:04:24.900
out there tomorrow.
Get out there and vote.

63
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.670
And when I say vote,

64
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.960
I don't mean go out and decide who you think is the right candidate.

65
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.340
I want you to go out there and vote.
Who for who?

66
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:38.890
I want you to vote for.
Okay.

67
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.170
I'm loaning my podcast celebrity and I feel like more so than that,

68
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.620
I'm actually going to be honest with you

69
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.180
as a person in your public ears rather than just being like trying to be like

70
00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.530
non,
you know,

71
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.680
criminal here and just say get out there and vote.
I want you to vote.
Who,

72
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.520
who I want you to vote for.
Okay?
I don't know who to vote for him.

73
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:11.740
Maybe.
Maybe somebody that hosts a game show could tell me.

74
00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.870
I watch CNN and Fox News all the time.
I'm informed.

75
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.650
I read the Sunday New York Times.
Shut up.

76
00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.590
Jesus.
Do these fucking people understand that there's,

77
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:33.070
there's engineers and doctors,

78
00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.360
you know I'm too stupid.
Name another smart job.
Veterinarian.

79
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.880
The guy who knows how to hook up your fucking cable.

80
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:43.060
I mean these are smart people.
They know it's an important fucking election.

81
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.110
They know who they're voting for.
All right?

82
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.700
I got a bad feeling that they're going to get this wrong the same way they got

83
00:05:51.701 --> 00:05:55.810
the election wrong.
You know,
I actually think

84
00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.210
that have celebrities wanted this blue wave.
They should shut up.

85
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.920
Cause do you know people who are on the red side are also watching this shit?

86
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.750
It's like you're broadcasting to the Japanese during World War II when you're

87
00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:17.730
going to attack.
Why would you do that?
You gotta get on your own frequency,

88
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.050
right?
Oh,

89
00:06:22.051 --> 00:06:25.470
who should I vote for?

90
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.270
Maybe 10 year ro could tell me.
Um,

91
00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.580
hey,
I liked that guy's movies.
Maybe I like his political choices.

92
00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.053
<v 0>MMM.</v>

93
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.450
<v 1>Do you remember back in the day when you just,
you know,</v>

94
00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.380
you didn't bring up politics and you didn't bring up religion and you sat there

95
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:50.360
and you eat your fucking cheese sandwich,
you know,
and you just said that was it.

96
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:57.560
Every fucking put,
you know,
you gotta get out there and vote.
And by vote,

97
00:06:57.561 --> 00:07:01.430
I mean vote who I'm gonna vote for.
Oh my God,

98
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:03.050
what is wrong with this country?

99
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.780
How come everybody doesn't see it the way I see it?

100
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:08.400
<v 0>MMM.</v>

101
00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.250
<v 1>Anyways,
having said that,
I usually vote,</v>

102
00:07:11.251 --> 00:07:14.220
but I'm going to be here in New York and I didn't file for the absentee thing,

103
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.883
<v 0>you know?</v>

104
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.330
<v 1>So whoever's not liking this should be happy that I just cancelled out my vote.</v>

105
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:23.503
<v 0>You know,</v>

106
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.660
<v 1>and one of the most important elections of all time.</v>

107
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.520
And you know why it's important because the same five corporations that have the

108
00:07:32.521 --> 00:07:36.330
money on all the horses in the race this time decided to just put it on one side

109
00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:37.380
of the ball evidently.

110
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.110
So we will move towards a more prosperous future.

111
00:07:43.111 --> 00:07:44.220
For the middle class

112
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.050
because someone's finally going to regulate the banks again.

113
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:54.540
Is that what we're voting for?
I don't know.
I have no idea.
Hey,
you know what?

114
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.740
I'm going to loan,

115
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:03.490
I'm going to loan my podcast celebrity right now and I'm going to solve the

116
00:08:04.861 --> 00:08:09.480
problems of the Middle East right now.
First thing I would do,

117
00:08:09.481 --> 00:08:11.940
I would go over there.
I would tell everybody to grow up.

118
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.513
<v 0>Okay.</v>

119
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:19.580
<v 1>As far as I can tell you all worship the same thing.
Um,
no,</v>

120
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.960
this is what I would do.
I would,
I would,
uh,

121
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.850
I would break up with Iraq as the first thing I would do.

122
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.250
I would just sit down and just say,
listen,
I wreck,

123
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.100
<v 0>I'm not happy.
Yes,</v>

124
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.500
<v 1>this isn't working out.
I know,
I know.</v>

125
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.510
I came in like gang busters.

126
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.900
I moved in within a week with this whole relationship,

127
00:08:43.901 --> 00:08:48.790
just moved way too quickly.
All right.
And I just,

128
00:08:48.791 --> 00:08:51.970
you know,
it's not that I,
I love you,

129
00:08:51.971 --> 00:08:54.820
but I don't love you in a way that makes me want to stay

130
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:01.440
and I would just get the fuck out.

131
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.130
You can keep the Starbucks and all these fucking things,
right.
All right.

132
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:13.110
Switch over to solar power.
I would do all of this on the same day.
By the way,

133
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:17.190
in my world,
you can actually do this.
Switch over to solar power.

134
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.000
Take that lunatic over a Tesla.
You know,

135
00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.050
he,
uh,
he looks like the guy,
Ian Mcshane,

136
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.690
if he had a nervous breakdown or so,
I don't know what the fuck that fucking guy,

137
00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:36.860
right.
I would just all electric all the fucking time.

138
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.713
Right?

139
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.680
I'd have a big campaign where I bring back the electric slide and everybody

140
00:09:42.681 --> 00:09:47.330
fucking enough mouth breathers would do it and they would get behind it and then

141
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.530
we're not no more money to the Middle East.
All right.
For Oil.

142
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:53.810
Then they'd all go bankrupt and the second we leave,

143
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.780
they go back to kicking the shit out of each other.
You know what I mean?

144
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.560
The same way,
when Russia left Eastern Europe,

145
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:04.040
everybody was happy for about three days and then they all started killing each

146
00:10:04.041 --> 00:10:07.100
other again.
They were like,
oh yeah,
where,
where are we?
That's right.

147
00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.910
God said we're better.
Right?
They just went right back to that shit.

148
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:13.070
See you leave.
Yeah,

149
00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.130
you got look fucking solar power and all that fucking shit going on.

150
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:18.830
I don't know if he knows about the Middle East.

151
00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:23.660
Middle East always reminded me of,
there was used to be this store in the uh,

152
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.990
south shore plaza that I used to go to before they did the remodel.

153
00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.110
You know,
when it was all brown and seventies looking,
I swear to God,

154
00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:36.860
I think the floor was made out of vinyl,
some sort of rubber.

155
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.440
Anyways,

156
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.930
they used to have these little kiosks in the middle of all these big stores,

157
00:10:41.931 --> 00:10:43.040
almost like a,

158
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.300
like little moons to these giant fucking planets of stores.

159
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:52.610
And one of them was called Wickson sticks and all they sold was candles.

160
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:57.140
And even as a little kid I was like,
how are they stay and

161
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.780
open?
Like that's all they sell.
You know,

162
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.350
if people ever stopped fucking or raw doing Voodoo,

163
00:11:07.351 --> 00:11:10.740
like these people are going to be in trouble.
So I look at like the Middle East,

164
00:11:10.741 --> 00:11:15.320
like they like a giant Wickson sticks.
Like where Wickson sticks,

165
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:20.070
just,
just sold candles.
They just sell an oil.
That's their main thing.

166
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:22.680
If you stop buying their oil,
they don't have any money.

167
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.720
They don't have any money.
They can't finance a fucking military.

168
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.430
Right?
Meanwhile,
they can't have a dangerous species as pets.

169
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:37.080
So that's too far right there.
They slowly go out of fucking business.

170
00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.870
We're over here with their fucking a,
I don't know,

171
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.940
fucking electric cars and shit.
Not saying it's cleaner for the environment,

172
00:11:44.941 --> 00:11:46.440
but it gets you out of that shit.

173
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:54.280
If elected tomorrow,
ladies,
gentlemen,
I will,

174
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:59.460
I will present a three day plan to get us out of the Middle East

175
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.500
and off of oil that would be implemented immediately

176
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.870
despite the crushing effects on the economy.

177
00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:17.510
I'm sorry,
I'm just,
I'm just,

178
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.260
I don't need somebody who was in fucking third rock from the sun,

179
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.410
you know,
talking to me about this.
But,
you know,
at the end of the day,

180
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:29.880
I am not voting.
I would have voted,
but,
um,
I'm just on the road.

181
00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:34.590
So what am I supposed to do?
Well built.
You could apply for an absentee ballot.

182
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.930
<v 0>Um,
well I would,</v>

183
00:12:38.931 --> 00:12:41.130
but the people that I vote for never win

184
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:47.910
<v 1>cause they aid the Democrats,
the Republican Party.
I vote for those lunatics.</v>

185
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.000
There's people that are like,
I don't know man.

186
00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:53.550
If we voted for this guy and he got in,
I don't know,

187
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.510
either things would get better or everything would be on fire.

188
00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.110
Like those are the people that I vote for.
So maybe I shouldn't fall.

189
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.310
Maybe I'm one of those people.

190
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:09.060
We'll be right back with podcasts.
Celebrities who don't vote.

191
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:11.743
<v 0>MMM.</v>

192
00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.900
<v 1>As a podcast celebrities.
I just like saying that,
that makes me feel important.</v>

193
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.660
Um,
speaking of important,

194
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.950
I have a couple of important announcements to make.
Um,

195
00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.890
I'm going to be at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday,

196
00:13:26.891 --> 00:13:27.970
the day after the election.

197
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:31.180
I think I'm still going to be like telling people what they should vote for.

198
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.660
That's how full of myself I am.
The day after the election.

199
00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.550
You know what you should've done.
You know,

200
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:39.700
like somebody calls up a sports show the day after their team fucking losers.

201
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.690
<v 0>Um,
all right.
Um,
important announcement.
Uh,</v>

202
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.030
<v 1>my patrion page,</v>

203
00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:51.770
www.patrion.com/birth five bucks a month.

204
00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:57.220
Every month you get two episodes of uninformed with me and old Joey roses.

205
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.430
Um,
I got a,
uh,
let's see,

206
00:14:01.431 --> 00:14:05.150
live from the live Monday morning podcasts that I filmed.

207
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.030
I didn't find any live studio on its pocket.

208
00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:13.060
We'll do it live in Phoenix or you can download that from the patrion app to

209
00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:14.720
stream,
um,

210
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:18.530
that in new uninformed episodes or download directly to your phone.

211
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:21.340
I have behind the scenes and a,

212
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.570
the forum behind the scenes backstage I should say.
And uh,

213
00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:29.630
I have some helicopter video and I'm just going to keep adding to that every

214
00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.140
month.
It's at www.patrion.com/bar.

215
00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:35.573
<v 0>MMM,</v>

216
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.830
<v 1>that's it.
What else do I have?
I think that was it.</v>

217
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.160
<v 0>Um,
other than that,
I went up and,
yeah,</v>

218
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:47.830
<v 1>I visited my family back east and I went to the Patriots Green Bay packers game.</v>

219
00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:50.260
Obviously was very excited with the outcome of that game.

220
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.620
I was nervous because Aaron Rodgers is such a fucking beast and uh,

221
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.870
yeah,
I was nervous about our defense against them.
And,
uh,
you know,

222
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.430
played a little Ben don't break in the red zone.
Uh,

223
00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:06.590
you kind of had all day to pass,
so most of the game,
but when it counted,

224
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:11.270
we got in his fucking grill and made it happen.
Um,

225
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:17.200
and I had great seats,
you know,
I have to tell on Jimmy Kimmel that I sit up,

226
00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.710
up top with the fucking real people actually got into one of those boxes,

227
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.790
no sitting right in the front fucking row.

228
00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:25.403
<v 0>MMM.</v>

229
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:28.850
<v 1>They had the window open and shit.
It was great.
So I was like cold.</v>

230
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.070
But then when I walked into the back near the food,

231
00:15:31.071 --> 00:15:33.410
I was all warm like those in somebody's living room.

232
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.610
I got treated like an absolute king.
So I want to thank the Patriots.

233
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:43.670
Um,
when we got the whole trip,
I got to see the,
uh,
the trophies.

234
00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.500
I got to talk to Andre Tippett.
I mean,
it was,
it was,
it was incredible.

235
00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:49.850
It was fucking incredible.

236
00:15:49.851 --> 00:15:53.830
And then I watched arguably two of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.
I mean,

237
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:56.600
one of them is the greatest quarterback of all time.
And then the other one,

238
00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:58.040
I don't know,
you know,
what are we going to put in?

239
00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.380
But he's the only halfway done,
you know,

240
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:05.180
he's just fucking kicking the shit out of everybody.
He's on track.
Right.

241
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.770
And he's on track to be what top five every has got gotta be,
you know,

242
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:15.200
I bet if he,
if he wasn't doing what he was doing in Green Bay,
you know,

243
00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:18.230
if he was doing it in a different city like New York,

244
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.750
he probably already be there.
You got to work twice as hard,

245
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.570
twice as hard in green bay,
I feel like.

246
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.360
But can you imagine me in the greatest quarterback of all time?

247
00:16:28.361 --> 00:16:33.180
And you're in Buffalo,
New York,
Green Bay,
Wisconsin.

248
00:16:33.181 --> 00:16:37.800
Like how long would it take people to notice?
Um,
we're taking collars?

249
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:42.320
No,
it was an amazing game.
And,
um,
is that,

250
00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:46.080
that's maybe the third time I've seen Aaron Rodgers play live.

251
00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:47.940
He just always,

252
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.390
he's one of those guys where he starts to run and then he can throw the fucking

253
00:16:51.391 --> 00:16:53.670
ball,
you think.
All right,
he's going to run for like eight.
Yah,
we did.

254
00:16:53.671 --> 00:16:58.500
He just got 30 yards.
Like how good he is at that is,
it's,

255
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:03.580
it's like drives you up the fucking wall when you're watching your team cause

256
00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.930
you'll like tackle.
Okay.
They got him go get,
he slipped away.

257
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.080
Now I've got to check on him before he gets a pasta,

258
00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.340
throws it down the goddamn field.

259
00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.740
I bet people like bitching at some of our quarterbacks.
It's like,
dude,

260
00:17:17.741 --> 00:17:21.670
that aid them.
They'd been running around back there for like six seconds.

261
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:23.350
Like something should have happened by now.

262
00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.570
They shouldn't still have to be covering a receiver.

263
00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:27.933
<v 0>MMM.</v>

264
00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.830
<v 1>But anyways,
uh,
I kinda called it before the game.</v>

265
00:17:31.831 --> 00:17:34.410
I kind of feel on Josh Gordon was going to have a breakout game,

266
00:17:34.411 --> 00:17:35.460
which I feel like he did.

267
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.970
I couldn't tell and I wasn't watching any sort of broadcast.

268
00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:41.310
Looks like you've jammed his fingers or something on two plays in a row.

269
00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:43.140
He was looking at his hands.
I hope he's all right.

270
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.500
And then that Patterson do just took over before the half,

271
00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:51.150
just unstoppable.
Just handing the ball off door.

272
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.120
This hybrid running back wide receiver.
I mean,

273
00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:57.810
how perfect is that for Bella checks offense.
Um,

274
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.630
so here we go with six and two,
but fucking Kansas City won again.
So there,

275
00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:06.710
what this seven and one,
I don't fucking know.
I got a kid now.
I have no idea.

276
00:18:06.711 --> 00:18:08.900
So as a right now,

277
00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.380
we would play Kansas City at home,

278
00:18:12.381 --> 00:18:17.280
provided we got to the AFC championship game and uh,
tell you that would be,

279
00:18:17.281 --> 00:18:22.090
that'd be a tall order trying to beat those guys two times a one year.
Um,

280
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:28.870
once again,
people freaking out about my homes.
He threw a ball like 90 yards.
Oh,

281
00:18:28.871 --> 00:18:33.490
you mean like Doug Williams did 30 years ago?
Sorry.
Um,

282
00:18:33.491 --> 00:18:36.160
I've never seen anything like this.

283
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.500
Alright.
Lsu versus Alabama.
Oh,
Jesus.
Oh,
that one hurt.
Oh,

284
00:18:43.501 --> 00:18:47.730
did that one hurt?
I was like,
Alabama hasn't fucking played anybody.

285
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.340
Let's look at their fucking schedule.
Right.
Cause this is what I was doing.

286
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:51.420
I was like,
you know something.

287
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.030
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

288
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:56.540
<v 1>Even though our fucking best defensive players going to be on the bench for the</v>

289
00:18:56.541 --> 00:18:58.640
first fucking half,
I feel like we're going to hang with them.

290
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.960
Then the other kid comes in.
Maybe he can,
uh,
you know,

291
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.690
tip the scale and Lsus favor.
That did not happen.

292
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:10.010
Can I spell Alabama?

293
00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:15.060
Alabama also scheduled 2018.

294
00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:21.261
Let's listen to these powerhouses that Alabama has played a Mississippi state.

295
00:19:21.611 --> 00:19:26.290
That's not bad.
Auburn.
Oh,
this is what they have left.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.

296
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.070
Hang on a sec.
Hang on a second.
Auburn.

297
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.860
They play Auburn every day of every fucking Thanksgiving though.
All right.

298
00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.880
They played Louisville.

299
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:37.040
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

300
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.250
<v 1>one 50,
one to 14.
Then they played Mississippi,</v>

301
00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.900
then they played Louisiana,
Lafayette.

302
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.890
Then they played Missouri.
Uh,
or whatever.
I think I'm fucking up these.

303
00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.270
None of these teams are ranked.
They played Arkansas state.

304
00:19:57.890 --> 00:20:02.150
They played Texas a and m not Alabama's fault that Texas a and M is not good

305
00:20:02.151 --> 00:20:05.240
right now.
Then they played Arkansas.
Not Their fault.

306
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.250
They played Tennessee.
They played Missouri.

307
00:20:09.251 --> 00:20:13.570
This is Lsu is the first fucking rank team they played all year.

308
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:17.260
So I'm thinking like,
well,
they're finally fucking planes.
Somebody.

309
00:20:17.261 --> 00:20:18.580
Let's see what happens.

310
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.200
And they went in there and they just fucking kicked him right in the deck.

311
00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.860
I mean,
it just,
it offense couldn't do shit.

312
00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.720
The defense just dominated.
Um,
it's,

313
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.110
it's like they just stuck a rag in their mouth and fucking wrap some duct tape

314
00:20:35.111 --> 00:20:40.111
right around of all fit and just repeatedly kicked him in the nuts slowly for

315
00:20:41.651 --> 00:20:45.970
four straight quarters,
um,
29 to nothing.

316
00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:50.260
So all those haters out there,
you know.
Yeah.
They don't play shit,

317
00:20:50.261 --> 00:20:52.540
but it's not their fault.
It's not their fault.

318
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.410
And everybody kind of sucks that they're playing,

319
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.690
but then when they do play a number three team,
they fucking destroyed them.

320
00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.850
So they got Mississippi state and then the biggest challenge of the year,

321
00:21:03.851 --> 00:21:04.860
they play citadel.

322
00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:08.543
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

323
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:14.790
<v 1>And then they got a Auburn and then for some reason there's a game on the 1st of</v>

324
00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.990
December.
I would have thought that that was the last one.

325
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:22.060
They're playing Georgia.
So they,
they got some teams come on up.
Not really.
Um,

326
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:26.380
but let's just say there'll be nice and rested for when they played for yet

327
00:21:26.381 --> 00:21:30.070
another championship,
but you know,
something as much as people bitch about that,

328
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.970
you know,
they're easy scheduled,
then they get in the championship game.

329
00:21:33.971 --> 00:21:35.740
And more times than not,
they win,

330
00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:37.813
<v 0>you know,</v>

331
00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:42.420
<v 1>as opposed to Ohio state.
I remember a few years ago,
they fucking,</v>

332
00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:47.700
they Penn state beat them straight up and then also won the big 10

333
00:21:47.701 --> 00:21:52.290
championships.
And for some reason Penn state didn't get in,
but Ohio state did.

334
00:21:52.291 --> 00:21:56.830
And then Ohio state went down there and got that fucking shorts yanked down.
Um,

335
00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.560
I'm in way over my head right now.

336
00:21:58.561 --> 00:22:00.930
I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Um,

337
00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:04.110
but I can just tell you as a podcast celebrity,

338
00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.180
your vote on who should be,

339
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:12.020
who should make the Ncaa College football playoff is extremely important.

340
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.580
It's extremely important that this Saturday coming up is one of the most

341
00:22:17.581 --> 00:22:22.530
important Saturdays in college football history and who would know better?

342
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.220
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

343
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.100
<v 1>Then his celebrity podcasts.
Oh,
that sounds better,
doesn't it?</v>

344
00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.680
I'm going to have to put that on my fucking,

345
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:32.423
<v 0>mmm.
[inaudible]</v>

346
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.980
<v 1>I guess concerned for that on my Wikipedia page.</v>

347
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:40.640
Comedian,
actor,
celebrity podcast or,

348
00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.080
uh,
please don't put that on there.
Well,
I've already said to do it.

349
00:22:49.081 --> 00:22:53.340
So now it's 2000 and I was done.
Um,
anyways,
um,

350
00:22:53.341 --> 00:22:56.250
so I'm hanging in here in New York,
uh,
going to do my little tune up,

351
00:22:56.251 --> 00:23:00.210
show tonight,
bounce around some clubs here in New York.
Uh,

352
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.740
looking forward to that.
And then,
uh,
I got my big shoe on,

353
00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.920
um,
on Wednesday,

354
00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.930
so I'm just sitting here and then I got,
I got three shows in Chicago.

355
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:14.790
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

356
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.550
<v 1>Um,
at the Chicago theater on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.</v>

357
00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:22.790
And then all freckles is fucking done for the year I've done for the year.

358
00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:24.773
So I mean,

359
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.553
<v 0>okay.</v>

360
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.050
<v 1>Uh,
no,
I mean I got some local shows then I'm doing,
but um,</v>

361
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:35.140
and I will not be doing shit again until I go out to eastern Europe,

362
00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:40.340
which I already made fun of on this podcast.
When are we announcing those dates?

363
00:23:40.341 --> 00:23:42.830
I don't know.
I think I just pictured the hedge.

364
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:47.510
I just pick the headshot they going to use or something to that nature.

We uh,

400
00:25:37.681 --> 00:25:41.550
I'm actually a came in town early because we had a surprise birthday party for

401
00:25:41.551 --> 00:25:44.130
Paul.
And um,
when I tell you like,

402
00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.430
you know when you go to those things and like the person's kind of figured it

403
00:25:47.431 --> 00:25:51.030
out and then they try to act like the surprise and you know that the not like

404
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.400
Versie legit had no fucking clue.

405
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.100
He was coming down the stairs and I could tell the way he was talking,

406
00:25:56.101 --> 00:25:59.490
it was at this restaurant,
the way he was talking to this guy,
I was like,

407
00:25:59.491 --> 00:26:01.260
oh my God,
this guy has like no clue.

408
00:26:01.261 --> 00:26:03.450
And then hours I got like nervous for a second.

409
00:26:03.451 --> 00:26:06.000
Like is he going to have like a fucking heart attack?

410
00:26:06.001 --> 00:26:09.300
What if he just breaks down and starts crying?
Like I always there,

411
00:26:09.301 --> 00:26:13.410
you guys were like,
you know,
just gets really fucking awkward.
I got,

412
00:26:13.411 --> 00:26:17.550
I got like really I don't like doing that to people.
You know what I mean?

413
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.170
You know,
let them know what's going on.

414
00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:20.520
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

415
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:23.850
<v 1>he just came,
walked around the corner.
We all just go sell prize.</v>

416
00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:28.290
And he did like a fucking doubletake put his hand up to his face and then just

417
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.810
walked out of the room for a second.
But it was funny.

418
00:26:30.811 --> 00:26:35.140
Everybody laughed and then he came back
and uh,

419
00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:36.840
I'll met God.
We had a great time.

420
00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:42.600
That's like this whiskey tasting thing.
It was just amazing.

421
00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.320
It was fucking amazing.
And this guy was giving us all this whole,

422
00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:47.530
<v 3>okay</v>

423
00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:52.530
<v 1>fucking history lesson on whiskey to a bunch of comedians.</v>

424
00:26:53.021 --> 00:26:56.830
So it's like,
we're in class with this subject we always wanted to take,

425
00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.260
but at the end of the day,
we're all class clowns.

426
00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:03.520
Everybody's trying to outdo each other.
And this Guy Ethan,
who did the,

427
00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:08.710
the tour just handled it like a champ.
You know,
we gave him shit a little bit.

428
00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:11.830
He gave a shit back.
Um,

429
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.570
it was,
oh,
it's just such a fucking great time.

430
00:27:15.571 --> 00:27:20.190
Then he had somebody they can roll in cigars.
It was really,
uh,
it was amazing.

431
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.070
And then I went up to the Patriots game.
Yeah,
you know,
this,

432
00:27:23.071 --> 00:27:27.420
this is what it's like people to be a celebrity pie.

433
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.730
I'm going to start with that joke.
All right.
Anyways,

434
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.480
so I'm back here in New York and,
uh,
I was watching today on ESPN.

435
00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.430
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

436
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:38.670
<v 1>Um,
they said the Lakers hit a new low and the Lebron era,</v>

437
00:27:38.671 --> 00:27:41.910
it's like the just fucking started.
It seems like a month into it.

438
00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:45.090
Magic Johnson said they're on a two year plan.

439
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.150
The first year is going to be rough and then they're going to clear all this cap

440
00:27:48.151 --> 00:27:51.410
space.
So they're going to buy a bunch of people and make a run and fucking,
uh,

441
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:52.520
<v 3>yeah.</v>

442
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.400
<v 1>Oh,
a golden state.
I mean,
the guy said that.
He said,
that's what I'm going to do.</v>

443
00:27:57.030 --> 00:28:02.030
I don't understand why ESPN is trying to make me act like this is like this big

444
00:28:03.371 --> 00:28:08.140
failure and Luke Walton needs to be fired.
They said it's a two year plan.

445
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.200
We're barely fucking,
not even two months into this

446
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:18.020
Jesus Christ,
he fucking ESPN.
I swear to God,
they're worse than CNN and Fox.

447
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.320
So I don't watch any of those channels.
I just actually tell,

448
00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.230
tell me who won the game.
Get me all fucking anxious.

449
00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:31.050
Um,
we had a,
bt was Luke Walton.
Uh,
they,
they said it wasn't,
you know,

450
00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:31.920
<v 0>okay.</v>

451
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.700
<v 1>It didn't concern his job,
but could it Ben,
his kidneys,</v>

452
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:39.730
sorry.
Anyways,
um,

453
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.390
I actually been going to the gym out here in New York

454
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:44.703
<v 0>and uh,</v>

455
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.330
<v 1>you know,
I had a little bit of set,
a little bit of a setback with my shoulder.</v>

456
00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.173
Now I'm back.

457
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.313
<v 0>MMM.</v>

458
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:55.030
<v 1>The person I was working with was telling me when I could do like 120 pounds,</v>

459
00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.810
like 10 times on the lat pull down with the weight that I'm at.

460
00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.710
I could attempt to do a pull up.
My shoulder would be,
but you know,

461
00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.480
one to three,
which means I would just do one.

462
00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.240
<v 0>And uh,
you know,</v>

463
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.840
<v 1>I took a few days off,
I tried to come back where I left off,</v>

464
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.540
I was up to 110 pounds and it felt a little tweak.

465
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.480
I fucking stopped immediately shut the whole thing down.

466
00:29:17.481 --> 00:29:21.920
Ice My shoulder and I was fine,
but I had to go back down to about 75 pounds.

467
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:27.110
Just these fucking rotator cuffs to such,
they're so delicate.

468
00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.690
You know what I mean?
It's like a,

469
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:36.840
you don't like what?
Like someone who's is a needy self centered asshole,

470
00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:40.490
like their group of friends.
It's just like,
uh,

471
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.250
I don't know what their deal is.
They're like a,

472
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.760
it's like this entourage of people.
Like that's Kinda like what a,

473
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.940
your rotator cuff is like that person,
you know,

474
00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.790
if your shoulder muscles are a bunch of different people built,

475
00:29:51.791 --> 00:29:54.970
what are you talking about?
I don't know.
I'm just trying to feel fucking time.

476
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.780
Let me read some advertising here.
How about that?
Huh?
Did I,

477
00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:02.350
did I copy and paste the advertising?
I don't think I did.

478
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.600
I don't think I did.

479
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.263
<v 3>Here we go.</v>

480
00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:11.310

481
00:30:11.311 --> 00:30:13.430
those cities.
I mean,

<v 1>Cheerleaders.
Somebody was saying that they have a problem with cheerleaders.</v>

549
00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:04.310
Should we let our girls be cheerleaders?

550
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.080
Is it time to rethink the rules for NFL cheerleaders?

551
00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.193
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

552
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:17.280
<v 1>Um,
okay.
Let's see what day,
what it,
let's see what the fucking problem is.</v>

553
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:18.930
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

554
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:20.280
<v 1>What is the problem now?</v>

555
00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:24.683
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

556
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.050
<v 1>Okay.
40 years ago this month,</v>

557
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.340
a visitor at the Dallas cowboys cheerleading tryouts described as seeing that

558
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:36.341
was quote as tense as an open casting call for a Broadway production with 150

559
00:34:37.851 --> 00:34:42.320
woman,
the most envied,
celebrated,
and sought after in the country.

560
00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:46.030
Shivering in an overly air conditioned room.
Aw.

561
00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:49.100
That's like being backstage at Letterman.
It was fucking freezing.

562
00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:55.140
Uh,
the women's spoke of starvation diets that had lasted for weeks.

563
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:59.220
The sounds like when you got a movie premiere premiere coming up,
uh,
the visitor,

564
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.780
a New York Times reporter,

565
00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.800
and noted that the cheerleaders were paid next to nothing,
$15 a game.

566
00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.210
They had stringent practice schedules as much as five hours a night,

567
00:35:09.211 --> 00:35:12.600
five nights a week.
The only thing I agree with is how little they pay.

568
00:35:12.601 --> 00:35:16.650
They should pay more and they could not appear where alcohol was served at 10

569
00:35:16.651 --> 00:35:19.710
parties of any sort or wear jewelry with the uniforms.

570
00:35:19.980 --> 00:35:22.650
A cowboy cheerleader above all else is beautiful.

571
00:35:22.651 --> 00:35:27.250
The article said at a time when the squad was perhaps the most iconic side's

572
00:35:27.251 --> 00:35:29.160
case.
So what is the fucking problem

573
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.340
for decades later the world made have changed,

574
00:35:34.341 --> 00:35:38.400
but the rules of professional cheerleading appear to be essentially the same.
No.

575
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.560
<v 0>Okay.</v>

576
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.300
<v 1>These people,
they don't even know what the fuck they're talking about.</v>

577
00:35:41.301 --> 00:35:42.770
First of all,
cheerleaders,

578
00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:47.360
they used to lead cheers before there was diamond v.
Dot.

579
00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:49.400
The big fucking whatever you call them,

580
00:35:49.401 --> 00:35:53.600
the big fucking flat screens and all the music go,

581
00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.790
go shorty and all that shit.
You know,

582
00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.090
everybody clap your hands before all of that shit.

583
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:04.730
They would lead people in chairs,
but then when it became obsolete,

584
00:36:04.731 --> 00:36:09.200
so now what they really are,
is it just sort of dance teams and then one,

585
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.340
there's a stoppage of play.
They'd come out,
oh,
oh,

586
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:16.600
Bobo Bobo.
Break it down,
right?
They just do something.

587
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.920
They just do some shit.
And this is just,
once again,
I swear to God,

588
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:26.300
this is just,
this is just fucking,
I'm telling you,

589
00:36:26.301 --> 00:36:28.220
like the women who are going to complain about this,

590
00:36:28.221 --> 00:36:30.110
no one's going to ask you to be a cheerleader.

591
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:35.290
This is like me being concerned with the models at copper tone being like,

592
00:36:35.841 --> 00:36:38.270
are they being,
you know,

593
00:36:38.271 --> 00:36:42.530
tanning is not the most healthy thing.
And in the end it's really,

594
00:36:42.531 --> 00:36:47.000
I'm just jealous because I don't have any pigment and look,

595
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:49.790
according to the Internet,
like among the Lloyd.

596
00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.773
<v 0>MMM.</v>

597
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.950
<v 1>Is it time to rethink this?</v>

598
00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:59.880
I don't think I've ever seen with all of the true,

599
00:37:00.030 --> 00:37:05.030
huge fucking gigantic fucking problems out there.

600
00:37:05.481 --> 00:37:10.481
I don't think I've ever seen a time where just like the most frivolous shit gets

601
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:13.880
kids bumped all the way up to the top.

602
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.520
It's like all those fucking assholes that some our board,

603
00:37:16.521 --> 00:37:18.050
the plane before group one.

604
00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:22.100
Will you just looking at how to fuck did that person get on to people today?

605
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.400
Got On,
not veterans.
No kids not limping.

606
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.270
Somehow got on before.
Everybody else is just like,
what the fuck did they do?

607
00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:32.950
And my buddy just sent me something.

608
00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:36.970
This is going to be the new scam in aviation.

609
00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.310
Is everybody just paying money and extra shit just to be able to get on that

610
00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:46.210
fucking plane.
First my buddies,
uh,
Dean del Ray sent me this thing.

611
00:37:46.211 --> 00:37:50.950
It's like five grand a year.
Five fucking grand a year.
You go to the,

612
00:37:50.951 --> 00:37:54.190
you go to your own private terminal at lax and then,

613
00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:57.070
then they take you right to the plane and you get on first.

614
00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:04.480
So you know what?
I decided,
I was like,
you know what?
I'm just going to pack less.

615
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.610
<v 0>Okay,</v>

616
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:08.760
<v 1>well I'm going to be old Billy backpack and my backpack will fit right</v>

617
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.940
underneath my fucking chair.

618
00:38:09.941 --> 00:38:12.310
And then you guys and anybody else who wants to fucking,

619
00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.553
<v 0>you know,</v>

620
00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:17.450
<v 1>sit there like,
like a,</v>

621
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:22.480
like a bunch of fucking hyenas trying to get the spoils of a lions kill.

622
00:38:23.571 --> 00:38:26.500
I am.
I'm not fucking doing it.
All right.
I'm going to fucking hang back

623
00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.750
and be like,
all right,
I'll you fucking I,
I quit.
Okay.
I did it the right way.

624
00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:37.000
I started in the back of the,
I worked my way up.

625
00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.990
I was promised a gold watch and the gold watch was that I was going to get on

626
00:38:40.991 --> 00:38:42.580
first.
Just doesn't fucking exist anymore.

627
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.113
<v 0>MMM.</v>

628
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.880
<v 1>Anyways,
what is a,
what the fuck was I talking about?
Oh yes.
So there's all these,</v>

629
00:38:51.881 --> 00:38:53.940
I actually like,
so,
you know,
it's funny,
I just,

630
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:55.660
I just did with these feminists to doing

631
00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:57.853
<v 0>right</v>

632
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:03.290
<v 1>rather than dealing with overpopulation,
climate change,
fucking uh,</v>

633
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.310
an uh,
deregulated banks.

634
00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.050
We're going to tackle cheerleading.
Why?

635
00:39:11.051 --> 00:39:13.660
Because it affects me then.

636
00:39:13.661 --> 00:39:16.600
I love that I went on that fucking rant about people getting on the plane first.

637
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.420
Cause I just showed him just as fucking bad as they are,
you know,

638
00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:22.780
so God bless them.
Let a bitch above a fucking job.

639
00:39:22.781 --> 00:39:26.750
They're never going to be offered.
How fucking full of yourself are you?

640
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.410
Should I let my daughter cheerlead what?
Is she good looking enough?

641
00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:39.290
Should I let my son be the head of the math team?
Well,

642
00:39:39.291 --> 00:39:44.240
did your son get your fucking,
I'm actually making fun of myself here.

643
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.240
You're,
you're fucking animal.

644
00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:50.020
Should I let my kid read out loud on the radio?

645
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:55.000
Uh,
no bill for the love of God know.
Um,
anyways,
uh,

646
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.490
policy genius.
Everybody.
That was just a little break.

647
00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:02.000
That's what feminists are concerned about now.
Cheerleading.

648
00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:03.770
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

649
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:07.310
<v 1>Hey,
there's this swirl of trash two times the size of Texas,</v>

650
00:40:07.311 --> 00:40:10.370
two miles deep out in the Pacific Ocean.
I don't give a fuck.

651
00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:11.813
<v 3>Okay.</v>

652
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.680
<v 1>Pull a pom poms.</v>

653
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.760
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

654
00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:20.740
<v 1>Um,
I don't give a shit.
Let's talk about cheerleading.
All right.
Policy genius.</v>

655
00:40:20.741 --> 00:40:24.100
Life Insurance isn't the most enjoyable thing to think about.

656
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:27.130
Most people don't like thinking about dying.
I can tell you right now,

657
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:30.100
I've got a life insurance policy and now all of a sudden I,
you know,

658
00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.230
I always took a weight off my chest.

659
00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:37.700
It's like I can fucking leave now and,

660
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:40.830
and nobody's going to have a problem.
And I'm not talking about dying.

661
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.950
I'm talking about going out and getting a pack of smokes and never coming back.

662
00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:48.450
Uh,
but actually having life insurance is a really good feeling as I just said.

663
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.230
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

664
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.480
<v 1>I literally feel like I could abandoned my family.</v>

665
00:40:52.481 --> 00:40:54.610
Like that's how relieved I am that I have life insurance.

666
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:57.400
It's nice to know that if anything were to happen to you,

667
00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.280
<v 0>I immediately pictured a piano.</v>

668
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:04.540
Did anybody ever bring a piano up with a fucking rope?
Did that really happen?

669
00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.430
<v 1>And why would somebody walk underneath,
um,
anything happen to you?</v>

670
00:41:10.431 --> 00:41:14.600
Your family won't have to start a go fund me to stay afloat.
Well,

671
00:41:14.601 --> 00:41:17.180
here's my question.
What happens if something happens to my family?

672
00:41:17.181 --> 00:41:19.310
What about the guy here?
Huh?

673
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:24.810
When do I get the fucking put my feet up.
Uh,

674

677
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:35.443
<v 0>Okay.</v>

678
00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:39.130
<v 1>Um,
well I already told you how much I like life insurance.</v>

679
00:41:39.131 --> 00:41:43.060
I just did it before you guys advertised here.
So I didn't use policy genius,

680
00:41:43.061 --> 00:41:46.750
but you know,
had there I had,
I known that there was a policy genius out there.

681
00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.220
I would have used it and would have saved myself a fucking small fortune.

682
00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:52.253
<v 0>Right.</v>

683
00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:57.260
<v 1>My loved ones would be in Kavia rather than 200 fish.</v>

684
00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.283

700
00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:04.640
about those fucking cheerleader thing.
You know,

701
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:09.560
I had to starve myself and everything.
You mean make sacrifices?
Well,

702

get a fucking nutritionist.
You don't have to starve.

Lionel Hampton could come over and play a fucking song on that goddamn torso.

708
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:30.200
That starving.

709

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.630
Just imagine

713
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:47.590
living in some fucking war torn country and listening to that fucking argument.

714
00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.520
I think one of the biggest problems facing women today is the question of

715
00:43:53.521 --> 00:43:56.580
cheerleading.
All right,
helix,
everybody.
Helix.

716
00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.970
You ever wake up in the morning?
We'll do.
Yeah.
With regrets of what you've done.

717
00:44:02.971 --> 00:44:05.430
Jesus Christ.
Tell tale heart.

718
00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:11.400
Is your roommate buried underneath your floorboards and your best friend,
Dad,

719
00:44:11.401 --> 00:44:15.810
the cop is coming over a reef laying the terrible decisions you've made the

720
00:44:15.811 --> 00:44:20.520
previous night over and over and over.
Jesus Christ.
Yes.
The kicking,

721
00:44:20.521 --> 00:44:23.880
sweating,
yelling or whatever she did to piss off everyone in the bedroom.
Well,

722
00:44:23.881 --> 00:44:27.840
guess what,
Bud?
Deciding to sleep on a shitty mattress is your choice.

723
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:31.410
<v 0>MMM.</v>

724
00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.250
<v 1>Wait a second.</v>

725
00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:37.350
You telling me if I have a nice mattress,

726
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:39.960
I won't regret decisions I made as a younger man.

727
00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.500
This might be the greatest sales pitch I've ever heard in my life.

728
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.810
What else can it do?

729
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:51.330
I you sick of your dick staring down at your ball bag when you wake up in the

730
00:44:51.331 --> 00:44:54.000
morning.
Wouldn't it be great if it was fucking pointing at the ceiling?

731
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:59.370
Is it to say there's a fucking raccoon up there?
Be careful.
Um,

732
00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:02.380
anyways,
what the hell am I here?

733
00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.043
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

734
00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.040
<v 1>Deciding to sleep on a shitty mattress is your choice.
But bill,</v>

735
00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:13.020

Where would I ever begin?

What kind of a creep reads other people's sleep quiz?

741
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:35.210
Are you naked when you sleep?
Oh yeah.
You,

742
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.540
whether it's on something violent,
um,

743
00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.280

773
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.670
Question Number One,
am I too fat to be a cheerleader?

774
00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:39.183
<v 0>MMM.</v>

775
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:42.800
<v 1>If I continue to take it in the face,</v>

776
00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.470
will that extra protein make me beautiful enough?

777
00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:50.240
These are the hard hitting questions in cheerleading.
All right,

778
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:51.830
Paul Barzee special.
Hey Bill,

779
00:47:51.831 --> 00:47:55.760
I just watched the Paul bursaries forsee special and just wanting to thank you

780
00:47:55.761 --> 00:47:57.320
for promoting it.
Look at that.

781
00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.460
It was hilarious and I can't wait for the next all things comedy special on

You Maniac.
Oh yeah.

783
00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:08.060
Paul Versey special did very,
very,
very well.

784
00:48:08.061 --> 00:48:12.710
So I want to thank everybody for watching that.
Um,
versus v I.
E.
R.
Z.

785
00:48:12.711 --> 00:48:16.910
I,
I'm sure they got it streaming on their website.
You know how those guys are.

786
00:48:16.911 --> 00:48:21.200
Everybody knows what they're doing over at comedy central.
And I'm,

787
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:23.270
Paul is just the first week we're going to,

788
00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:25.550
we've got three more specialists come in.
Um,

789
00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:30.820
and we're picking all comics at other comics like and um,

790
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.480
I'm very proud of the group that we have come in.

791
00:48:32.481 --> 00:48:36.410
I'm not allowed to say who they are when I can.
I will.
All right.
That's it.

792
00:48:37.050 --> 00:48:39.290
All right.
Advice for all of oil.

793
00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:41.230
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

794
00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:45.910
<v 1>Olive oil.
Uh,
number one.
Uh,
Benito.</v>

795
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.730
Billy.
I'm another 22 year old

796
00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:49.600
<v 0>lady</v>

797
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:54.050
<v 1>and longterm lover of the podcast and truly all of your work.
To be honest,</v>

798
00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:58.430
as an Amazonian myself,
just shy of six feet.

799
00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:02.510
Oh this is for that woman who wrote in olive oil.
Um,

800
00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:08.260
I wanted to reach out and offer some advice to my girl olive oil from last week.

801
00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:13.070
I co sign everything you said about loving yourself and some guy will love you

802
00:49:13.071 --> 00:49:17.750
just the way you are.
But I just wanted to put my 2 cents of advice in as well.

803
00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:22.670
Joel,
Jesus,
get on with it.
There,
which is lift some weights.
Girl.

804
00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:26.690
Thankfully my prayers were answered around the time I reached adulthood in the

805
00:49:26.691 --> 00:49:31.460
form of a nice little waist to hip ratio and suggest praise God.

806
00:49:31.461 --> 00:49:34.730
But I was never satisfied with my rear end and tell it.

807
00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.760
I met my husband who is jacked and he introduced me to pumping iron and iron and

808
00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:46.070
Schwartzenegger blesses hard,
taught me how to sculpt an ass out of muscle.

809
00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:49.560
I suggest she watches that movie.

810
00:49:49.561 --> 00:49:53.960
Starts with the basic no supplements except create team weight gainer and

811
00:49:53.961 --> 00:49:54.794
coffee.

812
00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:59.720
Don't waste money on any of the bullshit GNC concoctions and find some heavy

813
00:49:59.721 --> 00:50:04.070
stuff to lift in the following ways.
Squad bench deadlift.

814
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.391
Uh,

815
00:50:05.391 --> 00:50:09.800
now she will get so much self confidence out of becoming stronger than she has

816
00:50:09.801 --> 00:50:12.590
ever been.
I would just say get a personal trainer too.

817
00:50:12.591 --> 00:50:16.210
So you doing all of this right?
You don't fuck up your back.
Um,
and with,
uh,

818
00:50:16.310 --> 00:50:20.090
the endorphins from exercise plus the changes in her body adding mass,

819
00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:24.760
I really think she will love it.
Number two,
the tall,
skinny girl,

820
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:27.280
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is this doing to hear guy?

821
00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:31.430
Don't want to update now clicking,
no,
sorry.
Number two,

822
00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:36.640
the tall skinny girl who wrote in a should move to New York and be worshiped.

823
00:50:36.801 --> 00:50:38.420
I feel for her though,

824
00:50:38.421 --> 00:50:41.750
because people used to tell me stuff like that to my face all the time.

825
00:50:41.751 --> 00:50:45.080
They would just tell them you're calling you stretch,
you know?
Well,

826
00:50:45.081 --> 00:50:46.550
I know the type of type of shit,
you know,

827
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:50.060
eight foot or whatever they say to tall women.
I don't know.
I don't remember.

828
00:50:50.061 --> 00:50:51.380
It's been a long time since I had been in school.

829
00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.920
A 100% of those people who said that to me 10 years ago are now pretty Chubby at

830
00:50:57.381 --> 00:51:00.800
30.
While I look like the same slash better than I did at 20.

831
00:51:00.801 --> 00:51:05.720
My boyfriend says I'm a 10 and he's a catcher and a half.
Uh,
I just looked up

832
00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:13.840
GG Haddad's numbers,
five,
10 and a half tall,
130 pounds,

833
00:51:13.841 --> 00:51:18.370
almost the exact same as this girls.
She should also look into squats,

834
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:21.220
leg lifts and protein.
Thanks.
And Go fuck yourself.

835
00:51:21.221 --> 00:51:25.540
So I think what she did was she embraced her body and made it the best she
could.

836
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:29.620
She could be.
I think that's all great advice.
Olive oil.
I hope you listen.

837
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:32.610
All right.
But,
uh,
only thing I would add to that,

838
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:34.480
just make sure you get a personal trainer,

839
00:51:34.481 --> 00:51:38.770
get a nutritionist and all that stuff and they have the answers rather than

840
00:51:38.771 --> 00:51:41.800
fucking looking at the dope next to you being like,
what,
what are those

841
00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.380
knows breakers?
Do they enjoy you?
Try Ya.
I'll fucking,
I'll do,

842
00:51:47.381 --> 00:51:50.200
I'll just do that.
Um,

843
00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:51.770
<v 0>yeah.</v>

844
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:56.300
<v 1>Alexa at my hospital.
Oh Gee judge.
Dear bill,</v>

845
00:51:56.301 --> 00:52:01.100
I work in a medical center that is very up to date with technology in Beverly

846
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:04.970
Hills that I will not name my work involves me visiting patients at their

847
00:52:04.971 --> 00:52:08.870
bedsides.
I walked into one of my patients from defined Alexa,

848
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:13.900
mounted on the wall with an example question typed up on a piece of paper.

849
00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:16.700
Alexa,
call my nurse.

850
00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:21.440
My reaction was she has a big fucking Emoji.
Looks like a smiley face.

851
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:25.570
Oh,
you freaking out.
Is that a freaking out smiley phase?
I don't know.

852
00:52:25.930 --> 00:52:29.800
And I asked the RN that's registered nurse.
Uh,

853
00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:33.250
we have Alexa now.
As soon as I said Alexa,

854
00:52:33.251 --> 00:52:37.600
it lit up with that creepy blue ring waiting for me to give it a command.

855
00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:40.630
I have no idea why patients need that.
And then room,

856
00:52:40.810 --> 00:52:43.690
because patients have remotes that call the nurse station.
Yeah.

857
00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.780
Cause it's spying on you.
That also controls the TVS.

858
00:52:46.781 --> 00:52:49.510
I immediately thought of you and chuckle.
Love your work.

859
00:52:49.511 --> 00:52:52.650
And I agree a lot with you lady MD.

860
00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.960
See that this smart ladies go with the freckles and you should go with those

861
00:52:58.390 --> 00:53:00.600
freckles.
A celebrity podcast.

862
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.850
Podcasts are this Tuesday in the voting booth.

863
00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:09.550
I say you vote for me.
Me,
me,
me.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

864
00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:14.070
yes.
I saw them make rib advertised recently.
Must be voting season again.

865
00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:18.260
Hilarious.
Um,
yeah,
that's all creepy.
You know,

866
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.830
flew in and out of Boston from Newark Airport and they had this magazine.

867
00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.560
This was trivial to Burt Reynolds.
So it was like,
you know,
I,
you know,

868
00:53:25.610 --> 00:53:30.080
it was great.
His movies,
his stunts,
the women he loved.
I was like,
oh,

869
00:53:30.081 --> 00:53:31.950
I gotta read this fucking Burt Reynolds.

870
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:36.000
They're not gonna make another guy like this.
And,
um,

871
00:53:38.170 --> 00:53:43.050
I,
I go,
I pick up the magazine,
I'm looking around.
There's nobody there.

872
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:46.410
So I walk over to the restaurant,
I go,
where do I pay for this?

873
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:49.560
And The lady just goes,
oh,
at the self checkout right over there,
sweetheart.

874
00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:53.580
And she points over to whether it had to been 5 million fucking things.

875
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:59.950
So I just said,
oh,
okay.
It's right over there.
Okay,
well thank you sweetheart.

876
00:53:59.951 --> 00:54:02.230
And I just walked over to the rack and I fucking put it back in.

877
00:54:02.231 --> 00:54:05.260
I'm not doing it.
Not fucking doing.
That's another thing too.

878
00:54:05.261 --> 00:54:07.660
I've fucking refused to be my own cashier

879
00:54:10.830 --> 00:54:11.930
drawing the line in the sand.
I will.

880
00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.990
I will fucking eat a Goddamn thanksgiving meal before I go to the fucking

881
00:54:14.991 --> 00:54:19.660
airport.
I'll bring my reader's digest.
I'm going to be that old guy,
right?

882
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.230
I don't like new things.
And you know what?
No one's going to care,
Bill.

883
00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.190
Nobody's going to care.

884
00:54:25.191 --> 00:54:29.300
So just learn how to check yourself out in the mirror.

885
00:54:29.330 --> 00:54:31.610
No silly at a store.
All right,

886
00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:36.020
my wife cheated on me by downloading Tinder and sending nudes.

887
00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:38.300
Hey,
Billy balls.

888
00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:41.960
But listening to your podcast for a few years now in your advocacy,

889
00:54:41.961 --> 00:54:44.330
this is somebody who never would have cheated in the past.

890
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:47.450
They just were around a computer too long.
I'm telling you,

891
00:54:47.451 --> 00:54:49.490
it's like just having a heroin sitting on your table.

892
00:54:49.491 --> 00:54:54.290
Eventually you're going to do some dumb anyways unless you podcast for a few

893
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.900
years now and your advice always makes me laugh and hard times.

894
00:54:57.050 --> 00:54:58.930
Here's something that just happened to me this past week.

895
00:54:58.931 --> 00:55:03.830
I was hoping you could help me out with,
I got married Memorial Day irony,

896
00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:06.470
um,
of this year.

897
00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:10.580
My wife has been acting really distanced lately and on Sunday I asked her if she

898
00:55:10.581 --> 00:55:12.770
was seeing anyone.
She told me no,

899
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:16.880
I've known this girl for four years now and I knew she was lying.

900
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:22.100
Wow.
Do great instincts.
If you guys just gotten married in May,

901
00:55:22.101 --> 00:55:24.770
this is five months later,
it's gone.
This has gotten this bad.

902
00:55:26.810 --> 00:55:28.550
When I asked to look at her phone,

903
00:55:28.551 --> 00:55:32.930
she quickly deleted something and refused to let me see your phone physically

904
00:55:32.931 --> 00:55:35.660
attacking and scratching to keep me from seeing it.

905
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:37.850
She then admitted to downloading Tinder.

906
00:55:37.851 --> 00:55:42.470
About two weeks ago and has been take talking to a guy and send him some

907
00:55:42.471 --> 00:55:46.640
pictures,
claiming to never have met him and I believe her.

908
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:50.720
I've been struggling these last few days with a lot of emotions.

909
00:55:50.721 --> 00:55:55.400
It's only five months into the marriage.
Is it best to look at getting a divorce?

910
00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.550
It would take a lot of time to forget about what she did.

911
00:55:58.551 --> 00:56:01.520
Especially since I will never really know what transpired.

912
00:56:01.521 --> 00:56:05.690
Saw you in AC and loved it.
Thanks to go fuck yourself.
Yeah,
Dude.

913
00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:09.950
You five months in,
look,
if you were like 10 years in,

914
00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:13.250
you going through a rocky period and I dunno,

915
00:56:14.090 --> 00:56:16.730
you have a couple of kids,
it's something you work out maybe.

916
00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:18.013
<v 0>But</v>

917
00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.090
<v 1>yeah,
this just seems like if this is happening this early on,
I don't,</v>

918
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:25.060
she wanted to marry.
That's what I would add.

919
00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:27.730
Or doesn't want to be married or I don't know.

920
00:56:27.731 --> 00:56:30.880
What are his sabotage in the whole thing.
And at that point it's like,
well,
hey,

921
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:34.420
here's Kudos to you because you did it.
Yeah,
I would get the fuck out of that.

922
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:40.040
Yeah.
I mean as a kid,
did you dream?
Does that,
was that your dream woman?

923
00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:44.610
Five months in senator or fucking hoo ha over.
There's some funny,

924
00:56:44.611 --> 00:56:48.230
I don't think it is.
Um,
yeah,
I would,

925
00:56:48.231 --> 00:56:52.970
I would get the fuck out of that.
They know not to mention.

926
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.970
She also like physically attacked it too.
So I mean,
I don't know that's got this,

927
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:59.150
there's a lot of that sounds like the beginning of one of those uh,

928
00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:02.300
lay appear to be a happily married couples.

929
00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:06.740
Occasionally he would showed up with odd scratches and bruises,

930
00:57:06.741 --> 00:57:09.590
but he quickly explained it away saying he was working on his car.

931
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:12.920
Then one day he didn't show up for Thanksgiving.

932
00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:17.990
His wife had recently been digging a well in the backyard.
All right.

933
00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:21.980
Hate fat people.
Oh Jesus.
Dear Billy bitty balls.

934
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:29.180
Billy Betty balls.
Oh,
Billy Betty balls once a matter.
Um,

935
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:34.210
I'm a 20 year old sophomore in college and I have a dilemma like the subject

936
00:57:34.221 --> 00:57:38.970
says fat people really just discussed me.
Oh,

937
00:57:38.971 --> 00:57:42.750
the subject.
Kate Fatty bar.
Uh,
there are too many examples to name,

938
00:57:42.751 --> 00:57:45.450
but one that really gets me is this lady.
My math class,

939
00:57:45.451 --> 00:57:50.451
who sits next to me and we'll ram randomly start smacking her lips and making

940
00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:52.134
this,

941
00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:53.600
<v 0>yeah,</v>

942
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:57.500
<v 1>he spelled it m e h e m.
M noise.</v>

943
00:57:59.030 --> 00:58:01.970
Mm hmm.
She's doing that.
Maybe she's thinking about food.
I don't know.

944
00:58:02.300 --> 00:58:06.320
There was also this guy in my hall who shits literally three times a day.

945
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.260
Well,

946
00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:13.190
it must be rapping as pizza and Kale or something because I see him go to two is

947
00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:16.020
rum with pounds of food at a time?

948
00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:19.980
My dislike isn't anything malicious and I just can't help it,

949
00:58:19.981 --> 00:58:24.981
but I just stuck between a rock and a squishy place and surrounded on all sides

950
00:58:25.651 --> 00:58:30.000
by the fatties.
I know this does not seem like a big,
that big of a deal,

951
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:33.780
but I have a bit of a temper and I'm afraid I'm going to say something to one of

952
00:58:33.781 --> 00:58:38.781
the fatties and get title nine right out of my school.

953
00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:44.430
Do you have any tips to become a bit more tolerant?
Uh,

954
00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:48.270
I love the podcast.
Congrats on your role in front runner.

955
00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:53.490
You should grow that mustache and keep it and go fuck yourself.
Um,

956
00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:58.200
I did grow that mustache.
I grew that mustache when I had,

957
00:58:58.500 --> 00:59:02.790
when I played the cop way back on Chappelle show.
Um,

958
00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:08.760
let's see here.
Uh,
I would just make a joke out of it.

959
00:59:11.590 --> 00:59:13.690
How well do you know the guy who's always disappeared?

960
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.153
<v 0>Okay,</v>

961
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:19.760
<v 1>I will give him a sumo wrestler name.
Now you can't do that.
That's me.</v>

962
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:25.100
I don't know.
Yeah,
I know.
It's like a,
yeah,

963
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:29.100
you're supposed to be tolerant,

964
00:59:29.101 --> 00:59:33.210
but they just continue to eat and they make weird noises and they smell and

965
00:59:33.211 --> 00:59:36.200
you're supposed to just sit next to him and be like,
well,
I feel bad from,

966
00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.540
they have a fucking problem.
You know,

967
00:59:39.541 --> 00:59:44.100
it's hard to feel bad for someone that you know,
is gluttonous I guess.

968
00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:47.070
But that's just the way I'm wired.
Like a,

969
00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:50.533
<v 0>you know,</v>

970
00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:54.070
<v 1>all of these fucking addicts and all these goddamn people.
Like,
I dunno,</v>

971
00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:58.900
once you live with the fucking attic,
you just,
you just,
uh,
yeah.

972
00:59:58.901 --> 01:00:00.820
You just have,
you don't have a lot of patients from,

973
01:00:00.821 --> 01:00:05.110
I don't really know what you're asking me,
so I understand what you're saying.
Um,

974
01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:09.220
I would just find somebody else in shape and I would just together just make fun

975
01:00:09.221 --> 01:00:13.240
of them without them being able to hear it,
you know?

976
01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.180
And most of the time they're chewing anyway so it drowns out there hearing.

977
01:00:16.181 --> 01:00:20.830
So I think you'll be all right.
I would just make jokes like that.

978
01:00:20.831 --> 01:00:22.450
Other than that,
what are you supposed to do?

979
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:28.040
<v 0>You know?
Um,</v>

980
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:31.873
I dunno.

981
01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.510
<v 1>Sing songs when they go by.</v>

982
01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:35.913
<v 0>Okay.</v>

983
01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.470
<v 1>That'd be funny if he just snapped.</v>

984
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:40.840
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

985
01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:44.490
<v 1>Like Jesus Christ again.
How fat are you trying to fucking dead?</v>

986
01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.050
You can't do any of that.
And the thing is is you're not really helping them.

987
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.960
You shouldn't fat shame people,
but like,
it's also like,
you know what I mean?

988
01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:55.930
Like,
you know,
there's a little bit of arsenic and an apple,

989
01:00:55.931 --> 01:00:58.000
but it's still good for you.
Like,
yeah,

990
01:00:58.001 --> 01:01:00.850
if you could have like the same level of arsenic that's in an apple,

991
01:01:00.851 --> 01:01:04.000
if you could have that level of shame shaming and fat people,

992
01:01:04.001 --> 01:01:05.260
I think it would help them out a little bit.

993
01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.310
Why don't you tie one of them to your bumper and drag them to the gym?

994
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:15.390
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't want to have the answers here.
Um,

995
01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:17.550
recipe from vegetable Lasagna.

996
01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.970
I have no fucking idea why I'm getting this.
Speaking of which,
um,

997
01:01:23.130 --> 01:01:27.970
I have not been eating well.
I consider myself a fat fuck right now and I fetch.

998
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.820
I'm,
I'm a self contained unit.
I will,
I will fat shamed myself.
Um,

999
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:36.210
or you guys could do it too.
You know,
I always enjoy that.
All right.

1000
01:01:36.211 --> 01:01:38.100
Recipe for vegetables on your dear bill.

1001
01:01:38.101 --> 01:01:41.550
I was recently listening to an old podcast where you and you were talking about

1002
01:01:41.551 --> 01:01:43.230
a thanksgiving.
Oh God.
Yes.

1003
01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:47.670
Well you made a shitty vegetarian lasagna with carrots in it.
It was horrible.

1004
01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.390
Oh my God.
Is one of the worst thanksgivings ever.
Uh,

1005
01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:57.450
made me think of a great Broccoli lasagna recipe that my roommate and I would

1006
01:01:58.121 --> 01:01:58.954
cook

1007
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:02.400
<v 0>and I would cook.
Um,</v>

1008
01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.850
<v 1>he's at battalion from Sicily.
Oh,
those guys don't consider themselves Italians.</v>

1009
01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:12.710
They consider themselves Sicilian and the recipe is from his Italian

1010
01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.130
grandmothers.
See you know,
it's going to be some good shit.
Uh,

1011
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.600
this isn't healthy at all.

1012
01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:22.020
It's rich and creamy and absolutely delicious as a Lasagna should be.
Also,

1013
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:26.520
it's super easy.
I can't remember the exact measurements for each thing,

1014
01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:30.570
but we're going to try anyways.
Oh,
your protection.
The recipe,

1015
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:34.560
why he gave me was the fucking ingredients.
What does this a cooking show?

1016
01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:39.740
700 grams of Broccoli,
Florence
flour,

1017
01:02:39.741 --> 01:02:43.190
butter and milk for the bechamel sauce.

1018
01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:48.170
Look up a basic lasagna recipe for Beckham,
B,
c,
h,

1019
01:02:48.171 --> 01:02:52.640

1020
01:02:52.641 --> 01:02:57.130
A few cloves of garlic,
chopped olive oil,
fresh Mozzarelle,

1021
01:02:59.530 --> 01:03:00.860
Parmigiano Reggiano,
tablespoon of Pesto,

1022
01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:05.810
depending on how much back on mail you make.
Let's see.
It's pretty simple.

1023
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:09.650
Like all great Italian dishes.
All right.

1024
01:03:09.651 --> 01:03:14.030
I'm not gonna read all of this shit.
Cut Up the Broccoli.
All right.

1025
01:03:14.330 --> 01:03:16.970
I Dunno if somebody can figure that fucking shit out.
Uh,

1026
01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.520
anyways,
if I've done an hour,
I think I have.
Um,

1027
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:26.870
all right,
that's the podcast.
I don't know who's playing on any football tonight,

1028
01:03:26.871 --> 01:03:29.630
but I gotta do some spots tonight and tomorrow to make sure I'm ready for

1029
01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:33.020

And um,

1030
01:03:34.330 --> 01:03:34.580
<v 3>yeah,</v>

1031
01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:37.040
<v 1>I'm actually going to do something that all old men like to do.</v>

1032
01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:41.510
I'm going to take a fucking nap.
I can't wait.
And you guys,

1033
01:03:41.511 --> 01:03:45.140
you have no idea how difficult it is to be me.
You know,

1034
01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:48.920
dealing with hard hitting problems like cheerleading.

1035
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:53.870
Should we let women cheerlead I love how their cheerleading five feet away from

1036
01:03:53.871 --> 01:03:57.770
guys who are literally doing irreparable brain damage to themselves,

1037
01:03:57.771 --> 01:04:00.800
most of whom,
you know,
when they get to a certain point,

1038
01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:04.010
either go crazy or kill themselves,
but,
but let's,

1039
01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.390
let's not focus on that.
Um,

1040
01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:10.040
that's the podcast.
Everybody.

1041

1043
01:04:15.791 --> 01:04:19.570
I don't know what,
I guess now I'm down to watch and uh,

1044
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:23.440
I'm going to start watching the Celtics and the Bruins now when I get fucking

1045
01:04:23.441 --> 01:04:26.320
home to my,
my,
uh,

1046
01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:31.030
what is center ice package and what do they call the basketball when the NBA

1047
01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:35.230

I don't know what the fuck it is,

1048
01:04:35.231 --> 01:04:39.020
is that micro aggressive?
My,

1049
01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.020
sunrise vagina?
Is that what you're supposed to say?
I have no idea.
All right.

1050
01:04:43.021 --> 01:04:45.660
Go fuck yourselves,

Everybody.
Just,

1051
01:04:45.900 --> 01:04:50.010
just for me and my celebrity podcasting ego.

1052
01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:55.080
Could you get out there and vote because tomorrow is really,
really important.

All right.
Go fuck yourselves.
