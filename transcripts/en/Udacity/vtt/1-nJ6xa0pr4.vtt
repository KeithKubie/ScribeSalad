00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.190
The solution is to override the onPostExecute method

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.510
of the AsyncTask. And this runs on the main

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.410
thread. We received the string array of forecast results,

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.590
which came as a return value from the do

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.930
in background method above. First, we clear the ForecastAdapter

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.300
of all the previous forecast entries. Then we go

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.810
ahead and add each new forecast entry one by

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.500
one to the ForecastAdapter. This is what ultimately triggers

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.050
the listView to update. Note that if you're targeting Honeycomb

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.210
devices and above, you can use an addAll method here,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.430
so you don't have to add them one by one.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.320
You can just add it once and update the listView once.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.060
Once you hit Refresh, you'll see the weather forecast for

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.700
the next seven days for your location. Even though we hit

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.820
Refresh, we don't have any verbose logging statements being printed

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.520
out here. We don't need them anymore, because we have a

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.500
way to check that our code is correct by looking at the UI now.
