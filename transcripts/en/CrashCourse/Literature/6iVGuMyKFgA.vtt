00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.870
Hi I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature and I have some bad news.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.770
Disease is devastating the planet.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.639
Soon the global food supply will be compromised,
clean water will become scarce, violence will

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.730
grow epidemic, dangerous new street drugs
will circulate, the income gap will increase,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.560
corporate slavery will return and a strongman
president will be more interested in issuing

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.160
tough-guy slogans than actually improving
the lives of the people.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.470
Of course none of that’s happened yet.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.470
What’s that?

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.410
Oh, Stan informs me that some of it has happened.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.090
But the only place it’s all happening, so
far, is in “Parable of the Sower,” Octavia

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.830
Butler’s 1993 science fiction novel.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.130
It’s just made up.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.130
Thankfully.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.570
But jeez, I have never read a dystopia that
feels more possible, or more terrifying.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.311
And yet, it’s also one of my favorite books,
and a genuinely hopeful one.

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:53.760
The kind of hard-won, uneasy hope that actually
means something.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.750
INTRO
Let’s start with a brief introduction to

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.350
the author, Octavia Butler.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.260
She was an African-American science fiction
writer who won the Hugo and the Nebula Awards

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.940
and a MacArthur genius grant.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.430
She died in 2006 at the age of 58.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.330
Growing up as a shy only child in Pasadena,
California, Butler spent a lot of time reading

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.690
at her local library and telling herself her
own stories.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.860
And then, when she was nine, she saw a movie
and thought, I could write a better story

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.860
than that.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.860
So she did.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.720
Her aunt told her that an African-American
girl couldn’t be a writer, but she kept

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720
going.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.530
And as a young adult, she would get up at
two in the morning so that she’d have time

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.570
to write before working jobs like dishwasher
and potato chip inspector.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.380
It wasn’t until her early thirties that
she was able to support herself entirely as

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.380
a writer.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.540
Her works deal with race, class and power,
and most of her books also include fantastic

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.420
elements like time travel, and alien life
forms and telekinesis.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.380
She described herself as “A pessimist if
I'm not careful, a feminist, a Black, a former

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.460
Baptist, an oil-and-water combination of ambition,
laziness, insecurity, certainty, and drive."

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.240
“Parable of the Sower” is a coming-of-age
story-one of the best of the past several

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.240
decades.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.440
It’s also a story about being black in America,
and a feminist story and a theological story

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.480
and a dystopian story and in some ways maybe
a bit of a utopian story.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.230
It takes its name from a Bible parable.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.130
In which Jesus describes someone who goes
out to distribute seed.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.010
Some of the seed falls on the path and is
eaten up by birds, some falls in a rocky place

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.590
and can’t grow, some falls near thorns so
that’s no good, but some of it falls on

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.460
fertile ground and grows beautifully.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.490
So before we talk about genre and theme, let’s
briefly look at the story of “Parable of

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.260
the Sower.” in the Thoughtbubble:
When the book begins, Lauren Oya Olamina is

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.209
a fifteen-year-old girl growing up in a small
community outside of Los Angeles, in 2024.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.980
She lives with her father, a professor and
a Baptist minister, her stepmother and her

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.420
four half-brothers.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.740
Climate change and disease outbreaks have
increased social disorder so much that Lauren’s

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.730
community has built a wall all around it.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.890
When people leave the community, they leave
armed.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.989
Both Lauren and her father become more and
more worried about how long the community

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.310
can survive, and they prepare stashes of money
and supplies so that they can run away if

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.310
they have to.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.860
And Lauren has other secrets.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.120
Because of drugs that her mother abused during
pregnancy, Lauren has “hyperempathy”—she

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.250
feels what other people feel, which makes
it hard for her to hurt anyone.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.250
Also, Lauren has begun to develop her own
belief system, one that is different from

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.250
her father’s.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.230
It locates god in chaos, and change and uncertainty.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.819
Throughout the book, we read pieces of a new
kind of scripture.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.140
“All that you touch, you change.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.390
All that you change, changes you.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.510
The only last truth is change.”

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.370
Lauren comes to call this religion Earthseed
and believes that its purpose is to prepare

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.290
humankind to “take root among the stars.”

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.770
Eventually, her walled community is overrun,
and unlike most of her family and friends,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.140
she manages to escape and then Lauren meets
up with other survivors.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.569
For a time, she disguises herself as a man,
and eventually begins walking north with a

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.930
growing community--the first members of the
Earthseed movement.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.030
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.500
There’s a lot of death in this book, and
like the Handmaid’s Tale, the narrative

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.400
voice is so strong that it all feels terrifyingly
real.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.340
And yet, it IS science fiction.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.820
It’s set in the future--albeit barely.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.370
And there’s speculation from 1993 about
how climate change and wealth inequality and

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.099
walls will shape the world of the future.

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:23.599
Part of what makes Parable of the Sower, and
its sequel Parable of the Talents, so powerful

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.349
is how prophetic they seem.

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.789
Another term for this kind of science fiction,
which is set on earth and uses contemporary

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:34.240
technology is “mundane science fiction,”
although this is one of the less mundane books

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.240
you’ll ever read.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.580
In 1998, Butler told an audience that she
liked to think of science fiction in terms

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.330
of categories established by the writer, Robert
A. Heinlein, “the what-if category; the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.970
if-only category; and the if-this-goes-on
category,”

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.330
She described “Parable of the Sower” as
“definitely an if-this-goes-on story.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.599
And if it’s true, if it’s anywhere near
true, we’re all in trouble.”

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:56.870
Oh it’s time for the open letter?

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.699
An Open Letter to my future self.

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.639
But first, let’s see what’s in the secret
compartment today.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:01.639
Oh look!

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.580
It’s the sky express rocketship that I’m
going to use to travel around the solar system

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.580
in the future.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.520
Dear future me, Parable of the Sower is set
in 2024, it’s currently 2017, you’re watching

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.439
this in 2024—how we doin’?

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:15.500
Was Octavia Butler right that we were all
in trouble?

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.120
Because I’m concerned.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.020
So it’s seven years in the future, how are
things going?

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.240
I think you guys recently had an election
hopefully?

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.710
Did climate change turn out to be a hoax?

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.110
Are we still doing Crash Course?

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.830
Did the Looking For Alaska movie every get
made?

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.809
Does Diet Dr. Pepper turn out to be bad for
me?

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:29.350
Has Liverpool won the Champions League?

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.680
I have so many questions!

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.770
But mostly, I just hope you’re around to
answer them.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.419
Best wishes, current John.

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.720
So “Parable of the Sower” is obviously
an exploration of if-this-goes-on, but it’s

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.029
also lots of other things.

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:45.169
I want to look at two of the book’s other
genres—the book as a bildungsroman and also

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.400
as a sacred text.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.460
So you might remember bildungsroman is a long
and fun to say German word that means a novel

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.809
of education, a story in which a young person
grows up and becomes more or less independent.

00:05:55.809 --> 00:06:00.460
At the beginning of the book Lauren is a teenage
girl who does what her family expects of her.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.659
She agrees to be baptized in a religion she
doesn’t believe, because her father wants

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:09.360
her to, she helps out in the school her stepmother
runs, teaching the set curriculum.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.800
But as the book goes on, she starts thinking
for herself more and more.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.919
She establishes her own belief system and
begins to study how to survive in case her

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.219
community breaks down.

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:22.029
After talking things over with her father,
she also starts conveying some of that information

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:26.699
to the children at the school even though
survival skills are definitely not in the

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:27.699
curriculum.

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:31.389
And then, when her neighborhood is overrun,
Lauren learns her capacity for leadership.

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.309
She protects others in her group even though
her hyperempathy makes violent action nearly

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:37.309
impossible.

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:40.509
And she keeps them going until they find a
safe place in Northern California.

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:44.379
And we should mention here that Lauren’s
suffering and her escape, as well as her journey

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:48.300
north, have led some critics to draw comparisons
between Lauren’s story and narratives of

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.659
escape from slavery.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.400
And Lauren is an escapee and a leader, but
she’s also something else.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.569
In an interview, Butler explained that she
wanted to tell the story of someone who, “sometime

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.960
after her death – after people have had
time to forget how human she was – might

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.279
easily be considered a god.”

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:09.150
Now Lauren is human, but she does have this
god-like capacity for empathy, and “Parable

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.900
of the Sower” is in many ways a sacred text.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.499
It’s structured as a series of journal entries,
but also features many these passages from

00:07:15.499 --> 00:07:19.400
what Lauren calls, “The Book of the Living,”
a devotional text that people in the future

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.759
might read and interpret.

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:24.569
And we learn a lot about the belief system
of Earthseed in these beautiful little passages

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.419
from The Book of the Living:
Earthseed is focused on the inevitability

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:31.490
of change--several times, in fact, it says
that God is change.

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.460
Lauren says that she has based these religion
on “everything I could read, hear, see.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.149
All the history I could learn.”

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:41.789
And Butler seems to draw on elements of Buddhism,
Taoism, matriarchal religions, even a little

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:43.219
bit of the Yoruba religion.

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:47.189
It’s probably not coincidental that Lauren’s
middle name, Oya, is the name of the goddess

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:48.389
of the Niger river.

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:52.979
But Lauren doesn’t really believe in goddesses,
as she says, “Earthseed deals with ongoing

00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:55.959
reality, not supernatural authority figures.”

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:58.360
And as a person she isn’t perfect or puritanical.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.360
She gets angry.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.740
She steals when she has to.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.599
She has sex when she wants to.

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:04.639
“I mean to survive,” she says.

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:08.089
She also isn’t always certain about the
moral choices she’s making, some of which

00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:12.419
are influenced by her hyperempathy, which
she calls “a biological conscience.”

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:15.939
But that’s all part of what makes this portrait
of a prophet so fascinating.

00:08:15.939 --> 00:08:20.099
Butler shows us how her actions and her beliefs
might influence future generations.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:24.289
According to the verses Lauren writes, Earthseed
understands that:

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:26.770
“God is Power—
Infinite,

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.770
Irresistible,
Inexorable,

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.180
And yet, God is Pliable—
Trickster,

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.689
Teacher,
Chaos,

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:32.689
Clay.

00:08:32.689 --> 00:08:34.310
God exists to be shaped.

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:35.590
God is Change.”

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:40.710
Change is the one inevitability in “Parable
of the Sower”, it’s the only constant

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.460
in Lauren’s trauma-filled life.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.340
In an essay on the book, the professor Philip
H. Jos writes that those who practice Earthseed

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.950
must learn to respond positively to change.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:54.430
He writes: “‘God is Change” is an invitation
to respond to fear with creativity, productivity,

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:55.430
and compassion.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:00.200
[Practitioners must] fully acknowledge and
accept suffering and struggle as an inevitable

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.450
companion to love and happiness.’”

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:05.870
And I want to pause here and acknowledge that
for a lot of hardcore fans, “Parable of

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.110
the Sower” is a sacred text.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.150
Another way to look at “Parable of the Sower”
is as a dystopian novel, exploring a world

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.030
gone very, very wrong.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.630
And if we read the novel this way, Lauren
and her community’s journey toward a safer

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:22.720
place can make the end of the book seem a
little utopian, or at least as utopian as

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.110
a book can be where political instability
and environmental degradation mean that almost

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.250
everyone dies horribly.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.640
I’d argue though, that Butler takes care
not to make the Earthseed community, or its

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.270
leader, seem ideal.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.530
She once said, “Personally, I find utopias
ridiculous.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:42.310
We're not going to have a perfect human society
until we get a few perfect humans, and that

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.320
seems unlikely.”

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:49.000
For Lauren--and for Butler--the past, with
legal racism and misogyny, wasn’t ideal.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.810
And what’s fascinating to me about Parable
of the Sower is Lauren’s struggle to imagine

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:58.210
a better world that is not based on past models,
that isn’t trying to go back in time or

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.440
return to some imaginary golden age.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.810
The hope is less that Lauren’s followers
will create a utopia, on earth or elsewhere,

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:08.930
and more that they’ll learn new and better
forms of relating to each other and to the

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:12.820
world around them, and that they will find
something to unite them.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:17.070
Instead of a search for a paradise where nothing
ever changes, they have to learn to embrace

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.860
change and use that change to move forward
and seek life among the stars.

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:27.280
Whereas so many utopian and dystopian novels
seem to argue for dismantling technology,

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.780
Lauren sees this interstellar travel as a
goal that can unite humanity.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:36.341
As we come to the end of our miniseries on
dystopias--although I suppose Macbeth is also

00:10:36.341 --> 00:10:40.780
fairly critical of traditional power structures--I
think it’s worth pausing to consider the

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.690
if-this-goes-on-ness of Parable of the Sower.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.630
What forces or goals can unite and pacify
us?

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:51.280
We know how will humans of the past have responded
to resource pressures and deprivations—is

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.890
there a way that we can somehow avoid their
mistakes, when responding to the pressures

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.100
and deprivations of a changing climate?

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.260
And can we reconcile ourselves to change,
and live with it, as The Book of the Living

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.360
calls us to do?

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.080
“Parable of the Sower” is so page-turningly,
compulsively readable that it’s easy to

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:12.380
miss the moments where Lauren, and Butler,
speak directly to us and to our times.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:16.130
So I want to leave you with a quote from one
such moment in the novel.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.230
Lauren writes, “Embrace diversity.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:24.180
Unite— Or be divided, robbed, ruled, killed
By those who see you as prey.”

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:26.820
Good advice.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:52.509
I’ll see you next time.
