00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.179
All right. Hi and welcome to MoMA.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.619
My name is Corey D'Augustine from the "IN
THE STUDIO" series.

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.400
In fact, today we're here on the 10th floor
of the tower building at MoMA.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.800
Can't see but around us, we have the Digital
Media Department, the Graphic Design Department,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.430
Conservation Science is just around the corner,
so a little bit of behind the scenes today.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.520
What we'll be doing today is taking some live
questions as well as some questions that we've

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.020
gotten from previous videos in the comment
sections.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.750
I'm just gonna dive in right here with one
of the previous ones, but start clicking away

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.510
down the comment section, and we will be responding
to live comments in real time.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.270
First question from Chubling[SP] nice name,
Chubling.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.270
Hi.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.270
Hi.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.760
Can you talk a little bit about how you became
a conservator and what path you took to get

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.690
to where you are now?

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.450
Sure, art conservation for me, a really interesting
thing about it is that it's quite interdisciplinary.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.220
It really involves a lot of art history, a
lot of art studio techniques, painting, etc.,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.560
and a lot of chemistry also.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.170
And believe or not, when I was an undergrad
in college, I was studying biochemistry.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.750
I painted on the side, I studied art history
but they were really more hobbies than anything

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.750
else.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.580
And one day, I went to my art history advisor
and asked him, "What is this art conservation

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.690
stuff about anyway?"

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.810
It seems to be a lot of science and I actually
know something about that already.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.250
And he looked at me with a smile and he said,
"Well, I don't really know about it but go

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.850
next door to the museum and ask my wife, she's
a conservator."

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.030
So I just happen to be in the right place
at the right time for that, and really my

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.130
career started to take off here at MoMa, where
I spent five or six years in the Conservation

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.130
Department.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.909
So we could talk forever about that, but that'll
get us started here.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.591
So from the Kusama video on YouTube, Carol
Blythe asks, "No need to be rude, but why

00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:00.750
would I want to imitate someone else?"

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.220
Not rude at all, that's a really important
and really excellent question.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.750
Well, a lot of you out there are Sunday painters.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.179
What that means…in fact, I'm a Sunday painter
now.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.709
What that means is painting is just a hobby.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.700
It's something you do in your spare time,
and by all means imitating someone else can

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:15.980
be a whole lot of fun.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.129
You can also learn a ton about a given painter
by trying to replicate or apply his or her

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.680
techniques, in other words, to work in his
or her style.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.480
However, if you're a serious artist, not a
Sunday painter, but somebody who's really

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.040
trying to pursue this headlong, still working
through other artist styles is a really interesting

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.599
and really educational way, a really efficient
way to discover your own voice.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:46.390
One of the greatest examples of this comes
from art history itself, and the work of Arshile

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.930
Gorky, an Armenian-born, usually abstract
painter, who spent the latter part of his

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.949
career here in New York City.

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:59.430
Gorky in the early days... when I say early
days, his 30s, you know, not a super young

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.920
man.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.609
He would really be with another artist in
the way that you might be with your girlfriend

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.109
or boyfriend something like that.

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.260
And he was with Kandinsky for a number of
years.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.049
He was with Joan Miró for a number of years.

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.089
He was with Pablo Picasso for a number of
years.

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:22.099
In other words, he really engaged with those
other artist works, and in painting "someone

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.909
else's style," you're never gonna copy that
painting, you're never gonna really nail a

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.199
Picasso, promise you, I've tried a couple
times.

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:34.290
And so what you do is you find what part of
Picasso is really important to you, or you

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.340
find what Picasso looks like through your
hand rather than Pablo's.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.599
In other words, you're not stealing anything,
you're borrowing.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:49.749
And Picasso, again, one of the great quotes
from art history is that, "Good artists borrow,

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:51.169
great artists steal."

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.349
So even if you are stealing, put yourself
in a pretty good category at least according

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.939
to our friend, Pablo.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.829
Another comment from the same video, that's
the Yayoi Kusama video on YouTube, this one

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.110
comes from Olaf Bloch.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.790
Olaf asks, "Would it be okay to attempt this
all in acrylic?"

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.790
Absolutely.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.040
In fact, Kusama herself has executed a large
number of finished paintings of the Infinity

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.680
Net variety entirely in acrylics.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.661
In other words, sometimes she's working in
oil, sometimes she's working in acrylic, sometimes

00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:26.870
she's working in watercolor and gouache and
various other paint media.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.539
But there's really no reason whatsoever why
you couldn't dabble in other materials.

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:34.629
The problem being once you start combining
materials, you just need to be a little bit

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:35.629
careful.

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.400
But absolutely, working in acrylic emulsions
and Liquitex paints and Golden paint, etc.,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.060
no problem at all for that style.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.330
So let's dive into our first live question
here.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.220
This one comes from Preston Jarvis.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.680
Preston asks, "Are there any artists working
today that can be included in the AbEx movement

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.710
or is the era over?

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.350
And if it's over, what is the current abstract
movement called?"

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.350
Hmm…Nice.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.260
Funny you should ask, one of the artists I'm
working with a lot these days, I think you

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.370
might consider the last abstract expressionist.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.449
Of course, she's a little bit younger than
Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko who are long

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.900
gone, but I'm talking about the artist, Pat
Steir.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.990
Pat has been living and working here in New
York City, four decades in a large format,

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.590
aggressive gestural abstract style.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.000
As a matter of fact, as we speak, she has
an exhibition at Lévy Gorvy Gallery, you

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.129
can Google that and find out some really new
innovative recent work by Pat.

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:37.240
I hope she doesn't mind me saying, I'd admired
her work for a long time before ever meeting

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.889
her, and her work is huge and powerful and
strong.

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.069
So I just assumed that she'd be a kind of
huge hulking muscular lady.

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.419
And when I went to her studio for the first
time, "Oh, hi Pat," and she's very small and

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:52.400
very delicate and still very tough-as-nails
woman.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.340
At any rate, just goes to show that can't
judge a book by its cover, and you can do

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.190
a lot of different things that would be unexpected.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.530
Pat certainly looks up to a lot of the artists
that we're talking about here.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.909
Robert Ryman, who is often called a minimalist,
I really think that's a bad fit for his work

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.840
personally, but Ryman is also a New York school
painter for sure.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.870
New York school abstract expressionist, these
terms that, you know, are not exactly synonymous,

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.389
but those are the two artists I think living
today, working today, both of them making

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:30.229
very strong work today by the way, who I think
are really the closest to these abstract expressionist

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:36.479
artists.

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.889
Another one back to Kusama on the video from
YouTube, Renee Jones asks, "Love the series,"

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:42.889
Thanks, Renee.

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:48.550
If using all acrylic, as we're just speaking
about, would you add different mediums as

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:49.550
well?

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.499
Yeah, if you want to, so clearly if you're
working with say Liquitex acrylic emulsion

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:57.720
paint, you're not gonna be adding linseed
oil medium directly to that.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.439
In fact, you're gonna know that's a bad idea,
immediately it's gonna be a very unhappy,

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:05.030
kind of slurry, and a very strange resist
effect in your palette.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.969
The media that you'd be adding to those acrylic
emulsion paints, well, go over to Utrecht

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:15.169
or Dick Blick or whatever your local art store
is, and be amazed at how many different additives

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:17.759
there are for acrylic emulsion paints.

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:21.819
In the realm of oil painting, traditional
oil painting, there are, I don't know, let's

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:25.509
say five or six, something like that, typical
additives.

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:28.860
Of course, linseed oil is the most common
one.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.900
But in the realm of acrylic emulsion paints,
I'm not exaggerating, there are hundreds of

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.740
them, all different things to make the paint
dry faster or slower, or glossier, or more

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.219
matte, or more translucent, or a heavier body,
or something to cut the consistency and make

00:07:43.219 --> 00:07:44.880
it flow really quickly.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.550
So yes, absolutely, if you're working in a
Kusama-ish vein and you're working with those

00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.840
acrylic paints, as many of you are, do yourself
a favor and experiment.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:58.309
You know, buy the small-size vials, I have
a lot of those products, okay, they're a little

00:07:58.309 --> 00:08:03.469
bit more expensive, buy the millimeter what
have you, but mix and match and really start

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:04.930
to figure out what all of them do.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.449
They're all different kinds of acrylics but
you'll find out very quickly that they can

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:11.789
do some very, very different things in terms
of your working properties.

00:08:11.789 --> 00:08:16.669
And also, they look quite different when they
dry, so a really fun and really interesting

00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:27.449
place to do some experimenting in today's
really wide range of artist materials.

00:08:27.449 --> 00:08:30.999
This one comes from our first Q&amp;A session
back in May.

00:08:30.999 --> 00:08:35.550
Monica Lynnville[SP] asks, "Something that
was shoved into my brain," sounds violent,

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:40.040
"when learning oil paint, is the concern about
maintaining fat over lean."

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.040
Right.

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.850
"Doesn't mixing all these various solvents
and binders create problems?"

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.370
I'm not exactly sure which artist work we're
talking about that led to this question.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:55.220
But at any rate, fat over lean, as some of
you know is really the kind of golden rule

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.030
of academic painting.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.550
Fat over lean means two things.

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.690
Well, first of all, what is fat?

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:06.709
Fat doesn't refer to the thickness of a paint
layer, it refers to the binder or the medium

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:07.709
content.

00:09:07.709 --> 00:09:11.090
So a fat layer has a lot of extra oil mixed
into it.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.760
A lean layer is gonna be the opposite.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.139
It's a very dry kind of paint.

00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:18.791
You've maybe work straight out of the tube,
you've cut it with some turpentine, but you

00:09:18.791 --> 00:09:21.880
haven't added more medium, more linseed oil
to it.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.430
So it's gonna be a more matte finish and more
dry kind of a paint, fat over lean.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.590
So what is fat over lean about, is talking
about your first layer should be lean, and

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.330
then each layer successively should get fatter.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.950
Now, there's two reasons to do this.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.990
The first one is aesthetic.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:40.200
If you're painting, if you're an academic
or an old master at painting, you're an Italian

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.420
Guild-based renaissance artist, something
like that, if you're painting flesh, the way

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:47.420
to do that is to start out opaque.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.170
In other words, with a lean paint layer, and
then to progressively glaze over it, add more

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.389
and more medium as you are building in the
flesh tones.

00:09:56.389 --> 00:10:01.020
In other words, you start out building the
value, the shadows of my nose and chin and,

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.890
you know, eyelids, etc., just in grayscale
really.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:07.010
Something called a Verdaccio.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:10.410
And then you begin glazing over that to get
some of the flesh tones in translucently.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:15.380
So aesthetically, this is how to paint flesh
really convincingly, illusionistically.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:21.470
But lucky for us, oil painters, really the
other half of that golden rule of oil painting,

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.620
fat over lean, is that's also structurally
how to build a really strong, physically I'm

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.010
speaking now, strong, durable painting.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.010
Why?

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.709
Because those under layers, those lean layers,
they have less binder, they have less medium.

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:38.209
And, of course, it is the medium that is the
glue, the adhesive, the strength of the paint

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:40.550
film, so not that strong.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:44.970
They can crack, they can be abraded very easily,
marred, etc.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:50.720
But if every successive layer has additional
medium in it, every layer gets stronger and

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.980
stronger and stronger and locks in the one
underneath it.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:59.870
So this is really a beautiful invention of
the European masters, this method of painting

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:06.389
that at the same time is designed to achieve
naturalism in aesthetics and of structurally

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:08.940
sound painting that's gonna last for hundreds
of years.

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:13.110
Lucky for those of us who love to go to the
Uffizi or the National Gallery in Washington

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:17.790
or London or the Metropolitan, we can appreciate
both of those factors.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:21.720
So does fat over lean really apply to modern
paintings?

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:27.790
Well, sure it does, except naturalism is seldom
what modern and contemporary artists are going

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:28.790
for.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:31.529
Instead, they're direct painters like Matisse
or like Picasso.

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:36.410
They're going right to the surface in one
shot, no opaque paint more often than not.

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:40.630
So you might be thinking well, doesn't that
lead to structural problems?

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.610
And you'd be on the right track here.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:48.070
I think it's fair to generalize that artists
who are not working in that academic technique,

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:53.420
their paintings crack faster and to a greater
degree, just to generalize, than those artists

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.610
who are working in those academic manners.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.290
Sounds bad but for me personally, I don't
mind because it keeps me in business.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.480
A lot of contemporary artists are working
in really fascinating ways, but let's be frank.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:07.790
Perhaps, some of them don't last as well as
those tried-and-true guild based and academic

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.660
traditions did.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:17.730
Let's go to another live question from Olivier
Vendes here on YouTube.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.880
I'd like to hear about the relationship between
the expressionists beginning to use bigger

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.459
formats in the architectural environments
they had access to, such as cheap loft for

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:26.750
studios and new galleries.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:27.750
Nice.

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:29.750
Yeah, we could write a whole book on this.

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:35.110
So especially here in New York City, the abstract
expressionists, the New York school artists,

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.839
where do they live, where do they work.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:41.250
Well, first down around 10th Street and 8th
Street in Greenwich Village, and they had

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:44.000
some pretty large spaces there.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Why did they live there?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Because it was cheap.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.709
Good luck affording an apartment in those
neighborhoods these days.

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:54.540
The next generation moved down into SoHo further
south in Manhattan, there were loft spaces

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.560
and warehouse space or something you could
paint huge.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.560
Barnett Newman had a massive gallery... sorry,
a massive studio down on Front Street which

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.230
is quite close to the World Trade Center site
now.

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:11.460
And Newman, who painted some of the biggest
paintings really that New York had seen, really

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:19.360
that the world had seen since Canaletto in
the late Italian period, Newman was quoted

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:24.089
as saying, "Well, we painted those paintings
so big, so that they couldn't fit into the

00:13:24.089 --> 00:13:27.769
sons of bitches' apartments on the Upper East
Side."

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:34.720
I'm not sure that I totally buy that idea,
to be frank, but bigness is kind of an American

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:38.290
idea, and it's one of the new qualities that
those expressionist artists explored.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.569
What I'm talking about?

00:13:39.569 --> 00:13:43.709
Well, New York is big but in another way,
it's kind of small, a lot of Manhattan is

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:44.709
quite small.

00:13:44.709 --> 00:13:50.990
As the studio spaces got bigger, artists started
to explore ideas like the Grand Canyon, right?

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:56.069
Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, artists who were
thinking about landscape, but not the landscape

00:13:56.069 --> 00:14:01.430
of, you know, out the window here in Manhattan,
but the landscape of huge open vistas that

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:06.000
are kind of rare to find in Europe but here
in the States, not in New York City, but really

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.950
in the Midwest and places like that, the scale
of this country is massive, certainly not

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.160
the only massive country on the planet, but
these artists really were tapping into that

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.910
as they were trying to develop an American
style.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:22.880
What could they do that was new and different
from those European masters who, let's face

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.370
it, they were so difficult to compete with,
the Picassos and the Miros, and the Kandinskys

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.959
of the world.

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:37.930
Here we have a question from the Q&amp;A trailer,
I think that we launched last week on YouTube.

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:43.970
Ali Adinajade, sorry Ali if I butchered your
name there, asks how to paint like Max Ernst

00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.430
such as using the grattage technique?

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:49.839
Also, can you do an "In The Studio" video
on that topic?

00:14:49.839 --> 00:14:51.560
Very timely question from Ali.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:57.520
As a matter of fact, today we were installing
an exhibition of Max Ernst's work, a very

00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.600
exciting show on a very interesting, very
exciting artist.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:06.829
I believe that exhibition will open on September
23rd if I'm not mistaken here at the Modern.

00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:11.019
Ernst, for my money, really one of the best
surrealist painters, not one of the most famous.

00:15:11.019 --> 00:15:15.069
Dali, Magritte, artists like that come to
mind, but Ernst was a great visionary and

00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:22.290
technically speaking, one of the great innovators
of the 20th century.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:28.110
So frottage, which means rubbing in French,
is a technique that Ernst developed really

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:33.350
looking at floorboards, old Parisian, you
know, who knows, 18th-century floorboards

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:37.700
and hardwoods that had been rubbed away over
the centuries of just walking over them.

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.279
Well, he started doing rubbings with things
like charcoal on paper to pick up these hidden

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:46.819
meanings, these found compositions, these
interesting patterns transferred onto paper

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:48.529
from these textures that no one put there.

00:15:48.529 --> 00:15:52.570
They just kind of grew mysteriously and naturally
over the ages.

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:56.070
Grattage was Ernst's next innovation.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:03.649
Grattage in French means scraping, and here
he would take a canvas with fresh oil paint,

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:07.170
in other words, wet oil paint applied to it,
and then lay it down onto some kind of an

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:13.279
object like a fishbone or something like that,
and then scrape the canvas on top.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:16.949
Removing a lot of paint but of course, the
way that the paint would be removed has as

00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:21.410
much to do with the tool, the palette knife
or blade that he's scraping with, as it does

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:26.629
to do with whatever is underneath it in contact
with that canvas, transferring bizarre versions

00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:30.399
of whatever object or texture is underneath
the canvas onto the surface.

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:33.470
And then Ernst, of course, would remove the
canvas, stretch it on stretcher bars, what

00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:37.810
have you, and then go back into it, either
wet in wet or let it dry and paint wet over

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:38.810
dry.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:41.620
Ernst is a really, really interesting painter.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.810
If you're in New York over the next, I don't
know two or three months, please stop by the

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.279
museum and check out that show.

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:47.850
I think it's a great idea.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:53.259
I'd love to tackle that topic, either in the
galleries here at MoMA looking at those paintings

00:16:53.259 --> 00:16:59.230
or perhaps in the studio.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:03.779
From the Ad Reinhardt YouTube video that we
did a while back, Emily Brownhart writes,

00:17:03.779 --> 00:17:06.480
"Sometime ago, I used to dislike modern art."

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.480
That's okay.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.439
When I saw this video, I wouldn't think that
my whole perception of modern art was about

00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:13.100
to change for good.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.980
Ad Reinhardt with his brilliant work showed
me the true meaning behind modern art.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.700
Until that day when I first saw the video,
I've been very interested in modern art, three

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:20.830
years ago, actually.

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.790
I just finished painting a work of my own.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.830
Thank you so much for uploading this life-changing
video.

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:27.830
Nice.

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.170
Thank you for that great comment.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.130
That makes me really happy.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:35.280
It would make Reinhardt himself quite happy
as well.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.780
Reinhardt was a really amazing painter, as
Emily describes here.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:40.780
Reinhardt was a really gifted educator as
well.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:46.210
He was a professor of art history and painting
at Brooklyn College for many years.

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:52.510
He studied art history at the graduate level,
both Western art history and eastern classicism,

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.170
Japanese, Chinese painting, etc.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:18:00.920
And Reinhardt is someone who really purified
painting to its essence in a way, but the

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:06.830
point was not to make some elitist statement,
it was not to have some intellectual keep-away.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:13.450
The point was to purify it, to make it concise,
to really locate the experience of modern

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.390
art in the experience of looking at one of
his paintings.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:21.460
In other words, it's something that takes
time and attention and patience and focus.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.332
And by the way, you might not have it, especially
if you're texting on your phone and something

00:18:24.332 --> 00:18:25.950
like that.

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.000
He demands your attention and if you don't
have it, you're just gonna see a black box.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.670
If you do, as Emily found out, it can be a
really, really enriching and really beautiful

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.180
aesthetic experience.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:42.620
So I hope you might try that as well.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.200
Monica writes from the May live Q&amp;A that we
did a while back.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.330
"What is the most common problem with paintings
that you're called in to work on?"

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:54.750
Referring to work as a conservator here, you
know, I was thinking about this.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:57.140
I should have an easy answer to that one.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:03.040
There's a lot of different problems that modern
paintings encounter these days.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:08.090
I think probably the most typical for modern
and contemporary paintings is flaking paint.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.490
In fact, we were talking about fat over lean
earlier and how a lot of modern contemporary

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:13.690
artist don't use that approach.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.670
And sometimes, young paintings can flake,
especially if they're in rough environments,

00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:22.640
if the humidity is going up and down, or the
temperature is fluctuating wildly.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.130
So something called lifting or flaking, you
know, if you have a layer of an application

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.780
of paint that's cracked and is starting to
lift up, a technique that conservatives will

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.850
do is to consolidate that.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:36.090
In other words, using a tiny brush with some
dilute adhesive, getting it under that flake

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:39.090
of paint, getting it to flow under that flake
of paint.

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:43.650
And then to somehow settle that down gently
with some heat, perhaps some pressure, perhaps

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.650
some solvent.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:49.070
And then, let that adhesive dry under pressure
to get it back stable in a plane orientation

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.070
where it came from.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.280
So hopefully, you don't see that crack and
more importantly that paint doesn't flake

00:19:53.280 --> 00:20:00.420
off and become a loss in the future.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.840
Live question here from Antonio Jose Marti.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.920
"Hi, Corey.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.280
I have one question for you.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:10.350
Do you think gesso is enough as a primer when
painting with oils on canvas and hardboard?

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:11.770
If so, how many layers should I do?

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:17.310
Okay, first point here just to clarify our
terms here, gesso, if we're really talking

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:18.310
about gesso.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:24.140
Gesso is rabbit-skin-glue and calcium sulfite
or chalk or gypsum something like that.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.700
This is the material that the Italians use
on panel paintings, beautiful material for

00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:34.270
rigid support like a canvas...sorry, like
a board, like a panel painting.

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:38.130
If you're working on a flexible support like
canvas, you would not wanna use rabbit-skin-glue,

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.830
although Agnes Martin did, because it cracks.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.990
It's a rather brittle material.

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:47.550
So rather than using true gesso, you're probably
gonna work with an acrylic primer, and in

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.950
fact, I think that's what Antonio Jose is
talking about here probably.

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:56.040
The problem becomes when you buy a bucket
of acrylic primer, sometimes they write gesso

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.090
right on it.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:00.760
It's not actually gesso, it's an acrylic primer.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.940
Why is that better in some cases?

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:07.200
Well, it is flexible, so if you have especially
a large canvas that might flap around a little

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:10.540
bit, it can be less prone to cracking over
time.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.690
So Antonio Jose writes, "Is it enough as a
primer?"

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:19.140
Yeah, absolutely and "If so, how many layers
should I do?"

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:23.570
Now, this depends on really what kind of painting
you're gonna make.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:27.800
If you're gonna make a really delicate smooth
painting where you're gonna need to build

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.010
up some thickness in your gesso and then sand
it super smooth.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.010
Why?

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.570
Because if you leave one coat or two coats
like Agnes Martin did, you're still gonna

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.560
have the warps and the wefts, the texture
in other words, the bumps in other words of

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.220
the canvas, which are gonna impede your pencil
and your brush, and it's gonna have a little

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:44.220
roughness.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:48.330
Now maybe you like that, if you're de Kooning
and you wanna have that kind of rough texture.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:51.340
Certainly, one coat is fine in many cases.

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.450
But if you're really working in a finish fetish
kind of way, if you're trying to make an alabaster-smooth

00:21:55.450 --> 00:22:00.260
portrait or something like that, you may wanna
build up three or four or five sand between

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:05.730
coats with some really fine grade sandpaper
to ensure that you have a nice, almost slippery

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:11.840
smooth kind of surface.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:17.040
From Instagram, Levy Huddleston asks, "What
process did color field abstractionist such

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:22.010
as Ellsworth Kelly use to prep their canvases
and create the proper viscosity of paint to

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.000
achieve such dense and crisp areas of color?"

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.080
Okay, so another question about priming.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.030
Kelly, as far as I know, I've worked on a
couple of Kelly paintings, he just typically

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.750
used normal primer just like everybody else
did.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:37.170
I've worked on a couple paintings that had
an oil-based primer, nothing wrong with that,

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:41.790
and then I believe more recently even working
with acrylic-based primers.

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:47.800
It's not so much what kind of process, it's
really how you treat that, and more importantly,

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.590
the priming is the paint itself.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:55.960
So for Kelly, for a minimalist kind of painter
like that, opacity is really important.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.040
But hold on, we know usually those opaque
paints have a lot of pigment in them.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.180
They tend to be stiff, they tend to leave
brush strokes but if you look at Kelly's paintings,

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.490
you very seldom will see those brush strokes.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.770
So part of the beauty of Kelly's work is really
a function of how he prepared his materials.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:15.390
One of the things I hope you noticed in the
de Kooning video…videos I should say, is

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:21.100
that I spent a whole lot of time preparing
those paints rather meticulously because I

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.400
wanted to get some qualities that were ready
to go.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:28.340
So if I had an idea at the canvas, I didn't
have to, oh, stop everything, go back to the

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.230
kitchen, and work for 20 minutes preparing
something.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.230
No.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:35.760
It's there in a bucket, in a jar, in a bowl
ready to go.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.150
So Kelly spends a lot of time cutting the
viscosity of his paint, making sure it's flowable

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:44.520
so that he can brush beautifully and not leave
these brush strokes behind, but keeping a

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:46.110
high pigment load in his paint.

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.610
How does he do that?

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:52.290
With solvent, because solvent, you recall,
will temporarily cut the viscosity of your

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:55.560
paint to make it more brushable, flowable
but solvent evaporates.

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.100
So by the time that evaporates off of your
paint film, you're left again hopefully with

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.410
a nice opacity, working with medium and solvent.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:04.910
Hmm…how much?

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.250
Time to do some experiments and find out.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:11.100
For this kind of question, if you're kinda
left brained and you wanna take a practical

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:16.200
approach, what a lot artists do, Robert Ryman
I mentioned earlier, certainly a great purveyor

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.980
of this kind of approach, is to test these
things.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.790
Stretch a canvas the way you do and rather
than painting the whole thing, have little

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:25.020
squares, little paint-outs, and label them.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.210
This one is this color with three-parts oil
to one-part turpentine.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.430
Okay, it looks like this.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.800
This one is five-parts medium to one-part
turpentine and you notice, "Oh, it's glossier,

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.800
it's more translucent," etc.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.610
So the next time you find yourself at the
easel and there's a specific quality that

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:45.350
you really wanna achieve, rather than, you
know, tinkering and hoping you get it right

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.720
like a cook might, go back to the recipe like
a baker might.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.380
And say, "Oh, I know exactly what this does
here, and now I'm gonna mix this up precisely

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:57.080
and hit the canvas with it."

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.130
Live question from Nodia Vira.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:06.370
"When you did the second part of the de Kooning
painting, how could you cover completely the

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.370
first painting?

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.990
I would not be able to do it because I would
get attached to my work."

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:12.470
Actually, this is a really important one.

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.580
When I was a beginning artist, I had that
same fixation.

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:18.980
I'll tell you a little story here, a little
digression, but I think you're gonna like

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.980
it.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:25.720
I was painting in Florence in a studio painting
class in Italy, and at that time... how old

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.720
was I?

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.000
20 let's say.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.230
I considered myself a still-life painter.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:34.160
Okay, it's easy to laugh at yourself in retrospect
but I was quite serious about it at the time.

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:39.240
So I painted in oil and very carefully and
slowly, and I was in a painting class and

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.240
we all painted still life.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.230
That was my wheelhouse, no problem.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:46.830
So I was painting, painting, and I remember
the first critique that we had, the first

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:47.830
crit.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.030
One of students said, "Wow, this painting
it's so perfect."

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:53.690
And I'm smiling, so proud of myself, "Yeah,
I love it."

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:57.740
And then when it got around to my professor,
he said, "Okay, well, I'm gonna tell you to

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:02.680
do something to this painting and you have
to agree to do it."

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.690
Sounds kind of scary, but you're the student,
so okay, I'm here to learn, okay tell me what

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:08.690
to do and I'll do it.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:13.210
He said, "Flip the painting over, wash it
three times with different colors, and then

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:14.210
start again."

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:20.830
Hold on, I've been painting, you know, six
or eight hours a day for a couple weeks now,

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:25.010
and I really like this painting and you're
asking me to obliterate it.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:29.640
But I signed on, I said I would and I did,
and what I ended up doing because I washed

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:34.460
with super-bright colors I never would have
used otherwise, is I ended up painting a big

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:38.180
banana and a big apple, and I forget what
other piece of fruit was there, in a totally

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.690
different style, looked pop actually.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.560
I've never painted in that style since, but
I never would have without that challenge.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:50.670
And actually, it freed me from a very a narrow-minded
idea of what kind of painter I wanted to be

00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:51.780
working at a studio practice.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.000
I thought I had figured out, when in fact
I had figured out very little.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.240
I had the technique down but it wasn't really
open minded.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:04.410
So not falling in love with your work is really,
really important.

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:08.710
If you fall in love with your work too much,
you will inhibit your ability to progress.

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:15.580
If you're always willing to gamble that, "Okay,
I like it but if I gamble it, maybe I can

00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.860
do something that I love or maybe I'm gonna
ruin it."

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:19.860
Okay.

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:23.780
I have it on really good authority, Agnes
Martin, Robert Ryman to bring him up again,

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:28.510
both of these artists they throw away, if
I'm not mistaken, a lot of their work.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:29.510
Why?

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:30.510
Because they're taking risks.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:35.900
You know, these are artists who...in Martin's
case, she's painting into her 90s, not exaggerating,

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.660
who was still making tons of mistakes and
gambling.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:43.810
She had painted for five decades, six decades
and still took risks and wanted to get better

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:45.240
and better and better.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.460
And of course, some of them didn't work, hit
the trash can.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.960
So I think it's one of the most important
things I can try to convince you of today,

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.020
is to take those risks.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.160
And sometimes you're gonna be mad at me.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.490
"Ah, Corey, why did you tell me to do that.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:58.490
I was gonna give that to my mom for Christmas.

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:01.940
It was beautiful and now it's destined for
the trash."

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.400
That will happen too but you're gonna find,
if you really stick to this and you really

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.020
devote yourself to the studio, and you keep
on trying to make things better and risk things,

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:17.650
that you're gonna open up a whole lot of doors
that otherwise would remain closed to you.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:22.530
Chris Ames from the first part of the de Kooning
video that we did a while back.

00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:23.750
Chris writes, "Hi, Corey."

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:24.750
Hi, Chris.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.290
"I love your explanation of the de Kooning
process.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:29.960
I don't work in oils but I would think that
acrylics can also be used for the wet-on-wet

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:30.960
parts.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:34.150
What do you think about Golden Open paints?

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.150
Thanks."

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:40.480
Sure, first point is, acrylics were invented
during the lifetimes of most of the New York

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.120
school, most of the abstract expressionist
artists.

00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.910
Most of those artists experimented in acrylics.

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.980
Some of them really went headlong in that
direction, Agnes Martin.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.390
De Kooning didn't.

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:55.080
I'm sure he tried them but de Kooning is an
artist who really didn't have a whole lot

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.420
of time for acrylic for two reasons.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.180
First of all, because they dry too fast, hence
Chris's question.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.030
Second of all, they just look and feel different.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:08.340
There are natural resins versus synthetic
resins which are plastic, they just feel different,

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.410
they look different.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:14.240
So part one of the answer I have for Chris
is that, yeah, if you do wanna work wet in

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:20.200
wet, if you wanna keep your paint open or
wet for longer, that line of paint or to add

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.840
retarders to your paint.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.320
This is something that takes the drying time
and radically extends it.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.460
This is the way to do it if you work with
acrylics for sure.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.270
However, it's still going to look like an
acrylic, it's still gonna feel like an acrylic.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.730
So if this is your wheelhouse and you're really
comfortable here, and this is what's working

00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:40.410
for you, then absolutely the answer is yes,
that's the direction.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:44.390
However, you're not really gonna make a painting
that looks like a de Kooning with acrylics

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:45.390
ever.

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:50.210
A, because of the way the paints dry, and
B, also when you scrape an acrylic paint,

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:54.560
you're scraping a plastic versus a hard resin
like a linseed oil, and those textures are

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.560
gonna be quite different.

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.840
Also, it's gonna skid, it's gonna smear a
little bit rather than having these kind of

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.410
glassy fractures, like an oil paint film might.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:11.540
Abstractsbybrian, nice name, writes on YouTube,
from the May live Q&amp;A session.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:16.780
"At 20 minutes 12 seconds, you talked about
painting Rothko with watered-down acrylics.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.080
Couldn't you use the Golden High Flows."

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:25.640
So another question about a specific brand
and actually they're both Golden brands here,

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.240
another line of paints from Golden.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:32.640
These are acrylic emulsion paints, High Flows
that really have a low consistency, so they're

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:33.770
very brushable.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.080
Absolutely, try it.

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:40.520
That specific line didn't exist in Rothko
day but certainly when Rothko did paint a

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.190
lot with acrylics at the very end of his life,
he worked with a lot of water.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:46.970
He really thinned them out quite radically.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.580
The point was to make them more translucent
and to make them more flowable.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:54.970
And this line, the High Flows by Golden, that's
exactly what those are meant to do.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:59.420
They're actually not quite as translucent
as the paints that Rothko often worked with.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:04.660
But I probably shouldn't say that because
some of Rothko's late abstract paintings in

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.980
acrylics are quite opaque, the black and gray
paintings.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:10.310
So anyway, yes, absolutely mix and match.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:14.030
I guarantee you, if those paints were available
to Rothko during his time, he would have at

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:18.180
least dabbled with them to try to find out
if there were some new creative pathways forward

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.920
in that material form.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:26.050
Let's jump back into a live question from
D Brennan here on YouTube.

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:28.230
"I very much like Barnett Newman's zip style.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:32.040
When using a painter's tape, paint often seeps
under the tape where it looks like it's firmly

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.360
fixed to the canvas.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:35.130
How can the seepage be prevented?"

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:39.720
All right, so if you check out the Newman
video that we did a while back here, you'll

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:45.450
see that in paintings like Vir Heroicus Sublimis
painting around 1950 here in New York City,

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:47.640
that Newman was very aware of that too.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:52.070
And sometimes, Newman actually liked that,
where the paint would wick under the tape

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:56.650
and have this kind of almost like flame-like
edges from where literally it's seeping under

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:58.430
the tape before peeling it off.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:01.490
At other times, Newman had a really crisp
line.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:08.060
So part of D Brennan's question here, how
do you do that, is really, it's the same tape

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:11.220
but this is actually kind of a, you know,
super simple idea.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:15.960
If you take the tape and right before you
paint it, really rub it and make sure that

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:20.580
adhesive tape is really, really firmly bound
to the canvas, that actually helps a lot.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.370
Because as soon as you're done rubbing, remember
the canvas is bumpy, so it's gonna start opening

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.920
up a little bit and the paint can seep under.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:33.410
So if you prime your canvas and you sand that
priming so it's not bumpy, that's gonna help

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.190
prevent that seepage.

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:42.080
And also, if you really maintain the adhesive
bond, that's gonna help as well.

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.720
And the paint that you apply over it, the
lower viscosity that is, the more flowable,

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:51.140
the more watery, the more solvent rich or
medium rich it is, the more of a tendency

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.780
to have capillary action and to seep under
that tape.

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:58.630
In other words, if you use a stiff paint,
a thick paint which Newman often did as well,

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:03.870
that has very little flowability and you just
paint over that edge of the masking tape,

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:06.940
it's really not gonna have a tendency to run
whatsoever.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.700
So a couple of different approaches here and
certainly if you combine them, it's very possible

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:15.660
to have a super crisp line as many minimalist
artists coming after Newsman's time really

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.780
did.

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.250
Message and question from Wilbaspiny, this
comes from the Kusama video as well.

00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:30.480
"I'm amazed in how just almost the same strokes
comes out with an amazing painting.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:34.120
I like the way you talk through the process
of painting.

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.410
It is easy to understand the whole process."

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.650
Glad to hear that.

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:41.150
Question, "I have not yet worked with oil
but I did research and it said that it is

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:45.430
toxic, and that you would have to have air
flowing through your room to avoid the toxicity.

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:48.660
How do you work with oil when you are in a
closed area or not?"

00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:49.700
Important question.

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:54.050
As a matter of fact, as we move forward in
20th and 21st centuries here in art education

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:58.590
and studio art education, the safety concerns
are becoming much more important.

00:33:58.590 --> 00:34:02.890
Now in the grand scheme of things, there's
a whole lot of awful chemistry out there that

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.120
we're breathing and sometimes eating every
day.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:12.060
If you're dealing with turpentine, everyone's
got different sensitivities to it but turpentine,

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:17.570
let's call it a medium-strength solvent, is
not one of these awful things that's out there.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.359
But if you're exposing it to yourself day
after day after day in a closed environment,

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:26.279
it's a really bad idea as many older painters
can tell you, who did that for decades

00:34:26.279 --> 00:34:31.210
So working with an open window, working in
a big room, working with a fan just to speed

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:36.010
the evaporation and really have more air in
the room so you're not breathing a density

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:38.119
of it, is a good idea.

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:40.730
Closing the containers, don't leave it open
for the whole time.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:46.700
You need to use it, open it, close it again,
put a lid back on, is a good idea.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:51.629
A better idea, I think, the one that I use...
all of those things are good ideas, but if

00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:55.280
you're still inside even if you do have a
window and you even if you do have a fan in

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.690
the background, what have you, turpentine
although I happen to love that material and

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.900
I happen to love the smell although some people,
it drives them crazy, it's still a little

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.200
stronger than you probably need.

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.930
So I recommend odorless mineral spirits, that's
OMS.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:14.200
Sometimes, you can find at a hardware store,
sometimes you need to go to paint store like

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.710
a Benjamin Moore here in the States and I'm
sure in whatever country you have something

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.710
similar.

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:24.040
Odorless mineral spirits is still an organic
solvent, it's still gonna dissolve oil, but

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.760
it has a very, very low toxicity, much lower
than turpentine, by the way.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760
Is it good for you?

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.760
Should you drink it?

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:31.760
No.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.099
But relative to some of the things that are
around us every day in Manhattan, it's something

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:38.150
that is really quite tolerable in my opinion
anyway.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:43.109
Still, a good idea to keep the container closed,
still a good idea to have the window open

00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:45.240
and fans on etc.

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:49.420
The only downside to that is that because
it's a much weaker solvent than turpentine,

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:54.539
it's gonna dissolve your paint, it's gonna
thin your paintless effectively, more slowly.

00:35:54.539 --> 00:35:59.150
It's gonna be a little more difficult to clean
your brushes at the end your studio session.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:00.220
But for me, it's worth it.

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:03.960
As someone who loves painting and hopefully,
I'll be doing this my entire life, I don't

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.990
wanna be one of those aging painters who looks
back and says, "Oh man, I wish I didn't use

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.690
that material in all those decades."

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:15.390
So I think for most painting techniques, you
might not even notice the difference and it's

00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:20.180
really okay, to swap, to kind of downgrade
the strength of your solvent.

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:27.300
Here we have another live question from Yasmin
Mackey[SP] here on YouTube.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.769
"What draws the line between an abstract painting
and a painting that is the result of applying

00:36:30.769 --> 00:36:34.150
color to canvas without a clear intent or
rule?"

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:35.420
Interesting question.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:42.039
Harold Rosenberg, a great poet and art critic
here in New York City of the abstract expressionists,

00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:43.200
worried something similar.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.920
He worried what if these paintings are just
read as in his words, "apocalyptic wallpaper?"

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.160
Write that down, a critical phrase, apocalyptic
wallpaper, right?

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.559
In other words, what if it's just not important?

00:36:55.559 --> 00:36:56.859
What if people don't see it?

00:36:56.859 --> 00:37:01.480
What if this language is empty somehow and
it's just a decoration and maybe it's just

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.329
huge and apocalyptic?

00:37:04.329 --> 00:37:10.759
Well, now we know that a large part of this
is about the artist intentions, but at least

00:37:10.759 --> 00:37:15.950
that amount of importance has to be given
to the viewer or the reader, as many of you

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:18.140
have commented in some of these videos.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:22.329
Of course, everyone has their own opinion
and of course, everyone has their own intentions

00:37:22.329 --> 00:37:23.670
as an artist.

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:29.750
You know, the more thought that goes into
it, the more aesthetic beauty, or aesthetic

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:34.750
ugliness can be equally interesting, that
is achieved by the artist, the less of a concern

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:39.910
this can be as an artist, or as a viewer the
more you can understand these languages.

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:43.839
But let's be frank and I think Yasmin is probably
gonna agree with me here.

00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:47.470
Sometimes when you come into abstract paintings
without studying them, without reading books

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:52.500
about them, or watching videos, they can be
a little off-putting.

00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:53.500
What's the point here?

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:54.660
I just see some flat colors.

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:56.069
It seems random.

00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:57.210
Is this really art?

00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:59.000
What's so interesting about this?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.820
And personally, I think that's a problem with
some of the artists in this movement because

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.140
it is difficult.

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:09.599
When you look at a Renaissance painting, almost
anyone can tell you, "Ooh, that's really good...

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:13.829
that looks really lifelike, that's an amazing
painting," or "Uh, that looks kind of clumsy,

00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:14.829
look at that chin.

00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:17.089
It's all lumpy and awkward.

00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:18.359
Not a great painter."

00:38:18.359 --> 00:38:19.359
Okay?

00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:23.549
So there is something, there is a more pressing
need to understand the artist intentions or

00:38:23.549 --> 00:38:27.920
to focus on the materiality, to focus on the
process, to understand what an artist is trying

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.420
to convey to help the reader, the viewer really
appreciate this stuff.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:33.670
So what's the difference?

00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:37.620
I turn back that question back on you, that's
really up to you.

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.500
With some education, if it's a really good
artist, I think you're gonna answer that question

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:42.500
yourself.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.319
Now, maybe the artist, to be frank, isn't
that interesting, and you educate yourself

00:38:46.319 --> 00:38:47.700
and you don't find anything interesting.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.020
And by the way, that is absolutely your prerogative.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.440
Perhaps, some of you felt that way about some
of the painters that we've explored in the

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.440
videos.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.400
But really to be honest, this question is
part of the reason why I'm so excited about

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:01.250
making these videos because I love teaching
abstract art.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.250
I love turning on light bulbs.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:04.769
Of course, not all of them are gonna turn
on because we have different tastes.

00:39:04.769 --> 00:39:09.560
We come from, you know, different backgrounds
and experiences but if I can help you understand

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.880
something, an artist that I think is really
important, really interesting, really beautiful

00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:18.119
or really interestingly ugly, then as a teacher
that's something that really gets me quite

00:39:18.119 --> 00:39:19.119
excited.

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:27.420
So Yasmin, I hope at least some of these artists,
you're answering that question for yourself.

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:32.839
From the trailer we did last week, AreaECC[SP],
I'm not sure where that is, asks, "Would you

00:39:32.839 --> 00:39:36.530
be able to discuss personal art style and
how to fully develop one?"

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:42.980
Yeah, we could do an MFA on this and spend
a couple years dealing with this one.

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:49.390
Quick answer, let's see, I think really finding
your own voice is the most important thing.

00:39:49.390 --> 00:39:50.510
How to do that?

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:51.779
Well, you already have it in there.

00:39:51.779 --> 00:39:53.119
You just gotta pull it out.

00:39:53.119 --> 00:39:54.450
It's not easy, right?

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:59.822
You know, some of these things that seem fun,
that seem easy, are actually some of the most

00:39:59.822 --> 00:40:00.869
difficult things to do.

00:40:00.869 --> 00:40:01.869
It seems automatic.

00:40:01.869 --> 00:40:03.660
I have a voice, why can't I find it, right?

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:08.760
Well, you need to cull and you need to carve
down and you need to really pursue this with

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.039
time and effort.

00:40:10.039 --> 00:40:14.759
And, you know, if you're just hanging in the
studio on Sunday afternoons, you're probably

00:40:14.759 --> 00:40:17.130
not gonna get there, to be honest.

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:21.400
You know, for those of you out there who are
quite serious about this and who really want

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.900
to achieve something real in painting or sculpture
or whatever medium you pursue, it's hard to

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:27.380
do this as a hobby.

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.450
It's almost impossible to do this as a hobby.

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:35.480
So working with, you know, the artists that
you admire, really honing your craft about

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:41.369
what materials, what techniques are necessary,
what's most interesting to you and then repetition,

00:40:41.369 --> 00:40:43.609
repetition, repetition, repetition, just like
a violin player.

00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:51.660
A lot of artists don't do enough of that these
days, visual artists I should say.

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.660
And communication.

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:53.660
You know, you can't paint in a void.

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:58.859
Very few artists in history have been totally
isolated and really been able to maximize

00:40:58.859 --> 00:40:59.859
their own talents.

00:40:59.859 --> 00:41:00.859
Why?

00:41:00.859 --> 00:41:03.569
It's the same thing I was talking about before.

00:41:03.569 --> 00:41:08.839
It's important to criticize yourself and to
risk yourself and to jeopardize your own ideas.

00:41:08.839 --> 00:41:10.309
This is why going to school is a good idea.

00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:14.240
This is why taking a painting class and being
with not only a professor but other colleagues

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:17.509
is a really good idea, to open yourself up
to criticism.

00:41:17.509 --> 00:41:21.210
Other ideas that you haven't thought of that
are really useful for improving your own.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:27.269
I know that's only a quick answer but it's
a really big question, so it's a start anyway.

00:41:27.269 --> 00:41:32.980
Charles Peters asks, "What should my strategy
be as a 19-year-old with an infinite ambition

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.109
and work ethic to impact the art world?"

00:41:35.109 --> 00:41:36.619
Charles, I like you already.

00:41:36.619 --> 00:41:44.210
Well, kind of the same or a similar question
to what we're discussing here.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.000
Impact the art world, I assume you're talking
about, you know, changing art history.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.349
That's what great artists want to do, right?

00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:51.960
Of course, there's other ways to impact the
art world.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:56.829
You can become a teacher, you can become a
dealer and sell paintings, or promote an artist

00:41:56.829 --> 00:42:01.480
that you really believe in, or become an artist
historian and really write about an artist,

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:03.990
understand an artist in a way that hasn't
been done before.

00:42:03.990 --> 00:42:09.499
But I think you're probably talking about,
as an artist, put the hours in, is the most

00:42:09.499 --> 00:42:10.499
important thing.

00:42:10.499 --> 00:42:18.369
You know, I can't quite explain this but in
today's art world, we don't really have virtuoso

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:19.369
painters.

00:42:19.369 --> 00:42:23.099
There's some really good technical painters
out there but, you know, if you start thinking

00:42:23.099 --> 00:42:28.299
about classical music, thankfully we have
scores of virtuoso pianists and violin players

00:42:28.299 --> 00:42:30.020
and cellist, etc.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.020
Why?

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:34.480
Because they practice for hours and hours
and hours a day.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.829
If you do that as a painter, you will get
much, much better, and I'm not just talking

00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:42.730
about your hand although, for certain kinda
paintings, that's obviously really important,

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:46.220
but I'm also talking about your eye and I
hope one of the things you got from the de

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:51.809
Kooning video is that so much of why de Kooning
paintings are great, greater than mine obviously,

00:42:51.809 --> 00:42:54.299
is because de Kooning had a wonderful eye.

00:42:54.299 --> 00:42:55.770
Why did he have a wonderful eye?

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:59.420
Okay, may be part of that he's born with,
I don't really know him, maybe no one can

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:01.259
really answer that question.

00:43:01.259 --> 00:43:03.970
But de Kooning studied the hell out of art
history.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:09.349
De Kooning loved European old master painting
just as much as he's loved Piet Mondriaan.

00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:10.480
And he was a great synthesizer.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.059
He understood all of that, and he studied
all these different art histories.

00:43:14.059 --> 00:43:19.150
And the way that he was able to develop his
own voice is because he made art history work

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.180
for him.

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.940
He understood his own role in art history.

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:25.349
He understood how these different painterly
approaches and different sets of aesthetics

00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:26.980
were connected.

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:29.150
This is how you become really mature as an
artist.

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:34.509
And if you do that, I can't think of any better
way to maximize your chances in Charles's

00:43:34.509 --> 00:43:38.339
words here, impacting the art world or really
changing art history.

00:43:38.339 --> 00:43:42.880
Charles, good luck to you.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.650
Jessica Naishlinglee[SP] asks on the part
two de Kooning video.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:47.760
"Love the series."

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:48.760
Thanks, Jessica.

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:53.180
As a painter focuses mainly in realism and
surrealism, I've struggled with appreciating

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.549
abstraction, particularly the post-war stuff
we learned about at art school.

00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:59.410
Seeing it explained in this way really gives
me a much better understanding of it, really

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:00.540
looking forward to more."

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.720
Okay, no question, I appreciate that and,
you know, I really love hearing this stuff

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.599
because of course, not everyone is getting
this much out of the series, but I'm really

00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:13.880
happy to know that in some cases, we're really
hitting our mark here.

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:16.559
And again, as I mentioned earlier, abstract
painting is challenging.

00:44:16.559 --> 00:44:21.849
Cubism, a video that we're gonna launch pretty
soon here if I'm not mistaken, is also really

00:44:21.849 --> 00:44:22.849
challenging.

00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:25.940
It's difficult and probably the first time
you saw a cubist painting, you're at a loss

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:27.170
and you're drawing a blank.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:28.650
Maybe, you still are right now.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:32.950
So my goal here , of course, I'm trying to
make nice paintings too just like all of you

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:37.910
are, but my goal is to really open up these
paintings to your understanding and appreciation,

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:43.569
and it's nice to know that at least sometimes,
that's working out.

00:44:43.569 --> 00:44:46.829
Oh, we have a live question here that I've
been neglecting.

00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:53.150
Nicholas Nazmi writes, "I wonder if Corey's
ever considered a career in forgery?"

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:56.809
Well, to be frank, yes.

00:44:56.809 --> 00:45:02.380
One of my first jobs, when I was in Italy
a long time ago, was working at a shop.

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.540
I was just making paintings and I was young
and naive and didn't know what I was doing.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:11.180
And I hope that guy is not watching this video,
but I was making kind of 13th-century-looking

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.279
icon paintings.

00:45:12.279 --> 00:45:15.539
And I loved it because I was studying art
conservation and egg tempera technique and

00:45:15.539 --> 00:45:19.089
the right materials, and I was making these
little paintings, not really thinking about

00:45:19.089 --> 00:45:20.769
where they were going in the world.

00:45:20.769 --> 00:45:24.900
I think they were just sold to tourists and
I hope they were just sold to tourists.

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.160
Anyway, forgery will get you in jail pretty
quickly.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:33.960
You might make a buck if you start googling
around but it's probably not a great idea.

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.589
And actually, the thought has crossed my mind,
I wonder if potential forgers are out there

00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:41.270
watching these kind of videos, as conservators
talk more and more about how paintings get

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:42.270
made.

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.490
Of course, the bad guys are out there too
but it's not gonna get you far, I promise.

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:50.440
And anyway, I'm not gonna be one of them for
sure.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:54.609
No disrespect but I think this guy has a strong
resemblance to the Drakester.

00:45:54.609 --> 00:45:59.510
No disrespect taken, appreciate that.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:03.749
Tony Yada writes, "Is it me or does he really
look like Sandor Clegane," I don't know if

00:46:03.749 --> 00:46:08.100
that's how you say his name, "The Hound from
Game of Thrones," just different voice.

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.130
Now, I don't know who exactly that is but
people are snickering in the background here,

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:13.309
so I'm guessing that's not a compliment.

00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:16.069
But I'm gonna have to google that guy when
I get home.

00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:21.999
I'm not sure about this but Tony Yada, maybe
you're on my bad list and I'll get back to

00:46:21.999 --> 00:46:24.260
you on that one.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:30.519
Vin Diesel of the easel, now this one I can
get behind, that one I can run with, thanks.

00:46:30.519 --> 00:46:34.980
Okay, let's move on to some of the requests
that we have here.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.330
So the request in some of the comment sections
as well as down below, feel free to add to

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:40.430
it now.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:45.250
Thinking about future directions for this
"In The Studio" series, there's been a lot

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.890
of great ideas and honestly, I wish I could
address all of them.

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.839
I'll just address a couple of them here.

00:46:49.839 --> 00:46:54.970
Dojing[SP] writes, "I'm a big fan of the series,
your great art tutorial guide based on profound

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:57.619
art knowledge and techniques which to me is
so useful."

00:46:57.619 --> 00:46:59.670
Really happy to hear that, thanks.

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:02.450
"How about Gerhard Richter next?

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:06.109
Gerhard Richter really one of the most important
living artist we have.

00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:09.599
Richter would be an interesting video because
there's a lot of different Richter styles.

00:47:09.599 --> 00:47:12.220
He makes abstract paintings, he makes figurative
paintings.

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:16.080
He's a self-taught, almost virtuoso oil painter.

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.160
I said there are no virtuoso painters out
there.

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.279
If I had to name one, maybe that's at the
top my list.

00:47:21.279 --> 00:47:23.299
Richter's a really excellent technical painter.

00:47:23.299 --> 00:47:26.980
So, hey, why don't we do three videos on Richter.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.619
I think that'd be really interesting.

00:47:28.619 --> 00:47:30.890
Paint like Basquiat, "You should do Basquiat."

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:31.890
Nice idea.

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.789
In fact, we've gotten a lot of interest in
Basquiat.

00:47:33.789 --> 00:47:39.089
Basquiat, a really cool iconoclast artist,
really inventive, really synthetic about different

00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:41.520
sources that he's pulling together here.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:47.390
And technically, used basically everything
out there, really embraced Rauschenberg's

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:50.109
approach to find art anywhere and everywhere.

00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:54.239
Basquiat started making art as a graffiti
writer, as a street artist, and then very

00:47:54.239 --> 00:48:00.359
smoothly and really powerfully and effectively
shifted his language into easel painting convention,

00:48:00.359 --> 00:48:02.640
but in a really unconventional way.

00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:04.339
I think it's a great idea.

00:48:04.339 --> 00:48:08.019
"Loving In The Studio, learning so much of
you on Klimt.

00:48:08.019 --> 00:48:10.350
Gustav Klimt's materials and techniques would
be awesome.

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:12.249
I would love to learn how to achieve some
of his effects.

00:48:12.249 --> 00:48:18.980
Klimt, going back to beginning of the 20th-century,
secessionists, really interesting, Klimt himself

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:24.789
dialed back to primitive European techniques
including old stuff like pastelia[SP] and

00:48:24.789 --> 00:48:31.579
gilding techniques, scraffito scratching techniques
and really made some beautifully painted surfaces

00:48:31.579 --> 00:48:33.570
and beautifully decorated surfaces.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:35.670
I think that would be really interesting to
take on.

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:40.190
In fact, in doing so, you'd be learning a
lot about, you know, early Renaissance painting

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:43.730
as well since those are some of Klimt's most
useful sources.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:46.960
"Do Hieronymus Bosch speaking of the Renaissance."

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:52.029
Yeah, sure, why don't we just have, you know,
a three-month-long live video and I'll just

00:48:52.029 --> 00:48:55.109
be eating and sleeping and painting for month
after month.

00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:58.450
I'm not sure if MoMA is gonna pay me for my
time for that one, but I'm up for it if you

00:48:58.450 --> 00:49:00.940
are and let's do it.

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:05.790
"Love to see you take on Hans Hofmann, specifically
teaching his push and pull technique."

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:09.940
Jim Ellsbury here referring to Hans Hofmann,
one of the great educators and color theorists

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:11.920
of the 20th century.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:16.760
Hoffman and his countryman, Yosef Albers,
both of those guys German artists and theorist,

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:21.250
both of them immigrated here to the United
States in the context of World War II.

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:26.270
Both of them, they continue to be really important
and really useful theorists, as well as painters

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:31.230
to painters like you, Jim Ellsbury and many
other of you I'm sure.

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:32.480
I think that would be a great one.

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:38.160
For me, personally, Hofmann is a much more
interesting thinker and seer than he is a

00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.630
painter, just my two cents.

00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:45.009
But I think in painting his style, you really
understand his aesthetics, his approach to

00:49:45.009 --> 00:49:50.339
color and I think that continues to be really
useful for an extremely wide variety of other

00:49:50.339 --> 00:49:51.430
painting techniques.

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:56.599
A bunch of Francis Bacon here, some Cy Twombly,
Basquiat again, Helen Frankenthaler.

00:49:56.599 --> 00:50:02.650
You know, I really like a lot of these ideas,
and I hope that we can pursue a bunch of them

00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:04.649
in the coming months.

00:50:04.649 --> 00:50:05.900
So we're gonna wrap here.

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.230
Thanks again for your attention.

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:09.999
In case you have missed it, be sure to check
our last release.

00:50:09.999 --> 00:50:14.390
That was the part two of the de Kooning video,
you can probably find it on the right of your

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:16.410
screen here, if I'm not mistaken.

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:17.869
Check back in the next couple weeks.

00:50:17.869 --> 00:50:19.710
We will be releasing our next one.

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:24.739
In fact, I met one of my colleagues here and
saw some of that footage being edited.

00:50:24.739 --> 00:50:28.359
That one, I can tell, you will be on cubism,
specifically the work of Georges Braque and

00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:29.880
Pablo Picasso.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:35.419
Some of the great innovators of the first
couple of decades of the 20th century.

00:50:35.419 --> 00:50:38.999
That should be coming, I don't know, any way
in the next couple of weeks.

00:50:38.999 --> 00:50:45.279
I did mention before that we'd be announcing
our next project that we're gonna start painting

00:50:45.279 --> 00:50:46.279
but I lied actually.

00:50:46.279 --> 00:50:47.809
We're not quite ready to do that.

00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:52.430
The reason why is we take this really seriously
and we're doing a lot of research to make

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:55.529
sure that we're really making the best videos
that we can.

00:50:55.529 --> 00:50:59.819
We almost decided on our next one but anyway,
I can tell you that by all means, all the

00:50:59.819 --> 00:51:04.470
comments that I just mentioned and then some,
we're certainly taking into consideration,

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:08.690
except maybe not that Bosch one, sorry about
that.

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:12.869
Yeah, so if we didn't get to your question
today, sorry about that.

00:51:12.869 --> 00:51:14.989
I will try to get to some in text.

00:51:14.989 --> 00:51:19.309
Also, feel free to keep leaving those questions
down below and I promise I will get to them

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:21.920
next time we do a session like this.

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:23.470
So thanks for tuning in.

00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:24.470
Keep questions coming.
