with musicians where there's still a

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060
with musicians where there's still a
 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.580
with musicians where there's still a
viable kind of classical tradition they

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
viable kind of classical tradition they
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.689
viable kind of classical tradition they
can they could become part of an

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699
can they could become part of an
 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.950
can they could become part of an
orchestra and they can learn the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960
orchestra and they can learn the
 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.589
orchestra and they can learn the
repertory and things like this but young

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
repertory and things like this but young

artists i think learn from the art that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
artists i think learn from the art that
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.250
artists i think learn from the art that
came before them and the circumstances

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
came before them and the circumstances
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.470
came before them and the circumstances
of their own lives and so I think it's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
of their own lives and so I think it's
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.500
of their own lives and so I think it's
always been the case but I think today a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510
always been the case but I think today a
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.540
always been the case but I think today a
lot of artists are more in the present

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910
moment than they are with any kind of
 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.520
moment than they are with any kind of
vivifying relationship with the past and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
vivifying relationship with the past and
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.290
vivifying relationship with the past and
you can do good things out of that but I

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
you can do good things out of that but I
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.360
you can do good things out of that but I
think it's actually would a richer way

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370
think it's actually would a richer way
 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.680

to be able to pull from the president

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

to be able to pull from the president
the past together
