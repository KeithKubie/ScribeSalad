00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.360
TIM WEINGARTEN: The
Hunt is a community

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.540
that provides styling
recommendations and advice

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.880
to each other.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.900
One member of The Hunt could
be asking the question of,

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.240
what should I wear, and
another member of The Hunt

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.330
is answering that
question by providing

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.570
products, style recommendations,
advice, and so forth.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.060
The community is
now more productive.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.950
It's working better
than ever before.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.137
And this is due to the
success of our Android app.

00:00:25.137 --> 00:00:26.970
JENNY DAVIS: Material
design was a great way

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.733
to start building
the Android app.

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:31.110
It was like having a
team of design experts

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.610
helping you build the best
product for an Android device.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.736
ALEX FISHWICK: It allowed us
to simplify a lot of the things

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:39.360
that we were trying
to tackle early on.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760
It's an excellent
structure which

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.984
allowed us to just focus on what
was important for our users.

00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:46.150
JENNY DAVIS: The Floating
Action button was actually

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.110
really intuitive to our users.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.550
We use it for starting a
hunt and adding a find,

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.425
our two main actions.

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:53.570
And we've tested it
with our beta testers,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.210
and they just got it.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.210
TIM WEINGARTEN: On Android
with the Play Store,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.640
we are able to iterate as
fast as we do with our web app

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.140
today.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.114
We can push our production app
to our user base every day.

00:01:03.114 --> 00:01:05.030
That's not possible on
other mobile platforms.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.000
ALEX FISHWICK: If we
were to do it again,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.040
I would definitely go
after Android first.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.706
TIM WEINGARTEN: The results that
have been most compelling to me

00:01:10.706 --> 00:01:13.850
are, we had about 15% of our
weekly users starting hunts.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.930
Now on Android, in particular
with material design,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.280
it's increased to 20% of
our Android user base.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.910
We're seeing 150,000
hunts started a week.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.500
And our Android community has
increased our participation

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.670
on hunt solving from 10%
of our weekly users to 15%.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.560
The conversation
around what to buy

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.440
is not happening
on content sites.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.190
It's not happening on
social media sites.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.690
It's happening in these social
commerce sites like The Hunt.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.420
More and more retailers and
brands are joining The Hunt,

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.690
and they're providing
style recommendations

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.040
to our community by having
their teams solve hunts.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.611
It doesn't feel
like it's marketing.

00:01:49.611 --> 00:01:50.735
It doesn't feel commercial.

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:52.110
It doesn't feel
like advertising.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.650
Because they're really
engaging in a conversation

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.860
with their community.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.890
We believe that as
we go international,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.330
as we scale our user
base to tens of millions

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.990
of community members,
that The Hunt on Android

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.620
will be our platform
to make this happen.
