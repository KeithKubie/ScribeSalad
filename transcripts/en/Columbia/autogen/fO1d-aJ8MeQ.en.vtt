vaccines we know how to prevent HIV we
 

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:14.420
vaccines we know how to prevent HIV we
know how to treat HIV

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:14.430
know how to treat HIV
 

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:16.370

you know how to prevent mothers from

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380
you know how to prevent mothers from
 

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.680
you know how to prevent mothers from
dying in childbirth we know how to

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:18.690
dying in childbirth we know how to

so we have all this knowledge but then

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:24.900
so we have all this knowledge but then
 

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.839
so we have all this knowledge but then
you look on the other hand when you

00:35:26.839 --> 00:35:26.849
you look on the other hand when you
 

00:35:26.849 --> 00:35:28.730
you look on the other hand when you
contrast the wealth of knowledge we have

today we don't have all the answers we

today we don't have all the answers we
 

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.450
today we don't have all the answers we
need a lot more answers but we have a

need a lot more answers but we have a
 

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.120
need a lot more answers but we have a
lot of knowledge in our knowledge bag in

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:35.130
lot of knowledge in our knowledge bag in
 

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:37.700
lot of knowledge in our knowledge bag in
our toolbox and then you contrast what

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:37.710
our toolbox and then you contrast what
 

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:40.609

we know versus the state of global

00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:40.619
we know versus the state of global

internationally and you can see the

00:35:45.859 --> 00:35:45.869
internationally and you can see the
 

00:35:45.869 --> 00:35:48.740
internationally and you can see the
schism that exists and why is there such

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:48.750
schism that exists and why is there such
 

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:53.059
schism that exists and why is there such
such a schism and I think one of the

00:35:53.059 --> 00:35:53.069
such a schism and I think one of the
 

00:35:53.069 --> 00:35:57.460
such a schism and I think one of the
reason is that we have valued very much

00:35:57.460 --> 00:35:57.470
reason is that we have valued very much
 

00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.890
reason is that we have valued very much
the discovery of knowledge and that's

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900
the discovery of knowledge and that's
 

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.829
the discovery of knowledge and that's
very important and that's absolutely a

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839
very important and that's absolutely a
 

00:36:03.839 --> 00:36:06.140
very important and that's absolutely a
support they need for discovery and you

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:06.150
support they need for discovery and you
 

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:08.329
support they need for discovery and you
need for more and more discovery the

00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:08.339
need for more and more discovery the
 

00:36:08.339 --> 00:36:10.880
need for more and more discovery the
discovery of knowledge and I believe we

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:10.890
discovery of knowledge and I believe we
 

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:13.849
discovery of knowledge and I believe we
have not valued as much how do we take

00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859
have not valued as much how do we take
 

00:36:13.859 --> 00:36:16.789
have not valued as much how do we take
that knowledge into action we assumed

00:36:16.789 --> 00:36:16.799
that knowledge into action we assumed
 

00:36:16.799 --> 00:36:18.950
that knowledge into action we assumed
that once a discovery is made that

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960
that once a discovery is made that
 

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.230
that once a discovery is made that
somehow magically it's going to be

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240
somehow magically it's going to be
 

00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.059
somehow magically it's going to be
disseminated successfully and it's going

00:36:23.059 --> 00:36:23.069
disseminated successfully and it's going
 

00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:24.859
disseminated successfully and it's going
to happen and the world will read the

00:36:24.859 --> 00:36:24.869
to happen and the world will read the
 

00:36:24.869 --> 00:36:27.710
to happen and the world will read the
benefits of that knowledge and the

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720
benefits of that knowledge and the
 

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:29.120
benefits of that knowledge and the
reality is that that doesn't happen

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:29.130
reality is that that doesn't happen
 

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.539
reality is that that doesn't happen

speech that challenged universities at
that point in time and challenged

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:14.970
that point in time and challenged
 

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.390
that point in time and challenged
educators at that point in time to think

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:17.400
educators at that point in time to think
 

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.309
educators at that point in time to think
they have beyond the walls of

they have beyond the walls of
 

00:37:19.319 --> 00:37:21.019
they have beyond the walls of
universities and think about how they're

00:37:21.019 --> 00:37:21.029
universities and think about how they're
 

00:37:21.029 --> 00:37:23.299
universities and think about how they're
educating students and think of the

00:37:23.299 --> 00:37:23.309
educating students and think of the
 

00:37:23.309 --> 00:37:25.740
educating students and think of the
responsibilities of a university to

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:25.750
responsibilities of a university to
 

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.470
responsibilities of a university to
it's community and at that time it was

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480
it's community and at that time it was
 

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:30.270

walls of Colombia and think of New York

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:32.230
walls of Colombia and think of New York
 

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:35.310
walls of Colombia and think of New York
City in the 1930s and how can the city

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:35.320
City in the 1930s and how can the city
 

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.860
City in the 1930s and how can the city
inform the education of the students and

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:37.870
inform the education of the students and
 

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:40.530
inform the education of the students and
how can the city inform the actions of

how can the city inform the actions of
 

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.830
how can the city inform the actions of
the University and reflecting on that

the University and reflecting on that
 

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.380
the University and reflecting on that
and the university today not just come

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:46.390
and the university today not just come

are we we have to think beyond the walls

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:51.100
are we we have to think beyond the walls
 

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:52.830
are we we have to think beyond the walls
of our universities to our immediate

community but now we are global
 

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.630
community but now we are global
universities we have to think about the

00:37:57.630 --> 00:37:57.640
universities we have to think about the
 

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.060
universities we have to think about the
the walls what what lies behind the wall

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:00.070
the walls what what lies behind the wall
 

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:01.980
the walls what what lies behind the wall
of the university not just in our

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:01.990
of the university not just in our

community in New York City for Columbia
 

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.230
community in New York City for Columbia
but globally and how what happens in the

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240
but globally and how what happens in the
 

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.150
but globally and how what happens in the
world should inform what we do as an

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160
world should inform what we do as an
 

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:12.030
world should inform what we do as an
education institution but also how we

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040
education institution but also how we
 

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:16.530
education institution but also how we
prepare our students for the future so

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:16.540
prepare our students for the future so
 

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.300
prepare our students for the future so
going back to that schism and that

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:18.310
going back to that schism and that
 

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.940
going back to that schism and that
responsibility gap that I mentioned I

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:20.950
responsibility gap that I mentioned I
 

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.970
responsibility gap that I mentioned I
think there are ways in which and I

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:23.980
think there are ways in which and I
 

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.160
think there are ways in which and I
believe quite strongly that public

believe quite strongly that public
 

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:27.870
believe quite strongly that public
health has a unique role to play a

discovering by doing and then they take
 

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:01.230

these innovations and they take them
 

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.340

again to discovery and innovation and
 

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.940
again to discovery and innovation and

science but also as a catalyst for
 

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.700

taking that into action through very

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:02.710
taking that into action through very
 

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:05.640
taking that into action through very
rigorous scientific endeavor and I think

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:05.650
rigorous scientific endeavor and I think
 

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.380
rigorous scientific endeavor and I think
it's by doing this that we can actually

it's by doing this that we can actually
 

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:08.430
it's by doing this that we can actually
change the world

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:08.440
change the world
 

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:13.020
change the world

Sheryl started by talking about treaties
 

00:42:15.819 --> 00:42:20.099
Sheryl started by talking about treaties
for example and I was wondering if you

00:42:20.099 --> 00:42:20.109
for example and I was wondering if you
 

00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:24.349
for example and I was wondering if you
could comment on some models of

for that would best implement government

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:29.920
for that would best implement government
 

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.770
for that would best implement government
governance or systems that would best

you maybe go back to the global health

00:42:47.819 --> 00:42:47.829
you maybe go back to the global health

I was wondering if you could talk about

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:05.780
I was wondering if you could talk about
 

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:07.930
I was wondering if you could talk about
what what do you think are some ways to

00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:07.940
what what do you think are some ways to
 

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:10.450
what what do you think are some ways to
improve the implementation science issue

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:10.460
improve the implementation science issue
 

00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:13.359
improve the implementation science issue
in public health you discussed thank you

00:56:13.359 --> 00:56:13.369
in public health you discussed thank you
 

00:56:13.369 --> 00:56:16.780
in public health you discussed thank you
I think it's a very important question

00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:16.790
I think it's a very important question
 

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:18.820
I think it's a very important question
and maybe we'll decide what is the

00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:18.830
and maybe we'll decide what is the
 

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:21.220
and maybe we'll decide what is the

I haven't really thought about what's
 

00:56:27.329 --> 00:56:29.839
I haven't really thought about what's
called implementation research or

called implementation research or
 

00:56:29.849 --> 00:56:32.380

a period of disability in the very

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:32.540
a period of disability in the very
 

00:58:32.540 --> 00:58:35.560
a period of disability in the very
latest years of life and I wondered what

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:35.570
latest years of life and I wondered what
 

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:37.330
latest years of life and I wondered what
whether public health professionals

00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:37.340
whether public health professionals
 

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.370
whether public health professionals
think about this period and the

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:39.380
think about this period and the
 

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:40.840
think about this period and the
tremendous impact that it's going to

00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:40.850
tremendous impact that it's going to
 

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:45.040
tremendous impact that it's going to
have fiscally and also societally on the

remarkable things is that we're going

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:03.530
remarkable things is that we're going
 

00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:06.040
remarkable things is that we're going
through a demographic revolution I would

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:06.050
through a demographic revolution I would
 

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:09.160
through a demographic revolution I would
say that the success of public health in

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:09.170
say that the success of public health in
 

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:11.980
say that the success of public health in
the main supported by great medicine and

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:11.990
the main supported by great medicine and
 

00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:14.170

and people are getting to live much

00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:23.960
and people are getting to live much
 

00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:28.360

have a regular access to care ability to
 

01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:12.640
have a regular access to care ability to
see a physician regularly and so this is

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:12.650
see a physician regularly and so this is
 

01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:17.190
see a physician regularly and so this is
only one component of the larger

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:20.750
challenged prevention and I think we
 

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:23.289
challenged prevention and I think we
need to have the access issue dealt with

01:02:23.289 --> 01:02:23.299
need to have the access issue dealt with
 

01:02:23.299 --> 01:02:24.880
need to have the access issue dealt with
when you have 16 to 17 percent of the

you know you're not able to have your

advanced so it's important that we get

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:44.210
advanced so it's important that we get

said it's not a perfect law but it is a

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280
said it's not a perfect law but it is a
 

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:53.410
said it's not a perfect law but it is a
good first step and I think we have to

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:53.420
good first step and I think we have to
 

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:59.230
good first step and I think we have to
make these investments now as as much as

01:02:59.230 --> 01:02:59.240
make these investments now as as much as
 

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.030
make these investments now as as much as
they will cost now they will cost us far

01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:01.040
they will cost now they will cost us far
 

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:03.940
they will cost now they will cost us far
more later if we don't invest now

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:03.950
more later if we don't invest now
 

01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:05.710
more later if we don't invest now
ensuring that people get into the system

01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:05.720
ensuring that people get into the system
 

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:08.380
ensuring that people get into the system
that we bring down costs and that we

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:08.390
that we bring down costs and that we
 

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:10.180
that we bring down costs and that we
ultimately improve quality and that's

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:10.190
ultimately improve quality and that's
 

01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:11.530
ultimately improve quality and that's
just not quality in the health care

01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:11.540
just not quality in the health care
 

01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:13.120
just not quality in the health care
system but also quality in the public

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:13.130
system but also quality in the public
 

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:14.950
system but also quality in the public
health system and so one of the

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960
health system and so one of the
 

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:17.530
health system and so one of the
conversations that we're having now at

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:17.540
conversations that we're having now at
 

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.360
conversations that we're having now at
the state level is what is the role of

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:19.370
the state level is what is the role of
 

01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:22.150
the state level is what is the role of
public health and ensuring quality and

01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160
public health and ensuring quality and
 

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.980
public health and ensuring quality and
so we have these two sort of separate

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:23.990
so we have these two sort of separate
 

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:25.600
so we have these two sort of separate
quality conversations happening at the

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:25.610
quality conversations happening at the
 

01:03:25.610 --> 01:03:28.450
quality conversations happening at the
same time ultimately we're hoping to

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:28.460
same time ultimately we're hoping to
 

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:32.620
same time ultimately we're hoping to
bring down costs but I think we won't

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:32.630
bring down costs but I think we won't
 

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:34.600
bring down costs but I think we won't
see some of that initially that'll sort

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:34.610
see some of that initially that'll sort
 

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:37.000
see some of that initially that'll sort
of come in stages and I'm not sure what

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:37.010
of come in stages and I'm not sure what
 

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:39.840
of come in stages and I'm not sure what
the alternative is I mean to leave that

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:39.850
the alternative is I mean to leave that
 

01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:41.800
the alternative is I mean to leave that
percentage of the population without

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:41.810
percentage of the population without
 

01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:42.460
percentage of the population without

it just doesn't bode well for us and

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:44.990
it just doesn't bode well for us and
 

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:47.110
it just doesn't bode well for us and
certainly from a competitive standpoint

01:03:47.110 --> 01:03:47.120
certainly from a competitive standpoint
 

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.030
certainly from a competitive standpoint
as well I mean if you're a business and

01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:49.040
as well I mean if you're a business and
 

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:51.370
as well I mean if you're a business and
you're hiring employees you want them to

you're hiring employees you want them to
 

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.630
you're hiring employees you want them to
be healthy you don't want to be

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.600
be healthy you don't want to be
absorbing those costs in the future so I

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:55.610
absorbing those costs in the future so I
 

01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:57.100
absorbing those costs in the future so I
think it's something that we have a

01:03:57.100 --> 01:03:57.110
think it's something that we have a
 

01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:59.410
think it's something that we have a
moral obligation to do and how we sort

01:03:59.410 --> 01:03:59.420
moral obligation to do and how we sort
 

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.970
moral obligation to do and how we sort
of fine-tune those components and what

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:00.980
of fine-tune those components and what
 

01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:04.450
of fine-tune those components and what
that looks like in States is an evolving

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:04.460
that looks like in States is an evolving
 

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:06.850
that looks like in States is an evolving
challenge and conversation and so we're

01:04:06.850 --> 01:04:06.860
challenge and conversation and so we're
 

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.500
challenge and conversation and so we're
trying to give states and flexibility to

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:08.510
trying to give states and flexibility to
 

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:11.740
trying to give states and flexibility to
implement the law given the challenges

01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:11.750
implement the law given the challenges
 

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:16.000

about what health means we mostly had

about what health means we mostly had
 

01:04:49.370 --> 01:04:52.450
about what health means we mostly had
this sort of unstated concept that what

disease and what I've noticed after
 

01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:58.030

treating patients now for some time is
 

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.120

that we really focus on this idea of

that we really focus on this idea of
 

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:03.460

a society we need to start thinking
 

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:20.740
a society we need to start thinking
about health as sometimes living with

about health as sometimes living with

with dying and that we need to sort of
 

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:30.460

return to a way of thinking about health
 

01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:32.710

as not eradicating or fixing things

but also how to incorporate living

01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:37.220

and I was wondering from the public

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:41.840
and I was wondering from the public
 

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:44.770
and I was wondering from the public
health standpoint whether you have a

01:05:44.770 --> 01:05:44.780
health standpoint whether you have a
 

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:46.330
health standpoint whether you have a
definition of health or whether that's

01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:46.340
definition of health or whether that's
 

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.160
definition of health or whether that's
sort of part of the ongoing discussion

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:48.170
sort of part of the ongoing discussion
 

01:05:48.170 --> 01:05:51.040
sort of part of the ongoing discussion
you said that so eloquently that I'm not

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:51.050
you said that so eloquently that I'm not
 

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:55.810
you said that so eloquently that I'm not
sure the rest of us can add without

01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:55.820
sure the rest of us can add without
 

01:05:55.820 --> 01:05:58.780
sure the rest of us can add without
detracting but does anyone want to add

01:05:58.780 --> 01:05:58.790
detracting but does anyone want to add
 

01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:03.270
detracting but does anyone want to add
to that and I can add a word or two I do

01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:03.280
to that and I can add a word or two I do
 

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.610
to that and I can add a word or two I do
agree with you I think we've narrowly

01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:06.620
agree with you I think we've narrowly
 

01:06:06.620 --> 01:06:09.700
agree with you I think we've narrowly
defined prevention I believe as people

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:09.710
defined prevention I believe as people
 

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:11.560
defined prevention I believe as people
define prevention and we sort of

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:11.570
define prevention and we sort of
 

01:06:11.570 --> 01:06:13.240
define prevention and we sort of
calculus thought of Public Health as

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:13.250
calculus thought of Public Health as
 

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:16.650
calculus thought of Public Health as
prevention of disease and and

01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:16.660
prevention of disease and and
 

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.140
prevention of disease and and
unfortunately we know that some people

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:20.150
unfortunately we know that some people
 

01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:22.840
unfortunately we know that some people
will get some disease because we don't

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:22.850
will get some disease because we don't
 

01:06:22.850 --> 01:06:25.720
will get some disease because we don't
have solutions we don't have 100%

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:25.730
have solutions we don't have 100%
 

01:06:25.730 --> 01:06:28.540
have solutions we don't have 100%
prevention interventions so we need to

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:28.550
prevention interventions so we need to
 

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:30.490
prevention interventions so we need to
broaden I believe we should broaden the

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:30.500
broaden I believe we should broaden the
 

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.080
broaden I believe we should broaden the
definition of public health it's it's

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:32.090
definition of public health it's it's
 

01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:33.670
definition of public health it's it's
really prevention this is but it's also

01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680
really prevention this is but it's also
 

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.730
really prevention this is but it's also
really prevention of disability and

01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:36.740
really prevention of disability and
 

01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:40.360
really prevention of disability and
morbidity mortality from disease and I

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:40.370
morbidity mortality from disease and I
 

01:06:40.370 --> 01:06:43.060
morbidity mortality from disease and I
think you can see that very graphically

01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:43.070
think you can see that very graphically
 

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:44.640
think you can see that very graphically
when you look at for example diabetes

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:44.650
when you look at for example diabetes
 

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:46.980
when you look at for example diabetes
certainly we can try to prevent diabetes

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:46.990
certainly we can try to prevent diabetes
 

01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:49.690
certainly we can try to prevent diabetes
but also when you look at the outcome of

01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:49.700
but also when you look at the outcome of
 

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:52.270
but also when you look at the outcome of
someone who has diabetes who has access

01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:52.280
someone who has diabetes who has access
 

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:55.300
someone who has diabetes who has access
to healthcare versus someone from a

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:55.310
to healthcare versus someone from a
 

01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:57.550
to healthcare versus someone from a
developing country who has nothing you

01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:57.560
developing country who has nothing you
 

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.719
developing country who has nothing you
will see that their outcome is very

01:06:59.719 --> 01:06:59.729
will see that their outcome is very
 

01:06:59.729 --> 01:07:01.789
will see that their outcome is very
and these disparities exists within our

01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799
and these disparities exists within our
 

01:07:01.799 --> 01:07:03.709
and these disparities exists within our
own society so I think that we're only

01:07:03.709 --> 01:07:03.719
own society so I think that we're only
 

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:05.779
own society so I think that we're only
broad and I believe that public health

01:07:05.779 --> 01:07:05.789
broad and I believe that public health
 

01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:07.519
broad and I believe that public health
needs to be much broader than just total

01:07:07.519 --> 01:07:07.529
needs to be much broader than just total
 

01:07:07.529 --> 01:07:09.769
needs to be much broader than just total
prevention as we has it has been

01:07:09.769 --> 01:07:09.779
prevention as we has it has been
 

01:07:09.779 --> 01:07:12.169
prevention as we has it has been
traditionally conceptualized to also

01:07:12.169 --> 01:07:12.179
traditionally conceptualized to also
 

01:07:12.179 --> 01:07:14.319
traditionally conceptualized to also
prevention of disability as well as

01:07:14.319 --> 01:07:14.329
prevention of disability as well as
 

01:07:14.329 --> 01:07:17.870
prevention of disability as well as
ability or disability as well and that's

01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:17.880
ability or disability as well and that's
 

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.880
ability or disability as well and that's
why I think really this is a great

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:19.890
why I think really this is a great
 

01:07:19.890 --> 01:07:21.890
why I think really this is a great
moment for Public Health because it's it

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900
moment for Public Health because it's it
 

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:26.079
moment for Public Health because it's it

is do you think the American people are
willing to pay for the application of

willing to pay for the application of
 

01:07:46.919 --> 01:07:49.189
willing to pay for the application of
