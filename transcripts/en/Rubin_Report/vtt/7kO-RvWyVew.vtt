WEBVTT

1
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.660
All right,
so let's really focus on what you've done with them,

2
00:00:07.661 --> 00:00:11.800
Mckayla school that you started in 2014 there was a lot in,

3
00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:16.790
in the research that I was doing about discipline really before you even get to

4
00:00:16.791 --> 00:00:21.710
education.
So you guys do a bootcamp before you get to teach in them anything.

5
00:00:21.711 --> 00:00:26.440
You're actually teaching them some things that purely about discipline and sort

6
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:28.900
of how to live,
how to behave.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I know.

7
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.040
And that's because we believe if you haven't taught them how to behave,

8
00:00:31.041 --> 00:00:34.190
then you can't give them a detention for it because they don't know how.

9
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.370
And the reason why they don't know how is because we know that elsewhere,

10
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.720
they haven't necessarily been taught,

11
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.520
they haven't necessarily learned that at home.

12
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.250
They certainly want to learn it at other schools.
Um,

13
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.060
and that's because our expectations are really high.
And so we teach them,

14
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.890
we have silence in the car doors for instance.

15
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.520
So that's something people come and they say,
why do you have to be so extreme?

16
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.360
I'll tell you why you have to be so extreme because otherwise you've got kids

17
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.260
fighting in the corridors,
bashing each other's heads against the wall.

18
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.130
Some schools where teachers are scared to walk through the corridors because

19
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.020
it's such mayhem,
you have silence.

20
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.060
Everybody just moves really quickly to their lessons.

21
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.610
You've got change over that takes maybe a minute and a half.

22
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.100
Children aren't losing loads of time from their lessons.

23
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:15.980
I always say 59 minutes out of every 60 minutes in the lesson.

24
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.040
You've got it at MCKAYLA and we're trying to catch them up.
You know,

25
00:01:19.041 --> 00:01:21.800
a lot of our kids come to us with a reading age of a five year old,

26
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.840
six year old when they are 11 years old.
In fact,

27
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.470
I mean some of them aren't like that.
Some of them are Oxbridge material.

28
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.950
And we'll go to Oxford and Cambridge and some of them need real help so that

29
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:35.600
they don't leave school illiterate.
And innumerate 20% of the kids in,

30
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.860
uh,
Britain leaves school illiterate and innumerate right?

31
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.400
20% one out of five kids now.
And that's functionally,

32
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:46.560
so it looks like they can read,
but the cat really re right.

33
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.170
And this is happening all across the country.
Um,

34
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.410
and it's become normal to expect that now none of our kids going to be in that

35
00:01:54.411 --> 00:01:57.620
position because,
uh,
we teach them so,

36
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.340
and we teach them in an environment where the children are able to respect their

37
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:03.920
teachers.
They love their teachers,
they thank them for,

38
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.780
for the lessons at the end of their lessons.

39
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.750
They say good morning and good afternoon and so on.

40
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:12.650
And things that you would never imagine.
You know,
in a city,
kids,
you,
you,

41
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.040
you know,
if you have an idea in your head of what needs to see,
kids are like,

42
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:16.970
you imagine the boys walking with their,

43
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.900
with the trousers down here and that Bob kind of way and,
and,

44
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.170
and girls dressing in a way that isn't appropriate at our school.

45
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.010
None of that exists.
Um,
so you do have a dress code,
right?
Well,

46
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:30.290
they have a uniform,
a uniform,
and that's normal in Britain.

47
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:34.100
Everybody has a uniform.
Yeah.
But the thing is we actually stick to the uniform.

48
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.480
So you go elsewhere there,
that ties a down.
The shirts rung tagged,

49
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.020
they look like a mess.
They walk like a gangster.
I'm always saying to the kids,

50
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:44.770
I mean if they start,
they ever start bopping like that.
I said,

51
00:02:44.771 --> 00:02:48.170
you look like a gangster,
you need to stop that.
Right?
Um,
and they get it.

52
00:02:48.171 --> 00:02:49.940
They say,
yeah,
yeah,
Miss.
Yeah,
yeah,
I get it.
I get it.

53
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.700
And then they stopped doing it because we talk about getting into the best

54
00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:53.534
universities.

55
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.060
We want you to get the Ivy League universities to get to Russell Group

56
00:02:56.061 --> 00:02:58.760
universities in Britain and we want you to have,
you know,

57
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.930
you aim for the moon and you'll land amongst the stars.
That's why we think.

58
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:05.560
Right.
And so they're all really ambitious and they're all working hard.

59
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.700
Why anyone would be against this as a concept?

60
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.840
I don't know.
So when you hear pushback against that,

61
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:17.950
I guess it's that people think it's like presumptuous or something to imply that

62
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:21.990
their parents can't do it.
Even if often the parents are failing or,

63
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.880
or the parents just have to work too hard and they don't have time to do the

64
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:26.410
things that you are doing.

65
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:30.220
And I think then people think there's a racial element to that.
So if you,

66
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.050
if you even address that,
I shouldn't even have a problem with it itself.

67
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.740
They don't like the idea of us being in charge.
They don't like,

68
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.120
they think being an authority means that we must be Nazis.

69
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.990
I've been called not a Nazi many a time,

70
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.930
which is a bit ironic when you think that what the Nazis would've done to

71
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:47.920
somebody like me,
but

72
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.630
exactly.
So,

73
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.660
and they don't like the idea of us being in authority and us being in charge.

74
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.410
So,
um,
one we're really key on discipline,
but two,

75
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.780
we want the disciplines so that we can teach them properly.

76
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.040
And this is where you referring to what you said?
Yes.

77
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.810
I was watching you at the Oxford Union and you'd set,

78
00:04:10.811 --> 00:04:13.210
have on how kids need to be taught properly.
And I was,

79
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.270
and you'd said they need to be taught critical thinking and take me to task.

80
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.480
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The thing is is that

81
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.740
you can't teach critical thinking,
right?

82
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.070
People are critical in their thinking or independently minded or inquisitive

83
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.300
when they know lots about something.

84
00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.850
And it's only by knowing lots.
It's like the 10,000 hour thing.
You know,

85
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:43.270
you got Malcolm Gladwell,
you've got,
you know,
Steve Jobs,
you got the Beatles,

86
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.250
you spent a lot of time doing something.

87
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.490
You will get really good at it and then you'll be able to break the rules.

88
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.560
But if you're trying to break the rules right,

89
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.800
right away when you don't know anything,
then you end up with kids.

90
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.780
And this is the public don't realize just how bad things are where kids don't

91
00:04:58.781 --> 00:05:00.730
know where Paris is.
You know,

92
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.480
kids don't know in Britain who Winston Churchill is,
you know,
they genuinely,

93
00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:06.460
they have no idea.

94
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.570
And that's because nobody's taught them because people are anti knowledge.

95
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:14.080
So the grandfather to like the whole knowledge movement is,
is uh,

96
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.590
ed Hirsch and he's an American.
His most recent book is why knowledge matters,

97
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:21.700
which I would encourage all of your viewers to,
to read.
Um,

98
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.190
you know,
education is the most important thing in any country.
Right.
And,

99
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:27.760
uh,

100
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.120
and that's one of why I'm so pleased to be talking to you because people need to

101
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:32.870
realize,
you know,
you,
you,

102
00:05:32.871 --> 00:05:37.270
you can have all your arguments about free speech and about,
about,
I don't know,

103
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.290
guns and about whatever it is you want.

104
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.600
But if the schools are not teaching children properly,

105
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.630
then that is the end of any country.
Right.

106
00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.020
And I am desperately trying to shout as much as I can to tell people to that we

107
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:56.020
need to do something and,
and we are doing something.
I mean,

108
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:58.460
we're doing something and other people that were not the only ones,
you know,

109
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:01.160
there are other people who are doing things.
We named Mckayla,

110
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.450
Mckayla after a woman who died of cancer,
who I used to work with and uh,

111
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:08.180
she and her own classroom used to do exactly this.

112
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:11.690
And there are teachers all over America and all over Britain doing this in their

113
00:06:11.691 --> 00:06:14.990
own classrooms.
We need,

114
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.910
we need it to be more than that.
We need entire school districts.
You know,

115
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.560
we need people to get this point.

116
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:24.050
And when you said about teaching critical thinking,

117
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.190
it's a romantic view that comes from Rousseau,
uh,

118
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:32.060
so 18th century philosopher,
Rousseau and he said,
you know,

119
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.230
a man is born free but everywhere and change this whole idea of um,

120
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.720
of uh,
you education makes you less free.

121
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.850
This is what the,
the,

122
00:06:42.851 --> 00:06:47.851
the progressive thing and actually self control brings you freedom,

123
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.630
right?
It's counterintuitive,

124
00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:55.520
but actually order and structure make you free.
Um,

125
00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.500
they allow you to pursue all those avenues of knowledge basically.
Exactly.

126
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.120
The sort of center.
Exactly.
If you learn lots about something,

127
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:09.230
then you're able to apply that knowledge in different ways.
So I mean,

128
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.910
as an example,
um,
you know,
if,

129
00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.890
if you take a math question that a primary school kid might be given,
uh,

130
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.830
you know,
John has 8 cents at the end of the day,

131
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.380
it's one quarter of what he had at the beginning of the day.

132
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.750
How much money did he spend during the day?

133
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.760
Now I think I can do it and I think you can too.
I'm terrible at math,

134
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:29.390
but I do know,

135
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:33.710
I think you can do it is because you got short term memory and long term memory

136
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.910
and you've got a whole bunch of math facts in your longterm memory that you're

137
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:40.370
able to draw out.
You're able to go quarter,
no,

138
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:44.060
there's four of those in a hole and then you're able to go four times eight

139
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.890
cause I know my four times table and I can take it to 32 and then I can do

140
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:53.891
subtraction so I can take it to 24 right now if you're seven years old.

141
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:57.260
However,
if you have to hold all those facts in your working memory,

142
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:58.340
working memory,
can't do it,

143
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.570
you have got to drill and practice those timetable facts for instance,

144
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.720
and put them into your longterm memory and put those fractions into your

145
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:08.660
longterm memory so that when somebody gives you something more complex,

146
00:08:08.661 --> 00:08:12.950
you can go Bam,
Bam,
Bam and bring it out and then you've got the answer.

147
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.160
Sadly,
what happens is people say no,

148
00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:18.320
what we need to do is teach them complex problem solving.

149
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.980
Let's give them that first.
You've got to break it down.

150
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.500
What are the bits underneath that you've got to build up from?

151
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.830
And that stuff is a bit boring and because it's boring and isn't very romantic,

152
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:34.220
this resolved was talking about resale.
So Rousseau,
this idea with you,
you,
you,

153
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.300
you bring it out of the child,
right?
So they have this phrase which says,

154
00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:42.380
you know,
the mind is not a vessel to be filled but a spark to be ignited.

155
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:46.640
And it all sounds really exciting and thrilling,
right?
And that's the thing.

156
00:08:46.641 --> 00:08:49.070
It's so seductive.
It pulls everybody in.

157
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.850
But the reality is that actually what you need,

158
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.530
there's a whole lot of facts in your,

159
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:57.750
in your memory there that you can then go boom,
boom,
boom and apply.

160
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.350
Now that doesn't mean that you're just a parrot and you just end up learning a

161
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:04.470
whole load of facts,
which you then can just regurgitate.

162
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.500
You need to apply them and you need to give children the chance to apply them

163
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:08.910
and have a class discussion.

164
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:13.170
And we do paired work and selling often in more progressive places.

165
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:15.810
They'll do group work,
they'll put five kids,

166
00:09:15.811 --> 00:09:19.380
four kids around the table and they do group work and then what happens is the

167
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:23.100
teacher moves amongst them as a facilitator of learning as opposed to the

168
00:09:23.101 --> 00:09:24.840
teacher who's driving the bus.

169
00:09:24.841 --> 00:09:28.200
I always say the teacher needs to sit in the bus and drive and the kids get on

170
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:33.201
the bus with you and go the more progressive way your there just keeping them on

171
00:09:33.481 --> 00:09:35.940
task.
You do that,
let me come and see you.
You do that.

172
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.360
But they learn very much and then they don't succeed and then we say it's

173
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:43.560
because they were black.
It's cause they were poor.

174
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.740
What we need to do is give them welfare and then there'll be okay cause that

175
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:50.520
will make them equal.
I my point there is no fix the education system,

176
00:09:50.521 --> 00:09:53.520
give them an education and then they'll make themselves equal.
Yeah.

177
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.300
<v 2>Gosh this reminds me of,</v>

178
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.300
so I mentioned that I'm not that good at math and I remember the day,

179
00:09:58.301 --> 00:10:00.640
I haven't thought about this in probably 1520 I don't know,

180
00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:01.960
maybe literally maybe 20 years.

181
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:06.100
I remember being in sixth or seventh grade and we were doing division for the

182
00:10:06.101 --> 00:10:09.060
first time.
Yeah.
And I remember the teacher gave us a,

183
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.840
we had a quiz or something and I was able to do it in my head and I,
so they had,

184
00:10:13.841 --> 00:10:18.100
you know,
the the equation and I just wrote the answer and she gave me a fair,

185
00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:21.010
I failed or I got a zero or something,
even though I had all the answers.
Right.

186
00:10:21.011 --> 00:10:24.900
And she said,
you didn't show your work.
Oh,
and I,
and I remember Seder,

187
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.220
but I got all the answers right.
And she said,
no,
no,

188
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:30.130
I need to see how you do work now.
I didn't know how to do it that way,

189
00:10:30.131 --> 00:10:32.320
but somehow I was able to do it in my head.

190
00:10:32.321 --> 00:10:37.321
And I remember thinking that if that was all necessary to show the work,

191
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.930
that at some point I would get to a place where I would have to do it.

192
00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:44.050
But somehow I had figured out my little trick first.

193
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:48.340
But because of the way she kind of just failed me for it,

194
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:49.990
he completely turned me off.
Man,

195
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.570
I literally haven't thought of that in probably 20 years or something.

196
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.060
That's a total sidebar all together.

197
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.710
But I guess it just goes to show that we all,

198
00:10:56.711 --> 00:11:01.330
we all kind of learn differently and you need teachers that can kind of embrace

199
00:11:01.331 --> 00:11:05.200
the way you do it a little bit rather than just jam it down your throat.

200
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.530
<v 1>Yeah.
Well you,
you,
you,</v>

201
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.390
<v 2>which is probably a little bit of the,</v>

202
00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.700
the progressive thing that you don't like in a way.

203
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:12.391
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

204
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:17.220
What I would say is you remember that particular incident and think that's all

205
00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:17.880
it was,

206
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.510
but I guarantee you that how'd you been taught properly in that classroom?
Uh,

207
00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.080
you would have known her methods.
Yeah.
He would've known what to write down.

208
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.170
You didn't know what to write down because there was too much chaos in the

209
00:11:28.171 --> 00:11:29.850
classroom.
You weren't listening,

210
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:33.330
you were busy talking to your friend because she let you talk because she didn't

211
00:11:33.331 --> 00:11:37.480
have high enough standards of behavior.
Right.
And so yeah,
that sounds right.

212
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.310
Yeah.
Well and that's it.
Cause this is just standard.

213
00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:46.170
This is just what happens in all classrooms.
And then people think,

214
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.850
you know,
it's mean to make kids behave.
And after a while,

215
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:55.120
the thing is,
is that remember there's more of them than there is of us,
right?

216
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.210
So we're not actually making them do anything they want to behave.

217
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.760
We're just creating an environment where they're able to do it.
That's all.
Um,

218
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.870
now there's,
there's the,
there's the 10%.

219
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:08.740
There's the 10% on the outskirts that the detentions or so and keep them in
line.

220
00:12:08.741 --> 00:12:12.220
Right?
Um,
but the vast majority,
you need that tipping point.

221
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:16.000
The vast majority buy into what we do.
And if you come visit our school,

222
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.150
the kids will say to you,
yeah,
it's super strict and yeah,
we get detentions,

223
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:22.023
but you know what?

224
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.260
I get a great education and that's what I want because I want the opportunity to

225
00:12:26.261 --> 00:12:29.590
be able to change my stars.
And if you believe that,

226
00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.630
if you believe in equality of opportunity,

227
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.350
which sadly I think too many people in education don't believe in equality of

228
00:12:35.351 --> 00:12:38.050
opportunity,
um,
if you do,

229
00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.440
then you want to provide an environment where they're going to be able to do

230
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:45.910
that.
And,
um,
and,
and that's what we do and,
and I,

231
00:12:45.911 --> 00:12:48.870
and I really hope those teachers would come and visit us that they were able to,

232
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.060
to,
to take from that and,
and,
and,
and do something in their school.

233
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.200
<v 2>Yeah.
Well,
first off,
I told you before we started,</v>

234
00:12:54.201 --> 00:12:56.600
I'm going to be in the UK with Jordan Peterson for a couple of stops.

235
00:12:56.601 --> 00:13:00.880
So I will do everything I can to stop by and maybe I can get Jordan to swing by.

236
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:03.350
Oh Wow.
Yeah.
I know that his daughter is Mikayla by the way.

237
00:13:03.351 --> 00:13:08.060
So there's really deep,
powerful thing happened that is even powerful.
Um,

238
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.130
what about the type of kids you,

239
00:13:10.131 --> 00:13:12.890
you've mentioned that there's some diversity in the type of kids that are coming

240
00:13:12.891 --> 00:13:16.090
in.
How do you guys decide who actually can,

241
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.270
can cut it and who can afford it and other,
you know,
all that?
Well,

242
00:13:20.271 --> 00:13:22.300
it's not up to us who comes to us.
Uh,

243
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.860
it's the local council that kind of send kids to us.
Uh,
so we do,

244
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.060
they decide who goes,
well,
it's a lottery

245
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.070
<v 1>and people apply and then they get picked out of a hat literally,
and then,</v>

246
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.220
and then they come.
Um,
some of the people,
you know,

247
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:38.920
some of the kids who end up with us didn't even necessarily want to be with us.

248
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:39.820
Uh,

249
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.020
they just end up being pushed towards us because that's the way the system goes.

250
00:13:44.021 --> 00:13:46.420
I mean,
frankly,
I don't even understand the system,
but we get a bunch of kids.

251
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:47.920
We've got 120 kids in every year.

252
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.830
<v 2>So it's a pure lottery to go to the school.
Yeah.</v>

253
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.490
And basically if they don't win the lottery,
so to speak,

254
00:13:53.491 --> 00:13:56.190
they're just going into the public school because at that point,

255
00:13:56.191 --> 00:13:58.140
most likely the parents can't afford a private school.
Right?

256
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.560
<v 1>Yeah,
yeah.
No,
definitely.
The parents can't afford a private school,</v>

257
00:14:00.561 --> 00:14:03.290
but there's no,
I mean,
you talk about it as if we're different.
I mean,

258
00:14:03.291 --> 00:14:05.090
like we're just another school.

259
00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:09.410
There's loads of schools like us in that sense around.
Um,

260
00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:14.600
I mean we are a free school,
but,
uh,
yeah,
it doesn't,

261
00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:18.230
it's not like we're the free school.
And then there's the local public school,

262
00:14:18.231 --> 00:14:20.780
there's loads,
there's lots of schools and um,

263
00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.340
and parents will choose us if they want to.
Um,
and as I say,

264
00:14:25.341 --> 00:14:27.190
sometimes we end up with,
with,

265
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.200
with kids because the system is such that you have to choose your top five

266
00:14:30.201 --> 00:14:33.890
schools and you know,
you chosen us fifth,
he probably don't want to be with us,

267
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:37.730
but in the name of fairness as,
as it always goes,

268
00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.090
the people who have chosen as fifth has just as much of a chance of getting in

269
00:14:41.091 --> 00:14:43.490
at the people who've chosen this for x and got very American there.

270
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:47.780
And did it cause it,
cause I grew up in Canada,
so you know,
China changes.

271
00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.960
Um,
but yeah,
so people who don't want to come to us come to,

272
00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.490
and people who do really want to come to us,
come to us and look,
you know,

273
00:14:55.491 --> 00:14:58.910
I called myself the dragon lady and I say,
you know what?

274
00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:02.660
I'm not going to change.
And if you're happy to put up with me,

275
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.910
these are the rules and this is what we do.

276
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:06.920
So if we hear your phone or if we see your phone,

277
00:15:06.921 --> 00:15:09.740
we'll take it and we will keep it for up to 16 weeks.

278
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:13.910
And that's the way that it is.
Um,
you know,
these smartphones are killing kids.

279
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.460
I wanted to get there.
Yeah.
Where do you make of that?
Because it's an,

280
00:15:17.510 --> 00:15:19.940
it's a disaster.
And in 20 years people are gonna know,
you know,

281
00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:23.180
when I say it now,
people say,
Whoa,
you're being extreme.
You know,
some schools,

282
00:15:23.181 --> 00:15:27.080
they actually have these phones out in lessons.
Uh,
lots of schools.

283
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.450
They have the mountain corridors and in the yard and so on.

284
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.890
We have them banned completely.

285
00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.980
And I'm even trying to get parents to take them away at home.

286
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:38.450
We know we sell brick phones.
So a phone that you can't access the Internet.
Uh,

287
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.190
so that we try to encourage parents,

288
00:15:40.191 --> 00:15:42.650
give them that you want to keep in touch with their kid.
Fine,
I understand.

289
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.280
But you don't need to give them a smartphone.
And the access to the Internet.

290
00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.870
You know,
Steve Jobs,
Bill Gates,
all of those big guys in it,

291
00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.320
they don't give their children phones until they're 15.
They keep them away.

292
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:58.790
When Steve Jobs in 2010 and the iPad came out and he was interviewed and they

293
00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.380
said,
what?
What did you think about?
What does,

294
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.750
what are your kids think about the iPad?
And he said,
I don't know.

295
00:16:02.751 --> 00:16:07.100
I wouldn't give my kids the IPAD.
He,
his,
they protect their children.

296
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.050
Meanwhile,
our parents have no idea they're,

297
00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:14.090
they're saving up for months that give the kids this Christmas present.
And it's,

298
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:17.300
it's,
it's like giving them heroin.
I say it's like playing Russian roulette,

299
00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.430
you know,
um,

300
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.730
who did you give anybody access to your child on this phone?
Right?

301
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:26.120
Weirdo out there knows who your child lives knows where.

302
00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:27.950
How did they go to school?
Knows where they go to school,

303
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:32.510
knows who their friends are.
They get,
I mean,
I don't understand.
Well,

304
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.950
the reason why people do this is because they don't know and they don't think

305
00:16:36.951 --> 00:16:39.740
about the dangers,
not just with random people,

306
00:16:39.741 --> 00:16:44.240
but also lovely girls who get involved with the bad boys at school.
Um,

307
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.060
bad boys who might be criminals elsewhere,

308
00:16:47.061 --> 00:16:50.140
etc. And they quite liked them and they wouldn't otherwise know them.

309
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.960
But oh you maybe he's going to add me on snapchat.
Whoo.
You know,

310
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.590
and this is the kind of,
it's terrible.
What about just for attention spans?

311
00:16:57.591 --> 00:17:01.130
Cause I would imagine you're dealing with a lot of that for people right now.

312
00:17:01.131 --> 00:17:04.580
Cause massive problems.
Snapchat as you just said.
Exactly.
So you know,

313
00:17:04.581 --> 00:17:07.580
before when they used to watch,
you know,
Dallas and dynasty and so on,

314
00:17:07.581 --> 00:17:11.030
at least there was a narrative arc that went like this and it told a story and

315
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.810
then something bad happened and then it gets resolved and so on and doesn't

316
00:17:14.811 --> 00:17:15.644
happen anymore.

317
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:20.200
You've got like 22nd I went to the hairdresser's look at this man's head.
Ooh,

318
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:23.680
end of the little ditty that,
that's what they're watching,
right?

319
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.460
It's terrible.
So smart phones are a huge problem for the inner city.

320
00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.090
And the biggest problem I would say a progressive teaching methods that have

321
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.590
infiltrated our schools and sadly this kind of re so an idea that you're drawing

322
00:17:36.591 --> 00:17:40.520
something out of the child as opposed to putting something in and the way in

323
00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:44.360
which over the last 50 years we have turned away from knowledge,
um,

324
00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.140
as being really important.
This hits of course the most vulnerable.

325
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.900
So working kids,
uh,
in,
in,
in our country,
you know,

326
00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:55.260
that tends to be a black thing in this country,
in our country.
You know,
in,

327
00:17:55.261 --> 00:17:58.560
in Britain it will be black kids,
but it'll also be white working class kids.

328
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:02.880
It'd be a variety of different kids who get hit by this because if you are from

329
00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:05.400
a richer background,
your parents,
you know,

330
00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:08.880
you sit around the dinner table at night and you have dinner and you talk about

331
00:18:08.881 --> 00:18:13.080
the politics of the day and you learn about different countries and on science

332
00:18:13.081 --> 00:18:16.470
and all sorts of things.
Just through talking to your parents,
onto your parents,

333
00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:21.360
friends and your uncle and your aunt and so on with kids whose parents are not

334
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.610
well educated,
they don't get that at home.

335
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.080
So they're depending entirely on the school to give them what they need to be

336
00:18:28.081 --> 00:18:30.030
able to succeed.
And sadly,

337
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.620
because schools are convinced about this idea of this romance around,
um,

338
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.450
thinking critically and,
and,

339
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.120
and that's not to say we don't want them thinking critically.
We do.
Yeah.

340
00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:42.160
But you need to give them lots of stuff to get them to that.

341
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.540
<v 2>Right.
So,
so when I said that at Oxford Union about teaching critical thinking,</v>

342
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.550
it's not that you don't believe in critical thinking,

343
00:18:48.551 --> 00:18:51.940
of course it's that you really,
that's not,
that's not something to teach,

344
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.640
at least at first.
It's that you have to give them all the,

345
00:18:54.641 --> 00:18:59.140
the breadth of knowledge first and then they will learn how to critically think

346
00:18:59.141 --> 00:19:02.410
about overplays issues.
Fair enough.
I like tickets and criticism.

347
00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:05.970
<v 1>Exactly.
I agree for yearly and it's,</v>

348
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.660
it's something that we're just,
you're having to fight all over the place.
And,

349
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:14.210
and it's that idea of giving them that equality of opportunity,
you see,
uh,

350
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:17.770
which is what I call,
I keep coming back to because,
um,

351
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:21.390
<v 2>instances where this doesn't work.
I mean,</v>

352
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:26.290
have there been kids that come through and just for whatever reason,
this,

353
00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:29.350
this concept that,
that you've built,

354
00:19:29.351 --> 00:19:31.000
that you're instilling in all these other students,

355
00:19:31.001 --> 00:19:34.690
it just does not work for them either because of something about them or the

356
00:19:34.691 --> 00:19:35.340
family or,

357
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.130
<v 1>yeah.
So I've had to exclude a few children for knives.
You know,</v>

358
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:40.190
that that is something in the inner city.
That's a problem.
You know,

359
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.710
when we talk about in the city,
you know,
we've got kids showing up,
you know,

360
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:47.070
young men showing up on bikes with masks,
carrying knives,

361
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:50.520
waiting to meet some of our kids.
You know,
this,
this is the inner city.

362
00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:55.140
So there are,
uh,
some of those issues that can take over,
you know,

363
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:58.530
but,
um,
but that doesn't mean that it hasn't worked.
It always works.

364
00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:01.230
The kids always learn more than they've ever learned anywhere else.

365
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.610
The kids always are stunned by their own intelligence and what is possible.

366
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:10.560
Um,
because we show that to them and it's,
um,
you know,
and,

367
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:15.090
and what kind of breaks my heart is that even those who are conservative,

368
00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:15.680
so you ever,

369
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.450
I watched all your programs and you have all these great people that come on,

370
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.150
but nobody ever talks about education.
You're Larry Elder,
for instance,

371
00:20:21.151 --> 00:20:23.280
who I love and I think he's brilliant.
Yeah.
You know,

372
00:20:23.281 --> 00:20:26.000
he talks about all these things play in the black community and he has all this

373
00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:27.300
stats that he always comes out with.

374
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:30.780
And there's that thing where he takes you apart,
you know?
Um,

375
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.770
ignore my real moments.
Yeah.
But what,

376
00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.380
but what he doesn't do,
he talks about absent fathers,
talks about crime,

377
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:40.440
talks about drugs and so on,
but they never talk about education.

378
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:44.070
And the thing is education.
That's our black people's fault,
right?

379
00:20:44.071 --> 00:20:46.900
That isn't that the state.
Right.

380
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:51.940
And the state needs to be held to account for this because we spend in Britain

381
00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.690
80 billion pounds a year on the state education system.

382
00:20:55.810 --> 00:21:00.270
And yet we are failing all of our kids.
And that isn't right.
We,
we and,

383
00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:04.870
and Laurie older and all of these people who talk,
they need to be able to say,

384
00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.830
now,
wait a minute,

385
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:08.860
there's something going wrong at a very low level because you can,

386
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.080
you can talk all you want about personal responsibility,

387
00:21:11.081 --> 00:21:13.960
but if you haven't got an education,
it's very hard to make anything of your,

388
00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:17.550
<v 2>so is the problem then that in,
at least in the American context,</v>

389
00:21:17.551 --> 00:21:22.350
the answer always is throw more money at it.
So it's not the,
the real answer,

390
00:21:22.351 --> 00:21:25.260
which obviously we've spent 45 minutes talking about,

391
00:21:25.261 --> 00:21:27.810
which is why and how you have to clean up these schools.

392
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:30.990
But the easy answer is always throw more money at it if they just need more

393
00:21:30.991 --> 00:21:32.200
money.
You know,
you always hear these things,
well,

394
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:35.340
they don't have enough pencils and they don't have enough,
uh,
you know,

395
00:21:35.341 --> 00:21:36.930
other supplies and notebooks and things.

396
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.800
And then people don't take the next step,
which would be the critical thinking,

397
00:21:40.801 --> 00:21:43.140
step up the whole thing.
Yeah.
It's not about money.

398
00:21:43.141 --> 00:21:44.250
You can throw money at anything yet.

399
00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.260
<v 1>The irony is they all go on about critical thinking.</v>

400
00:21:46.261 --> 00:21:50.330
They're not doing any critical thinking,
you know,
if only they would.
But,
um,
I,

401
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.350
I wish you luck.
I mean the,
the,
the left really,
I refused.

402
00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.600
They refused to recognize there's even a problem.
Uh,
the right,

403
00:21:57.601 --> 00:22:00.780
we'll recognize that there's a problem,
but they don't talk about it.

404
00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.000
So that's what I'm saying about the people who you interview and so on.

405
00:22:03.001 --> 00:22:07.390
I just wish more people would say actually the solution is an education,
uh,

406
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:12.060
because it really is,
uh,
the,
the,
the black community for instance,
um,

407
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.080
you know,
would,
would transform if they were given,
uh,

408
00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.790
the opportunity to have a great education.
Um,
and,

409
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.070
and that's not to say that all of the things that Larry elder talks about,

410
00:22:23.071 --> 00:22:24.900
about absent fathers and so on aren't a problem.
Right?

411
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.980
I mean they are absolutely.
Uh,
but it's really important to call them out on it.

412
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.400
And it's really important to call out.
You see,

413
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:33.930
and this is where I would disagree.
You know,

414
00:22:33.931 --> 00:22:36.060
I consider myself a conservative and the black conservative,

415
00:22:36.270 --> 00:22:38.850
but I would disagree with some of the black conservatives out there who refuse

416
00:22:38.851 --> 00:22:41.910
to recognize racism as a problem at all.
You know,
they kind of just dismiss it.

417
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.160
And I would say no,
it is a big problem.

418
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:49.020
And the reason it's a big problem is because the left in so many ways are
racist.

419
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.740
You know,

420
00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:53.100
when they want to own us and they want to tell us how we can vote and they want

421
00:22:53.101 --> 00:22:55.440
to tell us how we can think that is racism.

422
00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:59.520
And when they refused to recognize what works in education that's going to help

423
00:22:59.521 --> 00:23:01.220
poor kids,
black kids,
you know,

424
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:04.440
white working class kids in Britain when they refuse to look at that.

425
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:07.200
Well that's racist.
And I'd say it's racist against the white working class.

426
00:23:07.201 --> 00:23:10.200
The way the white working class was spoken about in Britain is the way that

427
00:23:10.201 --> 00:23:13.080
sometimes black kidney,
the black communities have spoken about in America,

428
00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:16.410
which is like there's some kind of different,
they're like they're aliens.

429
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.360
Oh well,
you know,
that's just the way they are.
No,

430
00:23:18.361 --> 00:23:20.910
that's not the way they are actually.
If you give them the opportunity,

431
00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:25.890
but you will want to sit around dinner parties and talk about how kind you are

432
00:23:25.891 --> 00:23:29.070
and how great you are because your virtue signaling and voting on the left,

433
00:23:29.071 --> 00:23:31.260
you know.
Um,
and I just wish,

434
00:23:31.261 --> 00:23:35.280
I suppose that there were more conservatives who were speaking out about this

435
00:23:35.281 --> 00:23:37.210
and saying something.
Um,

436
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:42.170
<v 2>I guess there's a weird reflex for them where they've been called racist for so</v>

437
00:23:42.171 --> 00:23:46.250
long,
even though often they are minorities.
Yeah.
Where they don't want,

438
00:23:46.251 --> 00:23:48.020
I see this,
I definitely see this.
Yeah.

439
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.440
Where they don't want to use the same tactics.
So what you just said,
right.

440
00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:53.690
There is such a flip on the way we think of racism.

441
00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:57.040
I tend to agree with that line of thinking obviously.
But yeah,

442
00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.170
the people that are screaming about racism are all the time.

443
00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:03.950
Now are the people who are racist,
who are racist.
They really,
really are.

444
00:24:03.951 --> 00:24:04.610
And I don't say,

445
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.260
I don't say that lightly because I don't like calling people racist,

446
00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.990
but they are the ones who are demanding.

447
00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.650
I look at everyone based on race and sexuality and the rest of this,

448
00:24:12.651 --> 00:24:13.850
now we have to call it out.

449
00:24:13.851 --> 00:24:18.851
But I think there's a hesitancy from at least from sort of where I sit because I

450
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.260
don't want to become what they became.
But no,
but I know,

451
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.280
I know you're right at the,
at the core of this,

452
00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.750
<v 1>and look,
I understand you don't want to say everything is racist,</v>

453
00:24:27.751 --> 00:24:31.410
but when there is real racism,
you need to point it out.
Yeah.
And you know,

454
00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:36.530
the fact is that the fact is that if we don't call it out,

455
00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.070
all of these kids are going to keep failing.
Ryan.
Uh,

456
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:44.280
what we don't realize is that all these kids are going through school and being

457
00:24:44.281 --> 00:24:48.060
taught,
uh,
to make sure that they're going off and voting on the left.

458
00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:52.570
That's how it is like that,
that is that,
that's how everyone thinks,
like it's,

459
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.940
it's,
it's so standard in the education,
you know,
system to,

460
00:24:56.941 --> 00:25:00.990
to think on the left that the few conservative teaches that there are out there.

461
00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:06.070
Um,
they're quiet.
They never say anything cause they're terrified.
Right.
Um,

462
00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.880
there was no balance of Ford.
Um,
and,
and,

463
00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:14.820
and that's really scary I think.
Uh,
and,
and for the future of,
of,
of,
of,

464
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.450
of our countries we,
we need people to talk to each other.

465
00:25:18.451 --> 00:25:19.950
The stuff that you're always talking about,

466
00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:24.060
about talking to each other and sharing ideas and thinking about how the other,

467
00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.450
the other side thinks.
Um,
and,

468
00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:33.180
and I worry that,
uh,
w we don't,
we don't do enough of that.
We,
we,

469
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.880
we don't,
we don't do enough of that at school,
that's for sure.

470
00:25:35.881 --> 00:25:40.350
And then those kids turn into adults eventually don't they and them and then we

471
00:25:40.351 --> 00:25:41.850
just,
you know,

472
00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.750
<v 2>well I don't know that then they're really pissed at the system that they</v>

473
00:25:44.751 --> 00:25:48.470
believes failed them and then they just perpetuate that through the next

474
00:25:48.471 --> 00:25:52.130
generation two.
And then eventually that's unsustainable actually.

475
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:55.280
Cause then you have enough people that are turning against the system that's

476
00:25:55.281 --> 00:25:59.630
failed them.
Yes.
It's because no one stood up and did what you're doing.

477
00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:03.530
But it's interesting because this is where a good old American classical
liberal,

478
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.910
and I know you guys,

479
00:26:04.911 --> 00:26:08.180
at least in the UK have a better understanding of what classical liberalism I

480
00:26:08.181 --> 00:26:08.961
think that we do here.

481
00:26:08.961 --> 00:26:11.990
We talked about this a little bit before that these ones won't getting muddled

482
00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:15.890
and mangled and all that.
Uh,
but this is a place where,
to me,

483
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.780
where the government should be involved.

484
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:22.810
I am all for using tax dollars to do the things you're talking about.

485
00:26:22.821 --> 00:26:23.960
Where some,
I think,

486
00:26:23.961 --> 00:26:27.020
I think there are plenty of people that are American conservatives at least that

487
00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:30.170
want to just cut funding from all of these things and endlessly quite funny.

488
00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:30.651
As I said,

489
00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:35.060
I'm not for throwing money at them just because that's just the easy answer.

490
00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:35.660
But yeah,

491
00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:40.660
let's figure out how do we wisely use money to empower these teachers?

492
00:26:40.671 --> 00:26:43.950
And that sounds like that's exactly what you're doing.
Well,

493
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.560
<v 1>exactly.
Um,
it's,
you know,</v>

494
00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:49.410
it's the power of bad ideas at the moment that over the last 50 years,
you know,

495
00:26:49.411 --> 00:26:52.470
60,
70 years ago,
uh,
the schools that were out there,

496
00:26:52.471 --> 00:26:55.520
we were more like our school now.
Um,

497
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.010
it's just that things have changed so radically where knowledge has been

498
00:26:59.011 --> 00:27:01.530
sidelined.
Uh,
it's all about skills.

499
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:04.620
People talk about skills and drawing it out of the child,
like I was saying.

500
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.810
And um,
we've,
we've lost,
um,

501
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.440
we've lost the purpose of education and we've lost,
you know,

502
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:17.880
the ideas that we have about,
um,
perseverance.
Uh,

503
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.850
even when it's difficult,
especially when it's difficult personal responsibility.

504
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:24.000
You know,
if you didn't bring in your homework,
then you are responsible for that.

505
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.210
Whereas elsewhere they'll say,
oh,
well,
it's not your fault.

506
00:27:27.211 --> 00:27:29.920
You come from a difficult family,
difficult background.

507
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:31.080
We're going to give you an excuse.

508
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.180
And if you're constantly being given those excuses,

509
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:37.020
and if later on getting into university,
there were quotas,

510
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.550
and if you're likely to get in because you're black or your need there,
there's,

511
00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:44.640
there,
there are things that allow you,
oh,
I ticked that box.
I ticked that box.

512
00:27:44.641 --> 00:27:47.010
I'm going to be able to get,
get in with a lower score,

513
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:51.330
then you stop setting those standards for yourself,
right?
Yeah.
And then we don't,

514
00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:51.800
we all

515
00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.630
<v 2>eventually degrade the whole system.</v>

516
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.530
If you let someone in at a lower level and then also let them get a job at a

517
00:27:57.531 --> 00:28:00.370
lower level or get into Grad school at a lower level of the job,

518
00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.820
at a lower limit.
Everything else.
Yeah.
Well now,

519
00:28:01.821 --> 00:28:04.610
whatever you've created as a professional is,

520
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.520
is a degraded version of whatever that supposed to be.

521
00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:12.410
<v 1>That's right.
That's right.
And,
um,
and that is what's happening,
sadly.
Uh,</v>

522
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:16.070
there's a whole campaign at the moment in Britain for this to happen with Oxford

523
00:28:16.071 --> 00:28:20.580
and Cambridge University,
uh,
to,
to essentially,
uh,

524
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.490
allow kids.
I mean,
it's just,
it's,
it's,
it's really sad.

525
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:27.530
And the reason why is because they say,
hey,
look,

526
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:30.440
there aren't that many black kids,
uh,
at Oxford and Cambridge.

527
00:28:30.441 --> 00:28:33.470
We need to fix this.
We do.
I agree.
We need to fix it.

528
00:28:33.471 --> 00:28:34.850
So we need to fix the education system.

529
00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:37.490
We need to fix our schools and make sure that they've given that equality of

530
00:28:37.491 --> 00:28:38.090
opportunity.

531
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.500
<v 2>Not,
not,
not,
well,
I'll tell you,</v>

532
00:28:39.501 --> 00:28:42.380
that day that I spent at Oxford was such an absolute joy and talking to so many

533
00:28:42.381 --> 00:28:44.230
kids just in the streets and,

534
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:49.100
and just everybody was so like excited to learn and obviously they were

535
00:28:49.101 --> 00:28:52.130
sympathetic to a lot of the things that I talk about and,
and all that.

536
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:52.910
I'm curious,

537
00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:57.910
so I get it sort of on the sciences and math and that you really want to teach

538
00:28:58.071 --> 00:29:02.130
them the facts on this stuff on things like history.
Yeah.

539
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.490
A lot of the facts in history.
No,
no,
no.
There are facts in history,

540
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.210
but I wonder now these days where it seems like young people are kind of into

541
00:29:08.211 --> 00:29:12.710
socialism or young people are kind of into communism or Marxism,
abreast of it.

542
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:18.350
Uh,
have you found that teaching history has become oddly,
I was going to say,

543
00:29:18.351 --> 00:29:21.820
oddly political.
I mean it,
of course it is political,
but oddly politicized.

544
00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:26.490
<v 1>Yeah.
So like Hitler for instance,
has taught to death.
Um,
but,</v>

545
00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.440
uh,
say the,
the trustees of communism and so on are not taught so much.

546
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:36.330
Um,
or even then,
so rarely is,

547
00:29:36.331 --> 00:29:36.960
is,
is,

548
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.980
is so little is taught full stop because they're not being taught properly in

549
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.590
classroom because you are facilitating learning and kids are just teaching

550
00:29:44.591 --> 00:29:48.820
themselves.
I mean that,
I can't stress how much of that is actually going on.

551
00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:53.770
Um,
so yes,
things are politicized and,
um,

552
00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.040
children are not able to access the kind of education that they were able to

553
00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:57.791
access before.

554
00:29:57.791 --> 00:30:01.570
And it's hard because I'll say that and then people will just deny that that's

555
00:30:01.571 --> 00:30:03.130
what's going on.
Um,

556
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:08.310
but you can see by if you talk to university kids at university and asked them

557
00:30:08.741 --> 00:30:12.580
what do they know about the world and so on,
what do they think they'll tell you?

558
00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.790
And you'll see how much they've been taught,
what they've been taught at school.

559
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:20.620
Uh,
so a few of them have an understanding of communism and what it is.

560
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.030
Um,
and that's because they're not learning it appropriately at school.
Um,

561
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.680
school is

562
00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.810
<v 3>sadly,
it's,
um,
it's,</v>

563
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.420
<v 1>I wish that there was more diversity of thought amongst teachers.</v>

564
00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:40.550
So one of the reasons why we watch a lot of you the Rubin report is because I

565
00:30:40.551 --> 00:30:42.650
want my staff to try and think outside the box.

566
00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:46.130
What I always say is I can predict everything that you think about every issue

567
00:30:46.131 --> 00:30:51.020
out there.
So if I know that you definitely voted,
remain as opposed to Brexit,

568
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.480
um,
with regard to the European and for us,
or,

569
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:58.570
or if I know for sure that you would vote for Corban that the leader of the

570
00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.150
Labor Party in Britain or if I know,
um,

571
00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.970
you know what you would have to say about a whole variety of different things,

572
00:31:04.971 --> 00:31:08.150
even what newspaper you read,
if I can make all those predictions,

573
00:31:08.151 --> 00:31:11.900
there's something wrong.
Cause you know,
with me,
I'm conservative on some issues,

574
00:31:11.901 --> 00:31:16.470
but I'm,
I'm anti guns.
For instance,
I'm pro choice and pro gay marriage,

575
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:18.650
all sorts of things that I'm very much on the left on.

576
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.430
But there's other things that I'm more conservative about,
you know?
Um,

577
00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:24.860
and that's because I'm a thinking person.
Yeah.
Yeah.
A classical liberal.
Yeah.

578
00:31:24.861 --> 00:31:29.270
I suppose in many ways,
one might say that,
um,
you know,
I'm,

579
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:34.840
yeah,
the point is I just want people to think outside the box.
Right?

580
00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:35.920
And I wish teachers would,

581
00:31:35.921 --> 00:31:38.710
and that there was more diversity of thought and there is some diversity of

582
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:41.920
thought,
but they have to keep quiet because they're terrified.

583
00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:46.390
You get the right teachers.
Well,
in a way it's,
it's self selecting.

584
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:51.010
So when they apply,
um,
there are already people who are,

585
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.240
who are somewhat thinking outside the box.
Um,
and then they,
um,

586
00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:56.470
and then they come.

587
00:31:57.250 --> 00:32:01.570
And I think being at the school also changes their minds about things.
Uh,

588
00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.830
they start to think differently,
uh,
because they're seeing what's possible.
Uh,

589
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.380
people can't imagine what's possible within a city.

590
00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.860
Kids until they come to our school.
I have visitors,
teachers who are visitors,

591
00:32:11.861 --> 00:32:14.950
they're nearly in tears and saying,
we can't believe that these kids are so nice.

592
00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.020
Um,
so that's,
that's what we're trying to do.
And the point,
the PR,

593
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.290
and it happens here,
you know,
I've been to see a,
so I said Ed Hirsch,
you know,

594
00:32:23.291 --> 00:32:26.950
some of the schools where they use his materials and they placed knowledge at

595
00:32:26.951 --> 00:32:28.000
the heart of their curriculum.

596
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.980
I've seen some of those schools in the Bronx and in,
um,
in,

597
00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.460
in various but queens and so on.
And,
uh,
and they're doing a great job too.

598
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.430
Um,
I just wish more of it was happening and that we can,

599
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:45.320
we can get a bigger platform to talk about it because it's just so important.
Um,

600
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.960
but people don't,
people don't get that.

601
00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.940
They don't get that story.

602
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:56.020
<v 2>You think so?
Yeah,
I do.
I think that's why these types of things are working.</v>

603
00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.620
That's why you're half a world away,
you know,
thousands of miles away.

604
00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:03.190
And you've shown this,
the conversations that we're having here to your staff.

605
00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.670
Yeah.
And Yeah,
the amount of people that are showing up to these live events now,

606
00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.460
the amount of people that are downloading these podcasts and all that,

607
00:33:09.490 --> 00:33:10.570
it's starting

608
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.890
<v 1>to happen at least.
Yeah.
Well,
I hope so.
I hope so.
I mean,
uh,</v>

609
00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.910
there's,
there's so much to be had,
you know,
I've known tens of thousands of kids.

610
00:33:19.911 --> 00:33:21.500
People often say,
why do I do what I do?

611
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.300
Because I've known tens of thousands of kids who could have been so much more,

612
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:30.320
right,
who could have been in a position to change their stars?

613
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.550
And they weren't able to because the state is spending so much money on their

614
00:33:34.551 --> 00:33:38.570
education and isn't able to provide them with a decent education.
Um,

615
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.920
and that's really sad.

616
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:43.050
<v 2>All right,
one more for Ya.
Yeah.
I want you to offer,</v>

617
00:33:43.051 --> 00:33:46.290
so I know that I have a Lotta young people obviously that listen to this show,

618
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.500
high school,
sometimes junior high school,
but college,
whatever else,

619
00:33:49.501 --> 00:33:52.410
just for the general young person out there that's watching this,

620
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:54.660
that's in a school that's not doing these things,

621
00:33:54.661 --> 00:33:59.661
that's trying to figure out how to learn and think critically and get a good

622
00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.070
wide breadth of knowledge.

623
00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.670
But the situation that they're in is not everything you've offered here.
What,

624
00:34:05.671 --> 00:34:08.850
what would you say to them to just start doing it for themselves?

625
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.340
<v 1>You got to take personal responsibility.
So you can't be a victim.
Um,
you know,</v>

626
00:34:13.341 --> 00:34:17.390
the whole victimhood thing is just stoked all the time in schools and uh,

627
00:34:17.391 --> 00:34:19.370
and indulged you.
You got to think,

628
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:24.110
it doesn't matter where I am a great,
I haven't had the best luck,
right?

629
00:34:24.111 --> 00:34:26.240
I would've loved to been able to go to that local private school,

630
00:34:26.241 --> 00:34:30.350
but you know what?
So what I'm gonna,
I'm gonna sit down and I'm going to work.

631
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:33.130
I'm not going to work really hard and I'm going to go to the library and I'm

632
00:34:33.131 --> 00:34:35.660
going to find the books and I'm going to teach myself if necessary.

633
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:38.390
And I've known kids like this who have done this,
um,

634
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:41.780
I'm known colleagues of Mine and people who I've known,
they just,
they,

635
00:34:41.781 --> 00:34:43.130
they make it their business,

636
00:34:43.131 --> 00:34:46.430
the teach themselves what they need to know and they need to know that knowledge

637
00:34:46.431 --> 00:34:47.264
is at the heart of it.

638
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:51.200
You need to know lots of stuff and then you can manipulate that stuff.
Um,

639
00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.680
and then you can be intelligent with that stuff.
Right?
Um,

640
00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.460
you can do it.
You can.
The thing is,

641
00:34:57.461 --> 00:35:02.110
is that it's rare that a 15 year old takes it upon themselves to do it.
They are,

642
00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:06.050
by definition,
they're exceptional.
Most kids need somebody to guide them.

643
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.880
And if their parents aren't doing it,

644
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:12.680
then I think the school certainly can do it.
Whether or not the school should,

645
00:35:12.681 --> 00:35:13.550
there are people who will say,
well,

646
00:35:13.551 --> 00:35:16.220
it's not fair school shouldn't have to do that.
The parents should do that.

647
00:35:16.221 --> 00:35:19.730
And it's true.
And you know what,
if,
um,
if,
if welfare,

648
00:35:19.731 --> 00:35:21.980
we're not as generous as it is and so on,

649
00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:26.060
the parents probably would have more agency and self determination about

650
00:35:26.061 --> 00:35:28.560
themselves and the incredible catch 22.
Yeah,

651
00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:31.100
they would take more responsibility and they would do something.

652
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:34.580
And sadly the state hits them in both ways,
right?

653
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.020
Because it gives them the heroin,

654
00:35:36.021 --> 00:35:40.650
a welfare and then it suppresses them by not giving them a decent education.

655
00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.560
Uh,
and then they sit around and I talk,
oh,
and I say,
Oh,

656
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:46.710
I'm a really good person because I believe in giving people loads of welfare and

657
00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:50.550
in having terrible education.
I mean,
how,
you know,

658
00:35:50.551 --> 00:35:53.340
you punch somebody on one side,
then you punch them on the other side.

659
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.730
How on earth are they meant to succeed?
Right?
Um,
and the thing is,

660
00:35:56.731 --> 00:36:01.170
we spend a lot of money in tax to,
to have a state and I'm a classical liberal,

661
00:36:01.171 --> 00:36:05.730
so I believe in a small state,
but we do have a state,

662
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.480
let's use it for what we can for the,
for the good.
Yeah.
Um,

663
00:36:09.810 --> 00:36:14.430
but we're not doing that.
Um,
and,
and that's what's,
that's what's really scary.

664
00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.740
And,
um,
we,

665
00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:21.690
we need a soul believing in this idea of equality of opportunity and that,

666
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:26.130
uh,
teaching children's self control,
we'll make them free.

667
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.140
Um,
and,
and,
and having,
uh,

668
00:36:30.141 --> 00:36:34.290
an ordered environment where children can learn,
will,
uh,

669
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.790
enable them to learn lots of stuff so that they can then be motivated to do

670
00:36:38.791 --> 00:36:43.620
something with their lives because they will make themselves free,
um,

671
00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:48.690
by,
by grabbing that opportunity.
And,
and,
and it's that agency,

672
00:36:48.691 --> 00:36:52.470
it's that sense of self determination that the conservatives,

673
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.460
people on the right,

674
00:36:53.461 --> 00:36:58.461
right leaning tend to believe in more as opposed to mummy state coming in and

675
00:36:58.621 --> 00:37:00.960
looking after it for you and taking care of you.

676
00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:05.190
Because if that's what you aspire to,
then what's the point of living?
Right?
Um,

677
00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.670
but you know,
you have to teach dead white men,
right?

678
00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:12.750
Like one of the big problems we have is that they don't want to teach dead white

679
00:37:12.751 --> 00:37:16.740
men because they're dead white men.
And that's a problem,
right?

680
00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:17.910
So they only want to teach.

681
00:37:17.911 --> 00:37:20.940
Recently we had the situation where I'm in Manchester,

682
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:25.020
these students painted over a mural of Kipling.

683
00:37:25.021 --> 00:37:28.740
So Rudyard Kipling's poem was up there and they painted it over and put my

684
00:37:28.741 --> 00:37:32.520
Angelou's poem by Maya Angelou.
And now I'm a great fan of Maya Angelou.

685
00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:34.380
I think she's brilliant.
Um,

686
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.230
but one of the reasons why she's a great writer is because she read a lot of

687
00:37:37.231 --> 00:37:39.960
Kipling and she read a lot of Shakespeare.
In fact,

688
00:37:39.961 --> 00:37:43.680
she said of Shakespeare that she thought when she first read him that he must

689
00:37:43.681 --> 00:37:45.960
have been a black woman because he would have no,
he,
oh,

690
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:50.070
he had to be a black woman to have understood the plight of black women.
Right.

691
00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.900
Because he speaks to the human condition.
Right.
Um,
but he's a dead white male.
Oh,

692
00:37:54.901 --> 00:37:57.540
we don't want to teach him.
Oh,
Co Kipling.
He was a racist.

693
00:37:57.541 --> 00:38:00.600
We don't want to teach him,
but at our school,
we've got them reciting,
you know,

694
00:38:00.601 --> 00:38:01.150
the poem,

695
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:06.030
if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on

696
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:10.860
you,
you know.
Uh,
but at the end of it,
at the end of it,
it says,
uh,

697
00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:14.550
the earth is yours and everything that's in it.
And what's more,
you'll be a man,

698
00:38:14.551 --> 00:38:18.600
my son,
and that you'll be a man,
my son.
But what about the women?
How,

699
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.490
how can you not be recognizing the women?

700
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.990
And in a day and age where men can be women and women can be men,

701
00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.440
we can't allow this possible.
He's obviously speaking to me too,

702
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:32.880
but there's outrage.
Oh,
no,
no,
no.
He's only mentioned men,
right?
Um,

703
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.950
it's the most beautiful poem.
Our children learn it off heart,
right?

704
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.800
But children elsewhere will never have access to Kipling.

705
00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:42.460
Now everyone needs has to be taught about talk to taught Shakespeare.

706
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.440
You're gonna come by law.
You have to be taught Shakespeare.

707
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.830
But the fact is we indulge in Shakespeare,

708
00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:52.150
we love Shakespeare because Shakespeare is so beautiful and extraordinary.

709
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:54.820
I'm just cause he's a dead white guy.
Well,

710
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.120
does that mean that he didn't write beautifully?
You know,
they're,

711
00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.910
they're just some beautiful,
I mean,
you know,
love is not love,

712
00:39:00.911 --> 00:39:04.030
which alters when it alteration,
finds or bends with the remover to remove.

713
00:39:04.031 --> 00:39:08.080
It's all so beautiful.
And you want the children to be able to access this.

714
00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:11.680
And we teach them other poems like Invictus,
which means an unstoppable.

715
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.070
And when it was one of Mandela's favorite poems,
um,
and you know,

716
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:20.200
they say at the end,
I am the master of my fate.
I am the captain of my soul.

717
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.650
And all of our kids put their hands on here when they say I on the master of my

718
00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:23.921
fate.

719
00:39:23.921 --> 00:39:28.540
And there's nearly 200 kids in the lunch hall Olis belting this out and loving

720
00:39:28.541 --> 00:39:31.330
it because they are the masters of their fate.
Um,

721
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:35.500
and it's teaching the kids that and inspiring them to make a difference with

722
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:38.590
their lives,
whatever their color as opposed to saying,
oh,

723
00:39:38.591 --> 00:39:40.660
well there's racism and sexism in the world,

724
00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:43.090
therefore you're never going to be able to succeed.
Um,

725
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:45.670
because then you have to give up and don't worry because there's welfare.

726
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.260
So you can always just,
you know,

727
00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.560
you can just take the welfare instead of instead of making something of your

728
00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:52.390
life,
you know,
and,
um,

729
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.800
that is what it is to kill a man when you kill his self determination and you

730
00:39:56.801 --> 00:40:01.600
kill his,
his agency and you kill his motivation to do something with his life,

731
00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:06.490
that is to kill a man.
And that is what the left is doing.
And,

732
00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:10.210
and I say that's about that.
That is racism.
I do.
And,
and,
and,

733
00:40:10.211 --> 00:40:14.380
and we should say it out loud,
but we never do the conservatives never call it,

734
00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:19.150
and they should call it what it is.
Um,
and you know,

735
00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.340
well,
what can you do?
You just got to keep going.
Right?

736
00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.750
<v 2>What a beautiful ending.
That's it right there.</v>

737
00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:28.410
We're going to clip that one and do something with that.
Cause I was just barely,

738
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:32.290
well,
that this is what it's all about.
Everything that I'm trying to do here.

739
00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:35.590
You're talking about the roots and the foundation of all that,

740
00:40:35.591 --> 00:40:39.820
and you're doing it and I promise you I will make it to the school when I'm in

741
00:40:39.821 --> 00:40:42.090
the UK for sure.
That'd be great.
Can I do a little something?

742
00:40:42.091 --> 00:40:45.580
Can you give a little talk maybe or that'd be lovely.
We can do something.

743
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.620
They figured out that this was really a pleasure.
Thank you so much.

744
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:53.080
And thanks to Douglas by the way.
So we were used by Douglas Murray.
Yes,
yes.
No,

745
00:40:53.081 --> 00:40:57.100
I know that everyone's your friend who dad was here for more on Catherine.

746
00:40:57.101 --> 00:41:01.270
Follow her on Twitter.
