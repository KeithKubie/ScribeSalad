the lectures you will learn about cutting edge

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.820
research problems in computer networking and you'll also

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.740
gain the ability to come up with your

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.560
own problems. We'll pick up the basics along

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.540
the way as necessary. In addition to the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.750
lectures there are also a number of problem

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.000
sets or assignments that you will work through.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.890
As you work your way through the course. The

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.790
problem sets and assignments in the course will give

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.120
you proficiency with the tools and technologies that are

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.970
state of the art in the research community. That will

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.820
allow you to follow through on the research ideas

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.180
that you may come up with as we work

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.730
through various topics in the course. There are tons

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.000
of exciting tools to use, and the problem sets and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.270
assignments will help you gain proficiency with them.
