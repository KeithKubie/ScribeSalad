00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.462
So we just saw the solution to this problem, but there's actually a slightly

00:00:03.474 --> 00:00:07.096
different way to think about solving it, an equivalent way. Neither one is more

00:00:07.108 --> 00:00:10.682
correct than the other, but it might be useful for some of you to think about it

00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:14.341
in this slightly different way. So, before I said that we would divide each side

00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:17.975
by negative 3, because the coefficient over here is negative 3. What if instead

00:00:17.987 --> 00:00:21.463
though, I said that I wanted you to multiply by some number on each side, and

00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:26.135
then you would still be left with the same answer of x equals negative 4. What

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:30.656
number would you have to multiply both sides by in order to end up with the same

00:00:30.668 --> 00:00:31.065
answer?
