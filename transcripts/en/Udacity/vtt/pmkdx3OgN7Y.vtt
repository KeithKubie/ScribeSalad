Now it's your turn.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.520
In the assignment you'll be building

classifier deep.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.000
You'll also play with the various
forms of regularization.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.910
The amount of code that you need
to change is very small, so

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.520
don't hesitate to play around and
try new things.
