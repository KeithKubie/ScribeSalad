00:00:00.535 --> 00:00:01.961
- [Instructor] This is a map of East Asia

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:04.547
in the 19th century and you
can already see significant

00:00:04.547 --> 00:00:07.791
imperial control by
Western European powers.

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:11.711
You have the British East
India Company in India,

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.930
you have the French
initially getting a foothold

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.501
in Southeast Vietnam in this orange area

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:20.273
but eventually they will
take over this entire region

00:00:20.273 --> 00:00:24.211
that will become one day
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.772
You have the Dutch in Indonesia
and you have the Spanish

00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:30.007
in the Philippines, but
what we're going to focus on

00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.768
in this video is the European
and in particular the British

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:37.935
attempt to open up the Chinese
markets to British trade.

00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:43.695
China at the time under the
control of the Qing Dynasty.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.966
Well before this period,
Chinese products were in demand

00:00:47.966 --> 00:00:49.163
in Europe, in particular,

00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:52.680
Chinese porcelain and Chinese silk.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.619
Unfortunate for the Europeans,
the Chinese did not have

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:58.664
a lot of demand for European products

00:00:58.664 --> 00:01:01.369
and so you had a balance of trade problem.

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.795
These products would be
exported from China into Europe

00:01:04.795 --> 00:01:09.451
and you would have hard silver
currency going to China.

00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:12.244
And so the imperial powers,
especially the British,

00:01:12.244 --> 00:01:14.695
were looking for a solution,
and they eventually found

00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:19.247
that opium grown in India, which
is a highly addictive drug,

00:01:19.247 --> 00:01:22.188
it's the core constituent
of heroin and morphine,

00:01:22.188 --> 00:01:25.680
could be addictive to the
Chinese people and maybe

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.266
could help solve this
balance of trade problem,

00:01:28.266 --> 00:01:32.230
that silver could then
flow outside of China.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.498
Well you could imagine
the Chinese government,

00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:37.015
the Qing Dynasty, had no
interest in opium coming in

00:01:37.015 --> 00:01:40.202
to China, it was destructive
to their society,

00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:45.199
it was an addictive drug, but
in 1839, the British decide

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:48.972
to force the issue and you
have what will be known

00:01:48.972 --> 00:01:50.889
as the First Opium War.

00:01:52.008 --> 00:01:55.484
This is a picture of the
Second Battle of Chuenpi,

00:01:55.484 --> 00:01:58.006
you see the British vessel
Nemesis, which is actually owned

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:00.722
by a company, the British
East India Company,

00:02:00.722 --> 00:02:05.058
destroying Chinese junk ships
and because of this show

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:07.471
of force and this military superiority,

00:02:07.471 --> 00:02:11.783
they were able to win the
First Opium War and extract

00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:14.616
major concessions from Qing China.

00:02:15.634 --> 00:02:18.770
The Chinese had to open
up five ports to trade

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.915
with the British, they had to
give the island of Hong Kong

00:02:22.915 --> 00:02:24.825
to the British indefinitely
and the British would keep

00:02:24.825 --> 00:02:28.849
control of it all the way until
the end of the 20th century.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.701
The Chinese had to pay for
opium that they destroyed,

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:34.557
they had to give
reparations to the British

00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:37.620
to pay for the costs of the war.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.992
Now to add insult to injury,
the British were not satisfied

00:02:40.992 --> 00:02:44.824
and in 1856, you have
the Second Opium War,

00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:47.996
where they tried to extract
even more concessions

00:02:47.996 --> 00:02:51.753
from China, after which
opium is legalized,

00:02:51.753 --> 00:02:54.606
the whole time opium
flooding into the country

00:02:54.606 --> 00:02:58.177
and really undermining the
social fabric of society.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:02.955
To make matters worse for China,
you have a major civil war

00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:06.050
in this time period,
the Taiping Rebellion,

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.717
which was started by this sect
of Christianity that viewed

00:03:09.717 --> 00:03:13.280
it as their destiny to
overthrow the Qing Dynasty

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.716
and this is one of the
most bloody civil wars

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:19.045
that any nation has seen in
history, with over 20 million

00:03:19.045 --> 00:03:22.096
people being killed and
historians believe that the Qing

00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:24.537
concessions to the British
and then the French

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:28.024
and also the opium that was
undermining Chinese society

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:32.191
was a major contributor to
this long and bloody civil war.

00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:37.567
These opium wars are often
cited by Japanese in this

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:41.446
time period as a reason for
their need to industrialize

00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:45.214
and become imperial power so
that they don't get unraveled

00:03:45.214 --> 00:03:50.162
the same way that Qing
China does by the Europeans.

00:03:50.162 --> 00:03:53.177
But to appreciate that
this was even controversial

00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:54.010
in Europe.

00:03:55.292 --> 00:03:59.012
William Gladstone, as we enter
into the First Opium War,

00:03:59.012 --> 00:04:01.981
was a young parliamentarian in Britain

00:04:01.981 --> 00:04:05.495
and he will eventually be, at
the end of the 19th century,

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.915
a significant British prime minister.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:12.183
But as the opium war was beginning,

00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:15.821
he gave a famous speech in Parliament.

00:04:15.821 --> 00:04:18.403
"It is a matter of
certainty that if we stopped

00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:21.682
"the exportation of opium
from Bengal and broke up

00:04:21.682 --> 00:04:25.249
"the depot at Lintin and
checked the cultivation of it

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:29.077
"in Malwa and put a moral
stigma upon it, that we should

00:04:29.077 --> 00:04:33.294
"greatly cripple if not
extinguish the trade in it.

00:04:33.294 --> 00:04:35.150
"The great principles of justice

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.723
"are involved in this matter.

00:04:37.723 --> 00:04:41.521
"You," and he's talking to I
believe the Foreign Minister

00:04:41.521 --> 00:04:44.994
who is an aggressive
proponent of the opium wars,

00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:47.829
"You will be called upon to
show cause for your present

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:51.531
"intention of making war upon the Chinese.

00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:55.561
"They gave us notice to
abandon the contraband trade,

00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:56.999
"the trade in opium.

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:59.791
"When they found that we
would not, they had the right

00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:03.085
"to drive us from their coasts
on account of our obstinacy

00:05:03.085 --> 00:05:07.316
"in persisting in this infamous
and atrocious traffic."

00:05:07.316 --> 00:05:10.358
And opium was addictive and
William Gladstone had personal

00:05:10.358 --> 00:05:14.783
experience with this, his
sister became addicted to opium.

00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:18.574
He went on to say, "I am not
competent to judge how long

00:05:18.574 --> 00:05:22.997
"this war may last, but
this I can say, that a war

00:05:22.997 --> 00:05:26.209
"more unjust in its origin,
a war more calculated

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:29.397
"in its progress to cover
this country with permanent

00:05:29.397 --> 00:05:33.564
"disgrace, I do not know,
and I have not read of."

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:36.119
And a few days later, he wrote,

00:05:36.119 --> 00:05:40.266
"I am in dread of the
judgments of god upon England

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:43.766
"for our national iniquity towards China."
