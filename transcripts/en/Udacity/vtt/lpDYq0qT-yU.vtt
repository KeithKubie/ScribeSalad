00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.340
Let's look into this a bit further.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.620
I want to arrange my 10 sticks
of gum with 1 pack per column.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.420
So if I bought 2 packs of
gum with 5 sticks each,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.280
I would have 2 columns and
each column will have 5 sticks of gum.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.440
So I can just rearrange that a little
bit, and it'll look like this.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.500
I now have 2 columns of gum,
1 column for

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.770
each pack and 5 rows of gum,
so 5 pieces in each pack.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.090
To find the total number
of sticks of gum,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.640
I can multiply the number of
packs of gum, which is 2,

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.520
by the number of sticks per pack,
which is 5, and that gives 10.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.600
So I have 10 sticks of gum.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.173
But if I had instead bought 5
packs of gum with 2 sticks each,

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:47.045
I would have 5 columns and
each column would have 2 sticks of gum.

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:48.543
That would look like this.

00:00:48.543 --> 00:00:55.130
See, 5 columns, 1 for each pack,
and 2 rows, 1 for each piece.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.750
I still have 10 pieces of gum.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.880
They're just arranged differently.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.490
These two arrangements are equivalent.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.220
We have just reversed the rows and
the columns.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.460
Switching the order of the rows and
the columns does not change the results.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.400
This is the main characteristic
of the commutative property.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.220
The commutative property states that
changing the order of the terms does

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.420
not change the outcome of the operation.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.060
So which operations follow
the commutative property?

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.340
Addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.420
