00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.799
Contraception, with a variety of methods
available many people are able to avoid

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.950
unintended pregnancies.  But what happens
when things don't go quite as planned?

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.769
Thanks to modern science a second chance
is possible.  So how does emergency

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.529
contraception or "plan-b" work?  And what
exactly is happening inside the female

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.119
body? During the female menstrual
cycle many hormones are released

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.529
beginning a chain reaction.  The pituitary
gland in the brain releases FSH

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.580
which stimulates the growth of follicles
and a premature egg in the ovaries.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.600
These follicles then release
estrogen

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.030
which helps prepare the uterus lining
and triggers the brain to release leutinizing

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.640
hormone or LH.  LH then
triggers ovulation in which the egg is

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.940
released into the fallopian tubes where it
will spend around twelve to twenty-four

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.970
hours waiting to be fertilized.  If the
egg isn't fertilized in this time it

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.940
begins to dissolve and is shed away with
the uterine lining during menstruation. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.490
Though this window of opportunity is brief
it's increased by the fact that sperm

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.260
can live for up to five days.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.450
So the keen sperm from days ago show up early to the show anxiously awaiting

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.359
ovulation.

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.330
Birth control pills taken on a regular
basis modify these hormone levels.  By

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.420
increasing progestin levels the body
thinks it's already released an egg or

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.819
already pregnant.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:15.409
It effectively decreases FSH and LH and the cycle halts.  But in the case

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.520
of emergency contraception which is only
taken if regular contraception methods

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.200
fail,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.149
a few different mechanisms take place.
 The most important thing to understand

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.869
is that fertilization doesn't happen
immediately or even within hours after

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.130
intercourse.  Instead the sperm must
undergo a few biological changes in the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.630
fallopian tube first which takes time.  This is why emergency contraception is

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.840
still possible the morning after.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.609
It can actually work up to five days
after intercourse.  If taken during the

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.719
first half of the menstrual cycle,
emergency contraception works

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.040
specifically to prevent ovulation.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.170
This way the egg is not released even
though it may be ready and the available

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.299
sperm cannot fertilize it.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.940
In cases where it's too late to inhibit ovulation

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.270
emergency contraception is thought to
also thicken cervical mucus trapping sperm.

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:04.840
As well, it may directly inhibit
fertilization between sperm and egg.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.599
Clinical studies show that emergency
contraception prevents pregnancy

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.209
before fertilization.  No studies have
shown an effect from emergency

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.059
contraception if fertilization has
already occurred.  It does not stop

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:19.909
implantation from happening nor does it
have any effect after implantation has

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:20.799
occurred.

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.739
In this way, its unable to cause an abortion.

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.629
And while there are some minor side effects to
these drugs, such as nausea and headaches,

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.749
scientific studies have demonstrated its
safety in women of all ages and found

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:36.309
that the benefits far outweigh any risks.
