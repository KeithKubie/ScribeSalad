00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.120
NARRATOR: As a new day begins
on Oak Island, Rick Lagina,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.170
along with his nephew Peter
Fornetti, Craig Tester,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.000
and other members of their
team, gather at the Oak

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.040
Island Visitor's Center.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.460
- Hi, are you Brennan?
- I'm Brennan.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.620
Craig Tester.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.380
Nice to meet you,
Craig, finally.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.170
Nice to meet you.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.880
NARRATOR: They have scheduled
a meeting with representatives

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.170
of Choice Drilling, a company
that specializes in a process

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.580
known as sonic drilling.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.710
So that's the rig?

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.580
This is the rig.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.830
NARRATOR: Unlike regular air
or mud rotary drilling, which

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.580
uses powerful drill
bits to literally grind

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.670
beneath the ground,
sonic drilling uses

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.000
vibrations to create a high
frequency sound which can

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.380
literally pulverize obstacles.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.000
A coring barrel is
then used to extract

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.420
samples of earth and
objects from areas

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.540
as much as 500 feet deep.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.880
I think we all are quite
curious how this rig works.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.250
We've never seen one before.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.750
Should be a treat for you.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.380
Well, we've got some
real targets for you.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.540
We'll see.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.960
Well, I'm eager
for the challenge.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.750
Well, it is Oak Island.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.420
It is.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.460
CRAIG TESTER: Let's head on
back so you guys can set up.

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.120
All right.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.790
Sounds good.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.040
Good luck.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.710
I've always been
against just guessing.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.420
I mean, the whole point
of the seismic program

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.620
was to find anomalous features
underground in the Money Pit.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.880
Well, they targeted an area
that's worth investigating.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.920
And thus we're going
to drill there.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.620
If you can't get excited about
that, it's time to go home.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.250
NARRATOR: Assisting the team
with their drilling operation

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.380
is area geologist
Terry Matheson.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.790
OK, so the surveyors put
in the D line, D2 to D6.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.290
So there's our spot.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.620
So it's halfway between
D and E, right on line 6.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.580
So DE6.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.000
DE6 it is.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.420
NARRATOR: Using last year's
geotech grid as a reference,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.000
the team has decided
to dig their first hole

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.290
at a location known as DE6.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.620
Here, they hope to find not only
a possible system of tunnels

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.250
some 100 feet deep, but
also a 30-foot wide chamber

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.460
at a depth of
approximately 170 feet.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.330
Well, there it goes.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.670
Is it through?

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.670
Yeah, it went through fast.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.830
Excellent.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.040
Well, who knows what this is?

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.120
All right.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.960
Take the bit right over.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.710
Oh!

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.670
Bring it on over.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.540
Here it comes.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.460
That's, uh, 83--

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.540
or 93.
Sorry.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.290
93.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.380
93.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.540
Wow.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.790
That's interesting.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.460
And that's the way it's cut.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.330
I love it.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.040
It was laying this way.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.880
Yeah.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.710
Not standing up.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:55.880
It was laying like this.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.710
So it could be the
top of a tunnel.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.000
Wow.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.460
NARRATOR: Wood from a tunnel?

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.880
But from what period?

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.250
Could it be little more than the
remains of a searcher tunnel,

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.750
one of the dozens
that have been dug

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.250
on the island over the years?

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.250
Or could it be physical evidence
from an original underground

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.830
structure, one that may have
been put there centuries ago

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.920
by the people who came
to the island looking

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.000
to hide an incredible treasure?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.920
Yeah, man.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.920
Hey, guys.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.920
Hi.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.750
Wow.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.000
Look what we got.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.750
This is what we
came into at 93 feet.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.750
We came right out
of the material

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.380
into a horizontal beam.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.580
So it sure looks
like it's a tunnel.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.830
We've encountered
what we believe

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.250
to be a tunnel in an area
where we have our target

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.420
based on the seismic data.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.250
But we don't know
what that means.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.210
It could be original work.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.580
We don't know.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.380
And that's what we're
trying to decipher.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.750
It's exciting.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.380
It can't be just a coincidence.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.420
Definitely get
this carbon dated.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.920
If it comes back
really, really old, then

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.290
we know it's original people.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.120
Exactly.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.960
Yeah.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.460
NARRATOR: The discovery of
a possible tunnel directly

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.460
connected to the
Money Pit offers

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.920
exciting news for the Laginas
and members of their team.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.790
It means that the seismic data
they received from Eagle Canada

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.460
was able to accurately
pinpoint the existence

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.790
of a structure located
some 93 feet below ground.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.960
It also means that as they
continue to drill down deeper,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.000
the team may also be successful
at finding another critically

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.960
important chamber, the one
which they believe might contain

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.670
the legendary Chappel vault.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:51.500
Is this interesting?

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.830
Absolutely.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.830
You know, it mandates
that we continue.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.330
And we're going to
continue the process

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.460
and get down to the where
the anomaly is featured.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.170
Yeah.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.580
Exactly.
