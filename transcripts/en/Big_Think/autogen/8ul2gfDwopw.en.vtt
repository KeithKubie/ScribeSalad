I am by no means the first person to

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:08.180
I am by no means the first person to
 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.220
I am by no means the first person to
point out that the agricultural

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:09.230
point out that the agricultural
 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.420
point out that the agricultural
revolution was a disaster for human

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430
revolution was a disaster for human
 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.680
revolution was a disaster for human
beings

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690

lots of scholars before me have made the

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420
lots of scholars before me have made the
 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.660
lots of scholars before me have made the
similar point this is very important

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670
similar point this is very important
 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.300
similar point this is very important
because the agricultural revolution

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310
because the agricultural revolution
 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.970
because the agricultural revolution
takes place at the same time as the

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980
takes place at the same time as the
 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.160
takes place at the same time as the
Neolithic Revolution right it's seen as

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170
Neolithic Revolution right it's seen as
 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.460
Neolithic Revolution right it's seen as
this massive jump in human evolution

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470
this massive jump in human evolution
 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.130
this massive jump in human evolution
where we stopped hunting and gathering

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140
where we stopped hunting and gathering
 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.770
where we stopped hunting and gathering
and we began planting and harvesting

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780
and we began planting and harvesting
 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.979
and we began planting and harvesting
instead and the common sense theory is

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989
instead and the common sense theory is
 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.650
instead and the common sense theory is
that this was a good thing for a

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660
that this was a good thing for a
 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.380
that this was a good thing for a
humanity that it increased our food

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390
humanity that it increased our food
 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.900
humanity that it increased our food
supply that it allowed us to actually

supply that it allowed us to actually
 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.060
supply that it allowed us to actually
settle and create villages it

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070
settle and create villages it
 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.889
settle and create villages it
essentially was the first step to

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899
essentially was the first step to
 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.549
essentially was the first step to
creating what we know as civilization

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559
creating what we know as civilization
 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.810

of the Neolithic Revolution that human

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229
of the Neolithic Revolution that human
 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.130
of the Neolithic Revolution that human
beings actually ended up consuming fewer

beings actually ended up consuming fewer
 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.330
beings actually ended up consuming fewer
calories and certainly fewer proteins

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340
calories and certainly fewer proteins
 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.830

during the Agricultural Revolution than

we've discovered that the process of

we've discovered that the process of
 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.179
we've discovered that the process of
farming actually created a whole range

farming actually created a whole range
 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.960

hunting and it was there were enormous

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490
hunting and it was there were enormous
 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.420
hunting and it was there were enormous
costs to that transition so there been a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430
costs to that transition so there been a
 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.600
costs to that transition so there been a
lot of speculation about why the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610
lot of speculation about why the
 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.569
lot of speculation about why the
transition some have argued that it's

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579
transition some have argued that it's
 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.399
transition some have argued that it's
because of climactic reasons that there

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409
because of climactic reasons that there
 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.280
because of climactic reasons that there
was a massive shift of climate that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290
was a massive shift of climate that
 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.600
was a massive shift of climate that
essentially compelled people to begin

planting there's really no evidence to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200
planting there's really no evidence to
 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.929
planting there's really no evidence to
prove that point some have said that

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939
prove that point some have said that
 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.429
prove that point some have said that
it's because there was a a sudden drop

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:09.439
it's because there was a a sudden drop
 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.289
it's because there was a a sudden drop
in the number of species that were

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299
in the number of species that were
 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.129
in the number of species that were
available to be hunted there's again no

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:15.139
available to be hunted there's again no
 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:16.059

real evidence
 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.789
real evidence
of that at all this is one of those

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799
of that at all this is one of those
 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:20.890
of that at all this is one of those
moments again where we just don't know

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900
moments again where we just don't know
 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.429
moments again where we just don't know
why but I present what I think is a

00:02:24.429 --> 00:02:24.439
why but I present what I think is a
 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:27.039
why but I present what I think is a
fairly novel theory one that others have

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049
fairly novel theory one that others have
 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:29.170
fairly novel theory one that others have
discussed before which is that the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180
discussed before which is that the
 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.539
discussed before which is that the
reason we stopped hunting and gathering

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549
reason we stopped hunting and gathering
 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.649
reason we stopped hunting and gathering
and started farming instead was because

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659
and started farming instead was because
 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.069
and started farming instead was because
of religion and in this particular case

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079
of religion and in this particular case
 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.690
of religion and in this particular case
institutionalized religion the argument

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700
institutionalized religion the argument
 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.959
institutionalized religion the argument

lived so we know that this was a place
 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.890

of religious significance a place that
