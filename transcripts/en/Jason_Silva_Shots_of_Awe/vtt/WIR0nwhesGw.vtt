JASON SILVA: You know, there
is a constant debate that

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.000
takes place when looking at
the subject of technology,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.660
between people that argue that
technology is part of who we

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.150
are, and those that believe
that technology is fundamentally

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.050
unnatural, and that it's a tool
that's being used ultimately

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.030
to destroy the world.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.100
I don't fall into that camp.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.580
I echo Kevin Kelly's
ideas that stipulate

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.470
that actually technology is
the real skin of our species.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.440
Technology is the exterioration
of our nervous system.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.810
Technology is our extended mind.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.960
I phone, therefore I am.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.470
But think about it--
technology is literally the way

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.430
we turn our mind
inside out, right?

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.290
The cognitive philosophers,
Andy Clark and David Chalmers

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.220
describe it as a
kind of scaffolding

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.330
that extends our thoughts,
our reach, and our vision.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.040
We are a tool-making
animal that has

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.200
been in a symbiotic feedback
loop with technology

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.740
since the beginning
of stone tools.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.610
I mean, think about it--
once we created stone tools,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.770
our jaws shrank.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.600
Once we discovered that
fire could cook our foods,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.420
making every meal
more efficient,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.340
it freed up the
cognitive real estate

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.310
necessary for the emergence of
culture, religion, and arts.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.250
So you might say
that who we are is

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.090
due to the feedback loops
between us and our tools,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.640
to the degree that our tools
become extended appendages

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.250
that, even though they are
not within our biological skin

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.500
tissue, they are nonetheless a
part of our cognitive arsenal.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.920
They are a part of us, the same
way a nest is a part of a bird,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.960
and a spider's web is
a part of the spider.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.990
It is our extended phenotype.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.030
It is who we are.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.485
It is our termites' colony,
it is temperature-controlled,

00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:07.860
it is the extension
of our mindedness.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.090
This is technology,
this is the technium,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.570
the seventh kingdom of life.
