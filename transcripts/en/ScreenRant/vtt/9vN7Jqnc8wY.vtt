00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.490
When a blockbuster movie is just months away,
fans can't resist dissecting the trailers

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.460
and TV spots for hints of what to expect.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.930
But even casual fans will want to catch these
Easter Eggs and awesome details in popular

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.930
trailers.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.510
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Amazing Hidden Details
In Popular Movie Trailers.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.610
Deadpool

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.000
When the first test footage leaked, fans of
Deadpool related so strongly, Fox greenlit

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the movie immediately.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.500
One of the creators of the oddball assassin,
Rob Liefeld got a shout out in that test reel,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.250
but the movie's trailer took a different route
- literally.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.309
Eagle-eyed fans can catch both names of co-creator
Fabian Nicieza marking road signs in the background

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.940
of the trailer's freeway fight scene.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.670
Batman V Superman

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.559
The first face-to-face meeting between Clark
Kent and Bruce Wayne showed that Gotham's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.190
caped crusader doesn't have much respect for
Superman, or the disasters he helps solve.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.410
It's a common example, but it isn't random.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.929
It's actually a nod to the first Superman
movie, when Christopher Reeve was seen doing

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.559
exactly that.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.930
Another interesting nod is hidden in the shots
where Superman lifts a russian rocket with

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.960
the number “300” on it.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.140
It’s a clear reference to director Zack
Snyder’s other epic movie, “300”.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.240
Star Trek Beyond

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.610
The fact that the Enterprise is actually shown
being torn apart in the first trailer for

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.060
Star Trek Beyond rubbed some fans the wrong
way - but it also marooned Kirk and the crew

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.109
on an alien planet.

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.299
The crew's solution may actually be given
away thanks to a song choice: "Sabotage,"

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030
by the Beastie Boys.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.750
Scotty might not know the tune, but Trek fans
do.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.430
It's the same song Kirk played when he stole
his uncle's Corvette in the first movie.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.600
Since the crew seems to be stealing a new
spaceship, Kirk can't help but realize the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.600
coincidence.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.340
Captain America: Civil War

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.930
In the pages of Marvel Comics, Captain America's
friend Bucky didn't stay a sidekick for good,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.810
eventually taking the shield and title in
Steve's absence.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.990
The first Captain America movie showed Bucky
wielding the shield as a nod to that fact,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.409
and again in The Winter Soldier.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.999
Civil War keeps the trend alive, with Bucky
handling the shield in a fight with Iron Man.

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:03.469
Whether he takes the Captain America role
in the movies... remains to be seen.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.210
If that wasn't enough, the trailer also shows
a subtle upgrade to the Iron Man armor.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.410
Fans can catch a glimpse of the suit's helmet
Disappearing behind Tony Stark's head.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.860
It may just be a way to easily get Tony's
face on screen, but the idea of a flexible

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.760
suit of armor plates will instantly have fans
hoping for the Bleeding Edge nanotech armor,

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.100
which is actually stored inside Tony's body
in the comics.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.720
But we wouldn't hold our breath on that one.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.240
Independence Day Resurgence
Fans of the original Independence Day had

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.050
hoped that Will Smith would return for the
sequel, but before the movie started filming,

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.710
it was confirmed that his character, Captain
Steven Hiller wouldn't make an appearance.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.700
But the first trailer delivered a nasty surprise,
when the website built for the trailer’s

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.500
release showed us a timeline of events, one
of the moments explained his absence.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.580
Killing off the first movie's hero isn't a
crowd pleasing solution - but it does the

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.580
job.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.450
X-Men: Apocalypse

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.320
With brand new mutants being introduced or
reinvented in X-Men: Apocalypse, it's easy

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.370
to see why fans might miss some small details
from the trailer.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.820
For starters, the brand new, futuristic uniforms
may keep fans from noticing that Quicksilver

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.200
has apparently joined the team, after a brief,
but unforgettable scene from the previous

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200
movie.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.370
There is another cool easter egg in the shot
where Apocalypse is seen entering a dark room,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.430
the bald character is none other than Caliban,
of the Morlocks, that Bryan Singer decided

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.340
to bring to the big screen.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.340
Warcraft

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.340
Fans of the Warcraft video game series didn't
know what to expect from a movie version,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.310
but the first trailer showed it was mostly
the mythology of the franchise that would

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.310
be adapted.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.240
But one game easter egg made it through.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.270
The fields of Westfield shown in the trailer
aren't being farmed by humans, but mechanical

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.210
harvest golems, pulled right from the starting
zones of World of Warcraft.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.600
Those are the trailer moments and Easter Eggs
we caught, but which details from your favorite

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.720
trailers have we missed?
