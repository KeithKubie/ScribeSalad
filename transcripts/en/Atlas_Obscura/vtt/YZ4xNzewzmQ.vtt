00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.020
- Leonard Bernstein, Eleanor Roosevelt,

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.020
Orville Wright, Albert
Einstein, and Pablo Picasso.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.670
No other place can you find
the collection of people

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.910
in one miniature book, approximately

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.310
the size of a quarter, ever again

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.280
on planet Earth. We have it.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.123
This is Colleen Moore's Fairy Castle.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.290
My name is Margaret Schlesinger,
and I'm a curator here

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.166
at the Museum of Science and Industry.

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:47.090
The idea is fairies live
inside of the castle,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.766
even today, and that we as visitors

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:54.766
are seeing the room as
the fairy just left.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.100
So books are still out in the library,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.170
the kettle is still on in the kitchen,

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.190
and the place setting is ready for

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.733
dinner once the humans leave.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.620
Colleen Moore was an incredibly
successful film star.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.990
She collaborated with the highest-end

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.023
designers and architects
and fabricated this castle.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.040
It began in 1928, it cost
over $500,000 to create,

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.070
which in today's money would
be in the millions of dollars.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.610
It has materials such as alabaster,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.610
ivory, bone, opal, there are pieces of

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.240
World War II wood in the
pewter mugs in the kitchen.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.460
The polar bear rug in
the prince's bedroom-

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.380
no polar bears were harmed in the making

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.590
of the polar bear rug, just so you know.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.770
It is actually an ermine pelt and

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.293
a head and teeth of a mouse. Cheese!

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.230
It was finished in the early 1930s.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.130
By then, the country was
crushed in the Great Depression,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.423
but she traveled the castle nonetheless.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.090
It was Colleen's dream of bringing joy

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.630
to millions around the world.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.340
Over the course of 10 years, it traveled

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.430
on three designated train cars,

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.420
it went to 40 cities. It's something

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.493
that people would have
never seen before in person.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.610
These are the chairs from
the story of the three little

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.610
bears. They are probably a
third of the size of a grain of

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.450
rice. If I were to take
off the dome of glass,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.133
I would have to wear a mask
so I wouldn't inhale them.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.377
Inside of the library, on the bookcases,

00:02:54.377 --> 00:02:57.300
is one of my most favorite pieces,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.500
which is an iron maiden. It's
a medieval torture device.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.160
So it's in miniature and it's platinum,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.980
and you can open it and there are actually

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.143
spikes inside, so it's super cool.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.743
When you look at a room, you
see something new every time.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.950
I do find it very
inspiring. I find Colleen

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.399
to be inspiring, and I find that

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.979
when I sneak down here and I overhear

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:26.310
the adults talking to the children,

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.150
it's just so exciting because

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.150
they just get so caught up
in the magic of the castle.
