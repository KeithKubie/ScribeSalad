00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:58.340
and New York that have done a really
 

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.760
and New York that have done a really
good job in overcoming those barriers so

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:00.770
good job in overcoming those barriers so
 

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:02.950
good job in overcoming those barriers so
for example electricity consumption per

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:02.960
for example electricity consumption per
 

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.410
for example electricity consumption per
capita in both California and New York

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:05.420
capita in both California and New York
 

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.920
capita in both California and New York
is forty percent 40 percent below the

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:08.930
is forty percent 40 percent below the
 

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.460

right and so we might be able to scoff

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:15.140
right and so we might be able to scoff
 

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.900
right and so we might be able to scoff
at California but New York state the

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:16.910
at California but New York state the
 

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:19.540
at California but New York state the
state just north of us has managed to

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:19.550
state just north of us has managed to
 

00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:22.960
state just north of us has managed to
cut electricity use per capita forty

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:22.970
cut electricity use per capita forty
 

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.620
cut electricity use per capita forty
percent below what it is we do here so

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:25.630
percent below what it is we do here so
 

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.870
percent below what it is we do here so
what I'm saying is that the targets of

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880
what I'm saying is that the targets of
 

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.680
what I'm saying is that the targets of
how to achieve our energy efficiency how

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:32.690
how to achieve our energy efficiency how
 

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.770
how to achieve our energy efficiency how
we can reduce our energy use are quite

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:35.780
we can reduce our energy use are quite
 

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.240
we can reduce our energy use are quite
achievable there are things that we can

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.250
achievable there are things that we can
 

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:40.840
achievable there are things that we can
do we can get to those those goals of

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:40.850
do we can get to those those goals of
 

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.420
do we can get to those those goals of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:43.430
reducing greenhouse gas emissions
 

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.130
reducing greenhouse gas emissions
certainly in the United States and

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:45.140
certainly in the United States and
 

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.710
certainly in the United States and
probably in the world by simply being

probably in the world by simply being
 

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.390
probably in the world by simply being
more intelligent about the way in which

them so that's that's on a recent one
but I think in terms of the g20 is it's

00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:26.869
but I think in terms of the g20 is it's
 

00:22:26.869 --> 00:22:29.440
but I think in terms of the g20 is it's
very important for this region and and

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:29.450
very important for this region and and
 

00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:31.659
very important for this region and and
pittsburghers don't do this well and

00:22:31.659 --> 00:22:31.669
pittsburghers don't do this well and

trying to solve hard problems with some

00:22:40.269 --> 00:22:40.279
trying to solve hard problems with some
 

00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:41.859
trying to solve hard problems with some
of the smartest people that I've seen

00:22:41.859 --> 00:22:41.869
of the smartest people that I've seen
 

00:22:41.869 --> 00:22:43.599
of the smartest people that I've seen
and I'm not a native Pittsburgher but i

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:43.609
and I'm not a native Pittsburgher but i
 

00:22:43.609 --> 00:22:46.090
and I'm not a native Pittsburgher but i
but i certainly love it here solving

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:46.100
but i certainly love it here solving

00:22:48.129 --> 00:22:48.139
hard problems that are going to change
 

00:22:48.139 --> 00:22:49.659
hard problems that are going to change
the world but one of the things that

00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:49.669
the world but one of the things that
 

00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:52.659
the world but one of the things that
we're not very good at is sharing that

00:22:52.659 --> 00:22:52.669
we're not very good at is sharing that
 

00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:54.879
we're not very good at is sharing that
and talking about that in a way that

00:22:54.879 --> 00:22:54.889
and talking about that in a way that
 

00:22:54.889 --> 00:22:57.549
and talking about that in a way that
breaks it down into practicality so the

00:22:57.549 --> 00:22:57.559
breaks it down into practicality so the
 

00:22:57.559 --> 00:23:00.700
breaks it down into practicality so the
luxury that we have right now is to take

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:00.710
luxury that we have right now is to take
 

00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.649
luxury that we have right now is to take
advantage of the opportunity to talk

00:23:02.649 --> 00:23:02.659
advantage of the opportunity to talk
 

00:23:02.659 --> 00:23:04.690
advantage of the opportunity to talk
about it and to show and to demonstrate

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:04.700
about it and to show and to demonstrate
 

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.460
about it and to show and to demonstrate
our wares just like we did with the

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:06.470
our wares just like we did with the
 

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.499
our wares just like we did with the
Prime Minister showing him the kinds of

00:23:08.499 --> 00:23:08.509
Prime Minister showing him the kinds of
 

00:23:08.509 --> 00:23:10.210
Prime Minister showing him the kinds of
capabilities that we have in robotics

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:10.220
capabilities that we have in robotics
 

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.119
capabilities that we have in robotics
and being comfortable with that is

00:23:13.119 --> 00:23:13.129
and being comfortable with that is
 

00:23:13.129 --> 00:23:14.409
and being comfortable with that is
something that I have noticed that

00:23:14.409 --> 00:23:14.419
something that I have noticed that
 

00:23:14.419 --> 00:23:16.570
something that I have noticed that
pittsburghers or not and in Australia I

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:16.580
pittsburghers or not and in Australia I
 

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.269
pittsburghers or not and in Australia I
spent a lot of time in Australia and the

00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279
spent a lot of time in Australia and the
 

00:23:19.279 --> 00:23:21.460
spent a lot of time in Australia and the
turn was don't be the tall poppy and

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:21.470
turn was don't be the tall poppy and
 

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.680
turn was don't be the tall poppy and
because the tall poppy always gets

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:23.690
because the tall poppy always gets
 

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.200
because the tall poppy always gets
raised and I think that that's one of

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:26.210
raised and I think that that's one of
 

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.369
raised and I think that that's one of
the things that happens here in

00:23:27.369 --> 00:23:27.379
the things that happens here in
 

00:23:27.379 --> 00:23:29.649
the things that happens here in
Pittsburgh is that you know don't shine

00:23:29.649 --> 00:23:29.659
Pittsburgh is that you know don't shine
 

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:31.359
Pittsburgh is that you know don't shine
don't talk too much about it let's just

00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:31.369
don't talk too much about it let's just

unique opportunities for this region to
 

00:24:22.409 --> 00:24:24.340
unique opportunities for this region to
provide leadership on the Energy and

Climate front pittsburgh has reinvented

00:24:28.639 --> 00:24:28.649
Climate front pittsburgh has reinvented
 

00:24:28.649 --> 00:24:31.159
Climate front pittsburgh has reinvented
itself since the steel industry shut

00:24:31.159 --> 00:24:31.169
itself since the steel industry shut
 

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:34.129
itself since the steel industry shut
down and all we have to do is look

00:24:34.129 --> 00:24:34.139
down and all we have to do is look
 

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:35.659
down and all we have to do is look
around the region to see that there are

00:24:35.659 --> 00:24:35.669
around the region to see that there are
 

00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:38.210
around the region to see that there are
many other cities close to us that we're

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220
many other cities close to us that we're
 

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.830
many other cities close to us that we're
in exactly the same position as we are

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840
in exactly the same position as we are
 

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.049
in exactly the same position as we are
that have not reinvented themselves and

00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:42.059
that have not reinvented themselves and
 

00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:44.779
that have not reinvented themselves and
so it's not automatic that once you get

00:24:44.779 --> 00:24:44.789
so it's not automatic that once you get
 

00:24:44.789 --> 00:24:46.970
so it's not automatic that once you get
knocked down and get your nose bloodied

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.980
knocked down and get your nose bloodied
 

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:48.590
knocked down and get your nose bloodied
that you're going to stand up and be

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600
that you're going to stand up and be
 

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.600
that you're going to stand up and be
able to do something and so pittsburgh

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:50.610
able to do something and so pittsburgh
 

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:52.909
able to do something and so pittsburgh
has done that and has done that because

00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919
has done that and has done that because
 

00:24:52.919 --> 00:24:54.999

think we have an enormous opportunity to
go on from here to look forward to what

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:06.090
go on from here to look forward to what
 

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.570
go on from here to look forward to what
it is that we can do taking advantage of

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:08.580
it is that we can do taking advantage of
 

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.060
it is that we can do taking advantage of
the advantages that we have the first

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:11.070
the advantages that we have the first
 

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.070
the advantages that we have the first
and primary advantages at its western

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:13.080
and primary advantages at its western
 

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.619
and primary advantages at its western
Pennsylvania we have these three huge

00:25:15.619 --> 00:25:15.629
Pennsylvania we have these three huge
 

00:25:15.629 --> 00:25:17.659
Pennsylvania we have these three huge
rivers here it's an inherently beautiful

00:25:17.659 --> 00:25:17.669
rivers here it's an inherently beautiful
 

00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:19.999
rivers here it's an inherently beautiful
place as we managed to clean up from our

00:25:19.999 --> 00:25:20.009
place as we managed to clean up from our
 

00:25:20.009 --> 00:25:22.549
place as we managed to clean up from our
not so beautiful passed beyond that

00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559
not so beautiful passed beyond that
 

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:25.220
not so beautiful passed beyond that
we've got the university's we've got the

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:25.230
we've got the university's we've got the
 

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.369
we've got the university's we've got the
medical centers we've got all of the

00:25:28.369 --> 00:25:28.379
medical centers we've got all of the
 

00:25:28.379 --> 00:25:30.139
medical centers we've got all of the
technology that's being spun off from

00:25:30.139 --> 00:25:30.149
technology that's being spun off from
 

00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:32.029
technology that's being spun off from
here so I think that the answer is

00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039
here so I think that the answer is
 

00:25:32.039 --> 00:25:34.340
here so I think that the answer is
overwhelmingly yes that we are in a

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:34.350
overwhelmingly yes that we are in a
 

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.350
overwhelmingly yes that we are in a
position to lead the United States and

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360
position to lead the United States and
 

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.629
position to lead the United States and
the rest of the world to provide jobs

00:25:38.629 --> 00:25:38.639
the rest of the world to provide jobs
 

00:25:38.639 --> 00:25:41.869
the rest of the world to provide jobs
and as I said a few minutes ago not

00:25:41.869 --> 00:25:41.879
and as I said a few minutes ago not
 

00:25:41.879 --> 00:25:43.850
and as I said a few minutes ago not
providing jobs by messing up the

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:43.860
providing jobs by messing up the
 

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.490
providing jobs by messing up the
countryside which is what happened 150

00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500
countryside which is what happened 150
 

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.039
countryside which is what happened 150
years ago but rather by providing jobs

00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:49.049
years ago but rather by providing jobs
 

00:25:49.049 --> 00:25:51.139
years ago but rather by providing jobs
