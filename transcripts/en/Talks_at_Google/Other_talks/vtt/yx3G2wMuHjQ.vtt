DAVE MARKS: Welcome again.

00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:04.350
My name's Dave Marks.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.850
And today we'll be hearing
from Kira Asatryan.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.160
Kira's a relationship
coach, author, blogger,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.190
and loneliness expert.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.900
She calls loneliness a problem
of epidemic proportions

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.992
in our modern times and
writes about this topic

00:00:16.992 --> 00:00:18.450
for various online
blogs, including

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.190
"Time," "Psychology
Today," "Psych Central,"

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.949
and "Elite Daily."

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.865
She's spent her career
researching, pondering,

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:25.780
and reflecting upon
what specifically makes

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.420
relationships good or bad.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.320
And now she's taken
all that knowledge

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.970
and published her first book,
"Stop Being Lonely-- Three

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.230
Simple Steps to Developing
Close Friendships and Deep

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.189
Relationships."

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:37.230
So we've been lucky to
get some subsidized copies

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.400
through Google [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.660
So please pick one up at the
back of the room before you

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.520
go, and I'm sure she'd be
happy to sign them for you,

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.895
if you can stick around for
a few minutes after the talk.

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:47.560
And so with that, I'd like
to introduce to you Kira.

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:53.650
KIRA ASATRYAN: Thank you
for coming, everyone.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.983
Hello, everyone on the internet.

00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.100
I don't have any
slides or anything.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.920
I just am going to talk a little
bit, because I want everybody

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.470
who's listening to this to
kind of get the gist of what

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.590
"Stop Being Lonely" is about
even if you don't end up

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.260
reading it.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.110
So I figured I'd
start by just talking

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.170
a little bit about how to
"Stop Being Lonely" came to be.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.040
When I started writing
it, my only goal

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.770
was really to
write the book that

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.760
would have helped me in my own
social life about 10 years ago.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.130
I'm 32 now, and my
loneliest period of my life

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.510
was in college, which felt very
weird and unusual at the time.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.560
I found out now that it's
actually not that unusual.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.760
But at the time, I
really would have

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.300
liked to have had a book
like "Stop Being Lonely."

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.780
I have really dealt with
loneliness my whole life.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.350
I felt it for as long as
I can remember, really.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.810
And I would also
say that it's fair

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.070
that I've dealt with my own
fair share of shyness and social

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.802
anxiety, which, of course,
can co-occur with loneliness.

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:01.260
But the issue for
me was not really

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.340
that I was afraid to
interact with people,

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.880
which is kind of the
hallmark of social anxiety.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.600
Most of the feedback that I
got from people was positive.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.960
Most people thought I was
generally nice and sweet.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.170
So I didn't really
avoid people because I

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.500
feared their judgment.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.520
I avoided people
because I didn't really

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.190
enjoy interacting with them
that much, at least not as much

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.520
as everyone else seemed to.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.524
And this really
bothered me because I

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.190
would tend to isolate
myself, and then I

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.280
would become extremely
lonely when I was alone.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.600
And I thought, what
was wrong with me?

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.320
Part of what compounded
my frustration

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.861
with my own loneliness
was that there

00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:44.330
wasn't a terribly good
reason for me to be lonely.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.610
I have a really nice family.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.750
In high school, I had people
I could sit with at lunch.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.530
And as an adult, I had
boyfriends and acquaintances,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.159
and I just thought, shouldn't
these relationships be enough?

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.700
But no matter how
many people I could

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.000
put on my objective list
of people in my life,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.040
the same thing always
really bothered me;

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.670
I didn't know what
it was that made

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.440
some relationships feel good
and others feel not so good.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.670
I didn't understand why
some of my interactions

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.550
with some people were loneliness
remedies, while others felt

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.660
like loneliness intensifiers.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.950
I really wanted to understand
the root cause of what

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.610
made me feel close
to certain people

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.270
and not close to other people.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.600
This was really the
central issue for me.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.140
Because not knowing what caused
that feeling of closeness,

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.050
made every interaction
with every person

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.630
feel risky, something
to be avoided.

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.790
So in 2013, I left
my very techie job--

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.880
I was a performance
marketer and I did growth

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.740
at various Facebook
app companies.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.510
I ran Facebook
ads-- in an attempt

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.010
to sort of answer some of
these questions for myself,

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.290
and I became a relationship
coach and mediator.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.380
I spent the first
two years of those

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.812
roughly three years that it's
been researching the science

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:06.895
of intimate relationships.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.480
And I can summarize
what science has

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.000
to say about relationships in
two words; they're complicated.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.190
And what I mean by
that is this; science

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.720
has pinpointed tons and
tons and tons of things

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.970
that you're supposed to do
to have a good relationship

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.650
with someone.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.190
You're supposed to show empathy.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.730
You're supposed
to self-disclose,

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.640
meaning talk about
yourself, but not too much.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.680
You're supposed to offer
practical assistance,

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.190
but not right away.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.400
You're supposed to develop
interdependence, but not

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.192
prematurely-- that's bad--
and so on and so forth.

00:04:43.192 --> 00:04:44.650
And while it all
kind of made sense

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.430
to me, my next thought
was, can anybody really

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.660
do all of this stuff?

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.440
To me, this laundry list of
things you're supposed to have

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.120
and things you're supposed to
do in relationships, things

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.600
you're supposed to have,
like trust, communication,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.930
et cetera, et cetera, just
seemed really, really complex

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.380
to put into practice.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.300
And in real life
interactions, especially

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.150
if you have any amount
of social anxiety,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.444
it's extremely hard
to recall complexities

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:13.110
around what you are
and are not supposed

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.390
to do around other people,
or what you are and are not

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.920
supposed to say to people.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.490
In fact, in my own experience,
convoluted do-this,

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.190
don't-do-that advice make
social anxiety worse.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.280
So I asked myself, is there
any way to make this simple?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.940
Is there a way to streamline
what real research says

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.130
about relationships
and sum it all up

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.380
in some kind of practical way?

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.940
I sat with this question
for a long time.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.050
And then the answer
just kind of came to me,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.460
as answers sometimes do.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.790
And the answer to me it was
this; knowing plus caring

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.020
equals closeness.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.130
Closeness, which is the real
focus of "Stop Being Lonely,"

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.590
is that thing that makes
some relationships feel

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.305
good and others not feel good.

00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:03.180
It's the ingredient that
makes the difference

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.471
between an interaction from
which you walk away feeling

00:06:05.471 --> 00:06:08.530
more lonely or less lonely.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.600
It is, really, for all
intents and purposes,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.820
the antidote to loneliness.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.100
And it's created through
just two things--

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.420
knowing and carrying.

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.760
All of those
scientifically proven bits

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.910
of good relationship
stuff can pretty elegantly

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.710
fit into these two categories.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.660
And what I like about
this formula, so to speak,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.080
is that it's very
easy to remember.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.110
All you really have to
do in a social situation

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:35.660
is ask yourself,
should I be trying

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.090
to know this person
or care about them?

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.190
So before I dive into
what that really means

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:43.790
and what it looks
like in real life,

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.770
I want to circle back to
loneliness for a second,

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.252
because loneliness these
days is really, really weird.

00:06:51.252 --> 00:06:53.210
In another time and place,
you would not really

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.170
feel that lonely, unless
you did something wrong

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.310
or for some reason were
shunned by your people.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.290
But today loneliness
is extremely

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:06.137
frustrating and confusing
for many people.

00:07:06.137 --> 00:07:08.470
And the first thing that's
become abundantly clear to me

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.800
through my work and
my own life experience

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.650
is that modern day
loneliness is not

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.980
caused by a lack of
people in one's life.

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.300
Now, of course, literal
social isolation can cause,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.160
loneliness and social
isolation comes

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.510
with its own list of issues.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.020
If you live out in a cabin
somewhere by yourself

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:30.900
or you live in a very sparsely
populated town or something

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.070
like that, loneliness
is going to be something

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.960
that comes along with that.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.120
But there are a
plethora of studies

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.710
that show that one person
can be physically alone,

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.610
even for a pretty long
time, and feel totally fine.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.860
While another person can
have hundreds of friends

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.230
and feel desperately lonely.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:54.730
So if loneliness and aloneness
are not the same thing, then

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.320
what is loneliness?

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.150
Well, first, it's a feeling.

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.590
It's not an objective state
of being, like aloneness is.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:09.030
And it's actually a feeling
that's kind of hard to define.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.940
Science has a lot of different
definitions for what loneliness

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.582
actually is, and when
it comes down to it,

00:08:14.582 --> 00:08:17.040
it's kind of just one of those
you-feel-it-when-you-feel-it

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.720
feelings.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:23.520
So, for a moment, I want to
take myself back to high school.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.240
As I mentioned earlier, I had
people to sit with at lunch,

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.690
and I was invited by fair
share of social activities

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.897
in high school.

00:08:29.897 --> 00:08:31.480
And if somebody had
asked my teachers,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.530
does Kira have friends?

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.580
They would have said,
yes, she has friends.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.909
But, one day, when I
was in the ninth grade,

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.370
I had a freak
accident with a horse,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.130
and I broke my shoulder
and arm into 16 pieces,

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.620
and I had to have a surgery
that's only ever performed

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.450
on adult male rugby players.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.010
In fact, my surgeon had to
delay the surgery for a week

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.652
so that he could go
learn how to do it.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:01.320
So it was kind of scary
stuff for a 13-year-old.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.110
And to my anguish, it seemed
to me that none of my friends

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.820
really cared.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.320
Of course they noticed that
I was gone for a while.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.040
But once the story of what
had happened circulated,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.102
it seemed to me that their
curiosity was quenched.

00:09:16.102 --> 00:09:18.560
They figured they'd talk to me
about it when they got back,

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.970
and they knew I
was basically OK.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:26.280
But the lack of seeming
concern broke my heart.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.710
It was then that I felt the
distinction between having

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.990
friends and feeling close.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.820
And in our modern world, I
think that this distinction

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.920
between literal
aloneness, or having

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.540
no friends, and the subjective
feeling of loneliness

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.110
is becoming ever more obvious.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.180
Everyone has Facebook friends.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.850
Everyone has a phone
full of contacts

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:50.610
that they could
theoretically contact

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.780
about anything at any time.

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.000
But do we actually do this?

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.180
And does it really matter?

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.090
Personal technology,
specifically

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:03.690
the internet and mobile
phones, has made it

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:07.670
so that we have people available
to us all the time, at least

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.670
in theory.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.920
We never really need to
lose contact with someone.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.730
And if we do,
technology makes it

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.830
so that we can meet someone new.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.010
In many ways, we have
less literal aloneness

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.590
than any other
people have ever had.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.730
And yet, despite this
forever connectedness,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.930
levels of loneliness
are rising across

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.720
the entire Western world.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.380
At any given moment,
one in five Americans,

00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.120
that's 60 million people,
is feeling lonely.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:42.630
And that's up at least 30%
since the '80s-- at least 30%.

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.880
So what does that mean?

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.190
I see these two
things taken together,

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.790
that we have less aloneness,
yet more loneliness,

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.460
to mean that it's not
experiencially enough to have

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.575
people around you.

00:10:55.575 --> 00:10:57.340
And the goal should
not be to have

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.800
more contacts in your phone or
more social media connections.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.410
The goal should be to replace
the negative experience

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:06.910
of loneliness with the
very positive experience

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.070
of closeness.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.910
Or to put it another way, it's
about quality, not quantity.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.690
How one perceives the quality
of one's relationships

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.600
is vastly more important than
the number of relationships

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:24.880
that one has.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.030
And to really feel the
difference between quality

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.940
and quantity, I want to do
a tiny little visualization,

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.089
because I'm a coach, and
we do stuff like this.

00:11:34.089 --> 00:11:35.422
So close your eyes for a second.

00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.328
Imagine that you're eating
a piece of stale bread.

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:49.060
Now imagine that you're eating
the most delicious meal you've

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:49.750
ever eaten.

00:11:53.086 --> 00:11:54.210
Do you feel the difference?

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.360
OK, you can open your eyes.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.230
My point is that the difference
is not a functional difference.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:07.530
Both stale bread and a delicious
meal satisfy real hunger.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:08.992
The difference is qualitative.

00:12:08.992 --> 00:12:10.700
The differences in
the amount of pleasure

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.700
you derive from the experience.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.130
In my opinion,
when we're lonely,

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:17.280
we're not starving
for human interaction

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.230
and just ready to take
anything we can get.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:24.470
We're hungry for a certain
pleasurable experience.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.740
We're hungry for a
little bit of closeness.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:30.690
So let's talk about
closeness and how

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.262
to create it in your life.

00:12:33.262 --> 00:12:35.470
The word closeness has a
lot of different definitions

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.130
in the social sciences.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:41.100
But, in my world, it has a
very specific definition.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.690
It means the experience
of having direct access

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:48.270
to another person's inner
world, to her dreams, her fears,

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.930
her habits, her
preferences, et cetera.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:54.870
Once you have direct access to
another person's inner world,

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.000
you can sit next to her and
know what she's thinking.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.160
You can look into her eyes
and feel what she's feeling.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.400
And as I've said,
this is created

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.240
through knowing and caring.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.610
Knowing, as I define
it, means being

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:14.790
able to see someone's life
from their own perspective.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:17.060
And caring means expressing
interest and investment

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.380
in that person's well-being.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.970
So let's talk a
little about knowing.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.500
Knowing, in the
sense that I use it,

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.499
is actually pretty different
from how we usually

00:13:27.499 --> 00:13:29.480
know people.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.070
We tend to think we
know someone when

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.750
we've interacted with
them a lot and developed

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:36.550
a theory of how they are.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.390
My cousin Lisa is
a total pushover.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.400
My old boss had anger issues.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.730
My best friend is the most
dependable person in the world.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.630
While these things
may be true for me,

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.840
as you can probably
see, they are

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:54.660
evaluations that I have
made of this other person.

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.670
They're my perceptions.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:00.940
Take the last example
of my best friend.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.200
I may experience her
as being dependable.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.450
But from her
perspective, she may

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:09.270
experience her own
dependability as anxiety

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.010
about not wanting
to let anybody down.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.435
Until I understand
her experience

00:14:17.435 --> 00:14:20.397
of her own dependability
from her perspective,

00:14:20.397 --> 00:14:21.980
I don't really know
her and a way that

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.716
makes her feel close to me.

00:14:25.716 --> 00:14:27.590
In the same way, the
way that I define caring

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.170
is kind of different
than how we usually

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.211
try to care about people.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.470
In our culture, we
usually show caring

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.410
by either worrying about someone
or trying to give them advice.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.320
And, unfortunately, neither
one of these mechanics

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.020
work that well for
creating closeness.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:49.600
Giving advice, which is usually
really well-intentioned,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.320
doesn't work that well
because it actually places you

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.490
in a superior position,
as the one who

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:57.810
knows things or the
one who can fix things

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.220
for the other person,
which actually kind

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:03.410
of seeds resentment in them.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.310
Expressing concern
through worrying

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.930
doesn't really work
that well either

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.430
because it prompts
the other person

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:12.280
to try to prove that
everything is OK with them

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.930
to ease your discomfort.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:18.700
Instead, the kind of
caring that I talk about

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.510
is just the act of
simply expressing

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:25.660
interest and an investment in
the other person's well-being,

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.460
and it opens the door
for emotional connection.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.120
It says to the other
person, I'm here.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:33.640
I'm listening to you.

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.010
What would you like to say?

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.280
Together, knowing
and caring work well

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.810
because they are a
powerful combination.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.940
They communicate not
only do I really see you,

00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:50.070
I'm listening to you.

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.900
Not only do I understand
you, I also value you.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.320
So have you ever had
that experience where

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.020
you learn a new
word and then you

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.607
start hearing it everywhere?

00:16:01.607 --> 00:16:03.690
That's kind of what happened
to me after I came up

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.010
with this knowing plus caring
equals closeness thing.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.990
I started seeing it pop
up all over the place

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:12.120
in the unconscious phrasing
of some of the most

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.808
famous relationship experts.

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.150
Is anybody here familiar with
the "Five Love Languages?"

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.636
It's like the most famous
love book out there.

00:16:20.636 --> 00:16:25.640
In it, Gary Chapman says,
"with verbal encouragement,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.150
we are trying to
communicate 'I know.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.880
I care.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.020
How can I help?'"
Psychologist, researcher,

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.540
and bestselling
author John Gottman,

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.410
and he's also my personal crush,
ends in anecdote from his book

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.582
"What Makes Love
Last" by saying,

00:16:40.582 --> 00:16:44.040
"a husband I once helped came
to accept that he could not

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.710
control what his wife feels,
and that it's not his job to get

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.900
her to cheer up, calm down,
or develop a sense of humor.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.680
All she needs is for him
to know her and care."

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.520
The type of loneliness
that most of us

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.960
are experiencing these
days is fundamentally

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.320
an internal loneliness,
a loneliness

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.740
of the heart and mind.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:08.240
Knowing someone well and
caring about them deeply

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.650
creates a mental and emotional
closeness, or a closeness

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.920
of the heart and mind.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.650
And by eliminating
this internal distance,

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.329
closeness eliminates the sadness
that comes with it, also known

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.640
as loneliness.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.619
In this way, closeness
acts as the opposite

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:28.970
of loneliness and the
antidote to its effects.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:32.210
So to wrap things up, just one
more thing-- and this thing

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.410
is important;
closeness is something

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:37.070
that is within your
control to create

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.270
with anyone who also wants it.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:44.330
So it really is something
that you can start having now.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:48.850
So what could you do to start
feeling less lonely right now?

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:52.050
So I will save you any
icebreakers or friendship

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.089
pick-up lines, which
sometimes people ask me for,

00:17:55.089 --> 00:17:56.630
and instead just
talk about something

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.190
quickly from the book.

00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.200
It's an idea called "separate
the person from the problem."

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:06.360
And I didn't come up with it;
it's from business negotiation.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.820
The premise of separate
the person from the problem

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:10.950
is that to maintain
positive relationships

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.210
during hard times, one must
think of people and problems

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:18.127
as separate entities.

00:18:18.127 --> 00:18:19.710
In other words, it's
easier to come up

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:24.400
with a resolution with someone
when you don't view them

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.990
as the problem.

00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:28.490
Once you make this
distinction, you

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:30.440
can treat the person
with love and respect

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.070
and thoroughly
eliminate the problem.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.960
So one thing you
can do right now

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:40.210
to start feeling less lonely
is to start separating yourself

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.970
from the problem of loneliness.

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:46.900
You are really not to blame
if you're feeling lonely.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:49.870
You are a precious
person who is deserving

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.080
of love and closeness,
and loneliness

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.902
is a problem outside of you that
can be thoroughly eliminated.

00:18:56.902 --> 00:18:57.818
And that's all I have.

00:19:03.354 --> 00:19:05.770
DAVE MARKS: So those of you
who haven't read the book yet,

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.739
"Stop Being Lonely," it's great.

00:19:07.739 --> 00:19:09.530
Kira only talked about
just a small portion

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:10.843
of what she goes into n there.

00:19:10.843 --> 00:19:13.100
And I really like how, at
the end of each chapter,

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.849
you give really practical
tips that people

00:19:14.849 --> 00:19:17.662
can start employing
today, even how

00:19:17.662 --> 00:19:19.370
to break down it down
into littler steps,

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.330
because it's a
little overwhelming.

00:19:21.330 --> 00:19:22.413
KIRA ASATRYAN: It's a lot.

00:19:22.413 --> 00:19:23.852
I can be a lot, yeah.

00:19:23.852 --> 00:19:25.810
DAVE MARKS: So I guess
my first question to you

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.260
is the role technology plays.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.060
I think you emphasize
a lot in your book

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.842
that modern-day technology
and it's efficiencies

00:19:31.842 --> 00:19:33.550
gives us a little bit
of technology brain

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:36.220
and makes us all less
comfortable with like wasting

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.530
time or inefficient steps.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:39.870
I definitely feel that
in like new friendships

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.480
or potentially dating, that
unless I'm really into it,

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.480
or I think it has a great
chance of panning out,

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.470
I'm scared to use my limited
time and energy on that.

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:49.710
How do recommend people
with the technology brain

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:52.190
find the balance,
and you balance

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.960
between getting
out there and not

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.610
wasting our time and energy,
overcoming that fear?

00:19:57.610 --> 00:20:00.180
KIRA ASATRYAN: Yeah, so the
thing that you're referencing

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.240
is that I talk about how
the more that we interact

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.800
with our devices, that are
designed to be supremely

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.230
efficient, it's kind of
like the less patience

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.190
you have for real-life
interactions with real people.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:15.150
And I would say the
first step is just kind

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:16.950
of understanding that idea.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:20.290
So developing awareness
that like, OK,

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:23.210
I might be being a little
impatient right now,

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:27.150
or I am not getting the
results that I expected,

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.210
so I don't want to do it.

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:32.570
It's kind of a results-oriented
mentality that a lot of people

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:33.845
are developing.

00:20:33.845 --> 00:20:38.664
But human relationships
are just not that clean.

00:20:38.664 --> 00:20:40.330
Yeah, so that would
be the first thing--

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:41.630
develop awareness about it.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:47.330
And then kind of go with it?

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:52.030
Meaning, hold the
outcome more loosely.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.840
Because especially dating--
dating's a great example.

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.410
If you go into thinking I
understand who this person is

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.470
and this is what I
want out of this date,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.220
you are probably going
to be disappointed.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.970
DAVE MARKS: Right, so
be a little bit more

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.965
patient and less focused
on a specific outcome?

00:21:05.965 --> 00:21:06.840
KIRA ASATRYAN: Right.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.170
DAVE MARKS: Take it as
it comes-- I like that.

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.375
I'd like to [INAUDIBLE],
if anyone would like

00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:13.970
to pop up and ask a question?

00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:15.511
AUDIENCE: Just
wondering, how can you

00:21:15.511 --> 00:21:18.630
tell if someone is lonely,
if the facade of them

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:19.910
doesn't seems to be lonely?

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.410
KIRA ASATRYAN: How can you tell
that someone else is lonely?

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:24.010
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.260
KIRA ASATRYAN: Oh, I don't
know if thought about that.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:30.410
AUDIENCE: More specifically,
a 12-year-old, my daughter.

00:21:33.646 --> 00:21:36.020
KIRA ASATRYAN: So I was doing
another talk the other day,

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.010
and we were starting to
talk about teenagers.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.930
And they are lonely.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:47.130
One of the big spikes that we
see in sort of demographics

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.560
is 15 to 22.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.060
So she's a little
younger than that,

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:54.760
but they are having
issues with this.

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.220
I think that the-- this is
sort of just my speculation.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.860
But I think what's going
on with a lot of people

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:02.920
of that age is that
they've grown up

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.292
with this kind of public life.

00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:07.750
Like a lot of them have a public
persona that they develop,

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:11.690
which is really weird for a
young teenager to have that.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.420
And so they become
fiercely protective

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.070
of their private
lives, so much so,

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:18.710
that I think they
might be having

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:22.304
a little bit of a hard time
getting to know each other.

00:22:22.304 --> 00:22:24.220
Because the average
15-year-old or 12-year-old

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:27.980
is just very, very private.

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.290
So how can you tell
if they're lonely?

00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:34.580
I mean I would just trying
to be present with her.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.430
And if there are moments
when she starts to open up,

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:42.040
like be available for it.

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:45.285
But it's kind of a hard
situation in that age range.

00:22:45.285 --> 00:22:46.910
DAVE MARKS: Kira, in
reference to that,

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.743
I thought one of the
best parts of your book

00:22:48.743 --> 00:22:51.445
was about asking
open-ended questions.

00:22:51.445 --> 00:22:53.380
Could you maybe pitch
an open-ended question

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.417
you could ask to someone to
get to know them a little bit

00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:58.500
or maybe get them to open
up about their potential

00:22:58.500 --> 00:22:59.385
loneliness?

00:22:59.385 --> 00:23:00.260
KIRA ASATRYAN: Mm hm.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.551
Oh, yeah, there's lots of them.

00:23:01.551 --> 00:23:04.080
Well, my favorite one that
I talk about in the book,

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.620
because it's just my favorite,
is, what does that get you?

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:10.660
And you can ask it kind
of in any situation.

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.710
But what it's for
is like let's say

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:17.650
that somebody is thinking
of changing careers.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.107
What does that you?

00:23:19.107 --> 00:23:20.690
Or they're thinking
of buying a house.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.170
What does that get you?

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.250
And the purpose of the
open-ended question

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.480
is to go from this kind of
surface layer that a lot of us

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.620
talk on about like what we're
doing, what we're working on.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.546
What's going on and
go one layer deeper

00:23:37.546 --> 00:23:38.920
into what we're
hoping to achieve

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.610
or what's motivating
these decisions.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.460
Or just what are you
trying to get out

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.960
of what you're doing
with your life,

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.850
because that's really
who the person is.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:48.394
You know what I mean?

00:23:48.394 --> 00:23:49.810
AUDIENCE: There
was an interesting

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.830
you said sort of near the end.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.900
It was, if I captured
it right, closeness

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.570
is within your control to create
with anyone else who wants it,

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.310
and that part really struck me.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:03.740
So it's another question sort of
about how you read someone else

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:08.140
and get a sense of who people,
who are ready and actually

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:11.690
interested in real
closeness and those

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.305
who may not be ready for it?

00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:14.930
KIRA ASATRYAN: That's
a great question.

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:18.220
That's an excellent question.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.480
My first thing I would say is
you're going to know instantly.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.240
But you can know within, I would
say, one or two interaction

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.770
with them, like
real interactions,

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:30.777
like a one-on-one coffee
date or something.

00:24:30.777 --> 00:24:32.860
You could tell if somebody
is a good, what I call,

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:34.830
"closeness partner."

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.570
And the way that
you vet that out

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:40.185
is, do they have the
basic skills to do

00:24:40.185 --> 00:24:40.976
knowing and caring?

00:24:40.976 --> 00:24:43.910
And so on the knowing
side it would be,

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.910
are they willing to reveal
anything about themselves?

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.650
And are they
interested in getting

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:50.720
to know anything about you?

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:55.520
So if somebody is
feeling very-- people who

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.165
feel very vulnerable
in situations

00:24:57.165 --> 00:25:00.650
tend to keep everything
to themselves.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.880
That person might not be
great at this type of stuff.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.730
And then on the caring side,
it's about emotional capacity.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:12.990
So does it seem like they
can empathize with you?

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:15.860
Do they use a feeling
language for anything?

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.150
Like, I love my job.

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.950
I can't wait to see my mom.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.980
I like her so much-- whatever.

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:24.290
Like do they show emotional
capacity in any way?

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:25.847
Those would be the two things.

00:25:25.847 --> 00:25:26.555
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:25:26.555 --> 00:25:27.040
KIRA ASATRYAN: Sure.

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.471
DAVE MARKS: In
your book you say,

00:25:28.471 --> 00:25:30.220
"my favorite social
experiment in learning

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:32.600
to pick partners can be found
on your TV Monday night's

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.860
at 8:00 PM.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.342
It's called "The Bachelor."

00:25:35.342 --> 00:25:37.300
And you go on to say
like, "The Bachelor" isn't

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.800
the best at making
marriages; but it

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.430
is really good at this one
thing of making people feel

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.667
like they're falling in love.

00:25:42.667 --> 00:25:44.750
KIRA ASATRYAN: Yeah, it's
fascinating stuff to me.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:46.350
I also talk about
Kim Kardashian.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.940
There's some stuff
in there like that.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.650
DAVE MARKS: And so
what are the, other

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.936
than like awesome
free dates, what

00:25:52.936 --> 00:25:56.480
are the environments that create
the feeling of falling in love?

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:58.080
And is there
anything we can take

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.885
that to apply to
our personal lives

00:25:59.885 --> 00:26:02.804
to perhaps really use
those to fall in love?

00:26:02.804 --> 00:26:04.220
KIRA ASATRYAN:
Well, the big thing

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.720
that I think "The Bachelor"
gets right is that people

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.150
are going there with
the intention to get

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:15.060
to know the people there.

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:17.160
It's a fascinating
experiment for me,

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.772
because they're encouraged
to get to know each other

00:26:21.772 --> 00:26:23.230
and develop caring
for one another,

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:25.090
but they can't go
straight to the end.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:28.440
Like they can't get
married on the first show;

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.180
they're actually not
allowed to do that.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.820
So it's this kind
of like paced thing

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.000
that actually works pretty well.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.595
Like most of them develop a lot
of closeness with each other,

00:26:38.595 --> 00:26:40.936
and least the last couple
contestants at the end

00:26:40.936 --> 00:26:43.664
feel very, very close to the
bachelor and the bachelorette.

00:26:43.664 --> 00:26:45.830
DAVE MARKS: And so you say
the number one thing that

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:47.038
causes that is the intention.

00:26:47.038 --> 00:26:50.070
They come in with the
intention of getting close.

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:52.656
So we need to find people
that want to get close to us,

00:26:52.656 --> 00:26:53.280
I guess, right?

00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:55.865
What are some signs you might
be able to look for, I guess?

00:26:55.865 --> 00:26:57.560
KIRA ASATRYAN: Of somebody
who wants to get close to you?

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.440
DAVE MARKS: Yeah.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:03.240
KIRA ASATRYAN: Well, if you're
in certain environments,

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.270
opportunities will kind
of present themselves.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:07.260
Like I think Google is
actually a good example.

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.884
If you work at Google,
there's probably

00:27:08.884 --> 00:27:12.380
people around you who would
be interested in being

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.050
closer to you.

00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:19.324
If you're very, very isolated,
that's more difficult.

00:27:19.324 --> 00:27:21.337
But I would say
anybody who approaches

00:27:21.337 --> 00:27:25.436
you to talk about
anything outside of work

00:27:25.436 --> 00:27:26.810
is probably
interested in getting

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.200
to know you as a person.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.249
AUDIENCE: I have one, actually.

00:27:33.249 --> 00:27:35.040
I don't know if I can
articulate very well,

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:37.912
so you'll have to bear with me.

00:27:37.912 --> 00:27:40.370
The gentleman who asked about
his daughter actually kind of

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.720
gave me a vehicle to
ask this question.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:46.504
So you mentioned quality
over quantity, right?

00:27:46.504 --> 00:27:49.280
So let's extrapolate
that for a moment.

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:51.750
So we have 1,000
Facebook friends.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.610
That's quantity.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:55.380
But if we can five or
10 friends with whom

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.230
we have that intimacy,
that caring you describe,

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.740
we're probably doing better.

00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.200
If we take that further
though, because I

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.450
will attest to that
maybe on a Friday,

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.730
going out with a
very good friend

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.880
and having like a nice
conversation with them

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.150
and feeling cared for,
but still [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:14.900
go home and still a little empty
even after that interaction.

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:19.459
If you can have even one friend
who really kind of gets you,

00:28:19.459 --> 00:28:20.500
that can be kind of cool.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.780
So where I'm going with
this is that friend

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.820
might be you perhaps.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:30.230
And the reason is, you mentioned
the public persona, right?

00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:32.255
12- to 22-year-olds,
probably more so

00:28:32.255 --> 00:28:34.490
than any other
demographic, probably

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:38.070
know themselves the least
and are figuring it out.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:41.180
So is some of it maybe
not on us, in a way,

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.504
to really accept who we are, and
have intimacy with ourselves?

00:28:45.504 --> 00:28:48.170
KIRA ASATRYAN: Totally, that's a
really good question, because I

00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:50.756
actually, in the first
draft of this book,

00:28:50.756 --> 00:28:53.870
I didn't have
anything about that,

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.812
about getting
closer to yourself.

00:28:55.812 --> 00:28:57.270
And my editor was
like, you're kind

00:28:57.270 --> 00:29:00.350
of expecting that people
have done a lot of self-work

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:02.970
already, and she was right.

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:05.240
I was kind of assuming that.

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:06.790
So there is a
chapter in there now

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:09.840
about having do knowing
and caring with yourself.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.410
Self-care is actually
a big thing right now.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.420
Like if you're in
the self-help world,

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.060
self-care is like a very
trendy thing right now.

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.050
But it's real.

00:29:19.050 --> 00:29:20.200
It works.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.057
Making time for
yourself and doing

00:29:22.057 --> 00:29:25.220
the things that
kind of replenish

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.723
you are pretty important,
and getting to know yourself,

00:29:28.723 --> 00:29:32.327
of course-- you're own needs
and values and motivation.

00:29:32.327 --> 00:29:33.160
AUDIENCE: Very cool.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.201
Thank you for that, yeah.

00:29:37.612 --> 00:29:40.070
DAVE MARKS: I was going to say,
I identify as an introvert,

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.570
right?

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:44.110
And I very much so
like enjoy getting

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.540
to know myself and like
thinking through my emotions

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.320
and feelings.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.210
And sometimes it's
super energizing.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:50.960
But I notice that it
hits this point where

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.211
it becomes pretty isolating.

00:29:53.211 --> 00:29:55.835
Do you have any vision on how we
can balance it better or flags

00:29:55.835 --> 00:29:59.060
we can look for in ourselves
to know when we are recharging

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.546
versus going into a lonely hole?

00:30:01.546 --> 00:30:03.170
KIRA ASATRYAN: Yeah,
there is a version

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:08.910
of isolating yourself or being
alone that's really positive.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:10.640
It's like solitude.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.360
And I'm totally
an introvert too.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.297
And I think that my
introvertedness seeps through

00:30:16.297 --> 00:30:16.880
into the book.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.080
It kind of has that
perspective that

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.310
assumes that sometimes
people like to be alone.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.200
But, like I said, the
loneliness-versus-closeness

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.370
thing is really,
really subjective.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.845
So if you kind of
are keeping tabs

00:30:30.845 --> 00:30:32.934
on how your aloneness
is making you feel,

00:30:32.934 --> 00:30:37.610
you can probably identify when
that switch starts to happen.

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:42.945
The thing about loneliness
is that it's really bad

00:30:42.945 --> 00:30:45.410
when you feel like
you can't stop it,

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.150
like when you feel
like, OK, I am

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:51.284
aware that it's switched over
into this feeling bad thing.

00:30:51.284 --> 00:30:54.370
But I don't know what to do.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.055
So that was the issue that
I was trying to speak to.

00:30:57.055 --> 00:30:59.180
DAVE MARKS: So it's all
new tools to get out of it.

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:00.902
Once you notice it,
you'll be all right.

00:31:00.902 --> 00:31:03.360
A lot of times people ask me
like, are you a people person?

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:07.250
And my response is, I like
to be alone until I'm lonely.

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:09.580
KIRA ASATRYAN: Right, exactly.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.300
DAVE MARKS: That's how its.

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.130
AUDIENCE: So,
multi-part question,

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.760
all related to my
12-year-old daughter.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.370
I could probably ask you
a lot more afterwards.

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:24.230
But you mentioned that you felt
lonely when you were 13, right?

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:28.420
Is there a section in your book
which talks a little bit more

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.420
about your background
at 13 years old

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.410
and your state of mind?

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:32.690
And so that's one part.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:37.700
The other part is, is this book
suitable for a 12-year-old?

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:40.317
Like if give this to my daughter
to read, is it suitable?

00:31:40.317 --> 00:31:41.900
And the last part
associated with that

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.460
is, what do I say if I
give her this book to read?

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.200
You know, I attended
this talk at Google.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.790
I thought it was fascinating.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:49.920
Here's a great book.

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.130
I'm almost saying, I
think you're lonely.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:54.290
But she might not feel lonely.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.120
Sorry.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.120
DAVE MARKS: So I'm not
sure that one got caught,

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.036
but just to reiterate.

00:31:59.036 --> 00:32:00.685
So as for your teenage
daughter, right,

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:02.310
would this book be
appropriate for her?

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:04.886
And if you were to get it for
her, what would be a good way

00:32:04.886 --> 00:32:06.760
to present it to her,
rather than being like,

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.010
I think you'd like this?

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.237
KIRA ASATRYAN: I know,
it's an aggressive title.

00:32:12.237 --> 00:32:13.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah, very aggressive.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:13.740
KIRA ASATRYAN: It is.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.522
I fought for it.

00:32:14.522 --> 00:32:15.230
I like the title.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:16.510
But, yeah, it is.

00:32:19.449 --> 00:32:21.240
I'm going to do your
second question first.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.650
Yes, I think it would
be appropriate for her.

00:32:23.650 --> 00:32:27.570
It's about all relationships
not romantic or dating.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.240
It applies to family
relationships and friends.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.110
So, yeah, I think
it's appropriate.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.260
I would probably present
it as like this is just

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:42.160
a look about relationships or
how to-- I haven't interacted

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.732
with a lot of 12-year-olds.

00:32:43.732 --> 00:32:47.426
But try to make it more
about just like here's

00:32:47.426 --> 00:32:49.920
a book about like social
skills or something,

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:52.650
than about loneliness,
because that

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.952
might be insulting eventually.

00:32:54.952 --> 00:32:56.410
AUDIENCE: Exactly,
yeah, insulting.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.670
KIRA ASATRYAN: Yeah, it can be.

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.047
And I forgot your
first question.

00:33:00.047 --> 00:33:01.005
What was the first one?

00:33:01.005 --> 00:33:04.920
AUDIENCE: Oh, because you
wrote the book about yourself,

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:07.760
do you cover how your state
of mind was at 13-years-old?

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:09.340
KIRA ASATRYAN: I didn't.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.230
I only actually talk
about my own story

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:14.750
at the very, very end, and
it's about being as an adult.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.110
But I can talk about it now.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.450
I thought I was depressed
because lonely wasn't really

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.860
a thing in my mind.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.342
And I kind of think that there
is quite a number of people

00:33:25.342 --> 00:33:28.468
who think they're
depressed, when really it's

00:33:28.468 --> 00:33:33.214
about this issue more
than anything else.

00:33:33.214 --> 00:33:35.752
But I don't know;
I was a good kid,

00:33:35.752 --> 00:33:36.960
so I just kept going with it.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.460
And then eventually
I was old enough

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.690
to know that it probably
wasn't really my fault. Like,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:44.722
I was being nice to people.

00:33:46.812 --> 00:33:48.770
DAVE MARKS: I'll come at
it, if you don't mind,

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.720
because I was a
super angsty teen.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:54.090
And the number one thing I
felt was misunderstood, right?

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:56.341
And I think it was very much
so because I was changing

00:33:56.341 --> 00:33:57.965
every day, and I had
a really hard time

00:33:57.965 --> 00:33:58.950
getting to know myself.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:01.500
And so I constantly
felt misunderstood

00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.670
by everyone around me.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:04.340
Because even they understood
who I was yesterday,

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.756
that's who I am today anymore,
because I'm changing a lot.

00:34:06.756 --> 00:34:10.092
And I'm becoming a
grown man and all this.

00:34:10.092 --> 00:34:11.050
And that's what it was.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.582
And then when I finally
got to a more state

00:34:13.582 --> 00:34:15.290
where I'm like, oh,
OK, this is who I am,

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.456
I started being able to
share that with people more.

00:34:17.456 --> 00:34:19.320
Then they could
actually understand me.

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:21.111
I would say that's the
number one adjective

00:34:21.111 --> 00:34:22.360
I felt in my teenage years.

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.859
AUDIENCE: I loved
how you called out

00:34:23.859 --> 00:34:27.179
that focusing on the number
of friends or social media

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:30.582
contacts doesn't necessarily
get you where you want it,

00:34:30.582 --> 00:34:33.060
that it's almost a fallacy
to look for closeness just

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.340
by quantity.

00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:37.889
Another thought that I had
was, you mentioned, Dave,

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:40.126
just now being misunderstood.

00:34:40.126 --> 00:34:42.500
I feel like part of the problem
sometimes with loneliness

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:44.416
is you just don't feel
like there's people who

00:34:44.416 --> 00:34:47.310
get you or can relate to you.

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:49.420
Everybody has their
own flavor of that.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:53.969
From me, I went to a very
broadly Caucasian Catholic high

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:55.330
school.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.830
And I come from this Buddhist
family that's vegetarian

00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:59.320
and doesn't drink.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:01.284
And so throughout
college, especially,

00:35:01.284 --> 00:35:02.950
you mentioned feeling
lonely in college,

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.390
everybody's a at the frat
house, and I'm the only one,

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:07.100
and nobody really gets me.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.220
Now, I thought
it, and I might be

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:12.690
wrong in this, is that if
I just find people like me,

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.370
that intimacy will be there.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.357
But I look around today at my
closest friends, the ones who

00:35:17.357 --> 00:35:19.440
we totally get each other;
they're not necessarily

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:22.850
of the same background as me,
but we have that closeness.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:26.490
So do you have to find people
who are really just like you?

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.490
KIRA ASATRYAN: No, you do not.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.624
In the studies that have been
done, like official research

00:35:32.624 --> 00:35:36.354
social science studies,
it tends to pan out

00:35:36.354 --> 00:35:38.020
that people who are
more like each other

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:40.460
do like each other more.

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:45.340
But also, it's a
self-reported thing.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.220
So they may sort of
be-- the way that it

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.110
being like each other
helps is that you

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.860
don't have to do quite as much
work in the knowing department.

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.850
Like you can just say, I'm
Buddhist, and I'm vegetarian.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:35:58.690
And somebody who
else is like that

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:00.970
will make that
connection instantly.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:03.450
So there's a little
less heavy lifting.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:07.970
But it can be done with anybody
who's willing to open up.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:10.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.934
DAVE MARKS: I'd like to stay
on friendship for a little bit.

00:36:12.934 --> 00:36:14.850
You just mentioned offhand
that people ask you

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.846
for friendship pick-up lines.

00:36:17.846 --> 00:36:19.720
Do you have one you're
like willing to share?

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:22.210
And, B, I feel
like I moved here,

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:23.509
that I didn't know anyone.

00:36:23.509 --> 00:36:25.092
And I went through
this period where I

00:36:25.092 --> 00:36:26.940
felt like I was dating friends.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:27.940
Do you know what I mean?

00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:28.380
KIRA ASATRYAN: Totally.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.505
DAVE MARKS: I'd like you
talk about that experience

00:36:30.505 --> 00:36:32.180
and your thoughts on that.

00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:35.496
KIRA ASATRYAN: I think San
Francisco is like a hub of that

00:36:35.496 --> 00:36:37.120
because so many people
are transplants.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:40.320
I actually grew up
here, so I did not

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.430
have that exact experience.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.790
But, yeah, my advice
on that kind of thing

00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:50.320
is if you can tolerate
it, start out in groups.

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.430
Meaning like go to
something that's

00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:55.660
like an interest-based group
or something like that.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.730
But go there seeking somebody
who you would want to hang out

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.970
with outside of the interest.

00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:06.180
So meaning like, let's say
you like rock climbing.

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.150
A way to meet people is
to go to a rock climbing

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:10.510
club or something.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:12.200
But then try to
identify somebody

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.480
who you want to hang out
with not rock climbing.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.820
And then those will end
up being your people.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:20.460
DAVE MARKS: That's really
good, tangible advice.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.180
I think the book is full
of good, tangible things

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.267
like that.

00:37:24.267 --> 00:37:25.350
KIRA ASATRYAN: I'm trying.

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:26.710
DAVE MARKS: Yeah.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:27.460
It's hard today.

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.418
How do I make a friend?

00:37:30.082 --> 00:37:32.540
KIRA ASATRYAN: The hardest ones
are the love ones, the love

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.378
question, because who knows?

00:37:35.378 --> 00:37:36.503
How do people fall in love?

00:37:36.503 --> 00:37:37.290
I don't know.

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:40.060
DAVE MARKS: Been working on it.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.020
So I guess back to
love relationships,

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:43.900
you wrote an article
online last week

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:49.220
that said that single men are
way lonelier than single women,

00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:49.820
which I agree.

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:54.410
But it's just that single
women are like a little more

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:55.337
ready to admit it.

00:37:55.337 --> 00:37:56.920
So I feel like a lot
of men-- and I've

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.070
seen this with most my
friends and peers-- feel

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:02.129
they need to take on like the
lone-wolf mentality, like I

00:38:02.129 --> 00:38:04.170
like being alone, even
though they don't like it.

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:04.730
I don't want to do it.

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.670
Why do you think men
feel the need to do that?

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.670
And how can I, as like
a somewhat emotionally

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.310
available man,
help my friend feel

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.800
like it's OK to be lonely then?

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.190
KIRA ASATRYAN: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:17.314
I think a lot of
it is conditioning.

00:38:17.314 --> 00:38:19.480
I think that some of it is
the way that were raised.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:22.480
But this is a fascinating
question for me

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:25.666
because I thought that the
whole knowing plus caring

00:38:25.666 --> 00:38:29.200
equal closeness thing I thought
it was very gender-neutral.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.910
But the more I talked to
men, they've been like,

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.610
this isn't really like how
men get close to people,

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.680
or it's not really
realistic or something.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.060
And I didn't get it.

00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:42.210
But I've been
starting to get it.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.600
And I think that
this not wanting

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:48.700
to show any problems
in your social life

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.390
is a big, big part of
it and just the way

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.847
that men are taught to be.

00:38:53.847 --> 00:38:55.930
DAVE MARKS: Do you think
it's legitimate that they

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.096
say this won't work for men?

00:38:57.096 --> 00:39:03.470
Or men have been conditioned
to make it not work for them?

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.117
For me, I related
to it very much.

00:39:05.117 --> 00:39:06.450
I thought it was a good formula.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:07.430
Like you know someone.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:08.290
You care about them.

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:09.360
You'll become close to them.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.840
I thought it made
perfect sense and aligned

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.006
with a lot of experiences
I've seen in my real life.

00:39:13.006 --> 00:39:15.250
KIRA ASATRYAN: I
think that for guys--

00:39:15.250 --> 00:39:18.200
so the book basically takes
the romantic component out

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.970
of it, because then it was
going to be about intimacy,

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:23.557
and then it couldn't
apply really

00:39:23.557 --> 00:39:25.640
to friendships and family
in the same kind of way.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.120
And I don't want to go there.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:29.220
But I think that the
intimacy, meaning

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.590
like romantic types
of relationships,

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:36.340
I think that men are more--
they need that a little bit more

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:37.540
than women do.

00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:42.020
Like totally not romantic female
friendships are very common,

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:46.330
and they're quite a bit more
easy for women to develop.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.980
And I think it's how we're
socialized, personally.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:53.310
Eons of women have been
sitting around weaving,

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:55.920
talking to each other
and becoming friends.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.076
But for men, it's been
a little bit different.

00:39:58.076 --> 00:39:59.200
And our brains are ancient.

00:40:01.614 --> 00:40:03.530
DAVE MARKS: There's a
lot of studies out there

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:05.980
that say a majority of men lose
a lot of their close friends

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.980
in their 20s because they
don't know how to keep them.

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.438
KIRA ASATRYAN: They
do, and there's

00:40:09.438 --> 00:40:11.290
this idea of
closeness in the doing

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:14.544
is what it's called in the
social sciences, where men

00:40:14.544 --> 00:40:16.210
think that they stay
close to each other

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.240
by doing things together.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.881
And they kind of don't.

00:40:19.881 --> 00:40:21.380
Like they think
if they go golfing

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.180
with their friend for
20 years that they know

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.470
stuff about them.

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:27.710
And then at the end of those
20 years, they're like,

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:29.400
I don't really know
that guy at all.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:30.191
We're just friends.

00:40:33.729 --> 00:40:36.020
DAVE MARKS: So I think we
have time for about one more.

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.269
I'd like to offer it to
someone in the audience, who'd

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:40.360
like to finish those off.

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:43.380
But if not, I have one
we can close out on.

00:40:43.380 --> 00:40:46.140
All right, so it's Friday.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.807
It's national Unplugging Day.

00:40:47.807 --> 00:40:49.390
KIRA ASATRYAN: Oh,
yeah, that's right.

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:50.740
DAVE MARKS: And so I
assume a lot of people

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.170
will be going out and doing
social things tonight.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.753
You said something in the book
that I identify with very much.

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:58.830
You say, "I found mediocre
social interactions only made

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:00.000
me more lonely," right?

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.450
And I agree with that very much.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:03.220
You think like going out
and being with friends will

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.011
make you feel good.

00:41:04.011 --> 00:41:06.240
And then you go home, and
you just feel more alone

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.030
than before it started.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.720
Do you have any
recommendations of how

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.720
we can take mediocre
social interactions

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.704
to closer social interactions?

00:41:15.704 --> 00:41:17.120
You know, if you're
at this party,

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.580
maybe there's
nonsense small talk,

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.996
or you feel like you don't
connect with any of the people,

00:41:20.996 --> 00:41:24.160
how can we change that?

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:27.690
KIRA ASATRYAN: I'm going to
say something a little fruity

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:29.146
because I feel like it.

00:41:29.146 --> 00:41:30.770
I think the one thing
you can really do

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:34.490
is be a little braver,
be a little bit bolder.

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:35.900
Because the people
that tend to--

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.230
and this is a generalization.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:39.790
But the people that
tend to feel that way,

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.990
are the more timid people in
social interactions, especially

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:45.120
groups.

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.620
So ask a question that you
think might be a little too

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:52.500
personal, because
probably they won't mind.

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.000
It's much more likely that they
won't mind than that they'll

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.740
be offended or something.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.560
That's my advice.

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.595
DAVE MARKS: I like it a lot.

00:42:00.595 --> 00:42:03.280
So the book's "Stop Being
Lonely," Kira Asatryan,

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.540
available at the back for $10.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.998
Kira, thank you so
much for coming.

00:42:05.998 --> 00:42:07.300
We really appreciate it.
