Hi.

00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.280
My name's Matt Kaufman and I'm
the Head of Operations at CrunchBase.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.100
CrunchBase collects information about
startups, private companies, and

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.070
investors, and puts it all together
on the web for anybody to come and

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.630
see and anybody to research to
discover more about companies.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.700
About three years ago, AOL,
which owned CrunchBase at the time,

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.670
hired me to figure out
what is CrunchBase?

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.920
Is there a business of CrunchBase,
is there something there?

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.130
That was three years ago, and

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.440
that led to AOL spinning CrunchBase
out into a private business and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.280
us actually raising a Series A in
September of last year.
