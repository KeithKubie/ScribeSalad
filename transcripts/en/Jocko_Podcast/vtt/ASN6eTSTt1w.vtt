Hey Jocko,

2
00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.660
I'm a business owner in the beginning stages of merging with another company.

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.760
The other company doesn't know much about what we do,

4
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.890
but has the sales and marketing,

5
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.480
marketing we need just at a conference with just at a conference call with them

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.800
and it didn't go well.

7
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.840
They're wanting to change the pay structure for contractors as well as change

8
00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:27.700
how we build our customers. All the offer, the benefit of money to Ching,

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.590
let's save some money on that one. Isn't it not a good idea to have,

10
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.330
have the primary mission be about money in more so on the success of the

11
00:00:37.331 --> 00:00:40.870
customer or is it good to be money motivated? I,

12
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.920
I have and enjoy all your books. Oh yeah, that's cool. Advice

13
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.881
<v 1>could be helpful.</v>

14
00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:50.740
So that means you read the dichotomy of leadership hope because this is the

15
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.720
answer of the day. Need to be more balanced. Okay, so if you're money hungry,

16
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.500
right? Which is what this is sounding like. If you're money hungry, correct.

17
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.200
If you're money hungry, you're going to cut corners on product.

18
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.030
The product is going to be weak or, or low quality.

19
00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.360
You're going to do wrong by the customer, right? Cause when you,

20
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.870
when you get a chance to, you know, the customer, the customer placed an order,

21
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:18.290
a double order by accident, they click the click thing twice and it will,

22
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.100
they just gonna have to pay that restocking fee, you know, whatever.

23
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:22.660
Like whatever the thing is, right?

24
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.640
You treat customers like that and they're gonna go, okay,

25
00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:27.580
well we don't really want to shop with you anymore and you end up with a bad

26
00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:31.840
reputation and the quality is low and no, eventually you have no more business.

27
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.700
That's what's gonna happen. So, so no,

28
00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:38.701
we can't go hardcore money grubbing just that's our,

29
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.240
that's our focus. Other end of the spectrum

30
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.250
<v 0>is</v>

31
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.090
<v 1>hey, we're paying our contractors too much. Ken, is that possible? Yes,</v>

32
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:51.620
it's possible. You're giving your customers too much,

33
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.290
you're giving them too good of a price point and guess it was now going to

34
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:58.990
happen. Same thing. You're going to not have a business anymore. So one,

35
00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:01.240
you have a, you, your business goes out of business because your,

36
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.060
because you don't have any business anymore cause you've treated your customers

37
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:06.490
bad. And the contractors don't want to work with you so you have,

38
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.390
you end up shutting down. This one's opposite your, everyone loves you,

39
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.390
you just don't have any money so you're going out of business even at all.

40
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.190
So there has to be some balance. You have to find the right balance.

41
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:19.990
That's what every company is trying to do.

42
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.380
Now I would say that you would,

43
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.920
where you want to lean, and this is probably what you're thinking.

44
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.060
You want to lean toward taking care of the customer.

45
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.770
You want to lean toward giving the contractors good value for their work.

46
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.010
You want to lean toward high quality.

47
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.450
The reason you want to lean towards those things as those were all long term

48
00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:48.290
strategic pay offs, right? What's the short term?

49
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.390
The short term is take advantage of the customers.

50
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.970
The short term is screw over the contractors.

51
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.330
The short term is put out low quality stuff. We make good profit this quarter,

52
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.780
but it's a short, it's a term when it's a long time, long term loss,

53
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.050
so that's why I would say lean, don't go out of control.

54
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.030
You can't go out of control in that direction,

55
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.320
but you can lean towards that direction. Now as far as the new company,

56
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:16.300
the merger and all this stuff, get it. I get it. Here's what's going to happen.

57
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.880
What you need to go and build good relationships with those people.

58
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.781
The new company,

59
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:24.280
they need to be your best friends because if you build relationships with them,

60
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.800
then you can have influence over these points.

61
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.270
If you have an antagonistic relationship and you're the new guy or whatever,

62
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.850
like, Oh yeah, the new company, you think they don't.

63
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.810
You're saying that they would, as you say, they don't know what we do. Right.

64
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.870
What do you think they think? They think you don't know what they do.

65
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.150
They're thinking, you know what? You don't even, hey you guys make good money.

66
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.200
Might make good product but you can't sell anything.

67
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.620
And we got sales and we got marketing. We could sell anything.

68
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.110
We don't care what it looks like. We don't care what the quality is.

69
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:51.060
That's what they're thinking. Yeah.

70
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.470
So you need to form a relationship with them because I will tell you with their

71
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:58.750
sales and marketing, if you're making a good product,

72
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.570
that's how we get the big time win.

73
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.530
But if you have an antagonistic relationship with them, uh,

74
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.290
it'll all fall apart and you won't have any influence at all.

75
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.180
And they'll be like, you don't even know what you're talking about, dude.

76
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.940
We're just going to jack the price even more and we're going to undercut our pro

77
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.040
contractors. We're gonna get contractors competing with each other.

78
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:16.330
They're going to hate each other. They're going to hate us,

79
00:04:16.331 --> 00:04:17.980
but it doesn't matter. Looking at our bottom line.

80
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.280
So build some relationships there.
