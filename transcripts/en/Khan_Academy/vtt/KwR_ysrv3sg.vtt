00:00:00.903 --> 00:00:02.774
- [Voiceover] We have
two polar graphs here,

00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:05.308
r is equal to 3 sine
theta and r is equal to

00:00:05.308 --> 00:00:08.083
3 cosine theta and what we want to do

00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:10.435
is find this area shaded in blue.

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:15.118
That's kind of the overlap
of these two circles.

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:16.548
So I encourage you to pause

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:17.922
the video and give it a go.

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:21.927
All right so I assume
you've tried and what's

00:00:21.927 --> 00:00:24.805
interesting here is we're clearly bounded

00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:26.507
by two different polar graphs.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.373
And it looks like they
intersect right over here.

00:00:30.744 --> 00:00:32.818
If we eyeball it, it looks
like they're intersecting

00:00:32.818 --> 00:00:35.396
at when theta is equal to pi

00:00:35.396 --> 00:00:37.966
over four, and we can verify that.

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:41.775
Cosine of pi over four
is the same thing as sine

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:46.396
of pi over four so it is
indeed the case that these two

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:48.379
things are going to be
equal to each other.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.375
Their point of intersection happens at

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.827
theta is equal to pi over four.

00:00:55.568 --> 00:00:58.217
And if that wasn't as
obvious, you'd set these

00:00:58.217 --> 00:01:00.290
two equal to each other
and figure out the thetas

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.941
where this actually happened, but here it

00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:03.519
jumps out at you a little more.

00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:05.881
So this is theta is equal to pi over four.

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:11.337
And so the key is to
realize is that for theta

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:16.337
being between zero and pi
over four we're bounded

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:20.914
by the red circle, we're
bounded by r is equal

00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.246
to 3 sine theta and then
as we go from pi over four

00:01:24.246 --> 00:01:27.679
to pi over two we're
bounded by the black circle,

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.309
we're bounded by r is
equal to 3 cosine theta.

00:01:31.797 --> 00:01:35.138
So we can just break up our
area into those two regions.

00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:38.276
So this first area right
over here we already know

00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:41.778
is going to be one half
times the definite integral

00:01:41.778 --> 00:01:46.778
from zero to pi over four
of, what are we bounded by,

00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:53.484
3 sine of theta and we're gonna
square that thing d theta.

00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:58.875
That's the orange region
and then this, I guess you

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:01.781
could say this blue
region right over here is

00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:05.100
going to be one half times
the definite integral

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.796
and now we're going to go from
pi over four to pi over two

00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:16.595
of 3 cosine theta squared d theta.

00:02:18.345 --> 00:02:20.003
That's this region right over here.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.218
Now one thing that might jump out to you

00:02:22.218 --> 00:02:23.686
is that they're going to be the same area.

00:02:23.686 --> 00:02:28.686
These two circles they are
symmetric around this line.

00:02:29.237 --> 00:02:31.785
Theta is equal to pi over four.

00:02:31.993 --> 00:02:33.837
So these are going to be the same area.

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:35.773
So one thing that we
could do is just solve for

00:02:35.773 --> 00:02:38.653
one of these and then
double it and we will get

00:02:38.653 --> 00:02:40.987
the total region that we care about.

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:43.429
So the total area, and you can

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.421
verify that for yourself if you like,

00:02:45.421 --> 00:02:47.170
but I'm just going to say
the total area, I'm just

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.808
going to double this right over here.

00:02:48.813 --> 00:02:50.404
So the total area if I just double this,

00:02:50.404 --> 00:02:53.174
just the orange expression,
I'm going to get the

00:02:53.174 --> 00:02:58.143
definite integral from
zero to pi over four of...

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.050
nine, three squared is nine
sine squared theta d theta.

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.296
And you could evaluate this by hand,

00:03:09.296 --> 00:03:10.520
you could evaluate this by calculator,

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.309
let's evaluate this analytically.

00:03:12.721 --> 00:03:16.340
So sine square theta is
the same thing as one half

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.340
times one minus cosine of two theta.

00:03:24.692 --> 00:03:26.968
That's a trigonometric
identity that we've seen

00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:29.283
a lot in trigonometry class,

00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:30.747
actually let me just write it up here.

00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:35.048
So sine square theta is
equal to one half times

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:38.381
one minus cosine of two theta.

00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:42.584
So if we replace this
with this it's going to be

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:46.072
equal to, let's take the one half out,

00:03:46.072 --> 00:03:48.581
so we're going to get
nine halves times the

00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:53.240
definite integral from
zero to pi over four of

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.284
one minus cosine two theta d theta.

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:01.190
And so this is going to
be equal to nine halves

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:06.657
antiderivative of one
is theta and let's see

00:04:06.657 --> 00:04:11.657
cosine two theta, it's
going to be negative sine

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:17.136
of two theta, negative
sine of two theta over two.

00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:25.776
Actually let me just, negative

00:04:26.606 --> 00:04:30.368
one half sine of two theta.

00:04:30.368 --> 00:04:32.297
And you could do u substitution
and do it like this,

00:04:32.297 --> 00:04:34.197
but this you might be
able to do in your head.

00:04:34.197 --> 00:04:36.944
And you can verify the
derivative of sine two theta

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:41.018
is going to be two cosine
of two theta and then

00:04:41.018 --> 00:04:45.110
you multiply it times
the negative one half,

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.240
you just get a negative
one right over there.

00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:52.384
And so then we are going to evaluate

00:04:53.237 --> 00:04:57.856
this at pi over four and at zero.

00:04:58.351 --> 00:05:00.937
So if you evaluate it
at, well luckily if you

00:05:00.937 --> 00:05:02.803
evaluate this thing at
zero this whole thing

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:04.014
is going to be zero so we really just

00:05:04.014 --> 00:05:05.850
have to evaluate it at pi over four.

00:05:05.965 --> 00:05:09.949
So this is going to be
equal to nine halves times

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.949
pi over four minus one
half sine of two times

00:05:19.813 --> 00:05:24.618
pi over four is pi over
two, sine of pi over two.

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:28.220
Sine of pi over two we
already know is one,

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.873
so it is really pi over
four, so this right over

00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:32.457
here is just going to be equal to one.

00:05:33.114 --> 00:05:38.114
So this is going to be nine halves times,

00:05:38.486 --> 00:05:40.237
we could say pi over
four minus one half or

00:05:40.237 --> 00:05:45.237
we could say pi over
four minus two over four.

00:05:46.662 --> 00:05:49.067
So we could write it like
that or we could multiply

00:05:49.067 --> 00:05:51.762
everything out or we could
say this is going to be

00:05:51.762 --> 00:05:56.762
equal to nine pi minus 18
over eight and we are done.
