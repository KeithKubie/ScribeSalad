00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:05.520
In which quadrant is the point
negative 7 comma 7 located?

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.890
So let's just review
what a quadrant is.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.680
A quadrant are each
of the four sections

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.750
of the coordinate plane.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.250
And when we talk
about the sections,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.870
we're talking about the sections
as divided by the coordinate

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:16.960
axes.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.600
So this right here is the
x-axis and this up-down axis

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.726
is the y-axis.

00:00:21.726 --> 00:00:23.600
And you can see it
divides a coordinate plane

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.140
into four sections.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.950
We call each of these
sections quadrants.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.920
This one over here, where both
the x-values and the y-values

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.910
are positive, we call
the first quadrant.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.980
And we use the Roman numeral I.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.170
Then if we kind of
move counterclockwise

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.120
around the coordinate
plane, this quadrant where

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.070
the x-values are negative and
the y-values are positive,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.825
we call this the
second quadrant.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.840
I could write it.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.050
We call this the
second quadrant.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.120
Then we go down here where
both the x-values are negative

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.880
and the y-values are negative.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.110
We call this the third
quadrant, once again

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.660
using Roman numerals.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.430
Then finally the quadrant
where the x-values are positive

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.180
but the y-values
are negative, we

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.560
call this the fourth quadrant.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.310
So let's see which quadrant
the point negative 7 comma

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.927
7 is located.

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:16.510
So there's two ways
to think about it.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.180
You could just say, look,
we have a negative x-value.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.030
Our x-value is
negative, so we're

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.240
going to move to the left.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.730
So we're going to
be on this side.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.438
We're going to be on
this side right here

00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:28.220
of the coordinate plane.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.280
Just by the fact that
the x-value is negative,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.040
we're going to be either in the
second or the third quadrant.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.150
Now, we know that the
y-value is positive.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.230
We know that the
y-value is positive.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.430
So if the x-value is negative
and the y-value is positive,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.410
we're going to land
someplace right over here

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.537
in the second quadrant.

00:01:45.537 --> 00:01:47.120
The other way to
think about it is you

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.860
could literally
just plot this point

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.030
and see that it falls
in the second quadrant.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.080
So let's do that.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.400
If x is negative 7.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.040
So that's negative 1, negative
2, negative 3, negative 4,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.607
negative 5, negative
6, negative 7.

00:01:59.607 --> 00:02:00.440
Did I do that right?

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.690
1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.360
So this is x is negative 7.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.190
And then we have to
go up 7 because y

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.410
is equal to positive 7.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.510
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 7.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.100
So the point negative 7
comma 7 is right over here,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.323
clearly lies in the
second quadrant.
