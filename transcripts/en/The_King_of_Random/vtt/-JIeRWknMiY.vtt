00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Today, we're going to
show you how to build

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.160
one of the coolest looking
fountains I've ever seen.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.220
[Music]

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.252
Guys, it's been a while

00:00:12.252 --> 00:00:14.102
since we've built
a tabletop fountain,

00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:15.900
and I love making
tabletop fountains.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.100
I've got another really cool
one that I'm excited

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.800
that I figured out how to build.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.328
This fountain was inspired

00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:23.506
by a channel called
Living Positively,

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:27.100
which had a video on this type
of fountain about 10 years ago.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.500
It showed the fountain looking
at a little bit in

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.312
what's now considered
pretty low resolution.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.540
It didn't really say
how everything was built.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.200
So I've worked out how to make
that type of fountain,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.600
and we're going
to show you step-by-step

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.600
how to build one yourself.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.120
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.300
We'll use a small pump

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.465
and a specially shaped nozzle to
get a domed mushroom of water.

00:00:43.465 --> 00:00:45.100
We'll then use a water vaporizer

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.300
and some colored lights
to kick it up a notch.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.936
First off, we've got our bucket.

00:00:48.936 --> 00:00:51.800
This is what our whole fountain
is going to be housed in.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.700
The size can change quite a bit.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.829
This is much taller
than it needs to be.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.500
You really only need
four inches of height.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.200
While this is about the smallest
diameter we can use,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.750
you could have
a much larger diameter,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.600
and there would be
no adverse effects.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.325
The next thing we're going
to need is a pump.

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:11.020
Now, there are lots of types
of waterproof submersible pumps.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.000
This particular pump comes
with an additional piece,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.100
this ring light here,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.000
and you can actually fit this in
between the other pieces.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.873
I don't really like
this ring light.

00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:21.800
It has multiple colors
going at once,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.376
and there's no control over it.

00:01:23.376 --> 00:01:24.810
It's just not my preference.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.500
Most importantly
for this project,

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.200
one of the attachments is this.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.600
It's designed for making sort
of mushroom bubbles of water.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.200
It's pretty neat,
but a very simple idea.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.260
The water flows up
through this tube,

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.000
which is just being
held right there,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.700
and you can see with the shape
of this, it all goes flowing,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.766
goes up and out,

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:47.000
hits the edge and just
bubbles over on both sides.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.900
In fact, on all sides,
creating a round bubble.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.618
This piece is held
in place with friction.

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:52.330
You can move it up

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.244
and down just by grabbing it
and pulling it up,

00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:55.292
or pushing it back down,

00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:56.753
and that's going
to change the shape

00:01:56.753 --> 00:01:58.592
and the size of your bubble
by a little bit.

00:01:58.592 --> 00:02:01.000
Just because you're changing
the pressure of the water,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.300
and how far it has to travel

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.600
before it hits
the shape piece of plastic.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.835
This pump comes with
a couple other pieces as well,

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.490
and most of these
are just extensions.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.500
So you can choose

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.280
how high you want
the mushroom piece to go.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.400
And our bucket here,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.850
we are going to need
a little bit of extra height,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.823
because we're going
to want this to sit well

00:02:17.823 --> 00:02:19.540
outside the top of the bucket.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.600
So it's a good thing we've got
these extension pieces.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.050
Let's do a quick test
with some water to make sure

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.900
this is fountaining
the way we want it to.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.660
Start out with this test.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.100
We're just gonna
add enough water

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.600
that our pump is covered.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.600
We don't need to fill
the bucket all the way.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.800
Now, this pump
on the front, it's adjustable.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.507
If you have it open all the way,
its maximum volume of water.

00:02:38.507 --> 00:02:40.900
If we have it closed,
it's only a little bit of water.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.917
We're actually going to start
with it closed about

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:43.710
as much as we can,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.000
and then we'll open it up
because if we put too much,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
it's likely just spray
all over the place,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.500
and that's not what
we're going for.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.600
Alright, there we go.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.182
We can see what our fountain
is trying to do here.

00:02:55.182 --> 00:02:57.775
We've got the water flowing up
through the fountain,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.460
bubbling out into this cool
round mushroom shape.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.050
We are trying to get
a little bit bigger

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.300
of a fountain in it,
so I'm going to reach in,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.674
and I'm going to open
the valve on our fountain

00:03:06.674 --> 00:03:07.551
so that it's a...

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.100
More water is flowing through.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.100
It's a tricky balance.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.200
That's not bad right there.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.400
I'm liking that pretty well.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.190
When you were measuring this,

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.400
one of the interesting things
to take into account is

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.800
that this bubble can actually
be filled up with more air,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.100
so it can fluctuate,

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.535
especially if there's
any air flow in the area.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.520
So, let's see

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.860
if I can blow any in,
and make it a little bit bigger.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.340
[Music]

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.840
There we go.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.000
I got it to go so big
that it's actually overflowing.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.020
I can pop the bubble,
and it shrinks back down.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.800
Pretty crazy that
it works that well.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.204
It's actually made such
a complete sheet of water

00:03:49.204 --> 00:03:51.900
that it just stops
letting any air out.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.600
Now, we can see
how this is working.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.600
It's pretty cool.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.600
Super smooth, complete bubble
going around there.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.100
Let's turn this off for a bit.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.400
We don't want these cords coming
up out of the top

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.100
of our fountain super
visible and everything,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.900
so we're going to do something
similar to what we've done

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:05.300
in the past,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.094
and that's to drill

00:04:06.094 --> 00:04:08.100
a couple small holes
into the side of the bucket,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.737
and have the cords
coming out there.

00:04:09.737 --> 00:04:11.016
I'm putting mine on the back.

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:13.000
I don't want the handle
to be super prominent.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.342
So I'm going to call
this the back,

00:04:14.342 --> 00:04:16.000
and this is where I'm going
to drill holes.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.840
[Music]

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.900
This cord is not going to fit
through that hole.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.411
So we're gonna have
to do something

00:04:27.411 --> 00:04:29.900
that we've done in the past,
and that's cut the cord off,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.160
and splice it back on.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.005
We've got our cords
through the hole.

00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:34.355
This one went to the light.

00:04:34.355 --> 00:04:35.865
I don't want the light on this,

00:04:35.865 --> 00:04:38.400
so I'm actually going to trim
this cord even shorter,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.900
just to about right there.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.330
First, we need to
make this waterproof.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.707
Our bucket is going
to be full of water.

00:04:42.707 --> 00:04:44.196
We don't want it
all leaking right there.

00:04:44.196 --> 00:04:45.500
So we're going
to use some hot glue,

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.800
and we are going to try

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.500
and make a very water
tight seal around this.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.960
We'll use a little bit
of electrical tape to just

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.900
hold the smaller wire

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.306
that used to go to the light
on to the rest of the cord,

00:04:55.306 --> 00:04:57.520
make it a little
less visible and obvious.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.100
To secure down and cover
up the end of this wire

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.445
that used to be attached
to the light,

00:05:01.445 --> 00:05:03.300
we're just going to use
a little bit of heat shrink.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.177
We're going to put
that down over the cord,

00:05:05.177 --> 00:05:07.449
and make sure it overlaps
with the end of the wire,

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.849
so there's no exposed metal wire
that we could touch

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:11.800
that has electricity
running through it.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.141
For the rest of this wire,

00:05:13.141 --> 00:05:15.000
the main plug
that runs the fountain,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.300
we do want to solder back
together one of the two wires.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.600
However, the other wire,
we're going to leave unsoldered.

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.700
And we're going to use

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.100
that to add in a little
feed through switched.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.378
That way, we should be able
to turn the fountain on and off

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:29.400
just by flipping a switch,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.300
and without having
to unplug it every time.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:50.940
[Music]

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.340
Excellent.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.840
That's just what we want to see.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.000
Next step, we want to add
a little bit of magic to that,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.300
and for that,
we are using this thing,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.760
which is a water vaporizer.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.600
It's an ultrasonic vaporizer.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.795
This little plate right
here is a piece of ceramic,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.460
and when you turn this thing on,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.100
it vibrates at several
thousand times per second.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.528
They're really interesting.

00:06:13.528 --> 00:06:15.410
The way it splashes the water up

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.900
out actually just causes
the droplets to break

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.281
apart into these tiny
tiny little particles.

00:06:20.281 --> 00:06:21.610
It just looks like mist,

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.549
and when you put this

00:06:22.549 --> 00:06:25.600
under water about an inch and
a half to three inches of water,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.400
it starts putting out vapors.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.690
Crazy, right?

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:29.454
Look at that.

00:06:29.454 --> 00:06:31.300
Good amount of mist right there.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.600
That's pure water vapor.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.540
There's nothing else involved.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.200
No chemicals.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.300
No changes in temperature.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.318
Interestingly enough,

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.020
if you put your finger
in the path of it,

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.020
it actually starts to like heat
up the inside of your hand,

00:06:43.028 --> 00:06:43.978
and it hurts a lot.

00:06:43.978 --> 00:06:46.000
So be careful
when you're using these things,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.400
because you can
really hurt yourself.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.800
This bucket is going

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.991
to be filled almost
all the way with water,

00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:52.400
and we're going to use some

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.168
of this colored glass to help

00:06:54.168 --> 00:06:57.639
disperse the light just overall
make the whole effect nicer,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.520
clean it up,

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.437
but we don't want
the glass on top of this.

00:07:00.437 --> 00:07:01.790
This needs a clear path

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:04.610
from the ultrasonic plate up
to the top of the water.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.200
And what we're going to use
as a shield is a piece

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.280
of this ABS pipe.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.700
We're going to fit this
inside a piece of this pipe,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.800
and then we're just going
to cut about an inch

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.900
and a half above that,

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.195
and we're going to use
that as a sort of barrier

00:07:16.195 --> 00:07:18.100
to keep the glass
from getting in there.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.700
Once again, we've got chords
that we need to hide.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:22.049
In this case,
we have a cord

00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:24.740
that we want to come out
the side of the PVC pipe,

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.200
and then we're going to want to
come out the side of the bucket.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.068
To allow the cord to hang
down right where we want it,

00:07:30.068 --> 00:07:33.100
we're going to use a saw
to just cut a straight line down

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.531
to about the midpoint,

00:07:34.531 --> 00:07:37.200
so we can have it turn
and head right out.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.800
[Music]

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.900
Now, we're going to use just
a little bit of hot glue

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.100
to hold this in place.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.824
So it's attached to our pipe,

00:07:47.824 --> 00:07:50.294
and not just free
floating around in there.

00:07:50.294 --> 00:07:52.500
This gap at the bottom
is probably enough

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.080
that it would keep a constant
flow of water into there,

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.600
along with the slit on the side,

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.851
but just to be sure,

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:59.980
let's drill a couple
holes into it.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.620
That should do it right there.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.800
Water can easily get in,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.600
and it has a clear path
to shoot its water out the top.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.600
Let's give it a test.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.600
In fact, working great.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.100
Just what we want to see.

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.980
We're going to want this set
up so the black pipe is

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.500
just at the surface
of our water level,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.712
and so, we can kind of choose
about where we want that to be.

00:08:20.712 --> 00:08:22.800
I want it quite close
to the top of our,

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.484
bucket but not all
the way there,

00:08:24.484 --> 00:08:26.600
and then with the cord,
same as last time,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.789
we're going to want to attach it
into the side of the bucket.

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:32.500
Now, this chord is a little
bit different than most.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:33.900
It actually comes apart

00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:36.500
so there's a second
portion of it.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.400
Maybe, it's designed
to be a plug.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.900
Maybe it's just designed
to hold everything in place.

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.900
But if we use the right
size of drill bit,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.500
you actually might be able
to use that as a plug right

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.900
into the side of our bucket.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.156
Well, our plug sort
of fits into our whole,

00:08:50.156 --> 00:08:51.500
but because our drill bit

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.700
didn't cut a superfine
clean edge on it,

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.986
we're going to want to stop

00:08:55.986 --> 00:08:57.700
that up with a little
bit more hot glue.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.300
Just to make
sure it's watertight.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.878
Let's add a switch

00:09:00.878 --> 00:09:03.300
into our ultrasonic
vaporizer as well.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.320
[Music]

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.700
Just what we want to see.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.300
Let's start adding some
of our glass rocks down in here.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.900
Those are going to do
a few different things.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.400
One, they're just going to add
a nice look to the whole thing.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.504
We're going to be adding
some waterproof LED remote

00:09:19.504 --> 00:09:21.430
controlled lights inside there.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.555
It's going to do a really

00:09:22.555 --> 00:09:24.400
good job of diffusing
that light all over,

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.619
and holding them up.

00:09:25.619 --> 00:09:26.900
And three, to lift up

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:29.200
the ultrasonic vaporizer
a little bit so it's higher,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.000
and it's going to be sitting
on top of some of the rocks.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.300
[Music]

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:37.920
Oh, I like that.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:38.310
Okay.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.800
Well, I'm going
to try turning it on,

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.500
but we'll see
where it is right now.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.760
[Music]

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.580
We may have lucked out.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.800
All the plastic pieces

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.064
that fit together adding
up to make the extension

00:09:49.064 --> 00:09:51.164
for this have a little bit
of play in them.

00:09:51.164 --> 00:09:52.700
So if we aren't quite centered,

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.889
we can usually just
push it a little bit.

00:09:55.889 --> 00:09:58.120
Let's try turning on the fog.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.420
[Music]

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.600
This is what looks so good.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.700
We've now got a little bubble
that's just full of vapor,

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:10.953
like all the time.

00:10:10.953 --> 00:10:11.720
It's just--

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.653
Oh, it's magical.

00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:14.300
Then, you can,
you can poke it,

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.900
and the vapor just all leaks
out all of a sudden.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.400
It seriously just
like otherworldly,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.139
like this doesn't look
like a thing

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:24.800
that you can just have,
just full of smoke and stuff,

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.000
but it works so well.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.300
I love this thing.

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:42.080
[Music]

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:42.800
There we have it.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.942
What I think really is probably
the coolest looking fountain

00:10:45.942 --> 00:10:47.700
that we've ever
built in the show.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.229
I love the way this looks.

00:10:49.229 --> 00:10:52.000
It's seriously just like
some weird alien creature.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.100
When it fills with mist,

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:55.120
and then you can like
let the mist out,

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.300
being able to blow it
up and pop it again.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.700
Not that hard to build.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.980
Honestly, you can do this whole
thing in an hour easily.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.455
There are links
in the description

00:11:03.455 --> 00:11:05.438
for where to buy the pump
and the ultrasonic vaporizer.

00:11:05.438 --> 00:11:07.800
As for the bucket and glass,
you don't have to use glass,

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.700
that's just what we use
because we had it available.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.052
Whatever you want to do,
lots of variety.

00:11:12.052 --> 00:11:14.700
I actually probably
would recommend a slightly

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:15.700
larger container.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.525
Maybe something,

00:11:16.525 --> 00:11:18.900
you know planter that's
about that wide across,

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:20.525
and the reason for that is

00:11:20.525 --> 00:11:22.900
that it doesn't splash
or leak too much

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.131
when it's just sitting here,

00:11:24.131 --> 00:11:25.537
but when you turn it on and off,

00:11:25.537 --> 00:11:28.000
it does have a tendency to
splash a little bit like this.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.100
Got out on the sides there.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:34.500
And then turning it on
is even more splashy.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:35.861
When it first kicks in,

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:39.000
it doesn't always kick
in a nice even circle at first.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.120
So I used a little bucket
because I like the compact look.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.400
It all just stays together.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.300
However, this does need
to be mounted outside as it is,

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:47.800
because otherwise,
we're just going to get water

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.400
all over every time
I turn it on and off.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.500
Love this project.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.827
This is a seriously
fun-looking fountain.

00:11:52.827 --> 00:11:55.000
I am super happy with
how it turned out.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.620
Thanks again to the channel
Living Positively for the idea

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.450
for this fountain.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.300
It's really cool,

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.246
and your channel is
the only place I've seen it

00:12:01.246 --> 00:12:02.600
before building it in real life.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.000
So I'm really glad
it worked out.

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.760
Guys, that's not all.

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:06.835
We've got more for you to see.

00:12:06.835 --> 00:12:08.508
The box at the top takes you
to our last video,

00:12:08.508 --> 00:12:09.502
you should go check that out.

00:12:09.502 --> 00:12:10.355
The other box shows you

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.100
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:12.700
And of course,

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.860
if you hit this bomb in the middle,

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:14.635
you'll be subscribed

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.680
to the channel, so you
never miss out on a cool video.

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.660
Don't forget to ring that bell,
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:19.640
Talk to you then.
