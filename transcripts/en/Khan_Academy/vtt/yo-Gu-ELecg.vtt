00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.737
- [Voiceover] In recent
years the amount of C O two

00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:07.150
released by humans into
the planet has approached

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:12.150
40 billion, 40 billion tons and if

00:00:12.407 --> 00:00:15.882
you wanted to break that
down based on people

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:18.543
well we've recently crossed seven billion

00:00:18.543 --> 00:00:21.060
people on the planet so that's going to be

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.052
approximately seven billion
people, seven billion people

00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:30.696
times the amount of tons per person

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:32.180
and so if you work out the math,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.898
40 divided by seven is
going to be roughly 5.7

00:00:35.898 --> 00:00:40.898
5.7 tons per person, tons per person.

00:00:43.653 --> 00:00:45.548
And this might already seem like a lot,

00:00:45.548 --> 00:00:49.977
you can imagine 5.7 tons
of wood just being burned,

00:00:49.977 --> 00:00:52.781
actually it would have to be
more than 5.7 tons of wood

00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:55.361
because wood contains some water.

00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:58.146
But it's even more than that because,

00:00:58.146 --> 00:00:59.843
or at least for many of you all watching,

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:01.754
it's going to be a lot more than that,

00:01:01.754 --> 00:01:03.887
because that's the
average of the developed

00:01:03.887 --> 00:01:06.204
and the developing world and it turns out

00:01:06.204 --> 00:01:09.028
that the average person
in the developed world,

00:01:09.028 --> 00:01:14.028
so developed, developed average,

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:15.734
or if you're a wealthy person or a

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.814
middle class person in
even the developing world,

00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:22.938
your average is going
to be closer to 20 tons,

00:01:22.938 --> 00:01:26.656
20 tons, per person, per year

00:01:26.656 --> 00:01:28.688
and in the developing world, or if you're

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:30.537
not as wealthy of a
person or you're living

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:32.223
in a rural place and
you're not using your car

00:01:32.223 --> 00:01:34.336
to get to where you need to get to

00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:36.124
or your house doesn't have electricity,

00:01:36.124 --> 00:01:41.049
so the poor, the poor, are using closer to

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:46.049
one ton of C O two per person, per year.

00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:49.594
And so this already when
you even see this dynamic,

00:01:49.594 --> 00:01:51.624
it leads to something interesting.

00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:53.230
The number of people on the planet

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.781
is only likely to increase
and we can see that.

00:01:57.781 --> 00:01:59.365
We have a little chart here from,

00:01:59.365 --> 00:02:02.170
based on data from the UN,
I know the numbers here

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.896
are a little bit small, it starts in 1800

00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:06.781
and it goes all the way to 2100

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:08.589
and the blue are the actuals, if you

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.068
want to see where we are right now,

00:02:11.068 --> 00:02:14.786
so we are not quite at 2020 yet,

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:18.423
so we're gonna be
roughly right over there.

00:02:18.423 --> 00:02:20.718
That's where we are right now,

00:02:20.718 --> 00:02:23.746
we've recently crossed
seven billion people

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:25.090
and if you wanted to see where these

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.486
UN predictions have us for 2050,

00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:30.920
2050 is right over here and so

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.836
you can see the high UN prediction has us

00:02:34.836 --> 00:02:38.291
getting to a world population of about

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:41.501
ten and a half billion,
the medium prediction

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:44.529
has us crossing nine billion,
this is like a little bit,

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:49.101
maybe 9.3, 9.4 billion and
then the low prediction

00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:51.132
still has a population increasing a bit,

00:02:51.132 --> 00:02:55.804
it's crossing eight
billion people worlwide.

00:02:55.804 --> 00:02:59.117
So this number is
clearly going to increase

00:02:59.117 --> 00:03:01.474
and so you can also imagine
we want it to happen

00:03:01.474 --> 00:03:03.789
that more people get out of poverty,

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:07.039
that they are able to use, to
have more goods and services

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.514
and so in that case well, they
might be using more energy.

00:03:10.514 --> 00:03:12.688
And if we don't change how
we produce that energy,

00:03:12.688 --> 00:03:16.202
well this has the potential
of really going up a lot,

00:03:16.202 --> 00:03:18.762
which could make this number go up a lot.

00:03:18.762 --> 00:03:21.424
And to help us think about
that a little bit more

00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:25.142
Bill Gates gave his famous
TED talk a couple of years ago

00:03:25.142 --> 00:03:28.230
where he talked about his energy equation,

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.282
and it's a pretty
straight forward equation,

00:03:30.282 --> 00:03:34.285
it talks about the total
sum of C O two emissions.

00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:37.698
So this is the capital Greek
letter sigma right over here,

00:03:37.698 --> 00:03:40.812
it's shorthand math,
math shorthand for sum.

00:03:40.812 --> 00:03:43.888
So the annual sum of C O two emissions,

00:03:43.888 --> 00:03:45.621
and so that's that 40 billion number

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:47.407
that I was talking about before,

00:03:47.407 --> 00:03:49.662
well you can derive this in any given year

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:52.690
by taking the product of several things.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.429
First you can think about
the world's population, P,

00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:58.481
I'll even call that the average population

00:03:58.481 --> 00:04:00.735
because the population is changing,

00:04:00.735 --> 00:04:04.047
so the average population in a year,

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:07.846
average population in a year and then

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:10.813
you can multiply that times the amount of

00:04:10.813 --> 00:04:15.465
services on average each
person is using per year.

00:04:16.135 --> 00:04:21.135
So times the services,
let me write that down,

00:04:22.028 --> 00:04:27.028
the average services,
average, average services

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:32.009
per person, per person and really

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.569
we could say average services and goods.

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:36.113
Because we are talking
about things that are,

00:04:36.113 --> 00:04:38.754
that are going to need energy

00:04:38.754 --> 00:04:41.091
and any good or service pretty much,

00:04:41.091 --> 00:04:42.594
that you look around is going to need

00:04:42.594 --> 00:04:44.565
energy for you to consume.

00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:45.908
There's some of the obvious things like

00:04:45.908 --> 00:04:49.118
transportation, obviously
your car might consume

00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:52.023
some fuel, it needs energy to do that.

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:54.883
But even watching this
video, I'm consuming energy

00:04:54.883 --> 00:04:56.872
producing this video for you, I had to

00:04:56.872 --> 00:05:00.900
eat some food, some energy
which is, the reason

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.399
I eat it is for energy
and some energy was used

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:06.122
even to produce that food,
to get it to my table,

00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:09.088
I am using electricity
on my computer right now,

00:05:09.088 --> 00:05:12.339
you would have to use electricity
to consume this video,

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:13.883
so there's a lot more energy being

00:05:13.883 --> 00:05:15.447
used in the goods and services you

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:18.357
consume than you might realize.

00:05:18.357 --> 00:05:20.038
So then you want to take, and remember

00:05:20.038 --> 00:05:22.375
we want to get to the
total sum of C O two,

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.630
you multiply that times the average energy

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.364
per service, or you could say
per good or service consumed.

00:05:29.364 --> 00:05:33.264
So average, I'll just
services, average energy,

00:05:33.264 --> 00:05:38.264
average energy per service, per service.

00:05:39.648 --> 00:05:44.648
I'll just write the word
per, so per, per service

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:47.918
right over there, as I
said almost any service

00:05:47.918 --> 00:05:51.860
you use, you consume is using some energy.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.135
When you go to school your teacher,

00:05:54.135 --> 00:05:57.426
he or she is consuming
energy, to just be alive,

00:05:57.426 --> 00:05:58.808
they had to eat some food, they had to

00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:01.977
use transportation to
get there, your classroom

00:06:01.977 --> 00:06:04.720
might be heated or it might
be cooled in some way.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.829
And then finally to get
us to the sum of C O two

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:12.055
released in a year, we
have to multiply by,

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:16.199
we have to multiply by, let me do that in

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:19.125
the color I'm using for the C O two,

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:23.940
we have to multiply
that times the C O two,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.940
C O two released, released per

00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:34.666
unit of energy, per unit of energy.

00:06:36.635 --> 00:06:39.275
And so, you can, we
can think about how all

00:06:39.275 --> 00:06:40.941
of these dynamics are going to change

00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:44.070
but if we ever want this thing
on the left to get to zero,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:45.919
and unless it gets to zero, things like

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.174
global warming are only
going to get worse,

00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:49.616
in order for that to get
to zero and you're taking

00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:52.542
the product of four things, at least one

00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:54.391
of these things have to be zero.

00:06:54.391 --> 00:06:55.328
That's the only way that you're

00:06:55.328 --> 00:06:57.360
going to get a product to be zero.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.948
Now we could look at each of these,

00:06:58.948 --> 00:07:01.182
each of these elements
of the energy equation

00:07:01.182 --> 00:07:03.416
and think about what
they are likely to do.

00:07:03.416 --> 00:07:05.448
The average world population, well we see

00:07:05.448 --> 00:07:08.008
what's going on here,
even the medium prediction

00:07:08.008 --> 00:07:11.503
has the population growing by roughly 30%

00:07:11.503 --> 00:07:14.401
so we can say look, this
is going to increase,

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:19.401
this is going to increase
by, by a factor of 1.3,

00:07:20.198 --> 00:07:22.433
it's going to increase by roughly 30%,

00:07:22.433 --> 00:07:24.384
once again these are all
predictions, this is all very rough

00:07:24.384 --> 00:07:27.248
but we can think directionally
where things are going.

00:07:27.248 --> 00:07:29.036
Now, average goods and services,

00:07:29.036 --> 00:07:31.616
or average services per
person, well we want the poor

00:07:31.616 --> 00:07:34.969
to be able to consume
more, now maybe some of us

00:07:34.969 --> 00:07:36.305
in the developed world, maybe we consume

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:38.290
a little bit too much, you know,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.820
that's a philisophical
thing for folks to debate

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.177
but on average we want the world, we want

00:07:43.177 --> 00:07:46.510
more people to have better transportation,

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:48.276
better access to healthcare, better access

00:07:48.276 --> 00:07:51.527
to education, better access to leisure.

00:07:51.527 --> 00:07:53.416
And so this is likely to go up,

00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:55.631
in fact this will go up
as the world grows richer

00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:57.216
and some of the predictions,
and this is what was,

00:07:57.216 --> 00:08:00.365
I believe what Bill cited in his TED talk,

00:08:00.365 --> 00:08:03.209
was that this could go
up by a factor of two,

00:08:03.209 --> 00:08:04.428
this could go up by a factor of two,

00:08:04.428 --> 00:08:06.927
and this is good, we want
the world to become richer,

00:08:06.927 --> 00:08:10.523
we want more people to
consume goods and services.

00:08:10.523 --> 00:08:13.054
Now, the average energy per service.

00:08:13.054 --> 00:08:14.761
Well the good thing is technology is

00:08:14.761 --> 00:08:17.809
making things more
efficient, and so we might

00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:22.054
have better insulation,
better efficient engines,

00:08:22.054 --> 00:08:23.822
whether they're electric engines or

00:08:23.822 --> 00:08:26.463
some other type of fuel engines,

00:08:26.463 --> 00:08:28.150
and so the average energy per service

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.466
is likely to go down, it depends on

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:32.315
how optimistic you are,
it could go down by

00:08:32.315 --> 00:08:35.403
20% and depending on
your time frame, 50% and

00:08:35.403 --> 00:08:37.313
some even more optimistic predictions

00:08:37.313 --> 00:08:39.385
might be even more than 50%, so

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:42.554
it's gonna go down, so let's
just say this is times,

00:08:42.554 --> 00:08:46.049
let's just use 0.5,
let's just be optimistic.

00:08:46.049 --> 00:08:47.635
But even if you were to multiply this,

00:08:47.635 --> 00:08:49.401
you know, just 1.3 times two, that's

00:08:49.401 --> 00:08:51.698
a factor of 2.6 and even if you were

00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:54.399
to take that by half you still have

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:57.183
this entire product increasing.

00:08:57.183 --> 00:08:58.727
And even if we were to
get really efficient,

00:08:58.727 --> 00:09:03.460
if we were to, if we were
to decrease our energy used

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.585
per service by 80% or even 90%

00:09:07.585 --> 00:09:10.836
you still have many
tens of billions of tons

00:09:10.836 --> 00:09:13.660
of C O two being released every year.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.935
So the only way we're going
to be able to get that,

00:09:15.935 --> 00:09:18.818
to get this thing down to zero,

00:09:18.818 --> 00:09:22.831
is if, is if C, right over here,

00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:25.900
the C O two released per unit of energy

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:30.900
goes to zero, it needs, so
this needs to go to zero.

00:09:33.433 --> 00:09:36.987
Which is a fairly bold
thing to say because

00:09:36.987 --> 00:09:38.755
we're nowhere close to that right now

00:09:38.755 --> 00:09:40.766
but if we're serious about this,

00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:43.001
it's possible that humanity can get there.

00:09:43.001 --> 00:09:46.658
There are energy sources
that are, that don't

00:09:46.658 --> 00:09:50.640
release C O two or get pretty
close to being at zero.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.245
And just to be clear,
even if you're driving

00:09:52.245 --> 00:09:54.317
an electric car, you have to think about

00:09:54.317 --> 00:09:56.004
where does that electricity come from?

00:09:56.004 --> 00:09:58.584
If that electricity
was generated using say

00:09:58.584 --> 00:10:01.225
something like coal, well
that's going to release C O two

00:10:01.225 --> 00:10:04.821
or if it was generated using natural gas,

00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:08.438
that is going to release
carbon into the atmosphere.

00:10:08.438 --> 00:10:10.744
And so you need to think about,

00:10:10.744 --> 00:10:11.499
even if you are using something

00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:13.978
like an electric motor, how is that

00:10:13.978 --> 00:10:16.477
electricity actually produced?

00:10:16.477 --> 00:10:18.509
And you have energy sources, like nuclear,

00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:19.951
nuclear has it's own set of issues

00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:21.719
that we think about, like safety

00:10:21.719 --> 00:10:23.202
and what you do with the waste

00:10:23.202 --> 00:10:24.279
but people are working on things

00:10:24.279 --> 00:10:26.371
like clean burning nuclear
that are much safer

00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:30.536
and generate a very small
fraction of the waste.

00:10:30.536 --> 00:10:33.178
You have all your other
renewable souces of energy

00:10:33.178 --> 00:10:35.087
but this is a big challenge for humanity.

00:10:35.087 --> 00:10:37.668
If we want this thing
on the left to be zero,

00:10:37.668 --> 00:10:41.754
if we wanna slow, or if we wanna

00:10:41.754 --> 00:10:44.111
stop the heating of the planet

00:10:44.111 --> 00:10:46.020
we have to figure out how to do this.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.251
And the general sense
is, if as a civilization,

00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:54.011
we put our minds to it that we can do it.
