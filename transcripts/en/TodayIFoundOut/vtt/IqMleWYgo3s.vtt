00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:09.480
That Time Johnny Carson Accidentally Caused
a Near Month Long Toilet Paper Shortage in

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.530
the US

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.730
Much like Orson Welles before him, Johnny
Carson once accidentally used his public platform

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.279
to incite a public panic.

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.949
On this day in history, 1973, Carson started
a near month long toilet paper shortage in

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.609
the United States.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.039
In his show, he stated, “You know what’s
disappearing from the supermarket shelves?

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.039
Toilet paper…

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:35.550
There’s an acute shortage of toilet paper
in the United States.”

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.460
Americans promptly went out and bought up
every piece of toilet paper they could find.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.010
Supermarkets tried to ration it, but to no
avail.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.710
By noon the next day, pretty much all the
nation’s supermarkets were sold out of toilet

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:48.710
paper.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.059
After several days of toilet paper shortages
due to this hysteria, Carson went on the air

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.300
to try to explain it had been a joke and apologized.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.019
But because there really was a toilet paper
shortage now and the shelves were almost always

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.799
empty of TP at this time, whenever some would
come in, people would buy it all and hoard

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:06.799
it.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.950
This toilet paper shortage lasted a full three
weeks.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.409
Incidentally, in the “panic” (there really
wasn’t one in reality) after Orson Welles’

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.020
famous performance of H.G. Wells’ The War
of the Worlds many people tried to sue for

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.740
a variety of things, such as for the mental
anguish the broadcast caused due to being

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.930
presented as if it were actually happening.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.420
Among all the suits, which were summarily
dismissed, only one person got what he was

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.479
asking for.

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.730
That person was a black man who had spent
the money he had been saving for a pair of

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.720
shoes on trying to escape the invading Martians.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:51.719
When Welles’ heard about this, he insisted
that the man be reimbursed his shoe money.
