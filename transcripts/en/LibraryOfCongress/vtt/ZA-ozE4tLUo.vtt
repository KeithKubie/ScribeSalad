00:00:31.310 --> 00:02:50.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress in Washington,
D.C.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:03:08.049
[ Silence ]

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:42.880
[ Background Conversation ]

00:03:42.880 --> 00:04:22.680
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: It's so wonderful to see
so many people here on Friday night for a

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.670
fabulous lecture. That's so great [laughing].
Anyway, welcome. I'm Betsy Peterson. I am

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.660
the Director of the American Folklife Center
here at the Library of Congress. And I want

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:40.730
to welcome you to a very special edition of
our Benjamin Botkin Folklife Lecture Series.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.890
Now, for those of you we don't know what that's
all about, the American Folklife Center was

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:55.630
founded in 1976 by Congress with a mandate
to preserve and present American folklife.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:03.580
And we were placed here at the Library very
specifically. Congress chose the Library of

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:10.580
Congress as the site because the Library already
had an incredibly vast archive of traditional

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.419
music and culture. And so it seemed like the
best place to be. And it's an archive that

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:23.590
has been built for decades by the likes of
John and Alan Lomax and Benjamin Botkin. And,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:31.440
actually, the archives plays a role and influences
the topic that Billy Bragg is going to be

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.240
talking about tonight. And we'll be finding
out more about that. The Benjamin Botkin Lecture

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.470
Series, which is named after one of those
distinguished folklorists, provides a platform

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:52.900
for professional -- I'm sorry -- professional
academic individuals, people from the public

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.150
sector, from the university, as well as colleagues
working independently in folklore at their

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.819
musicology, cultural heritage, and related
fields to share their findings in their ongoing

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:10.490
research. Now, that's great for the public.
I think that's great for you. And it's certainly

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:16.990
great for us here at the Center because these
lectures form an important part of our accusations

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:24.030
as well. And each one is recorded and becomes
a part of the permanent archive -- I mean

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.160
-- yes, part of the permanent archive here
at the Library so that future generations

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:37.410
can enjoy, listen, and study. So, that reminds
me of my last caveat for you all, which is

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.990
that this is a good time to say, if you have
a cell phone or a mobile device, please turn

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:50.919
it off or you will be memorialized in our
archive [laughter]. So this evening we have

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:58.470
a very special honor to present a Botkin lecture
who falls -- of -- a Botkin lecturer -- excuse

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:05.301
me -- who falls outside of the usual categories
of academic or public sector research. And

00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:14.419
so to introduce Billy Bragg and his work,
please welcome our own Steve Winick. Thanks.

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:16.180
[ Applause ]

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Thank you. As Betsy mentioned,
I'm Steve Winick. I'm the Editor here at the

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.350
American Folklife Center at the Library of
Congress. And I should say that this event

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.139
is also cosponsored by the Folklore Society
of Greater Washington so we want to thank

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:34.759
FSGD for cosponsoring this with is. And I
should also say that I'm pretty thrilled to

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:39.620
have such a distinguished speaker. When I
was a teenager, I confess, that I was a big

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.659
Billy Bragg fan. And he's one of the first
artists whose work I got as it came out as

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:49.460
opposed to years after it came out because
I was just old enough in the 1980s to have

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.289
money and to have friends who were cool. And
that's a big theme in Billy's book as well,

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:59.340
the importance of teenagers in the music scene.
So, like many people, my musical tastes kind

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.530
of changed over the years and I ended up involved
in traditional folk music and working here

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:09.150
in a folklore archive, The American Folklife
Center archive here at the Library of Congress.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.639
And last year it came to my attention that
Billy Bragg had recorded an album called Shine

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:19.650
A Light, which includes several songs that
are first known from recordings in our archive.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:24.850
So I set about trying to get Billy here for
our program. And I got as far as discussing

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:30.160
in seriously when the album's promoter or
the publicist, but he just didn't have time

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.180
on his last trip to D.C. to come here. Now,
what I didn't know at that time was that Shine

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:40.530
A Light came about because of his research
for a book about skiffle. And I knew something

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:45.930
about skiffle from years as a music journalist
and also because, working here, many of our

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:51.670
recordings were important to the skiffle craze.
So here's where the story gets cool and a

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:57.650
little bit weird. Back at the end of 2016,
Billy was getting the book ready for release

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.400
and he realizes that maybe this is a better
opportunity to come to the Library of Congress.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.269
Right? So that's what happens then. And he
vaguely must have remembered that some dude

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:10.230
at the Library of Congress had been trying
to get him here before, but he's not working

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.730
with that album publicist anymore, so how
to find the dude at the Library of Congress?

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:20.240
And that's when I get a message from my high
school girlfriend, Jenny Lewis of Toronto,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:25.850
who says, "Send me your contact info at work.
Billy Bragg wants to meet with you."

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.850
[ Laughter ]

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:31.470
So I'm not making this up. Billy's good friend,
Avi Lewis, is the brother of my high school

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:36.370
sweetheart and that's how he found me. And
this would just be a funny story, except that

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:41.390
I think it demonstrates Billy's tenacity as
a researcher and his canny use of social networks

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:46.470
and social media, all of which contributed
to this book that he'll tell you about. So,

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.540
without further ado, I will say that Billy
Bragg is a singer, songwriter, activist, and

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:55.440
author. He's known for beautiful love songs,
for powerful political songs, and for standing

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.839
up for what's right. In the folk world, he's
also well-known for being one of the people

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:04.740
who Nora Guthrie and the Guthrie family specifically
asked to write music for many of Woody Guthrie's

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.540
unsung lyrics resulting in the Mermaid Avenue
sessions. And all of these activities have

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.330
deep connections to our archive and the Library
of Congress. So, from now on, he will also

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:19.300
be known as the author of an important book
on skiffle called "Roots, Radicals, and Rockers:

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.540
How Skiffle Changed the World." So, without
another word from me, please welcome our very

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:27.100
special speaker, Billy Bragg.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.290
[ Applause ]

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:40.110
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Thank you very much.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.010
[ Applause ]

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.010
Thank you very much.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.010
[ Applause ]

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:46.020
Thank you very much, everybody. I'd like to
thank the American Folklife Center for inviting

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.489
me here and Steve's girlfriend for making
it happen.

00:10:49.489 --> 00:10:50.489
[ Laughter ]

00:10:50.489 --> 00:10:54.270
Yes. I was kind of telling everybody about
the book -- the book was coming because I

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:59.459
thought it was a book that may be interesting
to people in North America, particularly here

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:03.850
in the United States where the bands of the
British Invasion are still so important to

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.430
you. We were actually touring at the time
when -- just last year with the Shine A Light

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:12.861
record -- we were touring around the time
Eight Days A Week was released, the Beatles

00:11:12.861 --> 00:11:17.370
movie, and it was making such a big splash.
I was thinking to myself, "I hope I can find

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:24.760
some way to connect these guys with the story
I'm trying to tell," because it's a crucial

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:31.829
part of that British Invasion story. And,
of course, it's inspired by music that's -- some

00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:38.430
of which was recorded on behalf of the Library
of Congress in the 1930s and in the 1940s.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:44.470
So let's start with -- let's start with the
word, "skiffle." Skiffle is one of those words

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.440
which you have to be very careful. It has
a different meaning in the United States of

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:59.019
America than it has in the UK. So a word like,
"Pants."

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:01.250
[ Laughter ]

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:02.250
Or "fag."

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:03.250
[ Laughter ]

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.470
Or, "Socialism," actually for that matter
now I think about it.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:05.470
[ Laughter ]

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:11.029
Which is why [inaudible], "football," at the
top of that list of words that you have to

00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:14.610
be very careful how you use it when you come
to this country because you get a lot of quizzical

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:23.610
look. The word, "skiffle," originates in African
American slang in the 1920s. The story that

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:27.860
comes to us in the UK says it originates on
the south side of Chicago, but I'm sure it's

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:33.149
much wider than that. A skiffle was a name
that African Americans gave to what we might

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:40.920
call a rent party where they would organize
some -- some food, cook some down home food

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:47.800
often from the place where they originated
in the South. They would brew up some hooch,

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.769
get a boogie woogie piano player to come around
and charge money at the door to raise some

00:12:53.769 --> 00:13:01.620
money. The word doesn't really have a strong
musical connotation in the United States of

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:08.410
America. It was used by Paramount Records
in the '20s who made an album called, "Down

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:16.000
Home," -- sorry -- a single called, "Down
Home Skiffle," which was kind of like a -- a

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.209
record that featured all their artists. It
was like a sampler for the label. They had

00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:24.240
half a dozen artists on each side playing
a couple of tunes and the concept of the thing

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.570
was they were at a down home skiffle. And
it ends with a knock at the door [knocking]

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:32.750
and the narrator says it's the police and
they've come to break up the down home skiffle.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.440
So that's -- that's the kind of early-ish
use, but it's not a word that's picked up

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:43.880
by African American musicians or anybody else
for that matter until 1947 when a guy named

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:51.930
Dan Burley records an album of songs that
he played as a young man in Chicago on the

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:59.560
South Side in the 1920s. Dan Burley is a kind
of Renaissance figure in African American

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:05.570
culture in the 1940s. He's a cofounder of
Ebony Magazine. He hangs out with a lot of

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:14.081
jazz greats, Ellington, and also writes a
very popular dictionary of African American

00:14:14.081 --> 00:14:23.000
hip slang. And during -- in the context of
the Trad Jazz Revival, someone says to him,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.509
"Why don't you make an album of those great
barrelhouse piano tunes that you made in the

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:33.800
1920s that you sang [inaudible]?" So he gets
together with Sticks and Brownie McGhee and

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:42.759
they record an album called "South Side Shake"
of predominately barrelhouse piano tunes.

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:49.589
And the album is credited to Dan Burley and
his Skiffle Boys. Now, in this context, he's

00:14:49.589 --> 00:14:54.000
talking about, we might say Dan Burley and
his party boys. In my country, we would call

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.060
it Dan Burley and his it" knees-up" boys.
That's what we'd call it. It's a slang word

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:03.750
for "party" in England, "A good old knees-up."
So, yeah. In this context, "skiffle," is still

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:16.420
referring to an event. Now, the Trad Jazz
Revival kind of kicks off in the late 1930s

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:25.300
where jazz fans, predominantly, begin to seek
out the earliest recordings by -- particularly

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:34.130
by New Orleans jazz bands because they believed
that modern jazz -- not modern jazz, but contemporary

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:39.389
jazz -- I think what we would not refer to
as swing, has become too commercial, too big-time,

00:15:39.389 --> 00:15:46.300
too white break, and the jazz has lost its
essence. And they begin to try to seek the

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:54.970
earliest records and eventually they kind
of come to an idea that New Orleans jazz is

00:15:54.970 --> 00:16:01.699
the only true, pure jazz. And what's special
about New Orleans jazz is it has no soloists.

00:16:01.699 --> 00:16:05.860
The players play constantly all the time in
and out of the rhythm and around one another.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.200
So Louis Armstrong, I know he's from New Orleans,
once he goes to Chicago and starts playing

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:15.089
solos, he's out, baby. He's out. They draw
a line -- they draw a line in the sand just

00:16:15.089 --> 00:16:20.529
north of Lake Pontchartrain [laughing]. And
anyone who crosses this line has gone over

00:16:20.529 --> 00:16:27.589
to the dark side. And in that, what they were
trying to do, those fans -- and then, in my

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:32.430
country, which it was very popular after the
war -- there wasn't a trad jazz band in Britain

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:37.750
until 1943 when a guy named George Webb, who
worked in a machine gun factory, got together

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:43.140
with a bunch of workmates to play -- or tried
to play trad jazz. They didn't have a bass.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.420
They had a tuba. They couldn't find a bass,
so they had a tuba.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.420
[ Laughter ]

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:53.250
But they were basically trying to get a handle
on this music that really moved them. They

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.410
didn't know where it was from. They couldn't
-- they couldn't put their finger on why it

00:16:56.410 --> 00:17:04.149
moved them so they were trying to play it.
So a trad jazz movement grew up and the impulse

00:17:04.149 --> 00:17:11.150
-- the trad jazz impulse is not something
unfamiliar in popular music. In many ways,

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:20.930
the trad jazz aficionados, in trying to go
back to basics to renew music, were following

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:26.740
the same impulse of the Ramones in your country
and Dr. Feelgood in my country in the mid-1970s

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:31.380
when appalled by the commerciality of guitar
rock. They sought to go back to the earliest

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:37.830
sort of rock-'n'-roll, the absolute most basic
rock-'n'-roll, that kind of idea that when

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:42.820
music becomes stale, the way forward is sometimes
to be found in the very back of the corner

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:48.350
of the record store, in the back of the racks
-- if you can find a record store -- in the

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:57.310
back of the racks. It's quite a potent idea.
And, unfortunately for the guys who want to

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:03.140
play trad jazz in my countries in the late
'40s and the early '50s, there's a musicians

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:11.680
union ban on American bands touring in Great
Britain. It's a reciprocal ban in response

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:19.920
to the American Federation of Musicians stipulating
in 1935 that British band leaders could only

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.290
tour in the United States of America if they
used American musicians and took out American

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:31.060
citizenship. It's the worst kind of protectionism
and as many of you all know I'm a staunch

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:34.610
supporter of organized labor. It's totally
embarrassing and that it should happen in

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:41.760
music as well is -- it's -- but I cover it
extensively in the book -- because it's absolutely

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.320
unbelievable. This band -- the Ministry of
Labor in British, the Musicians Union, asked

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:53.180
the Ministry of Labor to institute a reciprocal
ban. So between 1935 and 1955 no American

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:58.410
band toured the UK and no British artist band
toured the United States of America. That's

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.400
a long time. Imagine if it had been 1965 to
1985.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.400
[ Laughter ]

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:09.690
I mean, just think about that. No Beatles.
No Jimi Hendrix. No Judas. I mean, it's an

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:15.070
incredible long time. And these were the days
when the only way to find out how to play

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:20.070
a musical star was to watch, to see, to sit
on the edge of the stage and watch someone

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:26.360
play, and listen to their technique. That
was the way people learned how to play, but,

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.970
sadly, for the British trad guys, the only
way they had to learn was to listen to these

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:35.380
very early recordings, these precious earlier
recordings that they believed were the only

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:45.301
real true jazz. Now, due to the primitive
nature of recording in the 1920s, the musicians

00:19:45.301 --> 00:19:50.921
on those records really had to blow hard to
get onto the record. They blew like Billy

00:19:50.921 --> 00:19:56.490
O. So the British jazz guys figured that was
all part and parcel have it so they blew the

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.110
hell out of their instruments. They really
went for it. Because, I mean, jazz, you it,

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.750
trad jazz has that pep thing. Maybe it was
one of the things that first attracted people

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:10.710
to it, that zip and pep. But, as a result
of not having much technique, the British

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:16.720
jazz guys, after 30 minutes, their lips were
so numb, they couldn't play anymore.

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:17.720
[ Laughter ]

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.250
So they were in a bit of a quandary. So what
they did was they put down their brass instruments

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:26.640
and they picked up acoustic guitar, washboard,
and used the double bass from the jazz band

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:32.510
and they performed what broadly you would
refer to as Lead Belly's repertoire. And I

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:37.450
say Lead Belly because -- I'm not sure if
I'm allowed to say this this building, but

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:43.121
he is the greatest folk singer that America
ever produced, not only as a performer, as

00:20:43.121 --> 00:20:49.650
an interpreter, as a writer, as a popularizer.
You know, Lead Belly was to Woody what Woody

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:54.390
was to Bob. You know, Woody used to kind of
sit around Lead Belly's house on 14th Street,

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.790
sit in the corner and watch him play and listen
to him talk. The man was physically a giant,

00:20:58.790 --> 00:21:04.150
but also culturally, in your country and my
country, he was a giant. So the reason they

00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:07.910
played Lead Belly's repertoire was because
there was an element of education and what

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:14.330
they were trying to do. In my country in the
1950s, you could learn about jazz by going

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:19.060
to something called a record recital because
his music wasn't really played on the BBC.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:24.760
It was the only radio station at the time.
You would go to somewhere like Wigmore Hall

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:31.480
in London, which holds 1,200 people, and they
would sell out something called a record recital,

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:38.210
which is basically a jazz critic playing his
jazz collection on a wind up foghorn record

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:43.450
player and talking about the context in which
these records are playing, who is playing,

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:47.010
what, you know -- what the connections between
this and other artists are. This was kind

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:56.620
of really the only way to find out about jazz.
And so, in that context, playing these Lead

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:04.280
Belly songs, the trad jazzers believed that
they were educating their audience in where

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:09.210
jazz came from. They believed that jazz had
evolved from the blues partly because -- they

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:13.350
were mistaken in this -- the blues -- the
twelve-form blues -- twelve-bar blues, we

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:21.820
know, postdates New Orleans jazz. But I think
they were misled by the fact that the trad

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.980
jazzers used the term, "blues," on their records
when they actually meant a kind of loose playing,

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.990
like a jam. A blues would be a song that,
you know, everyone was adding their own bit

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:37.400
to. So there was an easy mistake to make.
So, anyway, they began performing these Lead

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:44.900
Belly songs and the guy who was the key proponent
of this was a fellow called Ken Collyer and

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:52.280
Ken Collyer was absolutely obsessed with New
Orleans jazz. He was a trumpet player and

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:58.310
one of the giants of the revival was a guy
named Bunk Johnson. Bunk Johnson was a guy

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:03.020
who claimed to have played with Buddy Bolden
back in New Orleans. Buddy Bolden, allegedly

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.090
the guy who invented New Orleans jazz. Again,
I know there's probably half a dozen of you

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:12.060
who are going to argue about that later, but
I'm just passing on what's taken for fact

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:18.730
in my country. Bunk Johnson disappeared in
the 1920s. He was rediscovered in the '40s

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:24.000
and made a couple of recordings with a band
that included George Lewis on clarinet. George

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.610
Lewis being one of the few New Orleans clarinet
players who hadn't traded up to be a saxophone

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:36.230
player when swing came along. And although
Bunk was dead, George Lewis and the rest of

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:41.350
the Johnson band was still playing in New
Orleans. So they were playing in little whole-in-the-wall

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:47.020
dives to people of a similar age to them,
which is in the late 60s, early 70s. They

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.470
weren't playing to young African Americans.
They tended to be much more interested in

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:56.330
the modern version of jazz, which, interestingly,
modern jazz, bebop, had come from that same

00:23:56.330 --> 00:24:03.210
impulse to get away from the commerciality
of swing. It's unfortunate that the trads

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:10.510
and the moderns ended up at war with one another,
but it was a similar impulse. The beboppers

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:16.110
were just trying to make the future happen
rather than going back to the past. But George

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:21.560
Lewis was still playing in New Orleans. And
Ken Colyer knew this and he finally realized

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.680
that the only way he would really learn to
play New Orleans jazz was to get to New Orleans.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.660
Now, in 1950s Britain -- early 1950s Britain,
this is a mountain to climb. It's a real mountain

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:37.050
to climb. The British government has currency
restrictions which only allow you to take

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:44.020
10 pound per person out of the country because
they're afraid of a run on the pound. And

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:48.780
the fair across the Atlantic to get into the
United States of America is not so straightforward

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.500
for him. So he comes up with a brilliant plan.
He joins the Merchant Marine.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.500
[ Laughter ]

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.160
Now, the Merchant Marine in my country works
on a taxing rank principle. You go down, they

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.170
give you a chit with the name of a ship, you
go to the ship, you give it to them, you have

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:07.840
to join the ship, they have to take you. So
his first trip he goes to Australia.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.030
[ Laughter ]

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:15.800
His second trip he goes to the Gulf of Arabia.
And the third trip he goes around the Cape

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.960
of Good Hope. So after 18 months at sea, he's
sitting back in the office waiting for another

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.600
chit when the guy next to him looks at his
chit he's just been given and says, "Dammit,

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.780
Mobile, Alabama."

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.780
[ Laughter ]

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:38.340
To which Ken Colyer says, "I'll swap you."
So they trade and Colyer gets to go to Mobile,

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.980
Alabama on a ship running up and down to the
Orinoco Cove where oil is discovered off of

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:49.960
the coast of Venezuela. And after a couple
of trips as the ship's cook, he gets to New

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:54.350
Orleans, he jumps ship, he leaves the ship,
and he gets a month long visa and rides the

00:25:54.350 --> 00:26:01.040
rails into New Orleans where he happens to
-- there's a guy named Doc Souchong [assumed

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:08.170
spelling] who's a jazz critic and also played
in string bands in the 1910, 1911 who's a

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:14.160
critic whose name he knows. In in those days
British libraries had phone book -- well,

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.090
the Westminster library -- just the Westminster
library, had phone books for American cities.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:24.070
And so before he's left, he's gone and found
Doc Souchong's phone number under MDs because

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.170
he's a real doctor. That's how he found him.
He tried finding George Lewis, but there were

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:31.030
too many George Lewis's in the phone book.
So he found Doc Souchong and Doc Souchong

00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:35.690
takes him to meet George Lewis and the band.
He sees George Lewis and the band and, of

00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:39.480
course, he's bought his trumpet. And, of course,
he knows their entire set. He knows their

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:45.200
repertoire inside out. These guys are so made
up, this young guy that's come here all the

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:50.320
way from England. They're so pleased that
someone's interested, someone young is interested

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:57.010
in their music. So they say to him, "Why don't
you sit up and play with us?" So Colyer, not

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:01.300
only has he gone to the mountain top, not
only has he climbed Olympus, but now he's

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:06.330
sitting in with the Gods. I mean, this is
just incredible. So he writes home to his

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:11.970
brother who's a huge -- works in a Dobell's
jazz shop in London, he's an expert on traditional

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:16.380
jazz, he's writing home to his brother, Bill.
Brother Bill's passing the letters onto the

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:21.700
Melody Maker who are printing them. So people
are reading -- this is unbelievable. Colyer's

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:26.600
like in New Orleans. It's like he's gone to
the moon. You know? It's like impossible.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.620
Everyone's like amazed by this.

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:30.620
[ Laughter ]

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:35.850
But not everyone's amazed. Some people are
very angry. Some people don't think a white

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:40.700
boy should sit down and play with black musicians.
This is around the time that your government

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:47.930
was getting very suspicious of any subversive
activity. And what Ken Colyer was doing was

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:52.970
subversive. And the proof of that is that
when he went to renew his month visa, he was

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:57.460
arrested. Now, he was a day late on his visa.
His visa was due for renewal on December the

00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:02.280
25th. So you can imagine they might say, "Well,
fair enough, son. You couldn't get here on

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.370
Christmas Day. We'll renew it." And even if
they didn't say that, the usual way to deal

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:15.770
with someone who's violated their -- the -- thing
to get them in the country, is to put them

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:20.850
in a hostile until they can be deported. Ken
Colyer is put in jail with no bail. He's kept

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:25.150
there for 38 days. It's absolutely clear.
And whenever they ask him why he's come to

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:28.770
New Orleans, he says, "I've come to New Orleans
to play with those guys." And they keep him

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:34.800
in jail all that time. It's clear that, you
know, they saw him as someone who was challenging

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:42.500
the Jim Crow law in New Orleans. And everybody
in the jazz community, Doc Souchong and those

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.070
people that he's been staying with are trying
to get him out of jail. They're appalled.

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:53.050
They're absolutely appalled. Ken -- Ken's
really pleased because now he's the only person

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:59.120
in Britain who will be able to sing Penitentiary
Blues with any credibility.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.290
[ Laughter ]

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:04.140
Because he's still writing to his brother
and this is still appearing on the pages of

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:09.410
the Melody Maker. He's like -- not only has
he played with Bunk Johnson's band, he's now

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:17.940
in jail in Louisiana like Lead Belly himself.
I mean, how great is this! So after 38 days,

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:23.880
they resolve the -- he was -- he has the problem
of how he gets home resolved for him when

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:30.210
he's deported on the SS United States of America,
which, at the time, has the blue ribbon for

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:36.080
landing crossings. So, having come over as
the second cook on an oil boat, he kind of

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:45.750
goes back in some style and he's met at the
boat train by his brother and a ready-made

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:52.070
band. He comes back to London like the Trad
Jazz Moses, down from the mountain to tell

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:59.720
it as it is. You know? And his brother has
pulled together a band led by Chris Barber

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:05.620
on trombone, has Monty Sunshine on clarinet,
Ron Bowden on drums, and includes Lonnie Donegan

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:15.220
on banjo. And they become the Ken Colyer Jazz
Men. And they instigate this breakdown session

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:23.040
as an integral part of what they do. But one
day they're doing a radio program for the

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:29.100
BBC and the rather observant BBC producer
notices that -- they decide to do some skiffle

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:34.150
songs. So they put down their brass instruments.
They reconfigure. Lonnie Donegan comes to

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:38.690
the mic. They have to set up the vocal mic.
Lonnie Donegan comes to the mic to sing. Colyer's

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:45.420
playing guitar. Barber plays the bass. Bill
Colyer plays a bit of washboard. And the producer

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:49.530
says, "Well, hang on a minute. Hang on a minute.
This is not the Ken Colyer Jaz Men and they're

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:53.820
definitely not playing jazz." So he says to
the band's manager, "Well, what is this? What

00:30:53.820 --> 00:31:00.330
is this music and who are -- you know -- who
is this band?" So Bill Colyer, his brother

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:07.960
-- Ken's brother -- says, "This is the Ken
Colyer Skiffle Group." And in that moment

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:14.160
he takes the meaning of the word, "Skiffle,"
and changes it completely to mean a sub-genre

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:20.760
of American roots music indigenous to the
United Kingdom.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.070
[ Laughter ]

00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:24.789
It can happen.

00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:25.789
[ Laughter ]

00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:34.260
It goes from being an event, a -- a house
party -- to actually being a type of music

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:42.491
played -- played in the UK. Why did he choose
the term, "Skiffle?" Obviously, he knows Dan

00:31:42.491 --> 00:31:46.340
Burley and his skiffle boys record. It was
very popular in the UK. The real reason I

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:51.590
suspect is because if Bill Colyer tried to
tell the BBC that he and his brother were

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:57.170
playing the blues, they would have been laughed
out the broadcasting house. All of the credibility

00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:00.640
that Ken got by going to New Orleans would
have gone down the tubes because everybody

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:06.511
knew in 1953 Great Britain that the blues
could only be played by old African American

00:32:06.511 --> 00:32:13.720
guys. Everyone knew that. So, instead, in
order to get to this music and to have the

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:21.160
-- the validity to be able to play this music,
they had to find a kind of -- another way.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:27.110
And it's really important that they found
a term that did have some roots in African

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.670
American culture. It's really, really important
to them. I mean, there's a few other words

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:34.080
he could have chose. He could have chose "jug
band." There were some elements of jug band

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:40.470
in skiffle. He could have chosen "spasm band"
because the spasm bands made their own instruments.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.580
But he chose skiffle -- he chose skiffle and
I like to think he chose skiffle because it

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:50.480
has the kind of automatic sound of a washboard
being scraped and cheap Czechoslovakian guitars

00:32:50.480 --> 00:33:01.660
being played not in tune. So that was -- that
was how skiffle got its name in the UK. Now,

00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:06.550
Ken Colyer was a -- you might have seen some
photo -- did -- you ran the photographs earlier.

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:11.260
You might have seen it was the guy wearing
the jacket, it had the word "Smile" on it

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:16.840
and had the biggest frown you've ever seen.
Ken -- Ken -- he's in the book. Ken was one

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:22.970
of those guys who frowned upon any modernity
music. When the band used to go outside the

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:29.210
London clubs and play to audiences that wanted
something familiar to dance to, Ken frowned

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:35.870
on that and nobody could frown like Ken Colyer.
He could have frowned for England if we had

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:38.900
had a frowning team. So --

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.900
[ Laughter ]

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:44.560
One of the things he really didn't like was
Lonnie Donegan. Lonnie Donegan was a sort

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:51.570
of -- he was already a star in his own mind
and him coming from the back of the band stand

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:56.450
where he played in the rhythm section with
the -- the drums and the bass to the front

00:33:56.450 --> 00:34:03.390
of the stage, he just owned the place. He
owned the place! And, unfortunately, Ken Colyer

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:07.850
had a bit of a chip on his shoulder about
this. So he went to Chris Barber and he said,

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:12.700
"I'm going to sack Donegan. I can't stand
him." And -- and, years later [laughing],

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:17.031
Chris Barber told me, "You see, that's no
grounds for sacking Lonnie Donegan. Nobody

00:34:17.031 --> 00:34:18.730
could stand him."

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:19.929
[ Laughter ]

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:28.120
So -- but Barber, being the noble soul that
he is, he said to Colyer, "I'm sorry, Ken,

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.500
this is a collective. This band is a collective
and we have to make collective decisions."

00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:37.259
So they had a band meeting, took a vote, and
they sacked Ken Colyer.

00:34:37.259 --> 00:34:38.389
[ Laughter ]

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:44.490
And Ken Colyer [laughing] -- Ken Colyer went
off and formed his jazz band with a new bunch

00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:50.190
of guys and Chris Barber formed his own jazz
band, got a new trumpet player. And in 1954

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:59.780
they made rival records for Decca. Both featured
skiffle songs -- a couple of skiffle songs.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:05.640
Colyer's band lacked that cutting everything.
Colyer himself saying he was not a great -- he

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:09.820
wasn't a great singer. He was a great trumpet
player. He wasn't a great singer. Alexis Korner

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.300
was in his skiffle band. He played the mandolin
in Ken Colyer's skiffle band. Alexis Korner

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:20.330
who went on to found the British R&amp;B boom
by running a club from which the Rolling Stones

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:25.080
and the Yardbirds and many of those bands
emerged, the [inaudible] club in the early

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:34.040
'60s. But Barber -- Barber was trying to push
the envelope as much as he could with his

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:41.210
own little jazz band. And, on the 13th of
July, 1954, he was booked to record an album

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:48.590
of New Orleans jazz called New Orleans Joys
for the Decca label. And it soon became clear

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:56.160
that they didn't have enough new material
to live up to Chris Barber's vision. And the

00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:05.230
producer, Hugh Mendel was aghast at this because
he'd made Decca put up 30 pounds to -- which

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:10.780
is not a lot with the exchange rate the way
it is at the moment I'll tell ya -- the session

00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:16.090
was going to crash when Donegan said, "Well,
why don't we record a couple of skiffle songs?"

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.780
because they needed eight tracks and they
only had six. So the producer says, "I don't

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:28.600
care what you do. I just need -- [inaudible]
with enough tracks." So Barber picked up the

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:35.060
double bass. Donegan got on the guitar and
the telephoned Beryl Bryden who was Britain's

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:43.580
premiere washboard player. And she came down
with a musical washboard. And in short time

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:49.640
they recorded "Rock Island Line", Lead Belly's
"Rock Island Line", and John Henry. And the

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:58.530
album was released in 1955 and got some very,
very nice reviews in the context of New Orleans

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:06.110
jazz. And that was kind of it for a while.
The jazz band carried on playing and they

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:17.100
carried on doing their skiffle breakdowns
and -- and towards the end of 1955 someone

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:22.300
at Decca Records decides to release "Rock
Island Line" as a single. It's not absolutely

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:28.000
clear why that is, but "Rock Island Line"
is released as a single in December -- November

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.590
1955. And it appears in the charts -- the
first chart of 1956. Lonnie Donegan, "Rock

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:40.310
Island Line" appears in the charts. And I
think in order to -- you've probably heard

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:43.860
all these songs in the warmup music, but I
think in the context of what we're doing now,

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:52.520
I think we should have a listen to "Rock Island
Line". Gus, if you could play track five,

00:37:52.520 --> 00:38:22.540
please, that would be great.

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.540
[ Music ]

00:38:23.540 --> 00:40:16.300
There he 

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:24.410
was gone. Lonnie Donegan, "Rock Island Line"
recorded in July 13th, 1954. Some context.

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:30.410
Just one month before Lonnie Donegan recorded
that song, the rationing of food ended in

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:36.110
Britain. It'd begun in 1940 during the war
and continued after the war. Rationing of

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:42.370
clothing, rationing of petrol, rationing of
food. What that meant was that if a child

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:49.260
was born in 1940, let's call him John Lennon,
he would have to wait until he was 14 years

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:53.680
old before he could go into a sweet shop and
buy what he wanted. Sweets were on the ration.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:41:02.600
Cakes were on the ration. Childhood was on
the ration. And what happens in 1954, '55

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:08.430
is that first generation of war babies leaves
school and they find work pretty easily. There's

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:15.252
a lot of semi-skilled labor work there particularly
with young women going to work in factories.

00:41:15.252 --> 00:41:19.090
And they're earning good money, sometimes
more than their parents. And they only have

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:26.050
one expense, which is giving some housekeeping
to their mums. So what happens in '54, '55

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:33.210
is sales of cosmetics, of records, of clothing
start to rocket. And for the first time a

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:41.750
group of consumers and a cultural group become
visible in the UK and that group are teenagers.

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:47.380
Now, there were teenagers, of course, between
the war, but they tended to be -- the ones

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:52.370
that were visible to us -- tended to be middle
class and upper class teenagers, the flappers,

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:59.880
who were known to the -- to papers. There
was no teen culture between the wars. What

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:05.000
happens in '54, '55 is this cohort of working
class -- and it is exclusively working class

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.080
kids because the middle class and upper class
kids went to university and tended to go into

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:16.900
professions that deferred earning until adulthood
such as medicine and the law. So these kids,

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:21.930
they have never been visible before. The music
that's been made available for them has been

00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:28.970
novelty songs for children, How Much Is That
Doggie in the Window. And the BBC just doesn't

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:36.100
really sort of cater for that kind of demographic.
They don't -- they don't really see them.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:41.080
And the context of what was happening -- Gus,
if you could just play track 21, if you wouldn't

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:45.220
mind. This is a song that was number one when
"Rock Island Line" was recorded.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:46.260
[ Music ]

00:42:46.260 --> 00:43:02.330
Don't worry. We won't have to hear all of
it. Just to give you a flavor.

00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:03.910
[ Music ]

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:11.820
That'll do, Gus. Thank you.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.400
[ Laughter ]

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:20.370
Culture -- culture as such was mediated by
the BBC. The BBC was the only broadcaster

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:25.590
and the only TV station. There was no commercial
broadcasting, no commercial TV station until

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:32.660
1955. You could hear rock-'n'-roll if you
listened to Luxemburg, Radio Luxemburg, which

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:37.410
was coming out of Europe, or the American
Forces Network, which was audible if you lived

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:45.250
near an American base. But really the BBC
had a dead hand on culture. So, in 1955, when

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:49.460
on the back of the popularity of the movie
Blackboard Jungle, Rock Around the Clock gets

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:57.711
into the charts. The BBC doesn't really play
it. There's a program called Family Favorites,

00:43:57.711 --> 00:44:03.310
which is a request program and there's a chance,
if you listen to that, enough people might

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.180
have requested Rock Around the Clock that
they might play it and you might hear it.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:19.340
So what happens is when "Rock Island Line"
comes out, a new -- a new idea comes forward,

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:25.600
you know, because obviously having heard Rock
Around the Clock and also in 1955 there's

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:31.110
a number of what we refer to in my country,
what they referred to at the time, is hillbilly

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:38.190
songs, get into the charts. This will be Slim
Whitman. It will be Tennessee Ernie Ford.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:42.430
And these are kind of coming in on the back
of the arrival of commercial telly and their

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:48.110
propensity to buy cowboy series from the United
States of America and broadcast them. And

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:55.070
so this -- kind of these figures are emerging
in our culture playing guitars because the

00:44:55.070 --> 00:45:02.520
guitar is not really an integral part of British
culture in the first half of the 20th century.

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:11.120
There are some guitars played in the musical,
but really if you heard or saw a guitar on

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:15.280
the telly or on the radio, it was often in
the context of an outsider character. It would

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:23.200
be a singing cowboy, a bluesman, or a calypsonian,
calypso was the identifying culture of the

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:32.500
first wave of migration to our country beginning
in 1948 from the Caribbean. And although calypso

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:39.510
comes from Trinidad, it kind of became the
identifying culture of the West Indian migration

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:45.380
when the West Indies defeated England in a
cricket match for the first time in 1950 and

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:51.230
a couple of calypso songs got into the charts.
So really it was an outsider's instrument,

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:59.970
the guitar. And Donegan is -- doesn't look
like a British singer. You know, all of our

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:06.220
singers -- one of our singers had a hit just
before Donegan put out with the theme title

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:11.060
from the movie, The Man from Laramie. It was
a cover of a Jimmy Stewart song. But even

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:16.880
on the leave of that record, the singer was
wearing a dinner jacket and a bowtie. That's

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.790
the image. And there's Donegan, doesn't even
have a normal tie on and he's kind of singing

00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:25.880
that song, he's lashing at that song like
it's -- you know, he's on a runaway train.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:34.820
It's kind of getting away from him. And the
most amazing thing in it, it transpires that

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:40.060
he was born in Glasgow and he's lived in London
most of his life. So when he goes on tour

00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:48.440
in 1956 -- in late 1956 -- he's bringing a
message that's probably the most revolutionary

00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:55.590
that British youth were ever -- ever learned
and that is, a, you don't have to be a trained

00:46:55.590 --> 00:47:01.340
musician to make music, and b, you don't have
to be an American to sing American songs.

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:07.900
And this is -- this is a startling experience
for a lot of young people. Van Morrison is

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:13.030
12 years old when he hears Donegan singing
"Rock Island Line". He's familiar with Lead

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:19.140
Belly -- Lead Belly's version -- because his
father collects blues and jazz records from

00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:25.730
an importer, Atlantic Records, in Belfast.
But his own aspirations to play music focused

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:29.581
on Irish folk music. He can imagine himself
playing that. It could never have imagined

00:47:29.581 --> 00:47:36.060
himself singing "Rock Island Line" because
it's -- it's a blues song. He hears Donegan

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.790
and he's -- you know, he's awake. He suddenly
recognizes that he can sing these songs as

00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:43.670
well. If Donegan can sing them, so can he.
So he forms a band. He forms his own little

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:51.471
skiffle band. And it's, you know, startling
to think that someone as young as 12 could

00:47:51.471 --> 00:47:59.570
be moved by that. But George Harrison was
13 when he first saw Donegan in Liverpool

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:06.070
at the Empire in November, 1956. He went every
night to see Donegan. Donegan was there for

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:10.230
a week. It's a variety circuit. It's the only
circuit there was and it's like vaudeville

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:15.070
circuit and they played two shows five nights
a week. George Harrison went every night.

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:19.970
He was 13. Paul McCartney was 14. He went
one night and he came home and he told his

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:24.460
dad he didn't want to play trumpet anymore,
he wanted to play guitar. And it's not recorded

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:29.310
whether John Lennon went, but it's significant
that within two weeks of Donegan playing in

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:34.520
Liverpool, Lennon had formed his own skiffle
band, The Quarrymen. And it's the age of these

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:40.510
kids that is really so significant because
it's something that never happened again in

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:47.640
our culture, such a level. You know, skiffle
was not like a normal scene of music, you

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:53.380
know, professional musicians deciding to play
some music. It's much more akin to the fidget

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.940
spinners craze, which is currently --

00:48:54.940 --> 00:48:56.220
[ Laughter ]

00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:01.970
I'm afraid it is. It's a complete -- skiffle
was a playground craze. It was a playground

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:06.750
craze. Every sentient schoolboy in the UK
learned to play the three chords necessary

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:13.480
to play all of Donegan's repertoire. You know,
it was -- they were basically finding old

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:18.930
guitars that were knocking around. They were
importing them from -- from Czechoslovakia.

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:24.700
Sales of acoustic guitars in Britain in three
years went from 5,000 a year to 250,000 a

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:29.670
year. It's like the Cabbage Patch dolls. You
know this? It is! There are stories in the

00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:34.230
book of, you know, guys saying, "You know,
I had a man in here the other day waving around

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:37.470
a 10 pound note asking for a guitar and I
couldn't find one. I couldn't get one for

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:43.619
him." You know, it's not just a small group
of people playing music that spreads. This

00:49:43.619 --> 00:49:48.970
is like -- this is like absolute wildfire.
Why would it spread so quickly? What could

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:56.390
possibly be driving something like that? My
sense of is it's to do with the BBC and Rock

00:49:56.390 --> 00:50:03.700
Around the Clock. When the BBC refused to
play Rock Around the Clock, those kids said,

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:08.620
"You're going to ration rock-'n'-roll? You're
going to ration bloody rock-'n'-roll? You

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:12.760
know what you can do with that, mate?" And
they went out and made their own music. They

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:19.170
went out and made their own sound. They got
together. They borrowed their mom's washboards.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:26.710
They made a thing called a tea chest bass.
Now, a tea chest bass -- a tea chest is a

00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:34.850
kind of meter high box, meter by a meter,
by a meter square box that we used to import

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:41.760
tea leaves into the UK with. There was -- everyone
had one in their house because they were used

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:48.300
for storage boxes. So everybody had one. To
open them, they literally saw -- there's metal

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:52.380
rims around all the edges to make it sturdy.
And they just saw the top -- saw a hole in

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:56.830
the top and take the top out in one piece.
But if you then turn the box upside down and

00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:01.650
add a broom pole to the side and draw a piece
of twine to the center of what was the base

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:07.800
that's now the top of the tea chest, you can
kind of get a duhn-duhn-duhn kind of sound.

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:12.050
If you look -- the guy lying on his back on
the right there, you can just see the twine

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:16.380
of the -- of the tea chest bass. And that
flat line under his hand, that's the broom

00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:21.010
pole. And the reason he's lying on his back
is because that's what Bill Haley's bass player

00:51:21.010 --> 00:51:29.100
did. He'd lay on his back and lay on top of
his instrument and so they -- they went out

00:51:29.100 --> 00:51:36.369
and learned to -- the three chords necessary
to play Donegan's repertoire. And Donegan

00:51:36.369 --> 00:51:42.922
continued to have hits and other artists had
hits. But really -- really what it -- it was

00:51:42.922 --> 00:51:48.869
this kind of underground things. It was these
kind of kids. You know? And what's significant

00:51:48.869 --> 00:51:52.230
I think and different from the experience
here in the United States of America is I

00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:59.180
can't think of a musical genre that has had
the majority of its performers under the age

00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:04.060
of 18. I don't think that happened here. Yes,
there were people playing folk music here.

00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:07.980
Of course there were. There were people playing
the blues here. But it wasn't -- it wasn't

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:17.370
absolute, you know, sub-teen grassroots and
so huge as it was in my country. Donegan has

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:24.790
a hit in the United States of America in the
summer of 1956, "Rock Island Line". It gets

00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:31.510
to number eight in the Billboard Charts. It
appears on the Ed Sullivan show and does a

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.430
skit with Ronald Reagan.

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:35.640
[ Laughter ]

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:43.970
And he tours around the country. He ends up
on a kind of rock-'n'-roll tour -- a package

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:50.280
tour -- headlined by Chuck Berry. But he has
a bit of a problem -- a ban on musicians traveling

00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:55.391
that ends in 1955 finally comes to an end,
which allows him to travel. But he's -- he's

00:52:55.391 --> 00:53:01.520
like me, Lonnie Donegan. He's not really musical.
He doesn't write notation. You know? He's

00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.940
kind of that -- so he's got no notation and
so he's doing like six shows a day starting

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:11.050
at 11 O'clock in the morning in cinemas playing
with a pit orchestra that doesn't really know

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:18.500
what he's talking about. When they get to
Detroit, one of the other bands on the -- on

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.790
the bill, the Rock-'n'-Roll Trio, that's Johnny
Burnette and Dorsey Burnette and Burlison,

00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:30.750
probably the greatest rockabilly band outside
of Elvis, Scotty, and Bill. They're also playing.

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:34.830
And Johnny Burnette says, "Listen, man, why
don't you let us accompany with you those

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.520
songs? We -- you know, we can play that stuff.
Why don't you let us play rather than these

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:43.980
old guys?" And Donegan being Donegan says,
"Oh, I don't know if I can afford that." Johnny

00:53:43.980 --> 00:53:49.750
Burnette says, "It's not about money, man.
It's about music." So for a few weeks on the

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:56.410
rest of that tour in Detroit and around the
Midwest, skiffle meets rockabilly as an equal

00:53:56.410 --> 00:54:01.430
and recognizes that they are coming from the
same kind of place. Unfortunately, there's

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:05.770
no recordings of this. It's a real shame.
But I think if you're looking for something

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:12.060
in the United States of America that would
be similar in its shape and duration, it would

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:18.670
be rockabilly. Rockabilly is superseded by
rock-'n'-roll, Elvis at RCI and all that kind

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:24.560
of stuff in the same way that skiffle is superseded
by British Elvis impersonation -- impersonators

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:33.700
by the middle of 1958. But here's a really
interesting fact. Donegan records "Rock Island

00:54:33.700 --> 00:54:39.340
Line" 30th of July, 1954, speeds up an old
blues song and saves a recording section that's

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:45.150
gone absolutely nowhere. Just a week before
in Memphis, Tennessee, Sam Phillips at Sun

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:50.930
Records is trying to coax an Ernest Tubb song
out of a rather recalcitrant truck driver

00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:58.530
and it's not really going anywhere. So he
says, "Look. Just take a break." And this

00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:01.900
kid who's a bit sort of nervous, he picks
up an acoustic guitar and he starts playing

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:06.700
a goofy version of a song called "That's All
Right Momma." And the bass player, he thinks

00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:10.900
it's very funny so he joins in with a goofy
bass line and the guitar player joins in too

00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:15.820
and Sam Phillips in the control room sticks
his head around the door and says, "What are

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.040
you doing?" And the guy said, "I don't know
what we're doing." So he says, "Well, back

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:22.660
it up. See if you can find a place to start
and let's record it." And that is how Elvis

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:28.990
Presley makes his first recording. And so
the fact that Donegan and Elvis should be

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:35.670
so close in time that it should be almost
simultaneous -- almost simultaneous -- says

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:39.030
something about what was happening in your
country and what was happening in my country.

00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:46.640
The -- the connection there between guitar
led music -- because I do think that for the

00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:54.020
skifflers back in the -- in the 1950s, if
they saw a sign tonight, "skiffle," they wouldn't

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:58.180
necessarily think it would just be Lonnie
Donegan songs. It would be guitar led music,

00:55:58.180 --> 00:56:02.530
music played on guitars. It could be blues.
It could be country. It could be calypso.

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:06.760
It could be English folk songs. It could be
anything. It represents the coming of the

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:14.340
guitar for that generation. And what the guitar
represents to them is a break with the past,

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:20.110
a break with the past. The guitar was so unfamiliar
to that generation, Bill Drummond, the genius

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:24.470
behind the KLF, read the book, told me he
first saw a skiffle band when he was six years

00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:30.930
old. He thought the guitar player had a hole
in his stomach. Now, you could not get to

00:56:30.930 --> 00:56:34.750
six today without seeing someone playing a
guitar. It would be impossible in our culture,

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:41.350
but in British culture in those days, the
guitar represented a break with the -- the

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:47.060
generational curve. It was their way -- those
kids' way of saying, "Old timers, forget it.

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:51.750
This is something new. We're -- we're moving
away from what was before. This is our year

00:56:51.750 --> 00:57:01.991
zero." And it's because of the -- the youth
of these people is what is significant. It's

00:57:01.991 --> 00:57:10.320
not what they did in '56 and '57 and '58.
It's what they do in '61, '62, '63, '64. You

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:18.980
know? Because what happens is when your young
men, their contemporaries, are learning to

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:28.040
play guitar when they're 16, 17, 18, our teenagers
are already in Hamburg. They're already playing

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:32.000
rock-'n'-roll. And the knock on effect to
that is when the Beatles break into the American

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.000
charts in January 1964 and have their first
number one, there's a whole phalanx of British

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:43.410
bands who have been playing seven, eight years
ready to come in behind them. Skiffle is the

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:50.100
nursery for the British Invasion of the American
charts. And between January 1964 and December

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:55.550
1965 there's a British band at number one
in the American charts for 52 weeks out of

00:57:55.550 --> 00:58:00.920
104. And every single one of them began as
a skiffle band, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones,

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:06.370
the Tremolos, the Animals, Chad and Jeremy.
The only exception is Petula Clark. Petula

00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:13.960
Clark is an exception because, a, she -- when
"Rock Island Line" came out, she had already

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:20.840
released a dozen singles under her own name
and, b, she's a girl. For some reason -- although

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:26.040
there were a number of female performers on
the records -- Nancy Whiskey singing "Freight

00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:34.370
Train" you probably heard earlier. And the
City Ramblers, they were Shirley Bland and

00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:45.710
Hilda Simms. There are very few photographs
of young women in the records -- of young

00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:50.180
women in skiffle bands because that's -- that's
all that's left really because these young

00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:53.180
bands, they were so young they didn't make
any records. They are kind of like the soft

00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:57.180
parts of a fossil, you can't see them. You
know? It's what they do later you see. So

00:58:57.180 --> 00:59:02.609
what's left is literally thousands of photos
like this one, which is a stock photo from

00:59:02.609 --> 00:59:09.050
a newspaper archive. Newspaper photographers
loved skiffle bands. And I've seen a lot a

00:59:09.050 --> 00:59:13.400
lot of them and the only one I saw that was
an all-women's band was actually some Irish

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.070
travelers with their mom who had dressed up
and played skiffle just for the occasion.

00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:21.630
So -- but the thing is young women were absolutely
crucial to the whole thing because I think

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:27.670
it was young women's determination to create
their own social space that really made it

00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:32.450
possible for the skiffle kids to get out of
the church hall, and the scout [inaudible],

00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:39.730
and the school gymnasium and go to somewhere
where there was actually sort of teen interaction

00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:46.430
because the young women who suddenly inherited
this incredible spending power, they needed

00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:53.280
their own social space. They didn't want to
go in the tea rooms, the Lyons corner house

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:57.980
where they stewed all the food where their
mothers used to take them. They couldn't socially

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:04.940
go into a pub on their own. So they colonized
the brand new cappuccino bars that had started

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:11.430
opening up across the UK in the mid-50s. And
this is very, very significant because the

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:17.200
cappuccino bar offered a level of sophistication
that wasn't there in the rest of the culture.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:25.580
And by that, I mean they looked towards Paris,
towards Milan, towards Rome, towards Madrid.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:30.910
You know, this was Jean Seberg rather than
Marilyn Monroe. This was a distinctive determination

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:35.280
to find their own culture. So these women
-- and, you know, they had these beautiful

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:41.720
high-tech gadget machines, these new gadget
machines, and to top it all off, the coffee

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.999
bars tended to be covered in this wonderful
new material, Formica.

01:00:45.999 --> 01:00:47.120
[ Laughter ]

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:56.210
And the sexual frisson of all that lead inexorably
to the arrival of young men playing guitars

01:00:56.210 --> 01:01:01.030
and skiffle. Of course! Where else would you
go? Go where the young women are. I mean you

01:01:01.030 --> 01:01:04.340
have a choice. You're a British kid, you have
a choice. You can either go out and play football

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:08.100
with your mates or get a guitar and go down
to the coffee bar where there's girls. It's

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:12.080
-- you know? My sense is that it was young
women that were deriving it. Young women wanted

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:17.070
to jive often when one another. The footage
from the day -- the documentary newsroom footage

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:21.050
from the day often shows young women jiving
with one another. They practiced in their

01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:24.340
rooms. My aunties told me that they spent
all their time practicing jiving with one

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:30.440
another only to find that men were useless
at it. Teddy Boys were useless at it so they'd

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:35.710
jive with one another. And there's great footage
of grumpy Teds all standing round while young

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:40.200
women jived to trad jazz. I mean it's -- I
think -- I wish there'd been more time for

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:45.800
me in the book to follow that idea because
I think there's a whole story there of the

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:56.130
-- how young women drove teenage culture during
that period. But the -- I think the crux of

01:01:56.130 --> 01:02:04.860
the matter with regard to that generation
of teenagers is that they used American roots

01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:12.390
music for a very specific purpose. When the
folk revival became visible in the United

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:19.160
States of America in 1959 when the Kingston
Trio, originally a calypso band into Kingston,

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:26.200
Jamaica -- not Kingston upon Thames, a suburb
of Surrey -- when the Kingston Trio had a

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:32.869
hit with Tom Dooley, the folk revival became
visible culturally here in the United States

01:02:32.869 --> 01:02:37.599
of America. And bands like the New Lost City
Ramblers, who were contemporaries of Donegan

01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:46.230
and Colyer, they went back to Appalachia to
discover the likes of Doc Watson and Roscoe

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:51.410
Holcomb. They were -- they were escaping from
contemporary American culture back to something

01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:59.450
that they felt was more true and pure. The
skiffle kids were doing the absolute opposite.

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:05.990
They were using -- paradoxically using American
roots music to make the future happen, to

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:13.230
escape a past in which they were wearing hand-me-downs,
where their culture was mediated by bureaucrats,

01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:21.330
in which their freedom was circumscribed by
parents who -- whose experience in the war

01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:28.970
had led them to lower their expectations somewhat.
And Donegan, he breaks the fourth wall of

01:03:28.970 --> 01:03:36.980
British pop culture and he says to these kids,
"Take this guitar and build the future with

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:42.550
it." And they built a bridge to the future
so strong that it crossed the Atlantic and

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:48.220
went to the top of the American charts. And
I would argue that we are still living with

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:59.580
the ramifications of what happened in the
skiffle boom. Thank you very much.

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:07.180
[ Applause ]

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:21.170
Now we -- we have time for some Q and A. I'm
happy to take questions about anything so

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:22.170
please --

01:04:22.170 --> 01:04:24.890
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much.

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:26.220
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: My pleasure.

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:31.070
&gt;&gt; I also appreciate the music that you do
and I was wondering, you did some beautiful

01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:38.800
work on Mermaid Avenue with all those Woody
Guthrie lyrics and I'm thinking of Walt Whitman

01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:39.800
and --

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.059
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Ingrid Bergman.

01:04:41.059 --> 01:04:42.059
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:04:42.059 --> 01:04:43.059
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yep.

01:04:43.059 --> 01:04:50.960
&gt;&gt; And Ingrid Bergman. How did you piece together
those lyrics? How did you get those lyrics?

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.150
And how did you get those beautiful melodies?

01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:57.570
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, you got to understand
the material that we were working with was

01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:04.150
so rich and so sturdy that you -- you know,
you could throw anything at them. "Way Over

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:08.140
Yonder" in the Minor Key you may be familiar
with from the album. I've played that like

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:14.310
a rockabilly song. It still works. The lyrics
are so -- are so good, you can do -- you can

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:18.560
do anything with them. In fact, we did. One
of the great things about Mermaid Avenue,

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:23.720
working with Wilco is every day it was like
going to the dressing up box. "Who are we

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:28.110
going to be today?" You know? "Let's be Tom
Waste today and play all the songs like Tom

01:05:28.110 --> 01:05:33.940
Waste. Let's be The Band. Let's be, you know,
"Times They Are A Changin'" Bob Dylan." One

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.070
day Wilco decided to be Cheap Trick.

01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:37.070
[ Laughter ]

01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:38.761
We didn't get much done that day, but --

01:05:38.761 --> 01:05:39.761
[ Laughter ]

01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:46.369
You know? So really -- I mean, it was -- I
don't know. There was one -- there was one

01:05:46.369 --> 01:05:51.780
song called "Go Down to the Water," which
I knew Nora loved. It was about her mother

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:57.119
and her elder sister, Kathy, who sadly died
as a child in a fire. And Woody's writing

01:05:57.119 --> 01:06:03.240
to them and their standing on the beach at
Coney Island where Woody and Marjorie's ashes

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:09.380
are scattered. And he's talking about them
going down to the water and watching the convoy

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:15.210
that he's part of depart to D-Day. It's a
very, very powerful song and I knew it was

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:19.770
very important to Nora. And I couldn't get
a handle on it. I couldn't get something on

01:06:19.770 --> 01:06:28.270
it that did it justice. And I'd written 20
lyrics by -- 20 of the songs, but I was stuck

01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:33.500
with this "Go Down to the Water." I was watching
the TV at home and there was an advert for

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:39.080
Irish Bah. And the soundtrack was Shane MacGowan
from The Pogues singing "She Moves Through

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:44.750
the Fair." And I jumped up from the telly,
ran into the office, pulled out our Lyric,

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:50.000
and sang it to the tune of "She Moves Through
the Fair." And I came back and sat down on

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.970
the sofa next to my missus and I says, "21."

01:06:53.970 --> 01:06:54.970
[ Laughter ]

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:59.550
So I don't know where it come from, mate.
I really don't know. But all I can tell you

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:04.840
is the material we were working with is so
great we were basically -- I'm sure Jeff and

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:09.750
the guys feel the same -- we were merely providing
the frame for those -- for those works of

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:11.270
art so that it could be hung up on the wall
and everyone could admire them. There seems

01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:16.020
to be a gentleman at the front.

01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:24.020
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thanks. Are there any scenes out there
these days that interest you or excite you

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:29.780
that make you think it could be where the
next wave of potentially important music could

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:30.780
come from?

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.560
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah. Are you familiar with
grime music at all? It's a kind of -- it's

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:42.330
urban music from the UK. It's a mixture of
hip-hop and Jamaica dance hall. And during

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:48.690
the recent general election, the grime artists,
as a genre, came out in support of Jeremy

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:52.150
Corbyn, the leader of the labor party. I haven't
seen that happen since we've been doing red

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:56.640
wedge back in the day. And even then we kept
him at arm's length. But the grime guys, they

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:03.849
didn't. They really went for it. And I think,
one, I'm really pleased about that. Two, I

01:08:03.849 --> 01:08:09.880
think they're using music in the way it was
used predominately in the 20th century as

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:14.570
a way of communicating with people who won't
listen to them because they talk to their

01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:19.060
own community that way, but it's also their
only opportunity to get in your timeline and

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:22.869
my timeline. Mainstream pop doesn't do that
anymore. Mainstream pop has other ways of

01:08:22.869 --> 01:08:27.520
getting in your face. Young people now -- I'm
sorry. Young people have other ways of getting

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:31.630
in your face that don't need to do what I
did when I was 19, which is if I wanted my

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:37.349
voice heard, I had to learn to play guitar,
do gigs, and write songs. But the grime guys

01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:42.410
are still doing that. And it kind of -- it's
the answer to the question about where is

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:47.480
all the political music these days? It's right
in front of your face. If your problem is

01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:50.160
you're looking -- not you personally. Don't
take this personal. I'm generalizing. I'm

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.160
sorry.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.160
[ Laughter ]

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:56.989
I just realized -- I'm sorry. If your problem
is that you want political music and you're

01:08:56.989 --> 01:09:03.520
looking for white boys with guitars, Ed Sheeran
is over there, mate. OK? Sorry. It's just

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.340
-- I'll get asked -- not this particular question,
but people often say to me, "Where's all the

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:12.870
political music?" I'm like, "just Google,
'grime 4 -- the number 4 -- Corbyn.'" Those

01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:16.950
guys are right on it. They are right on it!
Just like punk. Just like skiffle. You know?

01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:22.200
Making their own culture for their community
and doing something authentic. It really -- it

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.400
really cheered me up. I'm sure there's an
equivalent in the United States of America,

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.849
I just don't know about it. Want a secondary,
mate?

01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:32.569
&gt;&gt; Yeah. As this gentleman just asked, why
isn't there more of a connection, though,

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:35.640
between political music around the world in
your view?

01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:41.239
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Now -- you mean as compared
to the 20th century? Music's lost its vanguard

01:09:41.239 --> 01:09:45.600
role in culture. It's as simple as that really.
You know, there's so many different ways.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:49.029
If you're pissed off about the world, not
there are so many different ways you can articulate

01:09:49.029 --> 01:09:54.400
that. You know, you can sort of stir up a
Twitter storm, start a Facebook page, write

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.960
a blog. You can make a bloody movie on one
of these things and edit it. I mean, you know,

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.320
why go to all the trouble to learn an instrument
and have to stand up in front of people, which

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:10.239
is quite a high bar, you know? It allows -- the
internet and the social media allow more people

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:16.990
to participate in the -- in the 20th century,
there was really only one social medium and

01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:22.210
that was music and it had to encapsulate everything,
every experience, love, politics, football,

01:10:22.210 --> 01:10:26.620
whatever. You know? And we had, you know,
in my country, four weekly music papers in

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:32.760
which to fresh out the ups and downs of that
and communicate with one another along those

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.440
lines. That's not happening in music anymore
apart from in places like grime. And I was

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:40.790
going to say, I'm sure there's scenes in the
US that are like that. But I'm encouraged

01:10:40.790 --> 01:10:47.230
that more people are able to, you know -- through
social media, more people are able to contribute

01:10:47.230 --> 01:10:52.540
to the -- to the discussion. But no one is
ever going to ask you to tour America reading

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:55.910
out your tweets.

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:57.040
[ Laughter ]

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.530
So there's a catch. Sir?

01:10:58.530 --> 01:11:03.500
&gt;&gt; So I'm just curious. You're a little younger
than these skiffle musicians and stuff. Can

01:11:03.500 --> 01:11:07.679
you draw a line from this to you or how you
were drawn to this subject?

01:11:07.679 --> 01:11:14.540
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, of course. I was born
in peak skiffle, 1957. Peak skiffle is actually

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:19.840
the 6th of July, 1957. We just passed the
60th anniversary of peak skiffle.

01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:21.100
[ Laughter ]

01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:26.520
That's the day in which John Lennon's band,
The Quarrymen, are playing at Woolton Church

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:33.710
Fete and Paul McCartney turns up to come along
and join the band. Just an interesting aside

01:11:33.710 --> 01:11:37.490
-- I will come back to your question -- an
interesting aside, at the height of Beatlemania

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:43.130
here in the United States of America, a DJ
from Philadelphia went to Hamburg to find

01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:49.540
out about the Beatles' experiences there and
he met a German wrestler who had been given

01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:54.330
the job of looking after the Beatles and keeping
them out of trouble. And he said to this wrestler,

01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:59.110
"What were they like when they first came
to Hamburg?" And the guy says, "[in German

01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:02.180
accent] Ah! They played too much of that washboard
music."

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.460
[ Laughter ]

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:07.220
He said [laughing] -- he said, "[in German
accent] British bands, they think Lonnie Donegan

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:11.860
is Elvis!" And the implications of that -- apart
from the fact I don't do a very good German

01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:17.750
accent [laughter] -- the implication of that
is that the Beatles were still a skiffle band

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:21.860
when they got to Hamburg. You know? They were
still basically the three guitar players from

01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:28.860
the Quarrymen. So, you know, it's -- it's
not something that just ends in 1958. It ends

01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:34.940
in 1977 when the first generation of British
musicians appears that were -- never played

01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:39.480
skiffle. Right up to there and there are still
artists -- you know, Ian Hunter from Mott

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:43.870
the Hoople and those kind of guys -- they're
still emerging all the way up to '77. But

01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:49.460
it's my generation, the punk rockers, who
are really the first cohort to not have roots

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:56.810
in skiffle. But, incidental -- interestingly,
rather -- skiffle is -- has many similarities

01:12:56.810 --> 01:13:00.870
with punk rock, the most obvious one being
the punk rock slogan, "here's three chords,

01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:06.390
now form a band." You know? That's exactly
the same as with skiffle. You know, there

01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:11.900
were -- there were -- you know, some of the
skiffle bands made Flexi Discs in the way

01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:17.190
that punk bands did. There were skiffle fanzines
that people wrote themselves and sold at gigs.

01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:22.730
There are many similarities. And if you want
talk about DIY music, well, these guys were

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:26.460
making their instruments with stuff they bought
in a hardware store. How DIY do you want it

01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:31.470
to get? You know, I mean? So -- but really
I think the most powerful connection for me

01:13:31.470 --> 01:13:40.230
we skiffle is that punk was a music that kind
of empowered you to make your own music. You

01:13:40.230 --> 01:13:44.250
know? That was the thing about skiffle. You
don't wait for someone to say, "You can make

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:49.050
music." You just go and do it and skiffle
-- you know, that is the essence of skiffle.

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:55.070
And I think being able to see that period
through the prism of my own experience in

01:13:55.070 --> 01:14:01.820
skiffle allowed me to not only understand
better how the scene might develop, but also

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:07.020
to communicate it to a generation younger
than myself who have no reference points in

01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:14.900
the early '50s. So there's quite a few references
to punk rock in the book as a way of trying

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:21.430
to marry them up because I think skiffle should
have the same credibility as punk. It doesn't.

01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:28.050
It doesn't have very much credibility at all
and the reason for that is that in 1967, pop

01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:34.270
turns into rock. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts
Club Band is released, Rolling Stone magazine

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:41.030
appears, beards are grown [laughter], and
stroked [laughter]. And if you're a -- if

01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:49.340
you're a British rock star -- let's say you're
Jimmy Page and Rolling Stone asks, "Who first

01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:55.190
inspired you to play guitar?" You're not go
to say Chas McDevitt and Nancy Whiskey are

01:14:55.190 --> 01:15:00.670
you? You're going to say Chuck Berry, Elvis
Presley, Buddy Holly. Yet, if you look on

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:07.239
YouTube, there's a fabulous clip of a 14-year-old
Jimmy Page on a BBC TV program playing a song

01:15:07.239 --> 01:15:12.270
called "Momma Don't Allow No Skiffle Playing
Around Here." And when he's interviewed by

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:17.130
the avuncular BBC presenter who asks him if
he wants to be a skiffle guitarist when he

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:21.620
grows up, he says, "No," he wants to find
a cure for cancer. But, hey, you can't say

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:23.690
he didn't have ambition, can you?

01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:24.690
[ Laughter ]

01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:32.250
So that's the -- it's that -- I think what
happens is when rock becomes serious, skiffle

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:37.020
becomes the embarrassing photo in the school
yearbook and gets -- and gets put in the attic.

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:41.320
Some people remember. Some people never forget
the debt they own Donegan, Van Morrison being

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:48.110
one of them, that recorded with Donegan. And
every now and then you get a hint of what

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:57.910
happened. George Harrison was asked if the
Beatles were influenced by the blues and he

01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:04.210
said, "Yeah, of course we were. No Lead Belly,
no Lonnie Donegan. No Lonnie Donegan, no Beatles."

01:16:04.210 --> 01:16:09.500
And, yet, that quote often appears -- and
he says, "Therefore, no Lead Belly, no Beatles,"

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.750
and that quote usually appears as, "No Lead
Belly, no Beatles." Donegan is written out

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:19.950
partly by journalists who were there at the
time who were very sniffy about skiffle. And,

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:23.670
interestingly, the only sniffy response I've
got to the book was from a guy who was there

01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:31.440
at the time. And, you know -- and it's something
that that time struggles still to overcome.

01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:37.950
You know? Because -- it's understandable.
Rock-'n'-roll is so exciting and it is so

01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:44.121
all encompassing. But it was skiffle -- it
was Donegan who put the hands -- put a guitar

01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:49.960
in the hands of the war babies, not Elvis
Presley.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:54.270
&gt;&gt; I just wonder whether there was a reaction,
you know, like there was to punk, a sort of

01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:58.550
outrage in newspapers. And you mentioned Teddy
Boys briefly and I know there was sort of

01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:06.670
a newspaper outrage about Teddy Boys. So is
that also linked with an older generation

01:17:06.670 --> 01:17:11.760
worried about these new kids and what they
were getting up to with their guitars?

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:17.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Teddy Boys sort of predates skiffle.
Teddy Boys are kind of there in 1952. There's

01:17:17.070 --> 01:17:25.760
a chapter in the book that sort of follows
that as the sort of first British youth cult.

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:34.350
The trouble comes from Rock Around the Clock.
There's a -- the movie, Blackboard Jungle,

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:40.130
which is a pretty good movie, it's Glen Ford,
he's a teacher in a school in I think it probably

01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:42.480
must have been in New York somewhere and he's
got a load of hoodlums and he's trying to

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:48.870
educate them. But the movie opens with Rock
Around the Clock and that's the first time

01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:53.090
it had been heard in the UK. And if you've
grown up your whole life listening to music

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:57.640
through a speaker about that big and you go
to a cinema and the speakers are as big as

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:02.900
the book there -- cover -- and they're playing
this music loud, you know, people were dancing

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:07.500
in the aisles. People were jumping up and
dancing in the aisles. And a year later a

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:12.080
movie called Rock Around the Clock came out,
which had something like 12 performances by

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:17.100
Bill Haley and his comments in it. I mean,
there were riots. My uncle Dave and my aunt

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:20.540
Christine were at a riot in Rumford. I only
found this out subsequently when I asked them.

01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:27.960
And my uncle Dave helped to turn the firehose
on the manager at a cinema.

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:28.960
[ Laughter ]

01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:36.340
So there was some concern [laughing] about
it, but also -- also it was -- they attempted

01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:43.860
to cooped skiffle as well. It's often -- the
one book that was written by -- about skiffle

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:44.860
in the '50s, written by a vicar.

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:45.860
[ Laughter ]

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:46.860
So, yeah, it was a bit of both. Yes?

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:47.860
&gt;&gt; Hello, Bill.

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:51.190
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Hi [inaudible]. Here I am.

01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:52.930
&gt;&gt; How are you?

01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:54.659
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Good.

01:18:54.659 --> 01:18:56.370
&gt;&gt; Great. No pom poms today.

01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:57.370
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: OK.

01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:58.370
&gt;&gt; But anyway.

01:18:58.370 --> 01:18:59.370
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Ken, is it you under that
hat?

01:18:59.370 --> 01:19:00.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is.

01:19:00.370 --> 01:19:03.430
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Oh, here you are. Sorry, I
didn't see you under the brim. How are you,

01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:04.430
mate?

01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:05.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:06.550
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Tell me you bought a new T-shirt.

01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:07.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Anyway. Great to see you.

01:19:07.630 --> 01:19:09.540
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Great to be here.

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:14.590
&gt;&gt; Been a few years. And, of course, I have
to ask about this. As a Jewish guy who is

01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:19.150
sitting in Silver Springs, Maryland and who
loves England folk and folk rock and has for

01:19:19.150 --> 01:19:25.820
almost 40 years, I'm wondering about the connection
between skiffle and that particular scene.

01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:32.170
I seem to recall reading somewhere that Mr.
Martin Carthy was in a skiffle band a long,

01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:39.190
long time ago and it does seem to me that
you may be right that the skiffle thing, man,

01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:44.350
probably started the English rock-'n'-roll
business over here, the folk rock, and maybe

01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:45.350
other stuff.

01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:48.981
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It's true, Ken, because what
happens is when rock-'n'-roll comes in, there's

01:19:48.981 --> 01:19:55.751
a kind of split between the guys who want
to play beat music, you know, the Beatles

01:19:55.751 --> 01:20:01.090
and their cohort. There's another group who
want to play the blues and they become the

01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:07.990
Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. But there's
also a group who are wanting to stay faithful

01:20:07.990 --> 01:20:15.150
to playing your acoustic guitar and they kind
of form the very first folk clubs. Ewan MacColl

01:20:15.150 --> 01:20:20.530
plays a big role in that. And -- but there
are also significantly a number of Americans

01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:26.670
involved in skiffle by pure coincidence. It
just so happens that when "Rock Island Line"

01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:32.110
comes in the charts, Alan Lomax is living
in London. He's in London ostensibly to record

01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:37.940
a world music series for CBS, but he's also
there because he's afraid he's going to lose

01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:47.820
his passport and his job as part of the Red
Scare. So he's there in London. Jack Elliott,

01:20:47.820 --> 01:20:53.000
Ramblin' Jack Elliott is also in London when
"Rock Island Line" hits the charts. He's hitchhiking

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.710
around the world with his new wife, June Hammerstein,
and he's like -- talk to the skifflers -- he's

01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:02.989
like a walking god. I mean, Ron Gold said
to me, "I couldn't believe it the first time

01:21:02.989 --> 01:21:11.731
I saw Jack Elliott. He was wearing Levis and
a hat." So, yeah, he was a big figure. And

01:21:11.731 --> 01:21:17.160
Peggy Seeger is also in London at the time.
She was traveling around the world and she

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:23.460
started going and playing in the coffee shops
as well. And she played a lot of -- because

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:30.361
her -- very interestingly, her repertoire
had both -- because of the nature of where

01:21:30.361 --> 01:21:35.020
she got her repertoire from, some of it was
from the British Isles anyway. You know? It

01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:40.390
kind of was from over in the UK. So she fit
right in with the idea of playing folk music,

01:21:40.390 --> 01:21:43.820
Ken. You know, she had the -- that beautiful
banjo of hers to play.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:49.739
&gt;&gt; You know [inaudible] that and she even
reminds me a little bit of [inaudible].

01:21:49.739 --> 01:21:50.739
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:51.739
&gt;&gt; So I'm wondering who --

01:21:51.739 --> 01:21:58.530
&gt;&gt; Well, Shirley was in a skiffle band with
Peggy Seeger and Ewan MacColl and Alan Lomax

01:21:58.530 --> 01:22:03.360
call the Ramblers. They had a little TV program
and they were kind of using -- MacColl and

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:09.820
Lomax were older, but they were kind of using
music to -- the skiffle music, to get their

01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:17.050
agenda, the music they wanted, work songs
and folk songs, onto the radio.

01:22:17.050 --> 01:22:21.350
&gt;&gt; Hi. Would you talk a little bit about the
musicology in the book? It looks like there's

01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:26.199
a track that -- there were tracks that you
were asking to be played. Is there music accompanying

01:22:26.199 --> 01:22:27.199
the book?

01:22:27.199 --> 01:22:31.010
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, obviously there is,
but it's not in the book I'm afraid. But you

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:35.300
can always -- all this skiffle stuff is on
Spotify now because it's out of -- it's all

01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:38.900
out of copyright. So if you can use the titles
in the book -- I thought about putting in

01:22:38.900 --> 01:22:42.870
a discography, but I didn't want to narrow
it down. So if you use the titles in the book,

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:48.309
Donegan's easy to find and the rest of the
stuff is easy to find as well.

01:22:48.309 --> 01:22:53.750
&gt;&gt; Have you thought about recording some skiffle
yourself at this point? You've got this huge

01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:57.790
connection to the music, you're talking about
how it's not really out there, it's this sort

01:22:57.790 --> 01:23:01.940
of step child and sort of ignored in history.
Have you thought maybe, not only with the

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:05.860
book that you're clearly very knowledgeable
about and it looks amazing, but maybe putting

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:07.760
out a record of your own with skiffle music?

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:11.950
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, interesting, last year
me and a guy name Joe Henry got on a train

01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:16.980
in Chicago, Illinois, and rode it all the
way to Los Angeles via San Antonio and when

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:22.650
the train stopped in the largest cities to
allow freight traffic to pass, we jumped off

01:23:22.650 --> 01:23:30.150
and recorded a classic railroad song in the
railroad stations along the way. And there

01:23:30.150 --> 01:23:35.630
are, when you look at the track listing, I
think there are five Lead Belly songs on the

01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:39.900
record including "Rock Island Line". But if
you look at it from the United Kingdom, there's

01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.849
five Lonnie Donegan songs on it.

01:23:41.849 --> 01:23:42.849
[ Laughter ]

01:23:42.849 --> 01:23:49.510
So it's kind of -- that kind of is our record.
Can I say something about cultural appropriation

01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:58.150
because that's been a question that has come
up a few times if you're interested? In 1956,

01:23:58.150 --> 01:24:05.020
Lonnie Donegan had a hit with the song called
"Stewball," which is a quite famous folk song,

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:10.150
concerns a jockey whose racehorse speaks to
him and tells him how he's going to win the

01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:18.000
race. Lead Belly recorded it. Woody recorded
it. Now, Lead Belly could have got it from

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.650
two places. He could have got it from his
own experience because it was a song very

01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:29.560
familiar to African American field workers.
So familiar it was the Lomax's who recorded

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.480
a version that Lead Belly may have heard,
they said it was the most common song they

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:39.510
found when they were recorded in the 1930s
among African American sharecroppers. Now,

01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:46.800
100 years before that, "Stewball" was being
sung in boarding houses and bars in New York

01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.150
and Boston. A hundred years before that, it
was being sold as a broadside ballad on the

01:24:52.150 --> 01:25:03.250
streets of George in London. And in 1752-3,
the actual event on which the song was based

01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:10.880
happened at the Curragh of Kildare in Ireland.
Now, given that progress, who does this song

01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:20.360
belong to? Who has the rights to say, "This
is my song?" Lead Belly? Lomax? Woody? I mean,

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:25.170
at least Donegan had an Irish money. He did
have a [inaudible] I think in the holy [inaudible].

01:25:25.170 --> 01:25:30.960
But I think that one of the problems with
the debate about appropriation is it runs

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:37.150
contrary really to the spirit of music. Music
belongs to everyone or no one. You know? It

01:25:37.150 --> 01:25:45.480
kind of lives by being sung. Martin Carthy
who Ken just mentioned had a great phrase.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.489
Once he said to me, "The only bad thing you
can do to a song is not sing it." You can't

01:25:51.489 --> 01:25:55.920
put it in a corner and say, "This belongs
here." MacColl tried this. MacColl and Peggy

01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:00.170
tried this in the folk clubs in London in
the '60s and said you can only sing songs

01:26:00.170 --> 01:26:06.020
that come from your own culture. And it was
like a, you know, like a form of Stalinism.

01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:11.200
You know, who needs -- folk music doesn't
need police. You know? It needs -- it needs

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.730
to go wherever it goes because the great thing
about "Rock Island Line" is Lead Belly didn't

01:26:15.730 --> 01:26:24.730
write it either! You know, Lead Belly heard
it from Lomax. He and John Lomax working together

01:26:24.730 --> 01:26:32.650
recorded it in Cummins Prison Farm in Arkansas
and in 1935. I'm proud to say I held the paper

01:26:32.650 --> 01:26:37.590
sleeve of the original recording with John
Lomax's handwriting on today in the other

01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:43.230
building. It was a moment of deep meaning
to me I have to say. But, you know, the guys

01:26:43.230 --> 01:26:48.690
who sang in the prison, Kelly Pace and the
other seven prisoners who came to Lomax's

01:26:48.690 --> 01:26:53.310
microphone and sang "Rock Island Line" as
a call and response song, they didn't write

01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:59.500
it. They didn't write it either. It was originally
appeared Rock Island employees working in

01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:06.270
Little Rock in the engine sheds in Little
Rock. The company encouraged the formation

01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:11.590
of glee clubs and, in this case, it was an
African American quartet who wrote this song

01:27:11.590 --> 01:27:16.520
and would perform it at social functions to
advertise the railroad. That's where it really

01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:21.000
starts. And who knows that they didn't borrow
a song from somewhere else? And Donegan -- Donegan

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.920
also -- everybody who sang that song added
something to it. The great thing that Donegan

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:33.730
does is he introduces the idea of a toll gate
on the record. If you listen closely to Lead

01:27:33.730 --> 01:27:39.730
Belly's record, Lead Belly, the signalman
is telling the train driver to go in the hole,

01:27:39.730 --> 01:27:47.460
which means in a siding, because in the golden
age of American railroads, freight had to

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:52.770
give way to express trains. But it was an
exemption on animal welfare grants if you

01:27:52.770 --> 01:27:57.210
were carrying livestock. So the train driver
says to the signalman, "I've got all livestock.

01:27:57.210 --> 01:28:01.420
I've got pigs. I got horses," and he says,
"OK. You can carry on." And then he pulls

01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:06.140
away and he shouts back, "I fooled you. I
got pigiron," which may be a pun, maybe a

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:12.290
pun by Lead Belly. In Donegan's version, there's
a toll gate and he's having to pay some kind

01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:17.800
of a tariff. Now, there never was a toll gate
on the American railroad ever. Donegan -- Donegan

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:21.000
kind of got -- I don't know what -- maybe
he didn't understand what Lead Belly was saying,

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.880
but he invented that. But, interestingly,
he watermarked the song. He watermarked the

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:34.460
song. Anyone you hear singing a version with
a toll gate in it, it's Donegan's version

01:28:34.460 --> 01:28:39.690
they've learned rather than Lead Belly's version.
And, interestingly, Johnny Cash's first album

01:28:39.690 --> 01:28:46.199
for Sun Records in 1957 starts with "Rock
Island Line" and he mentions a goddam toll

01:28:46.199 --> 01:28:47.199
gate.

01:28:47.199 --> 01:28:48.199
[ Laughter ]

01:28:48.199 --> 01:28:55.260
So we have a saying in the American Folklife
Center which is, "What goes around, comes

01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:59.050
around," and that's [laughter] -- that's how
you explain skiffle. It's how you explain

01:28:59.050 --> 01:29:05.199
the Beatles. It's how you explain "Stewball."
It's how you explain the multicultural society

01:29:05.199 --> 01:29:10.440
that we belong to. The people are able to
hear music from outside their own cultural

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:17.329
context, be inspired by it, and grow up to
love the people who made that music. And that's

01:29:17.329 --> 01:29:21.340
-- that's the great thing about folk music.
Thank you very much.

01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:23.210
[ Applause ]

01:29:23.210 --> 01:29:38.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So we want to thank everyone
for coming and we want to say that there's

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:43.530
a table out in the front where you can buy
books and you can get Billy to sign books

01:29:43.530 --> 01:29:48.010
if you've already bought them. So we're going
to be there for just about an hour. We have

01:29:48.010 --> 01:29:54.450
to be out of the building at 9:30. So that
is our deadline. So head out the front and

01:29:54.450 --> 01:29:58.080
you'll see Billy there. Thanks very much once
again on the behalf of the American Folklife

01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.460
Center and the Library of Congress.

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:00.080

of Congress. Visit us at loc.gov.
