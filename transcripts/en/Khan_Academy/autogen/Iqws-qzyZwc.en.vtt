00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.430
 In this presentation I will solve a set of questions about the tendency 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.450
 With little review, the tendency is a method 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.920
 To measure the slope of the line 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.870
 And the definition - I hope we get 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.800
 Good knowledge of him in this offer - and his definition 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
 Is the change in y التغير the change in x 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.960
 Perhaps this is not clear to you now, but whenever 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.830
 We analyzed more and more issues, I think it would be a good thing 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.730
 So it is clear to us 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.900
 Let's solve the first line 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.660
 Line a 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.460
 Let's find his inclination 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.490
 We have two points here that we can use 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.130
 As reference points 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.140
 If first, let me look at 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.770
 These coordinates are points 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.140
 We have this point 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.040
 What are its coordinates? 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.480
 The x coordinate is 3 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.070
 The y coordinate is 6 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.940
 At the bottom here, this point is an x-coordinate 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.780
 -1 and its coefficients are -6 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.920
 There are a number of ways we can think about it 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.330
 The first is, we can look at its integrity using the formula 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.030
 We can say the change in y - the inclination is the change in y / 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.370
 Change in x 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.850
 We can find it numerically 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.200
 I will draw it graphically quickly 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.040
 What is the change in y? 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.330
 The change in y is about how much 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.760
 The shift in y values ​​from this point to that point? 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.400
 How much is the change in y values? 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.570
 Y moves from here, y falls on -6 and moves all 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.060
 Distance up to positive 6 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.150
 What is this distance? 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.930
 The end point will be the y value 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.040
 Will be a 6-point starting value of y 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.140
 - 6 or 6 + 6, equal to 12 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.960
 You can count them 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.000
 It says 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.840
 10, 11, 12 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.680
 When the y value changes by 12, we have to change the value of x 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.460
 By - what is the change in x / 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.800
 Same change in y? 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.570
 Well, we move from x = -1 to 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.190
 x = 3 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.930
 is not it? X moves from -1 to 3 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.110
 We put the end point, ie 3, - the starting point 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.540
 Ie -1, and equal to 4 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.270
 If the change in y / change in x equals 12/4 or if 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.660
 We wanted to write it in the simplest form 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.030
 It will be 3 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.690
 Now this explanation is that for every 1 we move 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.520
 On - let us consider it, let me write in this way 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.190
 Change in y / change in x = - can say 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.960
 It's 3 or say 3/1 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.590
 What shows us that for every 1 we move in 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.650
 Direction x positive, we will move up by 3 because 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.540
 Positive 3 towards y 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.480
 You can see it 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.320
 When we move 1 by x, we move up y by 3 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.880
 When we move 1 by x, we move up y by 3 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.500
 If you move 2 by x, it will 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.250
 We move on y by 6 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.210
 6/2 = 3 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.280
 This 3 shows us how fast we move up when the value of x increases 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.780
 Let's do the same thing for the second line on this graphic representation 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.470
 Graph b 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.060
 same idea 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.300
 I will use the points given to us 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.730
 But in fact you can use any points on this line 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.020
 To see, we have one point here, namely 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.550
 Point 0.1 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.540
 We have 0,1 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.780
 Then the starting point - we can call this the end point - 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.460
 The starting point here, we can consider 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:47.830
 x = -6 and y = -2 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.990
 The same idea 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.230
 What is the change in y that gives a change in x? 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.440
 Let's find the change in x first. What is the 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.060
 Change in x? 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.930
 In this case, what is the change in x? Ie delta x 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.850
 We can calculate it 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.910
 It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.110
 It will be 6 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.760
 But if you do not have a graph until you count it, you can 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.370
 Take the location of the end x, it's 0, and 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.029
 It is removed from the beginning of x 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.390
 0 - 6 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.360
 When the change in x = - the result is 6 - 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.180
 What is the change in y? 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.890
 Remember, we take this as an end point 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.520
 This is the starting point 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.670
 If we take 0 - 6 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.635
 Then on y, ask 1 - -2 

00:04:44.646 --> 00:04:45.658
 1 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.180
 How much product 1 - -2? 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.260
 It is equivalent to 1 + 2 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.410
 It is equal to 3 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.450
 If it is 3/6 1/2 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.080
 Note that when we move towards x by 6, we will move 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.340
 Towards y by positive 3 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.170
 If the change in y is 3 when the change in x is 6 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.430
 Now, one of the things that bother many people is 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.110
 How do I know the order - How do I know I am putting 0 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.930
 First and 6 Second and then 1 First 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:19.920
 Then II 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.210
 The answer is you can put any order you like 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.540
 As long as you keep them straight 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.300
 You can also put the change in y 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.830
 / Change in x 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:34.280
 We can say, it's worth -2-1 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.690
 If we use this coordinate first. 2 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.490
 For y divided by -6-0 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.960
 Note that this negative image of it 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.650
 This negative image of it 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.545
 But since we have a negative divided by a negative, it will 

00:05:49.545 --> 00:05:50.260
 We delete them 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.810
 Thus the result is -3 / -6 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.020
 Negative is deleted 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.250
 The result is 1/2 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:05.250
 The important thing is if you use this y coordinate 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.280
 First, you'll have to use 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.350
 X This is first 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.640
 If you use this y coordinate, as we have here, if 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.160
 You must use this x coordinate 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.130
 First, as I did here 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.850
 Just make sure that the change in x and 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.750
 Change in y - using the same 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.950
 Cut the end and the beginning 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:30.190
 So I explain this, this explains it to all 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.820
 6. We move it to x 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.480
 If we move on x by -6, we can go back 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.210
 We will move on y by 3 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.960
 This explains the same thing 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.170
 The mile of this line is 1/2 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:50.150
 Which shows that for every 2 we move on x, we will move up to y by 1 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.990
 Or if we return 2 by x, we will go down on y by 1 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.070
 This is illustrated by Mile 1/2 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:00.560
 Note, the line that tilts 1/2, will be less than one step from 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.840
 The line is tilted 3 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.490
 Let us solve more of these issues 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.200
 Let's move to the line c 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.670
 I will use pink color 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.250
 Suppose the starting point - I chose it in a way 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.120
 random 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.840
 Well, I use these points drawn here 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.010
 The starting point on the coordinates 1.6 and 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:29.050
 The end point is 5, -6 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.980
 The inclination would be - let me write this - the inclination 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.480
 Equals the change in the x-zero, the change in y 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.460
 I will not forget that 

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.500
 Change in y / change in x 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.170
 It is sometimes said to be height / dimension 

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.610
 The dimension is the amount of movement on the horizontal direction 

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.360
 The rise is the amount of movement on the vertical direction 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.840
 Then you can say that the change in y is a y endpoint 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.560
 - starting point y 

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.990
 This is the end point y 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.990
 This is the starting point y / x endpoint 

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.800
 End point x 

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.440
 If this bothers you, all I say is, it is 

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:16.570
 Equals the end point y, ie 6 - 

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:21.990
 Starting point y, ie 6, / x end point 

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:27.380
 Ie 5, - starting point x, ie -1 

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.780
 This equals -6-6 = -12 

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.280
 5 

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.080
 = 6 

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.840
 Ie = 12/6 

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.240
 This is equivalent to -2 

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.230
 Note that we have a negative tendency here 

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.670
 The reason is that each time we increase the value of x by 1, we will go down 

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:50.740
 Towards y 

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.730
 This line of inclination is descending 

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.170
 Moves from top left to bottom right 

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.610
 The higher x, y will be 

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.130
 That's why we got negative inclination 

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.010
 This line must have a positive inclination 

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.860
 Let's check it out 

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.360
 I will use the same points 

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.400
 Used here 

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.760
 If this line d 

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:17.760
 Tilt = Height / Dimension 

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.140
 How much height do we move from these points to those? 

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:21.570
 lets see 

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:22.270
 We can use this method 

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.500
 We rise - I can promise 

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:30.110
 We rise 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.460
 We rise by 6 

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.780
 How much is our height? 

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.150
 We will move - use a different color 

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:41.580
 We will move 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.640
 We move by 6 

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.300
 If the tilt is 6/6, ie 1 

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.510
 What shows us that for every 1 we move towards x 

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.390
 - 1 in x - we will move by positive 1 

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:55.390
 Towards y 

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.340
 For each x, if we move to -2 towards x 

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.340
 We will move to -2 towards y 

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.820
 Whatever we do in x, we will do the same thing in 

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.710
 y in this inclination 

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:06.740
 Note that this is very easy 

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.200
 If we want to do mathematically, we can 

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.260
 To find this coordinate 

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.570
 This can be seen as the starting site 

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.630
 The starting location is -2, -4 

00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:26.210
 The end location is 4.2 

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.965
 4.2 

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.850
 If inclination, change in y / change in x 

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:42.000
 I'll take this point 2 - -4 / 4 - 

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.250
 2 

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:48.970
 2 - -4 = 6 

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.000
 Remember that it is this distance 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.140
 Then 4 - -2, also 6 

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.300
 It is this distance 

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.600
 We get the inclination 1 

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.380
 Let's solve one another 

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:02.210
 Or let's solve a bunch of examples 

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.940
 It's fun 

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.200
 Let us solve the line e 

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.800
 Change in y / change in x 

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.420
 If the change in y, when we move from this point to this 

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:16.160
 Point - I will count 

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.210
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.530
 It's 8 

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.510
 Or you can follow the y coordinate which is 2 - 

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.460
 -6, and will give you the distance which is 8 

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.020
 What is the change in y? 

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.640
 Well, the value of y here is - ah, what is the change in x? 

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.260
 The value of x here is 4 

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.390
 The value of x here is 4 

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.630
 The x value does not change 

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:39.280
 If it is 8/0 

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.660
 Well, do not know 

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.320
 8/0 undefined number 

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:44.630
 In this case the tilt is not defined 

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:46.830
 When we have a vertical line, we say 

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:49.235
 The inclination is undefined 

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.190
 Because we divide by 0 

00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:56.530
 But this shows that we are dealing with 

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:58.320
 Vertical line 

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.720
 Let's solve another question 

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.670
 It seems to be a matter of direct inclination 

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.320
 Here 

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.050
 We have that point, which is 

00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:10.090
 3.1 

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:11.090
 If this line f 

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.210
 Our point is 3.1 

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:19.750
 Then here we have a point -6, -2 

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:24.440
 The inclination will be the change in y 

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.960
 I'll take this as an end point, so you can go on 

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.130
 Different directions 

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:31.770
 If the change in y - now we will move to 

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.820
 Down in this direction 

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.540
 It's -2-1 

00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.810
 It is the distance 

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.240
 -2 - 1 = -3 

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.340
 Notice that we moved down by 3 

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.340
 Then what would be the change in x? 

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.480
 Well, we'll go back just as much 

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.880
 What is that amount? 

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.200
 Well, it would be -6, those are 

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.920
 Endpoint, -3 

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:04.700
 It gives us that distance, I-9 

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:09.140
 For each 9 we go back, we will go down by 3 

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.680
 If we return 9, we will go down by 3 

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:16.065
 It is the same if we advance by 9 

00:13:16.065 --> 00:13:17.370
 We will rise by 3 

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:18.390
 All are equal 

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:21.830
 As we see, these are deleted and we get the inclination of 1/3 

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:22.810
 Positive 1/3 

00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:25.970
 Milan line is up 

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:33.110
 Each time we move by 3, we will rise by 1 

00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:37.740
 Each time we move by 3, we will rise by 1 

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.810
 Anyway, I wish it was a good review of the mile
