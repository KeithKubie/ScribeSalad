00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.440
So in the last video I
hopefully proved to you, at

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.720
least maybe it doesn't make
intuitive sense just yet, but I

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.130
showed you that the probability
of a and b is equal to the

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.400
probability of a given b
times the probability of b.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.700
And the probability of b given
a is equal to the probability

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.250
of b given a times a.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.230
And then we played around a
little bit and we got this.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.550
And this is called Bayes'
theorem or Bayes' law.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.630
And I will now show you how
you can apply this formula.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.450
But it shouldn't
be in a formula.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.690
You should always be able to
intuitively come to this

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.270
conclusion, even if you forget
Bayes' theorem, which I do all

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.740
the time and then I go through
that thought process that

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.050
we did at the end of the
last video over again.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.870
But let's see how we can
apply this to this problem.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.250
So we want to figure out the
probability that we pick the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.250
two-sided coin given that we
observed when we flip it

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.670
five times we got 5 heads.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.920
So let's say that this is
event a and this is event b.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.720
So we can use Bayes' theorem.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.770
So the probability that I got
the two-sided coin, given 5 out

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:07.440
of 5 heads is equal to the
probability-- and I'm actually

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.930
going to think about what this
fraction means in a second.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.370
But it means the probability
that I got a given

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.660
b, so it's this.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.760
The probability that I got 5
out of 5 heads, given the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.810
two-sided coin times the
probability of the two-sided

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.150
coin-- b-- we defined event
b as the two-sided coin.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.830
Time the probability
of two-sided coin.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.870
Divided by the probability of
in general, the probability

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.080
of getting 5 out of 5 heads.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.080
Well, what's the probability
of getting 5 out of 5 heads

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.600
given the two-sided coin?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.680
Well, we wrote that down.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.580
We're guaranteed to get 5 out
of 5 heads, so that's 1.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.470
And what's the probability of
getting the two-sided coin?

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.840
Well, that was 1/10.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.140
And now what's the probability
of getting 5 out of

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.110
5 heads in general.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.660
Well, we figure that out, I
think, either in the last video

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.720
or the video before that.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.170
I forgot the exact number.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.800
Actually, it was something
like 1/10 plus 9/320.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.910
Right, so this is 32.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.450
It was 41/320.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.760
We figured that out in
the previous problem.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.200
This is over 41 over 320.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.150
And so what did we get?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.190
We get this is equal
to 1/10 over 41/320.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.360
Now what is that equal to?

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.670
That equals to 1/10
times 320/41.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.480
Let's divide the top
and the bottom by 10.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.510
So it equals 32/41.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.610
That's interesting.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.560
I actually find that
really interesting.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.150
I don't know which coin I
picked out of the bag, but I

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.150
know that if I flip that coin
five times and all 5 are heads,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.360
there's a 32 out of 41 chance--
this is maybe a little bit

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.880
better than a 75% chance that I
picked the two-headed

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.330
coin we could say.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.490
And let's think about this
visually a little bit.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.120
So if this is the entire
universe of what could happen,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.830
and we said, 1/10 of that--
this is the two-sided coin,

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.720
this is the fair coin.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.530
And then, out of all of that,
the situation in which we get 5

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.350
out of 5, well, those could
be-- if we got the two-sided

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.820
coin all of that is
going to be 5 out of 5.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.120
And then some small fraction,
1/32 of the fare coin.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.070
So this yellow circle
represents getting

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.310
5 heads in a row.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.860
So if I want to know what's the
probability of the two-sided

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.420
coin, all Bayes' theorem is
saying, well, OK, we observed

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.490
that we got the two-sided coin.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.540
Sorry, we observed that
we got 5 out of 5 heads.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.980
So we now know that we're in
this yellow universe because

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.470
the yellow universe represents
the area or all of the outcomes

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.180
where we got 5 out of 5 heads.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.040
And then we say, well, out of
those outcomes, what percentage

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.670
of them involved me getting
the two-sided coin?

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.010
Well, if we look here,
all of these-- sorry.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.560
Edit.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.640
If we look at it here, this is
the area out of the yellow

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.770
where I had the two-sided coin
and I got the 5 out of 5.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.300
And so this is going to
be roughly 32 out of 41

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.320
of this yellow area.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.840
So that's a visual
representation of

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.000
Bayes' theorem.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.810
This says the probability of
getting a two-sided coin,

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.560
given I got 5 out of 5,
that says-- well, OK.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.660
Let's look at the universe of
you got 5 out of 5, and then,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.950
what percentage of that
universe involved you getting,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.370
essentially the two-sided coin?

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.250
And that's that.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.710
And that's all Bayes' theorem
essentially tells us.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.260
So let's see if we
can apply that.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.690
Let's do a more
interesting one.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.090
Actually, I'm going to to leave
it there and then in the

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.120
next video I will apply
Bayes' theorem to more

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.025
interesting problems.

00:05:20.025 --> 00:05:21.740
See you soon.
