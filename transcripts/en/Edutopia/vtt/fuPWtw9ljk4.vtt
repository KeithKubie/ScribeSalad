00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.620
- Every child has the right to graduate

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.183
with an "I Can" mindset.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.410
You meet a child anywhere in the world

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.990
they go from crawling
to standing to running

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.160
to thinking to laughing and just when

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.250
they're telling the world,
"Look at me, I can!"

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.819
We send them to school.

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:19.447
(laughs) And you say, "Oh, you can run?

00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:21.607
"Sorry, you have to sit out.

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:22.740
"You can think and talk?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.930
"Tsk, tsk, tsk, that's
wrong; you have to listen."

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.930
That is what I encountered
first-hand with my child

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.410
so I took him out of school.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.207
I said, "I can do a better job."

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:42.290
(students talking)

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.420
So when I took him out
I don't think it was

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.049
with a big story of changing
the world or you know,

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.010
changing education and all of that.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.183
It was just my child.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.720
And at that time I was
running a design firm.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.280
The fact that I didn't come from education

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.540
I was not bothered by the size

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.470
of what I was setting out to do.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.147
So that's really what
allowed me to be audacious.

00:01:03.147 --> 00:01:07.820
(students and teacher talking)

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.820
(students laughing)

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.826
- Good morning, thank you.

00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:22.076
- Good morning.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.262
- As a designer, I was very
inspired by design thinking.

00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:34.340
(laughing)

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.650
So to start by questioning the status quo

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.440
is what design thinking tells us to do.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.740
It starts with empathy;
it starts with the user.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.010
Who is it for?

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.490
What does success look like?

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.740
Okay, and then what should I
do to ensure that I achieve it?

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.730
So for the longest time education has made

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.990
the parent the primary stakeholder.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.070
Parent wants exam.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.160
Parent wants homework.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.461
Parent wants this.

00:01:54.461 --> 00:01:56.960
Children became incidental to the program.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.330
When you put the child
back front and center,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.620
they will shape the story.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.160
- Good morning, everyone.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.110
It's time for the shout-outs.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.170
- Our children became
a designer's write off.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.710
They designed the uniform.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.340
They became clients for the architect.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.180
It was a genuine collaboration.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.063
It was just that belief
that it's your space.

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.790
(talking and laughing)

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.520
We are crafting the final curriculum.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.430
We want you to graduate
with the idea of "I Can".

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.490
- We know that we are
responsible for our own learning

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.490
so that's (mumbles)

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.720
- Today we offer a
curriculum that is built

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.460
on design thinking framework.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.350
If you look at every design process,

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.800
they will have ideate, explore,
define, prototype, product.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.340
But we simplified it.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.533
We call it FIDS: Feel, Imagine, Do, Share.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.830
- Okay, Aleah is gonna make the uniform

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.008
which can be used?

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:58.150
- Both the sides.
- Both the sides.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.690
- To understand what they
might be going through,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.930
what can we do?

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.243
- Three, two, one, go!

00:03:07.747 --> 00:03:08.580
Keep going guys!

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.971
Keep going, keep going, keep going!

00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:13.470
(cheering and laughing)

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.910
- So for 15 years if they use the same

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.740
design thinking framework, they graduate

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.120
with an "I Can" mindset.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.833
This belief that I can do it.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.860
So I think that idea of
questioning the status quo

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.080
is what we need to do in education.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.650
We don't realize that
the choice can be us.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.750
That we are who we've been waiting for.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.310
That is the mindset we owe our children

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.050
so they shine and they thrive.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.903
That's what I wanna give to every child.

00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:51.048
(children laughing)
