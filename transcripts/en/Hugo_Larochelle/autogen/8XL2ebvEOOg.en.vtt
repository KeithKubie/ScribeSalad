00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 in this capsule we are going 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.230
 introduce the context of two-game 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.269
 opponents in artificial intelligence 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.250
 so our goals in the next 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.009
 capsule is to arrive at 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 understand what is the general eighth note 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.130
 to develop intelligences 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.380
 artificial games in a context of 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.170
 two opponents we see the algorithm 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.230
 mini max as well as its variant plus 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.400
 effective alfa beta pruning and then 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.390
 finally we'll see how we comment 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.160
 can apply these types of algae to 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.809
 rhythm in there context we are 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.430
 time constraints then against him that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.430
 our algorithms run in real time 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.120
 let's start with a research reminder 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.719
 heuristic with for example by stars 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.430
 so let's imagine we're a game 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.010
 puzzles have an initial configuration 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.550
 and the purpose of the game is actually armed 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.620
 a final configuration that allows us 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.430
 to solve lines which indicates 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.440
 we won the game 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.180
 so to attack the problem like that 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.570
 we have seen that we must take define 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.460
 a notion of state that conflict that 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.500
 finally defines the configuration of the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.750
 game that corresponds to a draw in our 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.619
 search space when searching 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.759
 with antoine 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.830
 these are to determine an initial state on 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.659
 must also define a function of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.000
 transition that allows us for each 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.090
 state of the game to define what are the 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.439
 successor states to note current rates 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.820
 which essentially determines 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.680
 what are the actions that we can 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.990
 take and where do these lead 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.700
 actions there to see also 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.960
 finally a goal function that we 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.670
 identify a configuration 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.650
 final of the game so it allows us 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.899
 to identify that we arrived at a 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.320
 final which corresponds to win the kind 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.320
 question 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.340
 so is it possible 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.360
 to attack jo where we have two 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.610
 opponents or more with an algorithm 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.410
 by stars after all we could 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.080
 really imagine how we could 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.660
 set a state for the game so we 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.970
 think about games at chess games we have 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.770
 two opponents ben the state would allow 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.630
 to identify the position of all 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.540
 pieces on the chessboard function purpose in 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.660
 this case could simply identify 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.060
 what are the configurations that are 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.140
 they do it before these are 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.820
 they that the player won the game 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.420
 on the other hand where we will have a problem 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.950
 if to define our function tradition 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.600
 actually but if we decide to 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.130
 move a room that's good 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.780
 determined we know what will be the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.180
 game configuration right after 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.500
 we will move our piece by cons 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.510
 do not know the strategy our 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.430
 adversary and so we do not know which 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.650
 will be the configuration of the chessboard 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.660
 after the opponent and play so 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.910
 next moment we will be able to take 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.739
 a decision as a player so at 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.830
 because of his own who directly to 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.500
 stars in the context of games with 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.950
 several hours one or more 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.910
 adversaries and so the assumption that they 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.860
 violated in this case it's like 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.800
 conducted in an environment context 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.450
 multi agents and the opponent player 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.400
 since it can change the environment 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.800
 because of that it does not define 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.890
 perfectly our transition function has 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:24.010
 used in our research in the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:27.850
 graph of the game when talking about gambling 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.010
 with opponents we can have several 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.690
 behavior makes them opponents 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.670
 which would correspond to functions of 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.350
 different transition finally we do not 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.250
 adversaries who are cooperative 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.900
 that is to say that they too are trying to 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.060
 like us to get to the goal then in 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.410
 what if they reach the goal 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.120
 corresponds to a victory of everything 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.230
 all members of the team so all 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.670
 the players of the game we have contexts where 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.880
 we have opponents who are 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.859
 competition so where a player's win 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.840
 is a loss for others 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.350
 players a particular case this is it 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.130
 called sum games 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.420
 where the heroes are games so it's this 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.180
 aspect among others during a game 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.950
 chess or the loss or gain of a 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.260
 player is completely compensated by a 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.300
 loss that to the players so we can 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.160
 imagine a context where we have a tournament 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.840
 chess where there would be money in 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.110
 game both players but very much 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.030
 the money at stake is actually the winner 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.130
 will win all the money which means 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.710
 that a player's cash prize is 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.470
 compensated by a money loss talking 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.980
 to the players and we finally have 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.530
 mixed context or made it an opponent 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.050
 can have an advantage to train 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:41.810
 some alliances and so we find ourselves 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:46.130
 a little bit between a purely cooperative game 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:50.470
 and game that will match will then 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.470
 really an opponent between the players 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.980
 so in the next capsule we're going 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.600
 in fact make the following assumptions to 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.940
 know that we play only two 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.060
 opponents that players play one to 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.640
 the rest of the others each turn 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.470
 we have a zero sum game that we have a 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.850
 environment that completely observe 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.550
 so that means that every player 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.880
 knows perfectly the configuration of the 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.280
 of the environment this contrasted with 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.940
 a game like starcraft or one to the concept 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.770
 of English fog of war said that a 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.870
 player does not have any information on 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.550
 the configuration of the water base 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.650
 players so here we have this meal in a 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.120
 context like that we will ask that 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.860
 the whole environment is observable by 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.120
 all the players and finally we're going 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.860
 replay with an environment 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.510
 deterministic so there will be no 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.880
 chance or uncertainty about the results 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.840
 of a player's action on 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.840
 the environment
