00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.080
For movies as big as the ones that come out
of Disney, writers spend countless hours pouring

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.780
over every detail of their scripts to make
sure every moment is the best it can be.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.880
However, the truth is, when the actors get
on set or in the recording booth the script

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.930
can sometimes go out the window as the stars
choose to improvise, ad-lib or just go crazy

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.940
with the character.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.640
Often times, these unplanned moments are scrapped
but in some cases these happy accidents end

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.410
up creating some of the most amazing moments
in the film.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.730
Here is our list of 10 Amazing Disney Movie
Moments That Happened By Accident.

Be sure to hang around until the end of the
video for a special announcement!

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:55.500
Lion King
Many people would argue that Lion King is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.960
Disney’s best animated movie of all time
and the truth is that there is a lot to love

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.600
about this classic film.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.100
From the heartfelt story to the iconic characters,
every aspect of the motion picture seems to

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.640
be perfectly designed.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.790
That being said, there is always room for
unscripted fun and that’s exactly what happened

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.920
when Nathan Lane, who famously voices Timon,
came up with the line “What do you want

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.970
me to do, dress in drag and do the hula?”
on the spot.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.730
This line fits so well with the character
and had people of all ages laughing away and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.950
it’s hard to believe that it was something
the actor just made up on the spot.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.310
Beauty and the Beast
Beauty and the Beast is one of the most beloved

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.630
Disney movies of all time and the hotly anticipated
live adaptation of the classic story promises

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.060
to be a smash hit.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.001
We have to wonder if the new film will include
one of the most famous improvised lines form

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:44.090
the original movie.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.530
As it turns out, when Cogsworth’s says:
“Flowers, chocolate, promises you don’t

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.530
intend to keep,” it was actually a moment
completely improvised by the voice actor,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.980
David Ogden Stiers.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.680
Sir Ian Mckellen will be playing Cogsworth
in the 2017 film and we will be watching to

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.120
see if he brings back this unscripted line
and if he add in any of his own improvised

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.730
moments!

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.030
The Avengers
While most people think of animated kids movies

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.080
when they think of Disney, let’s not forget
that the mouse house is also behind the wildly

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.670
successful Marvel Cinematic Universe too!

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.140
The Avengers took the world by storm in 2012
and the movie did a great job of managing

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.850
all of the various characters and creating
one cohesive film.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.330
That was not an easy task, especially when
you have the likes of Robert Downey Jr. messing

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.410
around on set.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.020
Apparently, the actor would hide snacks for
himself around the set and then eat them during

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.319
and between takes.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.950
The filmmakers tried to stop him but he persisted
and they ultimately decided to make the snacking

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.340
a fun part of the Tony Stark characters.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.340
At this point, we aren’t really sure where
Robert Downey Jr. ends and where Iron Man

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.700
begins.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.751
Brother Bear
Brother Bear is by no means Disney’s most

00:02:55.751 --> 00:03:00.400
successful or famous film ever but it does
feature a pretty remarkable voice acting performance

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.040
from Joaquin Phoenix.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.370
When a star of Phoenix’s size makes a mistake,
you just go with it and that’s exactly what

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.770
happened behind the scenes of Brother Bear.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.500
During recording, Joaquin Phoenix accidentally
referred to Koda’s friend Bucky as Binky.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.480
Jeremy Suarez, who voices Koda, chose to respond
by saying: “First of all, his name’s Bucky,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.140
not Binky, and it wasn’t a pine cone it
was a pine nut!

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.140
And it was huge!

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.910
Even bigger than your fat head.”

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.819
The line is great but the writers of Brother
Bear can’t take credit for it as it was

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.490
totally made up by Suarez on the spot as a
reaction the Phoenix’s slip up.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.080
Toy Story
With hugely talented stars like Tom Hanks

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.580
and Tim Allen voicing the lead characters,
Toy Story was destined to be a great movie.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.580
The characters are awesome but what really
sets this animated flic apart is it’s hilarious

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.580
dialogue that can be appreciated by people
of all ages.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.600
As it turns out, one of the most famously
hilarious scenes from the original film was

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.480
actually completely improvised by Tom Hanks.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.610
When recording the scene where Woody is trying
to convince the other toys that Buzz is okay,

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:09.160
Hanks improvised the entire puppet show routine
right on the spot.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.459
Most of the lines were so good they ended
up making it into the film proving yet again

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.410
that sometimes the best things in life are
the product of some happy accidents.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.050
Aladdin
By this point it’s a pretty well known fact

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.910
that the late great Robin Williams did a lot
of ad-libbing and improvising for the role

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.770
of Genie in Aladdin.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.430
There are countless celebrity impressions
in the film, but did you know the Pinocchio

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.389
gag was completely made up on the spot by
Williams.

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.300
Apparently, the filmmakers liked the joke
so much that they forced the animators to

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.110
go back to the scene and re-edit it to include
the moment where Pinocchio’s head ends up

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.580
on the genies body.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.410
This may have seemed like a lot of work at
the time, but looking back now it was totally

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.770
worth the extra effort!

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.130
Pirates of The Caribbean
Over the years, the Pirates Of The Caribbean

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.930
movies have made an absurd amount of money
for Disney and it’s mostly due to the outstanding

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:11.400
performance given by Johnny Depp as Captain
Jack Sparrow.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.720
Despite a recent string of flops, Depp is
a great actor and he brought a lot of ad-libbed

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.990
magic to the Pirates franchise.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.810
Most notably the use of the word “savvy”
which has now become instinctively connected

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.530
to his iconic character was something that
Depp came up with on the spot and the filmmakers

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.410
decided to keep in the film.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.380
With Depp returning for the fifth installment
in the Pirates franchise, fans can be sure

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.950
he will be bringing his famous “savvy”
line with along with him.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.440
Guardians of The Galaxy
When you hire a hilarious comedic actor, you

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.790
are going to get improvised moments and that’s
exactly what happened when Chris Pratt landed

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.480
the lead role in the Guardians Of The Galaxy
movies.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.090
Pratt goes off script many times in the first
film but there was one joke that he and director

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.200
James Gunn never thought would make it into
the final film.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.160
Pratt’s character, Peter Quill, makes a
quick witted and sexually charged Jackson

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:12.310
Pollack reference, but the actor was sure
the joke would be deemed to Risque for the

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.310
Disney property.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.370
However, Gunn convinced studio head Kevin
Feige to let him include the moment in a test

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.320
screening and it’s a good thing he did,
because it got the biggest laugh of the entire

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:27.220
film.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.410
The Jungle Book
The Jungle Book got it’s live adaptation

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.440
in 2016 and the world got to see actors like
Bill Murray, Idris Elba and Scarlett Johansson

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.370
voicing the famous characters.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.610
As it turns out, the original movie was almost
quite different as it almost didn’t feature

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.750
Kaa's famous song 'Trust in Me'.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:52.139
As it turns out, that song was actually once
called 'Land of Sand' and it was originally

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:55.050
was written for Mary Poppins to sing to the
Banks children.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.970
Disney decided that it didn’t fit in that
movie but that it was a good song nonetheless

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.900
so they just changed the name and gave it
to the hypnotic snake Kaa to sing in The Jungle

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.900
Book.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.350
Years later, the song has become a big part
of The Jungle Book and it’s hard to imagine

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:13.840
what it would have been like had Disney not
made the last minute switch up.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.740
Frozen
There is no denying that Frozen is a force

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:20.910
to be reckoned with and the hit song “Let
It Go” became the anthem of kids around

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.950
the world.

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.660
Kids weren’t just obsessed with the song
either, the lovable snow man Olaf, voiced

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.240
by Josh Gad, also became a huge hit with fans
of all ages.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:37.130
Olaf is a pretty silly character and it turns
out that most of his lines and actions were

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:43.540
actually improvised by Gad while on set.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.470
The actor has a lot of experience with comedy,
so it makes sense that he went off script

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.240
but apparently it started getting so out of
hand that the filmmakers had to reign him

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.310
in to make sure that Olaf ended up being the
character they wanted him to be and not just

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:00.220
and animated version of Josh Gad.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.389
So there you have it, there is our list of
10 crazy unplanned Disney movie moments.
