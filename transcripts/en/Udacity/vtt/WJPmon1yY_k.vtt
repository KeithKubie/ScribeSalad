00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.711
If we replace all occurrences of Alice with no letters, then the length of the

00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:08.622
book will decrease by five times the number of occurrences of Alice. Because

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:12.594
Alice has five letters. So if we calculate the length of the book with Alice

00:00:12.594 --> 00:00:17.610
and the length of the book without Alice, and take the difference. We can

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.010
divide the difference by 5 and get the number of occurrences. So, here again,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.618
is our book class with our new method, occurrences of Alice. First, we'll

00:00:26.618 --> 00:00:30.156
calculate the original length and then the length after we remove all the

00:00:30.156 --> 00:00:36.108
occurrences of Alice, by replacing Alice with an empty string. Then we return

00:00:36.108 --> 00:00:42.008
the difference between the 2 all divided by 5. Let's add a line to our book

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.180
tester to see how many times Alice actually occurs. And if we're in the main

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.444
method again it now tells us that Alice occurs 395 times. It's not totally

00:00:51.444 --> 00:00:56.070
clear or obvious that this will be correct, but you could check it a few ways.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.162
For example, you could open up the text and use some other program to search

00:01:00.162 --> 00:01:06.188
for the number of occurrences of Alice. Or you could find some word, that only

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:09.750
appears once. Or maybe a string of words so you can be pretty sure that it

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.979
would only occur once. And try using that to debug your code.
