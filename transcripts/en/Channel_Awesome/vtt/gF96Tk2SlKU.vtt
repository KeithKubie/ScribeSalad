00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.860
Why Does Everybody Keep On Hiring Me?

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.920
All Of My Work Is Shit!

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.820
Hey, Malcolm!

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.440
Hey, Critic!

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.780
Did you know 1/3 of the world's oranges are grown in Brazil?

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.560
What an odd thing to say.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.340
I guess it's my quirk - oranges.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.540
Ok, I'm going to shoot the review now.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.200
As you know there are two types of the people in this world.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.040
Those who believe that evil
is good and those who believe that evil is evil.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.240
Tamara, why are you spewing that sloppy unfocused philosophy?

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.740
I hear you whispering.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.460
Plan on stealing something?

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.220
Why is nobody talking right today?!

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.180
Plan on murdering me in my sleep?

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.680
What? No.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.480
Wait a minute. It's affecting me now.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.560
Around 85% of oranges are produced for juice.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.640
Oranges are domes-- As you know the world is filled with people who do not understand the ramifications of--

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.280
Well now that you're here I might as well make you suffer although I really dunno why.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.320
(Overlapping voices)

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.000
My god. I know what this is- I know what's going on here!

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.200
This is-!

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.720
The Shyamalizing

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.000
Look! A camera we can all get obnoxiously close to! (Overlapping voices)

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.160
I should've seen the warning signs:

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.540
The bad, monotone acting, the dialogue that makes no sense whatsoever, and-

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.800
-Europe loving all of this for some reason!

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.620
*Sighs* Who knows who'll be next? If I'm not careful, all of us could end up like the actors from The Happening!

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.320
Based on a title so lazily vague that the film does everything in its power to justify it,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.000
{There's something happening in a few states.}

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.920
{Could this really be happening?}

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.840
{Whatever's happening is happening population.}

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.620
(repeats of "happening")

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.560
The Happening has garnered a reputation as one of the most entertainingly bad movies ever made.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.900
Yep. Right up there with The Room, Troll 2, and give it time.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:06.380
For years we've made references to this trainwreck but have never given it a full review analyzing why it's so bad it's... actually kind of amazing.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.440
So let's take a look to figure out what, how, and-- well we'll never figure out why, it's Shyamalan.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.100
This is The Happening.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.580
It starts off in New York as two women do what Shyamalan thinks two women do,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.140
read a book at the same time.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.520
{I forgot where I am.}

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.540
{You're at the place where the killers meet and decide what to do with the crippled girl.}

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.220
{*laughs* That's right.}

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.480
Good thing I was reading that exact same sentence.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.800
As the crows suddenly realizes they're on the Truman show.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.560
{Clair?}

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.080
Well, that's what I would do if I found out I was in The Happening.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.920
Just down the street doesn't seem to be much better.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.620
{Christ, McKenzie fell.}

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.920
Oh, no, not poor Christ McKenzie.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.860
But it's raining men as everybody's apparently committing suicide or having a hell of a time catching roadrunners.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.100
This leads us to our main character Elliott, played by Mark Wahlberg.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.220
{Look, I dunno if you guys have heard about this article in the New York Times about honeybees vanishing?}

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.640
If you have not burst out into laughter yet from the mere delivery of that line, then you are watching the greatest drama you have ever seen in your life.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.580
No, seriously, where's the real performance? That can't be for real.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.600
{Scary, huh?}

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.720
I mean, this is Mark Wahlberg, a pretty damn good actor.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.520
But I'm not kidding, he does the whole performance like this.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.140
It's like he's on a 2am infomercial!

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.220
{Look, i dunno if you guys have heard about this article in the New York Times about honeybees vanishing?}

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.060
Scary, huh? Well now you can track 'em down with our new honeybee tracker. Order now and you'll also recieve a free Sam-Wow.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.980
As we quickly discover, he's not that great a teacher either.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.280
{Jake? You don't have an opinion? You should be more interested in science, Jake. You know why?}

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.160
It'll make you talk like Luke Skywalker if his whinyness levels were pushed to 20?

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.480
{Because your face is perfect. Now if you were interested in science you'd know facts like the human nose and ears grow a fraction of an inch each year,}

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.860
{So a perfect balance of features now might not looks so perfect 5 years from now. Take an interest in science.}

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.400
Yes, take an interest in science after I literally insulted your face.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.680
Hey Suzy, you interested in science? Well that's because you're a slut.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.160
In typical Shymalan style, Jake comes up with the laziest answer worded in a way that's trying to sound important.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.860
{... An act of nature and we'll never fully understand it.}

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.960
Aaaand that's how you got a D in this class, kid.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960
{Nice answer, Jake.}

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.300
Oooor nice answer, Jake.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.880
{I mean science will come up with some reason to put in the books, but we will fail to acknowledge that there are forces at work beyond our understanding.}

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.120
Yeah, great science teacher there. Something, something, something... magic.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.540
Like all great scholars, he acknowledges that science is just a temporary solution for the real answer.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.840
which is just shrugging your arms, saying "Pfffff, I dunno."

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.420
{The dark lord, don't look into her eyes.}

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.500
{Ooooo~}

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.740
{Vice principal! What can we do for you?}

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.740
Well you can clear out your desk, asshole. What do you think I'm gonna say after that!?

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.980
So all the teachers are forced to abandon their students.

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.460
Typical protocol..?

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.540
As they're all gathered in one room to be told about the crisis sweeping America.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.080
{Central park was just hit by what seems to be a terrorist attack.}

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.220
{It's some kind of airborne chemical toxin that's been released in and around the park.}

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.180
{There appears to be an event happening.}

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.840
Ok, that's a tragedy or an emergency. An "event" is a sale at Target.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.700
Y'know, for teachers, you're not very good with words.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.140
{Central Park? That's kinda odd.}

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.480
Yeah, terrorists rarely go after landmarks with lots of people.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.200
This means all the students are let out early.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.520
{What're the rules of scientific investigation?}

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:43.820
{Identify the variables, design an experiment, careful observation and measurement, interpretation of experimental data.}

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.860
Jesus Christ- and don't forget to recite the first 2 chapters of Moby Dick!

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.500
"Call me Ishmael. Some years ago, never mind how long precisely, having little or no money in my purse.,"

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.880
{Mother just called my cell again, she's hysterical}

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.740
So while Wahlberg's friend, played by John Leguizamo, establishes his strange quirk, being his mother.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.460
{I threw some figures at her- told her the probability of something happening in Philadelphia is very low.}

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.320
Hey, you stand out now!

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.400
We're introduced to Alma, played by Zoey Deschanel.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.240
{She leaving you?}

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.940
{I didn't say that, it's just talk, okay? Just relax, please?}

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.080
Oh, no, we're at that Shyamalan stage where-

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.140
Critic, as you know, Jim and I have decided that we're in love even though we have no chemistry at all.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.600
Whoopidy-doo.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.360
No, it's bad: We're having trouble in our relationship, and we fear we'll never be a couple again.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:35.420
No, no, that's just the Shyamalan talking, he always has a couple that's going through problems but is obviously gonna get together in the end.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.060
No, Critic, as you know, this is pretty serious.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.500
We're having some incredibly vague problems that only a supernatural event can fix.

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.160
Will you two be quiet?! Oranges!

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.840
Look, just stay in there, try to use logic, and for the love of god, don't be quirky!

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.900
But quirky is charming-

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.560
No, Jim, it's awkward! AWKWARD!

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.480
There are 600 varieties of oranges!

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.780
As you'd imagine, Deschanel's acting is about as bad as everyone else's.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:05.860
But there is a certain alien freakiness about her facial expressions.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.500
Yeah- she looks like this throughout the entire film.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.320
It's like in every shot she realized she shit her pants and she wants nobody to realize it.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.780
Her delivery isn't much better either.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:45.180
{It makes you kill yourself... just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that could be invented.}

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:49.840
*laughs* How do you even direct somebody to say a line that way?

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:58.780
"Alright Zoey, I want you to act like you're deaf, but in saying this line, you're hearing yourself for the first time, and you don't enjoy what you sound like."

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:05.480
{It makes you kill yourself... just when you thought there couldn't be any more evil that could be invented.}

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.920
That was definitely... a thing.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.580
So Wahlberg says he'll meet Deschanel and Leguizamo at the train station.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.360
{Where's Alma?}

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.060
{Restroom.}

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.060
{Hey Juilan.}

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.800
Why the hell'd you shoot it like that? Were you trying to make her look like a stalker?

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.640
{Hey Julian.}
*screams*

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.440
{Hey Alma.}
{How you doing?}

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.820
{Hangin' in there.}

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.740
Mm-hm. Typical 7-year-old response.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:43.160
"Hangin' in there. Still looking for a job, got those bills to pay, it's hard being a single mother".

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.120
So while on the train they're being told that the panic is spreading.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.460
{You okay?}
{They say Boston got hit too.}

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.440
{Where'd you hear that?}
{A friend from work; what about eh-that?}

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:57.060
Christ, that college girl who took theater as a blow-off class is acting better than you!

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.580
The train stops suddenly as it looks like they're kicking everybody off.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.400
{What do you mean? Where are we?}

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.140
{Filbert, Pennsylvania.}
{Does anybody know where that is?!}

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.460
{Hey, why would you just stop-}

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:12.100
Y'know, if you could take the whining of a dog and convert it into a language, it'd be this performance.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.340
{Sorry. She whispers stuff when she gets scared.}

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.220
{We're so much the same, Jess. I don't like to show my emotions either,}

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.520
Tch. Yeah, to quote Wahlberg from earlier, "Duh" with a capital "eyughyuh".

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.980
And the danger still seems to be spreading as one man says farewell to arms in the lion's den.

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:32.120
{Mother of God, what kind of terrorists are these?}

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.240
"They're such hairy and yellow terrorists-- they must be from the land of Oz".

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:44.520
So everybody takes off as the virus seems to be right in their neighborhood and Leguizamo decides to leave his daughter with Wahlberg so he can go back for his wife.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:47.980
Because... things always turn out well for people who do that, right?

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.500
{She's gonna be a lot safer with you. I have to go.}

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.540
{I got her, Julian-}
{Don't take my daughter's hand unless you mean it.}

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:00.740
Oh I'm sorry, why don't you find another couple to look after the daughter you're lovingly abandoning? You're welcome, asshole.

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:04.260
{There's a car}

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.460
Very good, Zoey, now can you tell which one's the plane?

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:15.940
So Wahlberg's gang gets a ride with a guy who runs a plant nursery poorly located next to a nuclear power plant.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.560
... Why do I get the feeling this is all streaming from there?

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:27.940
"Doh! Mr. Burns, I'm afraid I caused the happening."
"Simpson you idiot! Now we're trapped in an M. Night Shyamalan film! And not one of the good ones!"

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.260
"Either of them! *laughs*"

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:35.240
They're collecting a few things before they go, when this... bit of strangeness is said.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:44.500
{We're packin' hotdogs for the road.. Y'know, hotdogs get a bad rap. They got a cool shape, they got protein... you like hotdogs, right?}

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:52.480
Brought to you by hotdogs. Wanna be less cautious about where your meat comes from than Chicken McNuggets? Hotdogs!

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.880
{I think I know what's causing this.}
{You do?}
{It's the plants.}

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.300
Wait, what?

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.820
{It's the plants. They can release chemicals.}

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.780
Wow. That's... actually the twist of the movie. It's plants.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.660
I know it seems like I'm giving some stuff away early here, but the movie is giving away some stuff earlier here so what do I care?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:20.680
We're not even 1/3rd into the film and you already gave away the big twist.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.200
{You like hotdogs, don't you?}

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:24.520
... Followed by that!

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.440
D-do you need to go back to Film 101?

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:35.260
I think most people know this.. you don't give away the twist before you give. away. the twist!

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.460
You wouldn't open Citizen Kane with "It's a sled", it's kind of a no-brainer!

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:43.280
Critic, as you know, we think we know what's caused the Shyamalization.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.660
Okay, what?

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:45.800
The walls.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:50.900
No, we're not doing that.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.500
As you know, it makes a lot of sense, they use lead paint-

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.360
No, even for a parody we're not doing that.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.820
Y'know, oranges typically contain 10 segments.. maybe one of them contains Shyamalization.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.540
Fine, make a connection to that, but we're not doing goddamn walls.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.040
How're we supposed to make oranges the twist?

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:09.180
I don't know! If the freaking Giving Tree can be an antagonist in a movie, why can't oranges? Now get crackin'!

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:12.020
You guys like oranges, right?
