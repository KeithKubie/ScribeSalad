00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.506
Let's talk a bit more about the behavior of these exponential decay and

00:00:03.506 --> 00:00:10.138
exponential growth functions. In particular, what are their domains and ranges?

00:00:10.138 --> 00:00:17.242
The functions that are graphed here are y equals one half to the x. Or now you

00:00:17.242 --> 00:00:22.786
know, this is the same as y equals 2 to the negative x. And over here, we have

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:27.572
y equals 2 to the x. For each function, please use interval notation to write

00:00:27.572 --> 00:00:32.284
in the domain and range. Although using the graphs can be helpful to answer

00:00:32.284 --> 00:00:37.160
this question, the equations are also really useful. For each domain, try to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.060
see if there are any values of x that produce invalid answers when plugged into

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.062
the function. And for the range, think about what values the function can and

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:50.600
can't take on.
