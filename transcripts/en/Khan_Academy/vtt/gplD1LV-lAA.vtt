00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.110
- [Instructor] So much of
Piketty's book is about this idea

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.290
of more and more returns to capital,

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.800
that the return to capital
is going to grow faster

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.616
than the growth of the economy.

00:00:10.616 --> 00:00:13.270
We see charts like this,
where we have the value

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.700
of private capital as
a percentage of income.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.850
And we see this dynamic, and
we see this dynamic played out

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.300
in multiple charts, where as
we go through the Gilded Age,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.720
we hit kind of a peak right over here,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.480
at least a local peak, and then as we get

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.830
into the beginning of the
20th century it drops down

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.590
and then starts to pick back
up until the present time.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.780
And this is the present time

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.120
right over here, this data point.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.840
And then everything we see after that,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.040
this is Piketty's projections,
really based on this idea

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.490
of returns to capital be growing faster,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.610
that R is growing faster than G.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.730
But one thing to think about

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.970
is why this dynamic might be happening.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.440
And then that might inform how we think

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.670
about what the projections might be.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.700
So let's think about

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.700
why the value of private
capital could go down

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.913
and why the value of
private capital could go up.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.670
So one reason, so let's
just say we have some asset,

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.800
some capital asset right over here,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.760
and let's say its current value,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.516
I went on to some market and I bought it,

00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:13.260
and its current value is $100.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.240
Let me just write this, this is today.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.240
Today it has $100, and let's
say it gives an income,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.540
an annual income, of $10, of $10.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.910
So for this asset my return on
asset right over here is 10%.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.370
I get $10 on $100 investment.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.900
Now there are several reasons

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.680
why the value of this could go up.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.660
One reason is that this asset
starts producing more income.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.359
So this would be in line
with the idea of more,

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.340
of maybe income, of capital
becoming more and more valuable.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.150
It's able to capture more and more income,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.080
or maybe it's utilized in a better way.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.640
And so, let's write this as the future.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.460
So in the future, you
could have a situation

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.520
where it's generating an income,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.180
it's generating an
income of let's say $20.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.360
And let's say that the return is the same,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.850
so the expected return is the same,

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.530
so people are still willing
to say I'm willing to pay

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.700
as much for things so I
still get a 10% return.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.420
So people are saying okay I'll pay as much

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.730
so I still get a 10% return,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.680
so that means that they're going to pay,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.760
in the market they'll pay $200 for it.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.890
So this is one reason why
you could have an increase

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.690
in the value of something. And
you could go the other way.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.280
Maybe the value was $200,
but because the income

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.970
goes in half and the
return stays constant,

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.390
the value goes in half.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.180
So this is one scenario.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.730
This is one reason why the
price of an asset could go up.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.810
But it's not the only reason

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.810
why the price of an asset could go up.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.520
Another reason why a price
of an asset could go up

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.900
is maybe there's more and more capital

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.120
and maybe there's fewer and
fewer projects to put it to,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.280
especially if the growth of
the economy isn't growing.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.280
So more capital, capital chasing, chasing

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.430
fewer, fewer projects, or
fewer things for it to produce.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.550
And in this world, what
is going to happen?

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.670
Well, this, we'll just
assume that this continues

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.000
to produce $10 of income.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.860
So the income continues to be $10 a year,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.580
but people, let's say you and I were able

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.650
to buy this for $100, but
let's say the next person

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.710
who has $100 of capital
to invest in capital,

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.920
says well I can't find
something with $10 of income,

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.320
I can't get $10, so hey
I'm willing to take 9%,

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.440
so I'm gonna bid this up,
I'm willing to buy this

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.220
from you for $101, or
$102, or maybe it goes

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.987
all the way where they can't get anything,

00:03:47.987 --> 00:03:50.300
they can't get better than a 10% return,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.920
anything better than a 5%
return on their incremental $100

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.880
and so they're willing to do
a 5% return for this asset.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.650
So they would bid this thing up,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.000
the more and more
capital you have chasing,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.830
or more and more money you
have chasing this project,

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.900
I guess you could say, this asset,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.230
could just bid the value of this up.

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.230
So the value could go to $200,

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.020
it's still producing the same income,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.210
and now the return is 5%.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:22.210
And so the reason to point
this out is increasing value

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.360
of capital doesn't necessarily
mean increasing returns.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.940
In fact normally in the market,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.150
they move inversely with each other.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.080
When bonds have higher returns,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.680
then you have lower, then
their prices are lower.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.700
When their prices are
higher, for bond prices,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.170
that means that they have
a lower, a lower return.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.720
So when we look at something like this,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.640
when we look at something like this,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.870
this could be speaking to more
and more capital accumulation

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.450
chasing fewer and fewer potential projects

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.580
or whatever it might be,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.070
especially because you have
slowing economic growth,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.240
but this would be a story
of capital accumulation

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.530
but with R slowing down,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.570
with the actual potential
return slowing down,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.460
and probably starting to converge to G,

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.100
to the rate of growth.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.900
Another similar idea, this is more capital

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.230
chasing fewer projects, but you also have,

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:15.860
might have a reality
is that the reason why

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.520
this is getting a 10% return
is people find this scary.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.250
They've been burned on investments before,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.550
there have been wars.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.320
They don't want to put their
money into some kind of factory

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.450
they want to stuff it into their mattress.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.990
But then over time, maybe
people become a little bit

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.050
less risk averse and they're
willing to invest in the market

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.910
they're willing to invest in a project

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.880
or start a business or
whatever it might be.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.820
And so people become more risk tolerant.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.570
So maybe this is a world
that is very risk averse.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.330
Risk averse, so if you want
me to invest in capital,

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.320
you have to give me a high return.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.850
But maybe the future is going
to be more risk tolerant.

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.470
Risk tolerant, risk tolerant,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.610
and then in a more risk tolerant world,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.500
you could also go to something like this.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.520
So this is risk, in a
more risk tolerant world,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.350
you might say hey okay, well okay,

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.410
I don't have to stuff it in
my mattress, I'm getting 0%,

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.520
or in my bank account,
I'm not getting a lot,

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.147
but hey now I'm willing to take my money

00:06:13.147 --> 00:06:15.490
and invest it more in capital.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.000
And so once again, they
will bid up capital,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.520
and they will have a
lower expected return.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.370
Here they need a high expected return

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.220
because there was a lot of risk,
they were scared of things,

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.350
hey you better give me a
lot of return on my capital

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.220
if you want my capital because
it's a scary world out there.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.040
Hey okay, maybe now I'm
less worried about wars

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.790
and my wealth disappearing
and whatever else,

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.910
so I'm more willing to invest.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.320
And so that also is in line
with this more capital,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.690
and so there is a lower expected return,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.500
and so you have the value going up.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.550
And actually this is consistent

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.390
with what we see
happening right over here,

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.660
is that this, this period
right over here was a period,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.570
this is a period of major unrest.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.760
You have the two largest wars

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.810
in global history right over here,

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:04.770
you can imagine people becoming
very very very risk averse.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.713
You can imagine people starting
to stuff money in their,

00:07:07.713 --> 00:07:11.160
putting their, trying
to sell their assets,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.500
worried what might happen.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.470
And so you're going to
have less and less capital,

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:18.610
more and more risk aversion
driving that reality.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.310
But then as we go into
the post-war period,

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.350
the memories of those wars go away,

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.020
people become more risk tolerant,

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.930
more capital comes into the system.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.180
Because of the productivity,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.270
you have more and more
capital accumulation.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.480
If we go back into even
pre-Industrial Revolution times,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.900
if we go to Medieval
Times, and all the rest,

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.780
you had a limited amount of
capital, it was mainly land.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.180
As you go into the Industrial Revolution,

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.350
and especially the 20 and 21st centuries,

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:45.850
land represents a smaller
and smaller percentage

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:47.310
of the value of total capital.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.410
Now you have created
capital, you have technology,

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:50.910
you have intellectual property.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.890
And so this could be a trend,
once again I'm not sure,

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.900
it's up for you to make the judgment.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.350
This trend isn't necessarily
a return to a Gilded Age,

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.470
it could be more and more capital

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.250
chasing fewer and fewer projects,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.010
which actually could be
a sign of lower returns,

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:09.200
or it could be just people's
risk premium is going down.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.030
They're becoming more
and more risk tolerant,

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:14.870
and so they're willing to
accept lower and lower returns.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.210
So it's not clear what the trajectory is,

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:18.370
but I just want to make it very clear

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.580
that this isn't necessarily saying

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.120
that hey because this graph
looks the same as here

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.430
that we're necessarily going
into a second Gilded Age.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.533
But it's up for you to decide.
