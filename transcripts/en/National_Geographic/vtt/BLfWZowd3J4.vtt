00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:01.633
[sirens blaring]

00:00:01.633 --> 00:00:03.867
NARRATOR: In a post-9/11
world, the field

00:00:03.867 --> 00:00:05.667
of forensic science
has become more

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:08.100
urgent and important than ever.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.734
Deaths related to global
terrorism have spiked.

00:00:10.734 --> 00:00:14.166
And in 2015 alone,
more than 29,000 people

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.200
were killed as a result
of terrorist attacks.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.133
The pervasive threat of
mass casualty terror attacks

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.633
demands new innovations
in forensics,

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:24.934
especially when it comes
to how we investigate

00:00:24.934 --> 00:00:26.467
large-scale blast sites.

00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:27.967
Samples of these
could be taken

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:29.900
and sent for DNA analysis.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.900
NARRATOR: Kim Moran is
an instructor at Arcadia

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.967
University who works with FBI
agents, police, bomb squads,

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:38.734
and forensic scientists
on how to best respond

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:40.700
to the aftermath of a bombing.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.834
When a blast happens,
it's so important

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:46.433
to be able to identify
all the victims that

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:48.967
are involved so that
we can return those

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:51.266
remains back to the family.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.367
In terms of personal effects,
people wear very kind

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:55.600
of easily-to-distinguish
jewelry,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.533
so this could really help
identify the individual.

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:00.133
NARRATOR: Debris
from a blast can also

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:02.166
be used to identify
the perpetrator,

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:04.600
a crucial first step in
identifying any links

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.500
to terror organizations.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.300
But before this evidence
gets to the lab,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.333
it has to be collected
in the field.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:13.600
And training for that
is where the challenges

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600
of living in a
radically new world

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.934
lead to some radical
new solutions.

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:22.567
[music playing]

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:27.700
I've come to Pennsylvania
to shadow Kim as she takes

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.834
students through her
unorthodox approach

00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:33.834
to learning the intricacies
of post-blast investigation.

00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:36.700
We're in a parking lot,
and a group of students

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.300
are dressing dead
animals up behind us.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.500
What's happening?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.700
We have a bus today where
we're sending a charge,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.000
and we have a number of
passengers on that vehicle.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.500
We can't use human cadavers.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.800
Yes.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.467
And this is our
next best thing,

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:53.834
previously-deceased animals.

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.734
So these are the
passengers, essentially.

00:01:55.734 --> 00:01:57.367
These are the passengers.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:01:59.500
Using a mannequin,
it's just not going

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.567
to be affected by the
blast in the same way

00:02:01.567 --> 00:02:04.333
as an actual biological entity.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.266
It's really important
for first responders

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:09.633
to have really the full
realistic experience of going

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.433
out to a post-blast
investigation

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:13.300
with the sights and the
smells and the sounds

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.400
that would happen for a
real incident, such as this.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.233
The smells are real.

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:19.333
The smells are very real, yes.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:20.734
[music playing]

00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:22.767
NARRATOR: To mimic real-world
evidence-gathering,

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:25.533
the students create a fake
identity for each animal.

00:02:25.533 --> 00:02:27.200
This is Madison Kelly.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.200
Wow.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.834
You literally put
lipstick on a pig.

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:30.867
We did.

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:32.367
NARRATOR: And outfit
them accordingly.

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:34.633
The personal effects
that we're including

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:36.300
will help the
responders positively

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.000
identify the individuals.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.500
Some of the stuff that
would seem a little absurd

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.166
about what's happening
behind us, that's actually

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.633
happening because you are
trying as much as possible

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:46.500
to recreate--

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.900
Exactly.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.400
Family members are going to see
something happen on television,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.500
and they are going to
wonder if their son

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.033
or daughter or husband or
wife was involved in any way.

00:02:56.033 --> 00:02:56.834
What is this?

00:02:56.834 --> 00:02:57.834
A sheep?

00:02:57.834 --> 00:02:59.667
She's actually an
expecting mother.

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:00.734
Ah.

00:03:00.734 --> 00:03:03.600
I knew I hated this one.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.266
OK.

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:08.467
[music playing]

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.333
NARRATOR: As the day
swings into gear,

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:15.633
the students load up the
animals and put them in place

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:17.533
on the bus at the blast site.

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:18.367
What are you moving?

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:20.367
I'm trying to move its butt.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:23.166
NARRATOR: A 3D scanner is
also on hand to map the site

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:25.133
before and after the blast.

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:28.166
It captures a million
points a second as it scans,

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:32.867
and it's able to deliver
a very quick summary

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:34.433
of what happened at that scene.

00:03:34.433 --> 00:03:35.600
NARRATOR: But
there's no experiment

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.300
without an explosion.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.166
Enter the local bomb
experts, who board the bus

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:44.600
and set the explosive device.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.667
So on one hand, we're
here at the forefront

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:51.400
of a pretty important experiment
in modern day forensic science.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.033
On the other hand, I'm standing
here in front of a school bus

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:58.734
that's filled with dead
farm animals dressed up

00:03:58.734 --> 00:04:02.133
in human clothes and
they're about to be blown

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:03.600
to [bleeping] smithereens.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.233
[shouting]

00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:10.500
Three, two, one.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.834
[explosion]

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:31.166
[sirens blaring]

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:37.166
To the untrained eye, this
is just pure and total chaos.

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.533
[music playing]

00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:40.767
NARRATOR: The search team must
quickly sift through the rubble

00:04:40.767 --> 00:04:43.500
to mark any evidence that
could help identify the animals

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.633
on the bus, like body
parts or personal effects--

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:49.166
no matter how small.

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:52.433
From a cigarette butt,
you could get a DNA profile.

00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:53.967
NARRATOR: Even a
stray piece of plastic

00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:57.867
could be a bomb fragment that
may help identify the killer.

00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:00.834
I don't of anything on a
bus that looks like this.

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:02.734
NARRATOR: As the
investigators work the ground,

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:05.133
the 3D scanner provides
a detailed study

00:05:05.133 --> 00:05:08.433
of where each piece
of evidence originated

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:11.200
and where it ended up.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.834
Finally, the bodies are
removed from the site,

00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:17.433
and the evidence is
collected to send to the lab.

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:20.066
Experiments like this are
really important because not

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:22.900
something that people
see on a daily basis,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.000
but it's going to happen.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.667
We just don't know when,
we don't know where,

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:27.500
so we need to be
prepared for it.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.800
NARRATOR: Because when an
incident like this does happen,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.367
the skills these
students are learning

00:05:31.367 --> 00:05:33.266
become the crucial
tools that can provide

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:36.300
critical, real-time answers
to both law enforcement

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.367
and victims' families.
