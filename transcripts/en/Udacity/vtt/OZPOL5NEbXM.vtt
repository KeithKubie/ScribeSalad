Congratulations, you've reached
the end of this course.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.910
I hope that you find it interesting and
informative.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.140
And that the behavior of the internet
is a little less mysterious to you than

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.820
once it might have been.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.790
I'm going to leave you with one more
story about the importance of speed and

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.670
network bandwidth to the users
of a web application.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.410
I've put a link to it just below.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.610
It's a story from Chris Zacharias,
a former YouTube developer.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.340
He tells about how reducing the size
of YouTube's video viewing page

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.460
made the site much more accessible.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.070
But also that it was hard
at first to see the effect

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.070
without careful measurement.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.910
This story is worth reading and
thinking carefully about.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.370
For anyone who works on large websites
or anything else bandwidth intensive.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.560
Thanks for your time and
energy taking this course.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.100
See you around.
