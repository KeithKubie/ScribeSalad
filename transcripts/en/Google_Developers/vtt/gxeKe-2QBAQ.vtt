00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.980
MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.700
Welcome to Root Access, the show
on Google Developers Live

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.520
where we talk about common
startup problems and issues.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.400
In today's episode, we're doing

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.780
something a little different.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.560
We're not picking up one
particular topic, but we're

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.990
answering questions
that we've seen in

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.290
email and YouTube comments.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.800
And I'm joined here today by
Don Dodge, startup expert,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.239
working colleague with me here
in Google Developers--

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.070
in Developer Relations.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.710
And we have some pretty good
questions from the viewers,

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.660
don't we, Don?

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.680
DON DODGE: Yeah, it's great.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.250
I'm looking forward
to the questions.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.960
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah, let's
see if we can get

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.570
through them all.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.980
Some of these I actually
wonder about myself.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.950
So this will be very
interesting for me.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.860
DON DODGE: Hey, Martin, maybe
at this point we should

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.590
mention Root Access
to google.com.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.900
So if people have questions,
they can send them to their

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:30.880
email address.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.550
MARTIN OMANDER: Definitely.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.820
Thanks for reminding me.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.150
So we have the email address
rootaccess--

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:38.140
as one word--

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.352
@google.com.

00:01:39.352 --> 00:01:42.430
You can send comments on the
show or questions or

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.110
suggestions for other topics.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.170
And we read everything that
comes in, and we may put

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.260
together on a show about
the topic you suggest.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.890
Also, as you have been doing,
please continue to leave

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.640
comments in the YouTube
comments.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.850
We read everything.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.700
And most of these questions
are actually from those

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.730
YouTube comments.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:08.900
So one, YouTube comments,
m rootaccess@google.com,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.530
rootaccess as one word.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.080
All right, thanks for
reminding me.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.120
so the very first question,
top priority.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.280
We have no more than three
separate people asking us in

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.700
the YouTube comments about this
advisory board stuff you

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.770
talked about a couple
of episodes ago.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.210
It sounds really good.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.720
We should really
have advisers.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.540
But how do you compensate
advisers for your startup?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.810
DON DODGE: Typically you
compensate advisers with

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.320
common stock options, just
like you do employees.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.520
So in a typical startup, there
would be a pool for employees,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.840
and it's typically 10 to 20%
of the company is set aside

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.240
for stock options
for employees.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.090
You take a small percentage
of that pool

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.670
and apply it to advisers.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.550
Now, advisers typically get--

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.190
it could be 10,000 shares, and
the price will be the same as

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.990
the employee's pay at that
particular time.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.390
It could be expressed as a
percentage of the company.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.740
And I could typically be as
low as 1/4 of a percent

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.890
up to a full 1%.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.300
And it depends on what they're
going to do for you.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.130
And it depends on the stage of
the company that you're at.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.340
So if you're just starting out,
and you need a lot of

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.150
advice on how to form the
company, how to get your

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.590
management team, how to raise
money, how to get press, if

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.940
you find someone who's going
to do all that, then the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.280
percentage would be
closer to 1%.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.070
Whatever percentage that you
agree on, adviser options

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.740
typically vest in two
years with no cliff.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.760
Whereas employee options
typically vest over four years

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.390
with a one-year cliff.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.720
The cliff means that you have to
stay a full one year before

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.780
you get the options.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.770
And then after that,
they vest on a

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.840
quarterly or monthly basis.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.000
With advisers, it's more common
that the options vest

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.610
over two years and that they
start vesting immediately.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.820
So every month, they
get a 24th?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.760
DON DODGE: Right, 1/24.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.700
And an additional thing, you
may have heard about

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.870
acceleration, or accelerated
options, or triggers, where if

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.280
the company is acquired, the
adviser options automatically

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.830
accelerate or fully vest.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.820
So if you do a two-year vesting
schedule with an

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.960
adviser and your company gets
acquired after eight months or

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.630
12 months or 16 months, whatever
it is, the remaining

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.670
months get fully vested and
paid to the adviser.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.540
The reason for that is that the
acquiring company is not

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.350
going to want to keep you on
as an adviser, and you've

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.220
already given a lot of value.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.240
Most of the value that an
adviser gives is front loaded.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.680
So it's very early in the
process, and it sort of tapers

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.230
off as you get further out.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.380
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.580
So what should a startup founder
do if you approach a

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.880
person you respect who's in the
community and all of that,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.000
and that potential adviser
asks for cash?

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.740
DON DODGE: Probably decline.

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.620
Startups don't have
a lot of cash.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.320
And the cash they do have they
need to use that to hire

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.610
people and do the things
they need to do

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:44.480
to build the product.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:51.460
So I wouldn't spend precious
cash on an adviser.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.340
And if an adviser is not willing
to take stock options

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.840
and sort of grow with the
company, then they're probably

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.920
not the person you want, and
they're acting more like a

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.070
consultant.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.500
And consultants?

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.240
Sure, startups hire
consultants.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.010
But it's for very specific tasks
that they need expertise

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.260
on, and it's for a very short
and defined period.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.600
That's typically not what
an adviser does.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.370
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, so you want
the advisers to have skin

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.060
in the game as well, is
what you're saying?

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:24.440
DON DODGE: Right.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.940
Skin in the game and to be with
you for a couple of years

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.340
to really help you build
the business.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.360
MARTIN OMANDER: Very good.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.440
Great.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.960
Another thing, and this second
question, I get asked

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:36.930
this all the time.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:42.760
When I go to hackathons, I go to
college events, people who

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.510
are straight out of college
or have a couple years

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.950
experience, they ask what
experience do I

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.420
need to start a company?

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.110
Can I start one straight
out of college?

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.950
What other jobs should I have
had before to have what it

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.200
takes to start a startup?

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.710
DON DODGE: Yeah, sure.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.460
You can start a company right
out of college or even right

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.300
out of high school.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.760
Mark Zuckerberg started
Facebook in college.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.390
Larry and Sergey started
Google while

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.690
they were at Stanford.

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:14.510
Yahoo!

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.300
recently acquired a company from
a founder who was a high

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.135
school kid.

00:07:19.135 --> 00:07:20.800
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.100
DON DODGE: But those
are the unicorns.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.910
Those a kind of rare.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.070
Typically startups have founders
that have graduated

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:32.380
from college for a few years
and have done a few things.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.360
I say actually the best
preparation for doing a

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.380
startup is to work
in a startup.

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.280
So I think after you graduate
from college or high school or

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.340
do whatever you do, go
work for a startup.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:52.840
And that helps you to learn
how startups work, how you

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.120
have to raise money, how you
have to hire people, how you

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.820
get office space, how you
handle all of the

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.190
nitty gritty details.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.930
It gives you access to investors
and to employees who

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.480
want to do startups.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.630
Typically startups emerge
out of other companies.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:15.760
So they either emerge out of--
they spin out of a startup

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.980
that failed or that grew and
they got disinterested, or

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.570
they spin out of larger
companies.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.660
In larger companies, great
experience for a startup there

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.970
is, the closer you are to the
customer or product management

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:35.970
or understanding a problem,
the better off you are.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.750
So big companies are a good
place to get experience.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.070
But you want to be as close to
the customer and the product

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:48.300
requirements as you can.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.020
So those are the two ways.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.810
But I would say the best way,
the best preparation for

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.310
starting a company is to work in
a startup yourself, someone

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.210
else's, and learn how
it works there.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:02.740
MARTIN OMANDER: My first job
was in consulting, and I

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.800
thought that was pretty nice.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.870
Every six months I went to a
new company and saw it from

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.000
within as well.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:10.990
DON DODGE: I started
the same way.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:12.070
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, did you?

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:12.570
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:13.320
And you're right.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.860
Consulting is a good way to get
a broad overview of lots

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.200
of different companies
and how they operate.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.540
But it tends to be a short-term
kind of thing, and

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.980
you don't really get deep into
the issues that they are

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.590
solving, or the problems that
they have, for how the

00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:36.290
dynamics with customers work,
you get an overview of it.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.820
But there's nothing like working
in a startup and

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:43.350
having it in your face every day
to really impress upon you

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.432
how to handle those things.

00:09:45.432 --> 00:09:48.540
MARTIN OMANDER: Well, that makes
perfect sense, yeah.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:53.800
All right, the very first show
we did back in March was about

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.410
funding and seed funding.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.770
We got some questions
about that.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.390
I think we may not have been
completely care about the

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.220
difference between angel
investors and friends and

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.560
family round.

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.190
Could you dig into that
a little more?

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.060
DON DODGE: Sure.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.690
Friends and family are
just what it says.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:16.020
It's people who will give you
money to start your company

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.830
because they're friends
of yours.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:18.530
They know you.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.480
They trust you, or they're
family members.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.350
So friends and family, that's
the normal source for your

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.600
first money.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.370
And VCs often refer to them sort
of derisively as friends,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:35.570
family, and fools, because
you have to--

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:38.390
there's no justification,
really, for giving you that

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:42.610
money because you have
just an idea.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:44.270
You might not have your
founding team.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:49.190
You don't have a product
to look at.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.890
You're at the very
early stages.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.080
So only someone who
really knows you--

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.730
friends and family-- would give
you the money to do that.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:01.090
And that's typically, depending
on your friends,

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:03.740
somewhere around $100,000.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.250
If you have lots of friends or
rich friends, then it can go

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:09.470
to maybe a couple hundred
thousand dollars.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.760
But it's a small amount of money
just to get started to

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.980
attract a co-founder and build
a demo product that you can

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.780
actually take to angel
investors, which

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.250
would be the next step.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:30.320
Angel investors tend to be
retired tech executives or

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:34.050
entrepreneurs themselves, who
have built and sold companies

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.090
and have money to invest and
sort of like to live

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.240
vicariously through the
entrepreneurs and get involved

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:43.360
in a startup and
help them grow.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.770
So they are two kind of
very different things.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.700
The first money you get is
friends and family, and that's

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.730
probably 100,000 to 200,000.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.750
Angel investors are the next
level, and that can be

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:57.190
anywhere from $250,000
to a million.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:01.990
And they like to invest when
there's at least a couple of

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:04.320
people, so a couple co-founders,
maybe an

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.980
engineer, and that there's a
demo that they can look at

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.280
this and maybe a business plan
or some kind of plan about

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.180
where the company's
going to go.

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.470
And then once you get beyond
that stage, then you're ready

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.200
to go to VCs, Venture
Capitalists, for a series A

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.130
kind of financing.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:26.270
And those tend to be a
million to 3 million.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.490
MARTIN OMANDER: So this goes
against a little the common

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.900
wisdom and common knowledge that
friends and money, you

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:32.880
shouldn't mix those things.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.930
Family and money, you shouldn't
borrow from family.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:38.130
But you have to, to
get off the ground

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.020
before you have a product.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:40.520
DON DODGE: Right.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.750
You do.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:47.080
And family will do that for
you when no one else will.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:53.560
And I counsel people not to
take too much money from

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.510
friends and family because it's
very risky it's likely

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.370
that you'll lose it.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.250
So you don't want to
take too much money

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.790
from any one person.

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:06.960
You're better off taking 5,000
or 10,000 from several friends

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.550
and family to add
up to an amount.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.910
Don't try to take too much from
any individual because

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:13.640
it's very risky.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.900
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah, yeah.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:17.420
All right.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.140
All right, so I also
meet teams who

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:22.370
found startups together.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:27.490
And also most ideas usually
start with one single person,

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:29.840
and that single person
drives it on.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.460
But I think you mentioned in a
show recently previously we

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.870
did that you really should have
a co-founder, and that

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.520
was something you looked
at with startups.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.260
Why do you look at that?

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.830
DON DODGE: Well, not just me,
but investors look at that.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:52.730
Y Combinator and TechStars,
everyone tends to want to have

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.420
at least two co-founders
in a company.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.080
There are rare cases where a
single co-founder can be the

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.840
driving force and make
things happen, but

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.220
that's pretty rare.

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.560
The reasons that you want

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.090
co-founders, there are several.

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:11.180
One is starting a company is
really, really hard, and there

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.980
are ups and downs to this.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.690
And when you have two people,
one can be up when the other

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.390
is down and sort of help
each other out.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:25.080
Or one can be really good at
development and the other is

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:28.890
really good at raising money
and marketing or

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:29.810
that kind of thing.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.070
Or one of the founders is a
front-end developer and the

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:37.070
other founder is a back-end
developer so there's balance.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:41.750
It's pretty rare that one person
can do everything, and

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.930
you need co-founders that have
that same shared vision and

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.790
passion and willing to put
everything out there that an

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.650
employee might not.

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:56.920
So for those reasons, it's
pretty important to have

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.980
co-founders.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:02.180
From an investor perspective,
having a co-founder sends a

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:08.420
signal that says someone else
believes in this idea enough

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.990
to quit their job and join you
to build this company.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.650
So it's sort of validation that
someone else thinks this

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.140
is a great idea.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:22.340
And so the more validation you
have from co-founders, from

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.330
early employees, or from
friends and family and

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.930
investors, that makes the next
round of investors feel more

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.005
comfortable.

00:15:30.005 --> 00:15:32.080
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:37.220
So many startups build on top of
Google APIs to get started.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.160
You don't have to build your
own payment solution.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:43.260
You don't have to build your own
load balancer and things

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:44.520
if you run on App Engine.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.590
You don't have to write your--

00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:49.720
very few startups write their
own mobile operating system.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.670
They're built on Android.

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:56.500
But if you do that, you're
pretty dependent on whoever

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.900
the provider is,and for these
examples, Google.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.380
And sometimes, you
just hit a block.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.960
You can't do what you thought
you could do with the product.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.050
It doesn't do what you thought
the documentation says, and

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:10.340
you can be stuck.

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.910
What do you do then when it
comes to Google products

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.870
DON DODGE: Well, when it comes
to Google, Developer

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.350
Relations, there's a big group
of us, over 200 of us

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.340
actually, that help developers
solve problems.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.400
We give them advice.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.850
We give them code samples.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.530
We solve technical problems.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:35.980
So if you go to
developers.google.com, you can

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:40.470
find a list of the developer
advocates by product who are

00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:42.110
there to help you.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.160
Can go to Google Groups.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.670
There is a group for every
Google product, a discussion

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.530
forum where you can
ask questions

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.940
and get them answered.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.200
There are discussion forums on
Stack Overflow for every

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.020
single Google product.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.850
You can watch Google Hangouts,
their Office Hours.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.000
So if you go to
developers.google.com and look

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.700
for Google Developers Live,
you can see a schedule of

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:13.599
shows, upcoming shows, Hangouts,
and that kind of

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.670
thing where you can
ask questions.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:20.329
You can go to Google I/O. There
are Google Developer

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:24.079
groups all over the country,
all over the world.

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:28.400
So there are multiple ways to
get help from Google, and

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:29.210
that's our job.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:30.806
That's what we do.

00:17:30.806 --> 00:17:31.950
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah, I thought
I saw the report

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:33.710
recently about Google
Developer groups.

00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:38.840
They are now in 106 countries,
I think I saw in the report.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.600
It's pretty amazing.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:46.260
But let's repeat that again--
developers.google.com to see

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.180
all the different products
there are.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.660
And then
developers.google.com/live is

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:56.890
a great place to find video
about the various product

00:17:56.890 --> 00:18:00.640
teams talking about their
products and questions they

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.640
get from the field.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.770
DON DODGE: Right.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:05.150
MARTIN OMANDER: And Google
Developer groups, I think

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.440
that's
developers.google.com/groups,

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.810
and then you can see if there's
one in your city or

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:11.370
your country.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:13.580
DON DODGE: Right.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:15.480
MARTIN OMANDER: Or start
one if there isn't one.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:22.200
All right, so freemium, we
get this question a lot.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:26.400
People throw around that term
a lot, and it's something

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.110
where some stuff is free and
some stuff is paid for.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.580
But what does it really mean,
and how do you do it well

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.460
without infuriating and
nickel-and-diming your users?

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:39.050
DON DODGE: So freemium
is a conflated word.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:44.590
It's a conjunction of free and
premium, and we say freemium.

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:48.960
So it means is the service
starts out free, and then you

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:55.680
pay a premium for additional
services, or more features, or

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.330
more bandwidth, or
more storage, or

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:59.110
something like that.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:04.710
So freemium means that the users
can start for free and

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:06.440
experience the product.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.680
And when they go over a certain
usage limit or when

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.550
they go over maybe a one-year
free trial or something like

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:14.900
that, then you have to pay.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.760
I've seen hundreds of businesses
that have used the

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.190
freemium model.

00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:29.140
And typically 3% to 5% of the
free users convert to paying

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:34.120
customers, and 95 to 97%
of the customers--

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:34.900
or users--

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.210
are actually free users.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.140
So you need to make sure that
your business model and your

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:45.170
cost structure supports being
able to support these 95% of

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:47.160
the users that are
not going to pay.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.180
And with software, you can
generally do that because

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.890
using things like App Engine and
free infrastructure kinds

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:59.570
of things allow you to support
users without actually paying

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.200
a lot of money to do that.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.710
MARTIN OMANDER: So that
is a very good point.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.400
I should have no delusions about
half the people wanting

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.780
to pay for coming in.

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:10.340
I should count on 3 to 5%.

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.910
And my business has to be
profitable at that lower

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:14.930
percentage.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:15.350
DON DODGE: Right.

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.220
So some people do have a
misconception that half the

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.240
people will pay for
their product.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.740
And if they will,
that's great.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.740
You're going to do very well.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.910
But typically, 3%
is a pretty good

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:32.301
conversion, and 5% is fantastic.

00:20:32.301 --> 00:20:35.000
MARTIN OMANDER: I see.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.290
So quite often, I meet startups,
I'm sure you do as

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:43.020
well, who say that they have
this great idea, but they

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.560
don't want to talk about
it because it's

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:46.260
such a great idea.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.160
They might want you to sign an
NDA or not tell you about the

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.730
idea at all.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:57.870
So should startups have an NDA,
nondisclosure agreements?

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:01.750
DON DODGE: Yeah, nondisclosure
agreements were really an

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:05.680
invention of big companies, big
companies who were working

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:10.260
with multiple suppliers, or
consultants, or contractors,

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.470
where they had to try to
keep things secret.

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:17.570
But in the software world and
in the startup world,

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.070
nondisclosure agreements really
don't have a place.

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.620
For example, investors, venture
capitals, will not

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:27.350
sign nondisclosure agreements.

00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:29.290
MARTIN OMANDER: Why not?

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:30.530
DON DODGE: For several
reasons.

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:33.350
The biggest one is that
they can't remember.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.180
They talk to so many people,
they couldn't possibly

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:41.170
remember who they heard
something from and who not to

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:42.760
tell about it.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.480
So it's just too cumbersome
a process.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:52.170
it's too cumbersome of a
process, and it's too risky

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.310
from a legal point of view.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.640
Once you've signed one of those
things, people could sue

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:03.440
you for some comment you made
not even knowing that it had

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.680
anything to do with what they
were talking about.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.210
So most people will not do it.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:13.050
And quite frankly, from a
startup perspective, they

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:20.800
don't help you much because NDAs
don't prevent bad things

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.280
from happening.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:25.710
And when bad things do happen,
you still have to hire lawyers

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.990
and spend a lot of money
to try to defend or get

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.820
compensation.

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.650
So I don't think NDAs
actually work.

00:22:33.650 --> 00:22:38.250
I don't sign them personally,
and investors don't, and I

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.310
don't see it very often.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.510
The flip side of it is, as a
startup, you're actually

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.750
better off talking about your
idea with other people because

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.900
most people want to help you.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.050
Most people want to understand
what you're doing and

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:55.770
introduce you to other people
who can help you, or give you

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:59.540
advice on how you can make it
work better, or sort of

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.630
broaden your horizons and
thinking about things.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:06.130
So I think the benefit that you
get from telling people

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:10.560
your idea far outweighs any
risk, downside risk, that

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.870
someone might copy your idea.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.630
MARTIN OMANDER: I think that's
a good point, yeah.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:17.870
All right.

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.625
We also had a question
about patents.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.600
Should startups go out, if they
have this great idea,

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.890
which most startups
think they do.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:30.390
Should they go out and
get patents for that?

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.964
How much does it cost
to get one?

00:23:32.964 --> 00:23:33.880
DON DODGE: Hm.

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.160
Good question.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.770
Software patents are kind of
a controversial topic.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:41.770
MARTIN OMANDER: Indeed.

00:23:41.770 --> 00:23:46.950
DON DODGE: Patents in the old
days were for hardware and

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:51.950
mechanical processes and
things that were

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.290
manufactured, typically.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.090
In the past four or five years,
software patents have

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.280
become kind of prevalent.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:05.670
And I don't see a great deal of
value in software patents

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:11.580
unless you have something that
is so novel and new that you

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.510
need to protect it
with a patent.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.490
It costs about $25,000.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.480
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, that's
significant for a startup.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.030
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.810
So you have to get a lawyer,
and there are fees with the

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.090
Patent Trade Office.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:27.770
And all told, it's about $25,000
to get a patent.

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:31.280
And for complicated ones, it
can be as much as $50,000.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.040
MARTIN OMANDER: Gosh.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:37.030
DON DODGE: And beyond that, it
can take anywhere from a year

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:40.860
to five years to get a patent
actually issued.

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.890
So it's a long process.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.300
It's very expensive.

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:46.650
And from a startup perspective,
you've either

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:52.490
made your startup work or fail
within a year or 18 months,

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.540
and you wouldn't have had the
patent issued anyway.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:54.800
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:00.810
DON DODGE: So I think larger
software companies tend to

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:05.480
build patent portfolios as a
defensive mechanism so that if

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.410
someone sues them for patent
infringement, they can

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.940
countersue them for infringing
on their patent.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:15.260
So there's kind of a defensive
mechanism more

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.340
than anything else.

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:17.520
MARTIN OMANDER: Ah, sort
of mutually assured

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:18.600
destruction going on--

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:18.960
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.440
MARTIN OMANDER: --but nobody
dares to strike?

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:20.870
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.190
The big companies, they use
patents as defense mechanisms

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.860
against other people
infringing them.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.410
The reality is, if you're in
software and you're doing

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:32.890
anything that's reasonably
popular, you're probably

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:34.920
infringing on someone
else's patent.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.110
And they don't care unless you
start to get really, really

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.850
successful and impinging
on their business.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:46.050
And by that time, the idea is
that you'll have patents that

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:51.160
you can execute and sort of
trade and say, OK, truce.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:51.910
I won't sue you.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.380
You won't sue me.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.380
MARTIN OMANDER: OK, so patents
have their place in the way

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.950
our legal system is set up and
all of that, but not for a

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.050
startup for most of
the time, you say.

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:04.650
DON DODGE: Unless You're doing
something really unique and

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:07.960
really different, it probably
doesn't make sense because of

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.120
the expense and the
time involved.

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.760
But you may want to start
thinking about patents and

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:18.620
start the process for later on
down the road when it could

00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.550
become important.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:21.260
MARTIN OMANDER: Oh, right.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.745
Yeah, time and money, those are
two things startups have

00:26:23.745 --> 00:26:25.640
in short supply.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.440
Better to use it to build
your product.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:27.610
That's

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.610
DON DODGE: Right.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:30.620
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:36.470
Let's see, question from the
Tony that we got on Google+.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.030
He said that we've talked
a lot about

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:40.840
consumer-facing startups.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.950
And consumer-facing
startups is--

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.070
well, the ones I've been
in have all been

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.580
consumer facing as well.

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:51.940
It's easy because you are
yourself a consumer so you can

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.510
sort of tell what kind
of marketing

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.880
would work for a consumer.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:59.146
You can figure out how much a
product should cost because

00:26:59.146 --> 00:27:01.920
you know how much money
you would pay for it.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.430
But enterprise-facing startups,
that's a completely

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:07.550
different area.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:11.660
What is different about
enterprise-facing startups?

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:12.750
DON DODGE: Almost everything.

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:15.150
MARTIN OMANDER: Almost
everything.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.520
DON DODGE: Enterprise software
tends to be more expensive,

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.980
more complicated.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:25.970
You typically have a sales
force that would sell an

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.350
enterprise software product.

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:33.650
It might require integration
with existing software that

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.485
the enterprise has.

00:27:35.485 --> 00:27:39.940
It might require professional
services to help install the

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:43.250
software, integrate it with
other things, make it work,

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:48.220
customize it for the way the
customer wants to use it.

00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:50.880
So the cost structure
is different.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.620
The business model--

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:52.500
MARTIN OMANDER: That
sounds terrible.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.630
Why would a startup ever get
into this sort of cost

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:57.940
structure and all this stuff
you have to set up?

00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:00.470
DON DODGE: Well, because it's
very, very profitable.

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:04.830
If you get a product that people
are willing to pay for,

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:08.820
you can sell-- in the old days,
you could sell one seat,

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:16.250
a one user license for $25,000,
$50,000, and do that

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.820
in an enterprise where they're
buying hundreds of licenses.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.830
So you could have millions and
millions of dollars of revenue

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.400
from one customer.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:29.790
So it's a great business model
if you have an idea of that is

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:33.670
differentiated and people are
willing to pay, and it's easy

00:28:33.670 --> 00:28:38.880
to integrate, and it's easy to
customize to the way that the

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.540
business wants to use it.

00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:42.930
Some of the biggest software
companies in the world were

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:46.030
built on that model.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:48.830
In the past eight or 10 years,
we have sort of moved away

00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.230
from enterprise software, and
most of the investment and

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:53.820
most of the innovation
has been on the

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:57.100
consumer side on the web.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.620
MARTIN OMANDER: Yeah, we're
seeing consumer stuff sort of

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.000
working its way into
the enterprise

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.200
through the back door.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.110
DON DODGE: Exactly.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:07.630
So we've had eight or 10 years
of web-based development and

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:11.570
more recently mobile development
largely focused on

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:16.570
consumers, largely funded by
advertising business models or

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.680
freemium business models.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.500
And those things work pretty
well, but the venture

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.710
capitalists and the investors
have discovered, whoa, we've

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:28.010
been ignoring the enterprise
for eight to 10 years.

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.160
Now there's a great
opportunity to

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.530
invest in that area.

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:32.250
And you're right.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.970
What you're seeing is a lot
of social or consumer-type

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:41.660
features being built into
enterprise software, so making

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.960
enterprise software more
approachable and easy to use,

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.820
better user interface, mobile
access to enterprise

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:55.000
applications, bringing social
kinds of signals and social

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.890
inputs into enterprise
application.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:59.330
So there's a huge opportunity
there.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.000
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.510
And then the other thing I
notice also with enterprise is

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:07.030
that we're all kind of
experts on consumers

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:08.150
because we are consumers.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.630
But with an enterprise, you want
a pretty strong team who

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:17.870
knows real estate or knows
airplane leasing or whatever

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:19.330
you're into, right?

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.250
DON DODGE: Right, so
domain experience.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:21.950
MARTIN OMANDER: That's the
word I was looking for.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.510
DON DODGE: So having
domain experience.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:27.820
Going back to that first
question you asked about what

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:31.890
do I need to start a company,
and I said work at a startup,

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.520
well, if you want to start an
enterprise software company,

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.900
you're better off working at a
big software company that's

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.590
done enterprise because that's
where you get the domain

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:42.340
experience.

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:46.070
And you know the features that
matter, and you know the

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:47.710
problems, and you know how your

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.290
customers' businesses work.

00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:54.520
So you can identify unsolved
problems, or you can identify

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.590
efficiencies that
you can effect

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.250
with enterprise software.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:02.310
So for there, you need domain
experience, and you need

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.060
experience with those
customers to

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.910
understand what they do.

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.710
So it's a completely different
approach, not only from a

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:13.710
business model and cost
structure and implementation

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.920
and professional services and
all that kind of thing.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.575
Technical support
is different.

00:31:19.575 --> 00:31:20.370
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.480
DON DODGE: So the technical
support you provide to a

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.930
consumer is very different than
the technical support you

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.520
would supply to an enterprise
customer.

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:31.150
They expect more, and they
actually pay for--

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:32.010
MARTIN OMANDER: They're
paying for more, yeah.

00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:33.070
DON DODGE: They pay
for support.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.350
So it's a totally different
approach, different business

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:41.480
model, but very lucrative and
somewhat neglected in the past

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:42.230
eight or 10 years.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.445
MARTIN OMANDER: Hm.

00:31:43.445 --> 00:31:45.890
Sounds like a lot to
talk about there.

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.840
Maybe we should do a future
show on that.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.870
DON DODGE: Yeah, we could
actually do a whole show just

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:53.880
on enterprise software and the
opportunities there, and how

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:58.110
you structure those companies,
and how you raise money, and

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:59.520
how you raise--

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.480
attract the team.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.980
So it's a big topic.

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:03.000
MARTIN OMANDER: Great.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.670
All right.

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:04.480
Thank you, Don.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.860
I think those were all
the questions we had.

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.540
And thank you for sending
us your questions.

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.420
If you have further questions
or, for example, if we do an

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.550
enterprise-facing startups show
about that, what should

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:18.310
we bring up?

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.500
Or what other topics would
you like us to bring

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.970
up on future episodes?

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:28.840
Do either email us on
rootaccess@google.com or leave

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.800
comments in the YouTube
comments.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.820
Thank you for watching.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.070
See you next time.
