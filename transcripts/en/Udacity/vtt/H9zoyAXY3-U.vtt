Hey, have you ever wondered, what does

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.560
DNA look like? You know, deoxyribonucleic acid,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.650
DNA. The stuff inside virtually all living

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.060
things, from the smallest, to the largest organisms.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.840
Oh sure, you've seen pictures of the

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.430
molecular structure of DNA before. You've probably even

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.630
seen forensic shows, like CSI or Bones or maybe you've even seen DNA make an

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.040
appearance in movies like Jurassic Park, or Gattaca, but

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.650
have you personally ever seen DNA in real life.
