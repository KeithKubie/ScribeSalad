00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:02.203
- Dealing with climate disruption

00:00:02.203 --> 00:00:05.481
is eliminating the use of fossil fuels

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:07.504
which is a source of
this tremendous wealth.

00:00:07.504 --> 00:00:09.619
It's like telling somebody
who had a plantation

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.978
in 1855 that, "Fine. You're
going to walk away from this,

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:15.560
"and you're not going to have a dime

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.393
"from all these slaves that

00:00:16.393 --> 00:00:19.504
"you've developed over these years."

00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:21.774
So how do you get around that?

00:00:21.774 --> 00:00:23.955
This is not easy.

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:26.530
You saw how it ended in

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.947
1861, two, three, four, five.

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:32.738
Didn't end very well.

00:00:32.738 --> 00:00:34.424
I don't think we can
afford that kind of ending

00:00:34.424 --> 00:00:36.330
for the climate crisis.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.330
And yet the challenge is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.018
as great if not greater.

00:00:41.018 --> 00:00:44.090
In this case, we've enslaved
nature rather than people.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.052
- [May] And people,
who are part of nature.

00:00:46.052 --> 00:00:47.452
- Indeed.

00:00:47.452 --> 00:00:49.607
So we have both going, right?

00:00:49.607 --> 00:00:51.372
Okay, that's fair.

00:00:51.372 --> 00:00:53.054
So how do we do this?

00:00:53.054 --> 00:00:54.721
May, you're, you uh-

00:00:56.793 --> 00:00:59.227
- Well I think it's the right analogy.

00:00:59.227 --> 00:01:00.060
Frankly.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.037
I think in terms of this question

00:01:03.037 --> 00:01:05.266
about "wrecking the economy,"

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:07.752
which is the number one retort

00:01:07.752 --> 00:01:10.806
when we make this
argument about divestment

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:13.175
or about changing the energy system.

00:01:13.175 --> 00:01:15.280
There's plenty of people who

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.572
are not climate activist by trade,

00:01:17.572 --> 00:01:19.907
but who are, run the Bank of England,

00:01:19.907 --> 00:01:22.481
or are Michael Bloomberg,

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.385
who will make the argument that actually

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:27.533
the way around this problem
is that we're losing money

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:29.499
right now by not acting.

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:32.023
And that in fact the transition off

00:01:32.023 --> 00:01:34.690
of fossil fuels is the way to avoid some

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.274
of the worst economic impacts

00:01:36.274 --> 00:01:38.601
we're sleep walking our way into.

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:42.432
This whole idea of stranded
assets risk in a carbon bubble.

00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:44.866
It's exactly what you
were just describing.

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:47.467
That why people are
stopping investing in coal.

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:49.683
It's because they realize at some point

00:01:49.683 --> 00:01:51.256
that is not going to be profitable,

00:01:51.256 --> 00:01:52.926
and they should get out of it now.

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:56.759
So it really depends on
some of those factors,

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.669
but I would end by saying

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:01.503
it is a moral issue also.

00:02:01.503 --> 00:02:03.536
The financial argument is compelling,

00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:05.084
and it is changing the economy,

00:02:05.084 --> 00:02:08.503
and that's important, but it's also wrong.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.504
It's wrong to be causing this problem.

00:02:10.504 --> 00:02:12.685
And people's lives are at stake.

00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:14.788
And that's why the analogy is right.

00:02:14.788 --> 00:02:16.418
An enormous disruption was created,

00:02:16.418 --> 00:02:18.586
but it was the right
cause at the right time.

00:02:18.586 --> 00:02:19.502
Just like this is.
