don't even think of when it comes to
discussing Afghanistan and that's the

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:18.650
discussing Afghanistan and that's the
 

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:21.370
discussing Afghanistan and that's the
post-soviet Central Asian states I think

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:21.380
post-soviet Central Asian states I think
 

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.550
post-soviet Central Asian states I think
with good reason people tend to focus on

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560
with good reason people tend to focus on
 

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.520
with good reason people tend to focus on
Iran China Pakistan and India when it

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:27.530
Iran China Pakistan and India when it
 

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:30.760
Iran China Pakistan and India when it
comes to understanding where Afghanistan

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:30.770
comes to understanding where Afghanistan
 

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:34.300
comes to understanding where Afghanistan
fits in Central and South Asia but part

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:34.310
fits in Central and South Asia but part
 

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.980
fits in Central and South Asia but part
of Central and South Asia is actual

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:35.990
of Central and South Asia is actual
 

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:39.640
of Central and South Asia is actual
Central Asia and so in that context

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:39.650
Central Asia and so in that context
 

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:41.320
Central Asia and so in that context
focusing on these states is important in

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:41.330
focusing on these states is important in
 

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.540
focusing on these states is important in
a lot of ways because they will have a

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:43.550
a lot of ways because they will have a
 

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:45.760
a lot of ways because they will have a
role to play kind of just by design by

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:45.770
role to play kind of just by design by
 

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.500
role to play kind of just by design by
geography they're going to have some

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:47.510
geography they're going to have some
 

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.360
geography they're going to have some
kind of role in Afghanistan in the

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:49.370
kind of role in Afghanistan in the
 

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:53.080
kind of role in Afghanistan in the
future but not a lot of people first of

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:53.090
future but not a lot of people first of
 

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:54.700
future but not a lot of people first of
all understand the region at all much

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:54.710
all understand the region at all much
 

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.020
all understand the region at all much
less understand that region's

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:56.030
less understand that region's
 

00:35:56.030 --> 00:35:59.230
less understand that region's
relationship to Afghanistan so I'm gonna

00:35:59.230 --> 00:35:59.240
relationship to Afghanistan so I'm gonna
 

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:01.810

lay out a couple of broad themes without

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:01.820
lay out a couple of broad themes without
 

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.970
lay out a couple of broad themes without
much detail because there's no time for

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:03.980
much detail because there's no time for
 

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.240
much detail because there's no time for
it but these I hope at least will help

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:07.250
it but these I hope at least will help
 

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:09.130
it but these I hope at least will help
contextualize how these states are

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:09.140
contextualize how these states are
 

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.020

themselves as it were and then what
 

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.160
themselves as it were and then what
those implications might mean moving

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:15.170
those implications might mean moving
 

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.470
those implications might mean moving
forward so one of the first things to

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:17.480
forward so one of the first things to
 

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.050
forward so one of the first things to
understand with Central Asia and

00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:20.060
understand with Central Asia and
 

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.240
understand with Central Asia and
Afghanistan is that there's a very
