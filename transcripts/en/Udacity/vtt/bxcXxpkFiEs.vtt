00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.480
It turns out that sunlight doesn't just do

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.190
bad things, like cause DNA damage but it

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.160
also does many good things, one of which

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.690
is that it stimulates vitamin D production. So here

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.600
is a molecule that resides in cells in

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.100
your epidermis. It's 7-dehydrocholesterol. And simply getting UV

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.130
rays from the sun causes the chemistry, right?

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.010
I mean this is real energy. Energy's being absorbed

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.120
by this molecule. And it is structurally changing,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.410
it is chemically changing into Vitamin D3. Now this

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.080
is obviously a good thing because your body

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.950
needs Vitamin D. But the more melanin you produce,

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.830
the more light it absorbs and so the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.660
less UV light is available for this conversion process

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.190
to vitamin D. So, if you have too much

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.070
melanin in regions with too little sunlight, then you're

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.390
not going to get enough light to produce enough vitamin

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.730
D. So as humans migrated away from the equator

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.530
and into regions with less sunlight, the darker pigment

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.450
prevented enough good sunlight from stimulating this vitamin D

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.060
production. And as a result there were some mutations

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.100
that produced less melanin and they were selected for

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.660
to allow more sunlight back into the cell. Just

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.620
enough sunlight so they could get some vitamin D3 but

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.370
not so much sunlight that it's causing a heavy mutation burden. One allele that

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.320
was selected for in an environment with less UV rays is an SNV contained in the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.710
tyrosinase coding region on chromosome 11. Here's

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.520
the original sequence. And here's the variant sequence.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.080
I want you to identify the would be codon with the mutation by selecting which

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.850
region you think it's in here. And then determine the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.210
type of coding region mutation that it is by selecting

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.340
silent, missense, or nonsense. Remember, use your genetic code if

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.920
you need it. It's in the instructor's notes in this page.
