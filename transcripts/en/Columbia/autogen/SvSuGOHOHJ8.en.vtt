but otherwise we'll just deal with them

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060
but otherwise we'll just deal with them
 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.390
but otherwise we'll just deal with them
as as you have them and minimize the

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400
as as you have them and minimize the
 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.410

talk about research regulation more

and then we'll have time for discussion
 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.270
and then we'll have time for discussion
so the ethics of research do not proceed

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280

the development of gangrene was then
 

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.900
the development of gangrene was then
observed until the person died not that

created a tribunal and some basic

because it clearly was not what was

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:45.870
because it clearly was not what was

answer is that the tribunal went to the

answer is that the tribunal went to the

because most other medical researchers

00:39:36.059 --> 00:39:39.769
it's a little hard to argue that that
was not correct let me pause for a

00:39:39.769 --> 00:39:39.779
was not correct let me pause for a
 

00:39:39.779 --> 00:39:42.440
was not correct let me pause for a
second here this is the historical part

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:42.450
second here this is the historical part
 

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:44.719
second here this is the historical part
of the talk i'm going to move now to

00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:44.729
of the talk i'm going to move now to
 

00:39:44.729 --> 00:39:46.459
of the talk i'm going to move now to
talk a little bit about where we may be

00:39:46.459 --> 00:39:46.469
talk a little bit about where we may be
 

00:39:46.469 --> 00:39:49.579
talk a little bit about where we may be
going some hot issues and and the

00:39:49.579 --> 00:39:49.589
going some hot issues and and the
 

00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:50.989
going some hot issues and and the
direction in which the field may be

00:39:50.989 --> 00:39:50.999
direction in which the field may be
 

00:39:50.999 --> 00:39:53.180
direction in which the field may be
evolving but let's see if you've got

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:53.190
evolving but let's see if you've got
 

00:39:53.190 --> 00:40:01.490
evolving but let's see if you've got
questions or comments

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.500
 
 

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:09.720
 
by the

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:09.730
 
 

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.480
 
yeah the transcripts of the trials which

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:12.490
yeah the transcripts of the trials which
 

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:14.370
yeah the transcripts of the trials which
are published are actually sort of

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:14.380
are published are actually sort of
 

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:20.550
are published are actually sort of
interesting to to read they made a

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560
interesting to to read they made a
 

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:23.760
interesting to to read they made a
number of arguments in their defense one

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:23.770
number of arguments in their defense one
 

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.070
number of arguments in their defense one
what one was we're only following orders

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:26.080
what one was we're only following orders
 

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.340
what one was we're only following orders
a second was these people were going to

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:29.350
a second was these people were going to
 

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:33.090
a second was these people were going to
die anyway it wasn't because of us that

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:33.100
die anyway it wasn't because of us that
 

00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.650
die anyway it wasn't because of us that
they were going to die they were in the

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:34.660
they were going to die they were in the
 

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.420
they were going to die they were in the
death camps they were going to die and

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:36.430
death camps they were going to die and
 

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:42.660
death camps they were going to die and
so to benefit humankind we decided to do

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:42.670
so to benefit humankind we decided to do
 

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.090
so to benefit humankind we decided to do
these experiments because they were

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:45.100
these experiments because they were
 

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.340
these experiments because they were
going to die anyway and why waste their

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:47.350
going to die anyway and why waste their
 

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:49.260
going to die anyway and why waste their
lives when their deaths could actually

00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:49.270
lives when their deaths could actually
 

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:53.070
lives when their deaths could actually
contribute to the advancement of human

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:53.080
contribute to the advancement of human
 

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.570
contribute to the advancement of human
knowledge and there were appeals to the

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:57.580
knowledge and there were appeals to the
 

00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.310
knowledge and there were appeals to the
importance of the work that had been

00:40:59.310 --> 00:40:59.320
importance of the work that had been
 

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:01.560
importance of the work that had been
done which pretty uniformly today is

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:01.570
done which pretty uniformly today is
 

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:03.830

generally agreed to have been worthless

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:03.840
generally agreed to have been worthless
 

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.060
generally agreed to have been worthless
there's some arguments about rare

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.070
there's some arguments about rare
 

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.970
there's some arguments about rare
exceptions but by and large the studies

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:08.980
exceptions but by and large the studies
 

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:11.940
exceptions but by and large the studies
were were worthless but but those were

00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:11.950
were were worthless but but those were

the those were the essence of the
 

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:16.470
the those were the essence of the
defense claims yeah these into the

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480
defense claims yeah these into the
 

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.930
defense claims yeah these into the

nineteen seventy one and then it really

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:31.370
nineteen seventy one and then it really
 

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:35.230
nineteen seventy one and then it really
doesn't break until 72 so they had no

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:35.240
doesn't break until 72 so they had no
 

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:37.960
doesn't break until 72 so they had no
idea of that but they did argue in their

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:37.970
idea of that but they did argue in their
 

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.680
idea of that but they did argue in their
defense that they were being held to a

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:41.690
defense that they were being held to a
 

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.540
defense that they were being held to a
standard that nobody else was being held

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:43.550
standard that nobody else was being held

nobody got consent from patients prior

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480
nobody got consent from patients prior
 

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.380
nobody got consent from patients prior
to doing research and you know as I say

00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:56.390
to doing research and you know as I say
 

00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:58.390
to doing research and you know as I say
there was some validity to the argument

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400
there was some validity to the argument
 

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.210
there was some validity to the argument
but it's also true that much of what

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:01.220
but it's also true that much of what
 

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.820
but it's also true that much of what
they did looked more like torture than

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:03.830
they did looked more like torture than
 

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:07.260
they did looked more like torture than
it looked like genuine medical research

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:07.270
it looked like genuine medical research
 

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:09.550
it looked like genuine medical research

if you're interested Miriam I can
 

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:13.740
if you're interested Miriam I can
suggest some books that are really good

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:13.750
suggest some books that are really good

00:54:38.610 --> 00:54:38.620
percent of requests for changes to
 

00:54:38.620 --> 00:54:40.770
percent of requests for changes to
protocols were for changes to the

00:54:40.770 --> 00:54:40.780
protocols were for changes to the
 

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:42.960
protocols were for changes to the
wording of the consent forms which

00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:42.970
wording of the consent forms which
 

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:47.240
wording of the consent forms which
nobody reads is a little secret and

00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:47.250
nobody reads is a little secret and
 

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.830
nobody reads is a little secret and
investigators as a result have also

00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:49.840
investigators as a result have also
 

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.600
investigators as a result have also
learned that they ought to put a lot of

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:51.610
learned that they ought to put a lot of
 

00:54:51.610 --> 00:54:53.280
learned that they ought to put a lot of
effort into writing their forms and

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:53.290
effort into writing their forms and
 

00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:55.650
effort into writing their forms and
maybe less effort into making sure their

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:55.660
maybe less effort into making sure their
 

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.290
maybe less effort into making sure their
subjects understand what the studies are

00:54:58.290 --> 00:54:58.300
subjects understand what the studies are
 

00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.560
subjects understand what the studies are
about because nobody goes back to look

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:01.570
about because nobody goes back to look
 

00:55:01.570 --> 00:55:03.000
about because nobody goes back to look
at whether or not the subjects

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:03.010
at whether or not the subjects
 

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:05.940
at whether or not the subjects
understand all they look at are the

00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:05.950
understand all they look at are the
 

00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:10.680
understand all they look at are the
forms the forms have gotten longer and

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:10.690
forms the forms have gotten longer and
 

00:55:10.690 --> 00:55:12.120
forms the forms have gotten longer and
longer i'm not going to read you the

longer i'm not going to read you the
 

00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:13.530

numbers but take that as a
 

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:17.280

generalization and the question is what

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:17.290
generalization and the question is what
 

00:55:17.290 --> 00:55:21.000
generalization and the question is what
can we do about it well there are some

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:21.010
can we do about it well there are some
 

00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:24.000
can we do about it well there are some
things that are being tested and

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:24.010
things that are being tested and
 

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:25.470

reviewing what actually happens not
 

00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.490
reviewing what actually happens not
what's proposed that is you could go

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:10.500
what's proposed that is you could go
 

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:14.569
what's proposed that is you could go
back and ask how well the protocols were

00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579
back and ask how well the protocols were
 

00:57:14.579 --> 00:57:16.819
back and ask how well the protocols were
implemented did subjects actually

00:57:16.819 --> 00:57:16.829
implemented did subjects actually
 

00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:18.799
implemented did subjects actually
understand what they were told as

00:57:18.799 --> 00:57:18.809
understand what they were told as
 

00:57:18.809 --> 00:57:20.599
understand what they were told as
opposed to would they be likely to

00:57:20.599 --> 00:57:20.609
opposed to would they be likely to
 

00:57:20.609 --> 00:57:23.660
opposed to would they be likely to
understand and you can build in to a

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:23.670
understand and you can build in to a
 

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:27.260
understand and you can build in to a
retrospective review process a mechanism

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:27.270
retrospective review process a mechanism
 

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:29.470
retrospective review process a mechanism
for appellate review which doesn't exist

00:57:29.470 --> 00:57:29.480
for appellate review which doesn't exist
 

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:33.440
for appellate review which doesn't exist
now right now I arbys are the court of

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:33.450
now right now I arbys are the court of
 

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:36.200
now right now I arbys are the court of
last resort they say no your only

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:36.210
last resort they say no your only
 

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:37.940
last resort they say no your only
alternative is to go right back to that

00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:37.950
alternative is to go right back to that
 

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:41.030
alternative is to go right back to that
same IRB and ask again maybe more nicely

00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040
same IRB and ask again maybe more nicely
 

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:43.670
same IRB and ask again maybe more nicely
this time so there's a great deal of

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680
this time so there's a great deal of
 

00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.980
this time so there's a great deal of
sentiment building for rethinking I

00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:45.990
sentiment building for rethinking I
 

00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:54.370
sentiment building for rethinking I
arbys a couple of hands yeah disappear

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:54.380
arbys a couple of hands yeah disappear
 

00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:58.549
arbys a couple of hands yeah disappear
yeah so the question is is focused on

00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559
yeah so the question is is focused on
 

00:57:58.559 --> 00:58:00.349
yeah so the question is is focused on
what's happened in the last two years

00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359
what's happened in the last two years
 

00:58:00.359 --> 00:58:02.270
what's happened in the last two years
with that advanced notice of proposed

with that advanced notice of proposed
 

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.920
with that advanced notice of proposed
rulemaking which is nothing there was a

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:05.930
rulemaking which is nothing there was a
 

00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:09.079

public comment period and we've heard

00:58:09.079 --> 00:58:09.089
public comment period and we've heard
 

00:58:09.089 --> 00:58:12.770
public comment period and we've heard
nothing from HHS since that point in

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:12.780
nothing from HHS since that point in
 

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:19.910
nothing from HHS since that point in
time why I don't know for sure and HHS

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920
time why I don't know for sure and HHS
 

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.530
time why I don't know for sure and HHS
isn't talking about this

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:23.540
isn't talking about this
 

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:28.760
isn't talking about this
my guess is that this is a sensitive

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:28.770
my guess is that this is a sensitive
 

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:31.640
my guess is that this is a sensitive
area whatever you do hear somebody is

00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:31.650
area whatever you do hear somebody is
 

00:58:31.650 --> 00:58:35.090
area whatever you do hear somebody is
going to object to it and the pressure

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:35.100
going to object to it and the pressure
 

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.990
going to object to it and the pressure
to move forward may have lessened with

00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000
to move forward may have lessened with
 

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.880
to move forward may have lessened with
some personnel changes in the federal

more directly to your question do the

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500
courts take consent seriously and how

they deal with the consent forms in
 

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:50.240
they deal with the consent forms in
these cases I would say they deal with

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:50.250
these cases I would say they deal with
 

01:08:50.250 --> 01:08:51.680

if it was on the form the person read it

if it was on the form the person read it

and understood it if their signature is
 

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.520
and understood it if their signature is
at the bottom of the form so there's a

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:07.530
at the bottom of the form so there's a
 

01:09:07.530 --> 01:09:12.800
