1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,010
Okay. We're talking about
acid derivatives, uh,

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,550
where we started last time
talking about ACL insertions,

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:10,350
although I'm not sure
I mentioned the term.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,300
And then about reactivity at the
position adjacent to carbon eels,

5
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:20,280
Alpha reactivity and condensation
reactions, which are related to that,

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,210
which are chapters 18
and 19 in the Jones tax.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,680
So a cell insertion is to put an atom in
the bond between the r and the carbonyl

8
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:36,840
group, the ACL group. So you just moved
the, our aside and put x in there.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,570
Okay. So x can be an oxygen, uh,

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,140
the buyer villiger reaction of ketones.
It can be,

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,330
uh, an Nh group. So you can
make an amine from a key tone.

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,570
It can be a ch two group,
so you from which, uh,

13
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,930
inserted into the carboxylic acid.
So in the first case,

14
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:05,931
you get a ketone transformed to an
Ester in the second case of ketone

15
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:11,520
transformed to a mid, in the third
case, it's an acid, goes to an acid,

16
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:14,670
but it's an asset that's
longer by one carbon.

17
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:19,890
Can you think of any other ways of
having an acid and making an acid that's

18
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,480
longer by one carbon?

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,970
It has to be sort of a roundabout way.

20
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,840
You could go from the acid to the alcohol,

21
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,073
right

22
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,840
from the alcohol to the
haylight. Now you've got
something you can make reactive.

23
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:40,390
It's reactive in itself.
The Halo lied.

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,830
You could displace it with
a carbon nucleophile that
would add one carbon to the

25
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:48,580
chain. So it could be CN, right?

26
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,390
And then we know you can hydrolyze
Sia and to make a carboxylic acid.

27
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,240
So that would be one one unit longer.

28
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Or once you have the Alk Hill haylight
you can make it into a grin are reagent

29
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:06,610
or an Kia lithium. And they had CO2, which
is a carboxylic acid. Again, one way.

30
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:10,030
So there are many ways,
as we said last time to skin the cat.

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,770
But one way is this aren't I stared
procedure, which, which gives good yields.

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,800
So we starting to talk about the
buyer villiger a reaction last time.

33
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,050
And um,

34
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm going to put it on the right some
more on the board here with this.

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,030
No,
it's this one.

36
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,060
Okay.

37
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,340
So as we said last time,
the buyer Villinger reaction
hopes this is, I thought I,

38
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,663
yeah,

39
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,660
it's supposed to turn that projector off.

40
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,290
MMM.

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,180
I think I'll just
turn it off

42
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,850
and we'll use the side
ones for the rest of the,

43
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,240
okay. So the buyer Villinger reaction
as we said, starts with a key tone.

44
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:35,900
Yeah.

45
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,930
And reacts with that.

46
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,603
Okay.

47
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,290
Per Roxie acid.

48
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,950
Okay.

49
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,670
Which is of course an acid.
It's got a PK,

50
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,600
I think about seven or something like
that. So we can get the anti in here.

51
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,273
Okay.

52
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,200
Okay.
We could add the acid and make the,

53
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,280
the analog of a Hemi Quito.

54
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:26,540
But, uh, uh, instead

55
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,280
we don't have a leaving
group here that we can leave.

56
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:35,110
It looks like the only leaving group is
that, but there's a fancy way to do it,

57
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,740
which is this can make these electrons
of high energy so we can use those

58
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:41,710
electrons.

59
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,430
Okay.

60
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,170
To displace the leaving group.

61
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,680
So now we have Si.

62
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,310
Oh, our prime. Oh,

63
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,960
are,
okay.

64
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,810
So we've inserted that oxygen between
the originally ACL carbon and the,

65
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:05,660
our group.
So we have an Ester.

66
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,310
Yeah.

67
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,150
Plus, of course, the carboxylic
acid, which was a good leaving group.

68
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,010
Yeah. And I ended the
carboxylic acid. Now, uh,

69
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,290
I indicated here that we had different
art groups or could have different r

70
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,640
groups are in our prime.

71
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,680
The question obviously
arises of which one, uh,

72
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,480
which one migrates which
Esther do you get? Uh,

73
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,170
now this has,
this is called migratory aptitude.

74
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,403
Yeah.

75
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,510
And it comes in a reasonable order.
H

76
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,820
tertiary,
radical secondary,

77
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,280
primary
and c h three.

78
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,340
But I didn't tell you whether this is
increasing or decreasing in migratory

79
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,850
aptitude.
So what is the group that shifts?

80
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,580
Is that a cat ion or
radical or an an eye on,

81
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,370
what am I showing my curve
when our moves over?

82
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,820
Does it move without electrons with one
electron or with a pair of electrons

83
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:47,470
with a pair of electrons.
So it's r minus that moves.

84
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,610
Okay. At least it's a height. It's a myth.

85
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,550
I'd or an and shift.

86
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,880
When you say like the Meth,
I'd shift now.

87
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,790
So do you think methyl is the best
or the worst? That shifting say,

88
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,570
compared with a tertiary,
which should be the best?

89
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:19,470
Suppose that were a cad ion on that
we're shifting, which would be best?

90
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,880
Well, yeah. What do you think?

91
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,510
Which is the best cat? [inaudible] methyl.
A primary. A secondary. A tertiary.

92
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,773
Okay.

93
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,240
Yeah,
tertiary.

94
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:38,470
So if it's just the opposite with an ions,

95
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,370
right?
So if it's an an eye on the shifting,

96
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,410
then one would predict that methyl would
be the thing that would be easiest to

97
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:49,630
shift and tertiary would be the hardest.

98
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,760
But in fact h is better than
this and this is better. Better,

99
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,780
better, right? So it's not the best.

100
00:07:58,781 --> 00:08:03,700
And I on that shifts,
it's the best cat die on the shifts.

101
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,820
Doesn't that seem curious?

102
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:14,420
But the reason is that it doesn't break
completely away to become our minus,

103
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,990
right?
It's electrons

104
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,640
which have been boosted and energy by
having this charge next door are being

105
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:28,290
shared with sigma star here.

106
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,503
Right.

107
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,330
So in fact, those electrons have to be
given to something else in order for the

108
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:37,920
rearrangement to take place.

109
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,610
If it were an alcaide shift in which
they are pulled away to become an ion and

110
00:08:44,071 --> 00:08:48,480
then attacked sigma star,
then the best anti and would do it.

111
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,730
But that's not the way it goes.

112
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:55,731
It's exactly the opposite because it
actually is giving up electrons in the

113
00:08:55,771 --> 00:09:00,150
process of shifting. These electrons
are being given the sigma star,

114
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,310
so it's the best cat on migrates fast,
fastest,

115
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,690
which seems sort of funny when you
say that it's an alcaide shift. Okay.

116
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:22,501
Uh,

117
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:27,501
one other feature is that if you have,

118
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,950
um,
if the group that's migrating

119
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,650
is Kyrell,

120
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,070
then since you're just
moving these electrons over,

121
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,860
it's not any kind of backside attack.

122
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,630
So the are in the product.
We'll retain stereochemistry.

123
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,140
Okay.
This is the buyer villiger reaction.

124
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,710
So that inserts and oxygen.

125
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:31,310
Then we said that the
Beckman Rearrangement, uh,

126
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,770
notice that these are old.

127
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:36,310
Remember the buyer villiger was done at
the same time that Gomberg was there.

128
00:10:36,311 --> 00:10:40,690
Essentially 1900, roughly. The
Beckman rearrangement is 1886.

129
00:10:40,691 --> 00:10:42,010
This was done by,
uh,

130
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:47,190
one of the few organic chemists who was
also a physical chemist backed bond.

131
00:10:47,201 --> 00:10:52,150
He invented a very, very
sensitive thermometer as
well and worked in the same,

132
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,810
uh, uh, department with Austin,
all whom we mentioned before.

133
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,600
But the, uh, the back of Henri
rearrangement puts a nitrogen in,

134
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,700
so it starts with a key town

135
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,970
like cyclohexanone and inserts a nitrogen.

136
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,283
Okay.

137
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,440
And the bond between carbon and
oxygen and the reagent that does it.

138
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,473
Okay.

139
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,740
Is hydroxyl mean

140
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,633
okay.

141
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,560
And then treated with acid.

142
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,700
So we already talked about
what a means do with ketones.

143
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:35,750
They give him means and
it's especially good to do.

144
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,380
Yeah.

145
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,380
For a means you remember that have
unshared pairs that are interacting

146
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,620
unfavorably.

147
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,993
Yeah.

148
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:52,850
So you'll lose water and
generate what's called an

149
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,823
yeah.

150
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,900
Now the backbone rearrangement happens
when this is treated with strong acid.

151
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,370
You could imagine it protonated and
the nitrogen, it probably does that,

152
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,680
but one it does it,
it comes off again.

153
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,620
But it can protonate the oxygen as well.

154
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,423
No.

155
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,110
And now we have the leaving group,

156
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,950
but in plus doesn't look like
us or such a very good cad ion.

157
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,340
So in fact,
what you use is the electrons here.

158
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,090
These electrons shift up. So
it's very much likely, uh,

159
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,080
r minus R R plus if you
wish shift in that case.

160
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,073
Oops.
Sorry.

161
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,580
Some part of me that this is
the C. Alright. It explicitly,

162
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,610
and we have the on here.

163
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,660
All right.
Uh,

164
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,000
double bond here.

165
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,913
Yeah.

166
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:28,030
And notice that since these
electrons left this carbon,

167
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,960
there should be a positive charge
on this carbon in the formula.

168
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,443
All right.

169
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,383
Uh,

170
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,330
so since this is done with water resin,
we can put water on there.

171
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:56,260
Well, actually, let me draw a
resonance structure of this first. Uh,

172
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,020
notice that,
uh,

173
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,860
it's hard to pull these
electrons away to leave this,

174
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,890
what would appear to be a vinyl cad ion,
right?

175
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,110
But remember that the nitrogen has a
pair of electrons in its Pi system.

176
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:14,350
Uh, me just stuck on this.
I got that right. Yeah.

177
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,180
It's got another pair of electrons.
These electrons are displacing this.

178
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,880
So they're coming again
backside to that orbital.

179
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,000
But there's another pair of
electrons on the nitrogen.

180
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,980
And at the same time that these
electrons are leaving from this carbon,

181
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:33,100
these electrons can go toward that carbon.

182
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,200
And if that happens, we got a
resonance structure of this thing.

183
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,693
Okay.

184
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,530
Which has the positive charge.

185
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,653
Oh,

186
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,760
on the nitrogen. Right. So it's not
unstable as you might've thought,

187
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,410
but any rate when we add water,

188
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,993
okay,

189
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,670
I lose a proton,
we can get this,

190
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:14,160
which is of course related Al Lily,
Chloe. If we just shift the Proton.

191
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,913
Okay,

192
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,710
so this,
I'm good.

193
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,240
So we've indeed inserted n h into
the carbon eel to Alpha carbon bond.

194
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,710
Incidentally,
this particular bean,

195
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,610
this particular lactone a lactone

196
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,550
lactam.
Pardon me?

197
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,660
A lactone is a cyclical Esther.

198
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:55,150
I'll walk town is a sick
lick Amin or a mid right.

199
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,720
And this particular one
is called caprolactam.

200
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,573
Yeah.

201
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:07,550
And it's of some commercial interest
because if you hydrolyze it,

202
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,070
it becomes this amine.

203
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,690
All
right.

204
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:26,490
Which of course can Sciflies the
amine conform in the mid with the Coh,

205
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,230
but it can also form polymers
where the amine attacks the,

206
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,800
the a carboxylic acid of another molecule.

207
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:39,550
So instead of a ring one can then
get a chain and you can get a very,

208
00:16:39,551 --> 00:16:43,990
very long chain.
This is called nylon polymer.

209
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,000
All right?
If this way

210
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,840
it's called nylon six.

211
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,720
Yeah.

212
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,720
So the six means that there are six
carbons in the chain between the amid

213
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:00,494
groups.

214
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,653
Okay.

215
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,450
Now again,
we could wonder in a,

216
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,940
in a case where we have
different ours here,

217
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,770
which are migrates,

218
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,860
that is which one gets
next to the nitrogen. Okay.

219
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,560
Now one might think that
would be something like this
up here where the best cat

220
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:40,561
ion would move because it's electrons are
being shared with the sigma star who's

221
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,300
that's allowing the water to leave.

222
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:48,670
But it's actually not that because you'll
notice there are two different isomers

223
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,210
of oxy hymns.

224
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,233
Okay.

225
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,500
And if you're careful,
you can separate them.

226
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:05,430
And it turns out that in this one
are migrates, but in this one,

227
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:06,900
our prime migrates,

228
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:13,040
which doesn't surprise you because it's
a backside attack cause displacement of

229
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:15,414
the water.

230
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,710
So it inserts the nitrogen
inserts in the anti bond.

231
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:22,614
The one that's,

232
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,843
yeah,

233
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,160
the one that's away from the h?

234
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:34,923
Yes.

235
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,290
Okay.
So that's the backbone rearrangement.

236
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,470
And then the art,
I stare a reaction,

237
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:04,350
which is up the whole model allegation,
the one that makes the,

238
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,550
I'm Allison one year longer.

239
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,153
Okay,

240
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,370
so you have a carboxylic acid

241
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,040
and insert c h two
in this bond.

242
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,170
And the way that one goes is first to
react with soc all to what will that do to

243
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:43,230
the acid SOCL to remember
that reagent switches,

244
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,380
the wage up for seal
replaces all h with cl,

245
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,370
the same as it does in Roa h
so we have an acid chloride.

246
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:54,670
Yeah.

247
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,360
And now nuclear files can, I can, uh,

248
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,690
do association dissociation
and displace the chloride.

249
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,540
And the particular nucleophile that's
used in this case is called die a zone

250
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,383
methane.

251
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,613
Yeah.

252
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,190
It's a very poisonous
and unstable compound.

253
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,370
It's a good idea not to work with it.

254
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:28,480
It's one of these interesting molecules
that you can't draw a Lewis structure

255
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:29,980
without putting in charge in it,

256
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:32,980
which is sort of a tip
that it might be reactive,

257
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,190
but you can draw not only that
resonance structure, but also this one.

258
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,623
Yeah.

259
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,040
The nitrogen in the middle has to be

260
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,873
positive,

261
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,440
but the negative charge can be
written on either end of the molecule.

262
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:57,640
It's probably better to put it on
nitrogen that to put it on carbon.

263
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,000
But the reactivity is of the carbon.

264
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,930
So this is that these are the
electrons that come up and then,

265
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,423
okay,

266
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,090
lost again. So substitution at the ACL
carbon as we've been speaking about.

267
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,770
So now we have,
uh,

268
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:29,090
c h two n plus triple bond,

269
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,910
which loses a proton

270
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,020
to give r

271
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:45,640
o c h and to,

272
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,270
uh, okay, I'll draw it this way

273
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,230
if I had done it right.

274
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,180
Uh,

275
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:09,560
did I do it took those electrons
in there? Yep. Okay, good.

276
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,010
Uh, yeah. Plus minus.

277
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,460
Okay.

278
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,620
Which is called a diease. Oh, ketone.

279
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,680
No, it doesn't surprise you that
dies. Oh, ketones when heated

280
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,020
and it's often done in
the presence of silver

281
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,420
lose nitrogen.

282
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,520
Can you give an unusual compound?

283
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,013
Okay.

284
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:00,710
Because there's just a same, just to
bonds to that hydrogen to that carbon.

285
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:05,120
It's like a car being,
so it has a vacant orbital.

286
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,323
Yeah.

287
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,840
And An unshared pair.

288
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:12,970
All right.

289
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,700
And now you can see how we're
set up for the rearrangement.

290
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,540
These electrons can shift

291
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:27,260
just as they did in the Beckman
rearrangement, just as they did in the,

292
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,870
in the buyer villiger reaction.

293
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,580
Right.
Which would,

294
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,440
but at the same time,
these electrons.

295
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,270
Okay. Then come here to make a double

296
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,510
bond. So we have c double bond, o

297
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,310
double bond, c, h, R.

298
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:01,200
Right.
And notice that this,

299
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,443
okay,

300
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,630
if we trace through this carbon here
became this carbon

301
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,930
and this carbon became a, this carbon

302
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,680
and it's now this carbon.

303
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,473
Yeah,

304
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,350
so we inserted that carbon between
the carbonyl carbon and the r group.

305
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,540
Okay.

306
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,050
Now we've seen this kind of compound
before. It's an acid derivative.

307
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,430
It's a key team.

308
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:41,680
Yeah.

309
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,320
So it can add water,
as we've discussed before,

310
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,430
to give R, c, h,

311
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,160
c, O, o, h, which accomplishes
what we wanted to do.

312
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,613
Wait

313
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:02,200
c h two now because of
the age from the water.

314
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,840
Okay, so that's the aren't
I stared of procedure,

315
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,470
which LinkedIn's a
carboxylic acid by one unit.

316
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,893
Second,

317
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I want to speak a little bit about the
rest of the stuff we're going to talk

318
00:25:34,571 --> 00:25:39,520
about with acid derivatives is reaction
that the Alpha position that is making

319
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:43,750
an an eye on at the Alpha position and
using that. So like an [inaudible].

320
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,030
But first we should look at the,
at the acidity of these compounds.

321
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,560
Uh, so I'll just use the slide
to talk about that. Okay,

322
00:25:53,561 --> 00:25:57,730
so the PKA of acid aldehyde is 17,
right?

323
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,230
A acetone, we talked about this before,
is slightly more acidic. That is the,

324
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,890
the anti, any or part,
probably slightly less acidic,

325
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:07,660
the anti and isn't quite as stable.

326
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:13,170
19 to two a or two orders of
magnitude in the equilibrium constant.

327
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:14,710
Okay.

328
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,710
Now the Ester is another five
orders of magnitude less acidic,

329
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,590
right? The equilibrium constant
is 10 to the fifth smaller.

330
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,980
Why is it that the ester forms is less
prone to form the anti and by losing that

331
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:34,510
Red Proton than a ketone is,

332
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,223
okay,

333
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,490
I could make the opposite argument. I
could say oxygen is electron withdrawing,

334
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:43,980
which should make

335
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,600
it easy to form an an eye on.

336
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,430
So there must be something else that goes
in the opposite direction that's even

337
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:52,380
more important.
What is it,

338
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,263
Roy?

339
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,570
What allows you to form?
That's right.

340
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:08,990
What allows you to form the anti and at
this position is it's in these cases,

341
00:27:09,481 --> 00:27:13,350
it's that stabilization by
mixing with the Lumo Pi Star.

342
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,000
But in this case,

343
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:20,060
the Luba was always already being used
to stabilize the electrons of the oxygen.

344
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,180
In fact, you could make the same argument
here in terms of hyper conjugation,

345
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:29,181
that the Pi Star here is being used to
stabilize the electrons in a ch bond,

346
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,840
right? So when those, when
that a vacant orbital,

347
00:27:33,841 --> 00:27:36,960
the Pi Star mixes with
the occupied orbital,

348
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:41,961
whether it's ch bond or even higher
than the unshared pair of oxygen,

349
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,570
then they mix and the vacant orbital
becomes higher and less able to stabilize

350
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:52,830
the Ani and on the carbon
here. Right? So that,

351
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:56,910
that's a clear understood.
Now,

352
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:02,070
notice that a cyanide group, as we've
said before, I so called night trial,

353
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,420
has much the same character as a
carbon eel. In fact, this has the same,

354
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,110
uh, this has the same
acidity as the Esther does.

355
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,700
Okay. Now, in an amid,

356
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:19,530
so this amid has a PK of 18.
Does that make sense to you?

357
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,030
What would you have predicted?
Ayesha?

358
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,470
Yes.

359
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,590
If, uh, if the Aldehyde
is here, when you have a,

360
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,540
an unsure that when you have a bond next
door, you get a little bit of, of, uh,

361
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,530
raising the vacant orbital,
right? So it's not so good.

362
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,750
Unshared pair on oxygen is even more
important and makes it a lot of civic.

363
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:50,380
What would you expect if I, instead
of oxygen here, if I had nitrogen?

364
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,940
How about it's unshared?
Pair?

365
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,700
Yeah.

366
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,930
Huh. You got everything right
except the periodic table,

367
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,650
right?
Nitrogen comes before oxygen.

368
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:15,630
So nitrogen has less
nuclear charge than oxygen.

369
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,410
So it's unshared is higher in energy.

370
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:24,420
So what would you expect would
he makes even more with Pi Star?

371
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:28,200
Pi Star would go up even
more and it should be, uh,

372
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,950
it should be less acidic.
It should be greater than 24.

373
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:37,110
And the reason is that
that's not what ionizes what?

374
00:29:37,111 --> 00:29:40,140
Ionizes is a hydrogen from the nitrogen.

375
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,990
So it's like the amid is a little
bit like a carboxylic acid,

376
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:47,320
so it's not comparable with
these others actually. Right.

377
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:51,510
But if you put to our groups on the
nitrogen so it doesn't have a hydrogen,

378
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,630
it can lose then.
Indeed it's less acidic than the Ester,

379
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:59,410
which is what you predicted once
you get the periodic table. Right.

380
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,410
Okay. Now you can do even better
if you have two carbon eels.

381
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,580
So notice that all of these
are weaker acids than water,

382
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:12,970
right?
So if you put them in with hydroxide,

383
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,860
the equilibrium will have the
proton on them, not on the water.

384
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:22,990
Right? So if you can,
especially in the cases up here,

385
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,640
they're close enough to water,

386
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:29,641
water's about 1615 0.7 they're close
enough that you get an that there is some

387
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:34,270
anti entity equilibrium, a significant
amount. So you can do reactions with it.

388
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,860
Right? But mostly it's not in that form.
Mostly it's in the protonated form.

389
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,510
But if you have two carbon eels,
then it becomes quite acidic.

390
00:30:43,511 --> 00:30:47,410
And we spoke before when we were talking
about the myths are Nobu reaction about

391
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:50,660
active methylene compounds,
methylene group,

392
00:30:50,661 --> 00:30:55,661
ch two groups that are adjacent that
are activated by two adjacent Pi Star or

393
00:30:56,321 --> 00:31:00,730
but also that then they become much
more acidic. This one has a pka of five.

394
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,570
Right? And if we have two methyl groups,
it's like going from here to here.

395
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:07,720
The PK is nine. In fact, it looks,

396
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:12,810
it looks uncannily good for that because
if you've got two orders of magnitude

397
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,740
by putting on one methyl group from h
to methyl here, when you put on too,

398
00:31:17,741 --> 00:31:18,471
you get forward,

399
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:23,470
there's a magnitude that's that's
a spurious and how good at it, uh,

400
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,140
how good the agreement is because you see,

401
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:30,460
if you put Esther on instead of
the methyl as we did here, Esther,

402
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:34,930
instead of methyl, the PKA goes up
as it did here. But here it went up.

403
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:39,770
Five orders of magnitude
here, the acidity, one up,
only two orders of magnitude.

404
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,610
So they're really not additive
the way we were talking about,

405
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,740
but it's in the right direction,
right?

406
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:49,750
If you have to Esther's then it's
another two orders of magnitude, right?

407
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,760
If you have nitrogen, it goes
up five orders of magnitude
for the reason that we,

408
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,460
uh, in fact, uh, compared to this one,

409
00:31:57,461 --> 00:32:02,461
it went up seven orders of magnitude
over here compared to the Esther to

410
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,250
nitrogen. It went up six
orders of magnitude. So that
one, it looks reasonable,

411
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,280
right? And finally, uh, if you have two
night trial groups, you can get, uh,

412
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,390
you,
it's still quite acidic.

413
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,200
And notice that all of these
are stronger acids than water,

414
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,610
except the one here which was deactivated
by the unshared. Pair the nitrogen,

415
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,450
right? So if you put these
with base, they'll be in the,

416
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:29,110
an ionic form with hydroxide or alk oxide.

417
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:35,230
Okay. So you can get these, these
anti ions from the simple compounds,

418
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,530
a small amount of
equilibrium and strong base.

419
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:43,220
And for the double doubly activated
compounds and high concentration,

420
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:46,040
if you put strong base in there,
in fact,

421
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:51,041
if you use an even stronger base
like lithium die ice of propyl amid.

422
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:57,210
So amid remember as a
confusing name because it means
both the functional group,

423
00:32:57,211 --> 00:33:01,400
c Double Bond, o n, but it also
means a nitrogen. And I, and,

424
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:05,680
and you just have to know from
context what you're talking
about. Okay. So anyhow,

425
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:09,530
this is a nitrogen and I,
and so it's a strong anti and it's the,

426
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:14,480
the PKA is 36. Right? So if you
were to take this one, that,

427
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,950
that, that you don't get, uh, uh, uh,

428
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,130
very good formation of
pulling off this hydrogen,

429
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:26,030
the one that's much deactivated,
but you put it with this very strong base.

430
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:30,590
This one has a pka of 25,
but this one has a pka of 36.

431
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:35,591
So you have an equilibrium constant of
10 to the 11th favoring formation of the

432
00:33:35,751 --> 00:33:40,370
Anti. And so you could make a
hundred percent essentially or, uh,

433
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,260
just one part in 10 to the
11th. Not that way if you, uh,

434
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,520
if you use this very strong
base. So sometimes even, uh,

435
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,500
these alpha and ions that are difficult
to make, if you use a really strong base,

436
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:58,190
you can get them all made.
Okay. So, so you can,

437
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,340
you have complete formation even of the
amid insulate and not just a little bit

438
00:34:03,351 --> 00:34:07,730
at equilibrium. Okay. And notice
that it's a hindered base.

439
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:10,280
It's not die methyl or die.
Ethel,

440
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:14,930
it's die ice approachable and you want
it to be hindered because otherwise this

441
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:17,030
h isn't so very easy to attack.

442
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,940
It would also be possible to
attack the carbon yield group.

443
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:23,210
Pi Star had the nitrogen to this,
uh,

444
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,230
to this carbon and lose the other
nitrogen. You don't want that to happen.

445
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,950
So you use a hindered one that can
only get at the hydrogen out there.

446
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:36,590
Okay? Doesn't attack
the insulate. Okay? Uh,

447
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,090
now when you make these things, you
have a nuclear fill lake, Alpha carbon.

448
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:44,090
That's why you make them
so you can use carbon.

449
00:34:44,091 --> 00:34:48,560
Remember in the ways we've talked about
it mostly is an electrified while our

450
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:51,110
halogen, uh, uh,

451
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:54,770
the Pi Star of CW Bondo are low lumos.

452
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,930
Here's a carbon that's a high homo,

453
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:59,870
the unshared pair here on that
kind of that Alpha carbon.

454
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:04,760
So this allows you then to form carbon
carbon bonds with the other kinds,

455
00:35:04,761 --> 00:35:06,860
the electrophilic carbons.

456
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,720
So by using that unshared
pair to form a new bond. Okay?

457
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:13,610
So let's look at some examples of that.

458
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,880
And it could be done either with acid
or basic italicize via in the acid case

459
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:22,700
enal and in the base case in oh,
late an ion.

460
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,450
And you know how to do this,
I'm going to zip through it quickly.

461
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,680
So a proton comes in prototype.
In the acid catalyzed case,

462
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:31,880
you get this cat ion,

463
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:36,740
which is very stabilized because of
the unshared pair on oxygen next door,

464
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:42,330
okay? But that can lose a
proton degenerate. Any anal.

465
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:47,490
Okay. But now in the case of
hydrogen deuterium exchange,

466
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:50,430
it's interesting because if d comes up,

467
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,830
we can reverse the state the reactions.

468
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:55,290
We could have reversed it
this way and put a proton on.

469
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,630
But if you have a Deuteron available,

470
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:02,810
then you can do it this way and go
to there and now lose this a d plus.

471
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,920
And what we've done is
exchange in the Alpha position,

472
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,820
hydrogen deuterium in place of hydrogen.
Okay?

473
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,720
So that's the acid catalyzed mechanism,
which doesn't surprise you.

474
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,630
You can also do it with basic analysis.

475
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,140
You can have bass come in and take
the proton generating is an Ino late.

476
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:27,660
And I ion, which of course
has this resonance structure.

477
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,120
And now we have this as we had
here, a new, uh, uh, nuclear fillic.

478
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:37,290
Yeah. Nuclear affiliate carbon. We also
have a nuclear affiliate carbon here,

479
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,510
so we can in the Ino eight,

480
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,780
we could bring in a
deuterated water and do it.

481
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:49,440
So you either acid or base
allows you to exchange that, uh,

482
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:52,500
those protons, protons. And if
there's more than one proton,

483
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,280
you and that Alpha position,
you can exchange the others as well.

484
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:03,230
Now notice that you can also Ras Umyes
in this way because if the other things

485
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:06,960
attached to this carbon,
we're a and B, right?

486
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,190
You can go through exactly
the same scheme, acid or base,

487
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,610
but there's no configuration here.
So if the AE is,

488
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,450
if the H is in front of the plane here,
in this case,

489
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,810
when the h h plus comes back on,

490
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:25,770
it could come either from the
front or from the back. So,

491
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,390
so because this, this thing is
planar and this thing is plainer,

492
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,370
not chiral.
So,

493
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,960
so we've lost the memory of whether the
thing was right or left handed so it

494
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:39,870
could come in from the back just
as easily as from the front.

495
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:42,000
And then we Rasamayi wise,
uh,

496
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:46,560
so either by deuterium
exchange or by randomization,

497
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:50,580
you can measure the rate at which
ina latest formed and destroyed.

498
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,070
Okay.

499
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:57,930
You can also do Alpha halogenation and
it's exactly the same scheme. Again,

500
00:37:57,931 --> 00:38:01,440
the only difference is once you
get the anal or the analyte,

501
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,240
you react it with a halogen.

502
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,680
I've chosen to show IOD and here you can
do it with chlorine or bromine as well.

503
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,430
So you can make an Alpha Halo Ketone,
right?

504
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,220
Nothing special here.

505
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:21,090
Now the product we made was an
eye odo methyl ketone. Right?

506
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,150
But we could also do
the reaction with that.

507
00:38:24,151 --> 00:38:26,970
Pull out if there's another hydrogen
here. We could, we could, uh,

508
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,300
we could do the acid catalyzed or
the base catalyzed and get a dye.

509
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:37,510
I odo compound or can we,
in fact, in this case,

510
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:39,460
only one of the pathways works.

511
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,590
And the reason is that the eye than
the halogen is electron withdrawing,

512
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,230
right? So it's deep. It's makes,

513
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:51,130
gives positive charge to that
carbon partial positive charge.

514
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,230
That means that if you want to up here,

515
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:56,920
you will be putting two positive
charges next to one another.

516
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,180
Which isn't so great.

517
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:03,690
So in fact the acid catalyzed a pathway
disappears after you've added the first.

518
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:09,040
And so you can put one in one I
had in one chlorine, one bromine,

519
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,630
but you can't put the second one in cause
you can't with acid ketalysis get the

520
00:39:13,631 --> 00:39:16,480
anal.
But if you have a positive charge there,

521
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,730
that's all the better for for uh,

522
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:23,260
for losing the Proton and getting
the analytes. So this is even faster.

523
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,870
The second one.
And what do you think happens next?

524
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,470
If you'd have another hydrogen there.

525
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,010
All right,

526
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,360
so there's the,
the base catalyzed of hearts,

527
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:39,350
but now you can do it with the dye
iota methyl ketone and make a try.

528
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:42,200
Iota Messel ketone. Okay, so that's great.

529
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,600
What happens next with base?

530
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,020
Okay,

531
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,680
well there are no, you can't have any
more hydrogens on that one, right?

532
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:52,800
So if you brought in hydroxide,
at this stage

533
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:57,920
it would attack the carbon eel.
Right?

534
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:02,460
But when it does that, you could
imagine the Eoh coming off again.

535
00:40:02,461 --> 00:40:05,970
Although it's not such a good leaving
group, there's a better leaving group.

536
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,590
What's the better leaving group?

537
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:14,430
See I three with three
halogens on the carbon.

538
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,030
It's a sufficiently good
an iron that it can leave.

539
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,280
So we can unzip and that direction.

540
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:25,281
One of these association dissociation
mechanisms and get that because the,

541
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,920
the PKA of, of, uh, of,

542
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:33,950
and then of course you want to transfer
the Proton, uh, the PKA of, of the,

543
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:38,250
uh, Hci three is about 14, so
it's more acidic than water is.

544
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,020
Okay. Now that's neat because
that compound I odo form,

545
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,620
remember CHC all three as chloroform.
This is iota form,

546
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,350
but whereas chloroform
is a colorless liquid,

547
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:53,760
I oto form is a yellow solid.
Right?

548
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,230
So this provided in the
days before there was a Nmr,

549
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:03,510
like if you had a methyl ketone, now you'd
look for a methyl singlet, right? At a,

550
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,860
shifted down, a shifted down field,
right? At a certain position.

551
00:41:07,861 --> 00:41:12,450
We know from Nmr how you'd identified
it in the, in the, uh, Carbon Nmr,

552
00:41:12,451 --> 00:41:16,170
you'd look at a particular place,
right? But in the days before,

553
00:41:16,171 --> 00:41:18,540
there was spectroscopy
to identify these things.

554
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:20,640
How would you know if
you had a methyl ketone?

555
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:26,010
You reacted it in water with bass and I
iodine and see whether you get a bright

556
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:30,770
yellow solid. So this
is a picture, uh, uh,

557
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,610
what you want is,
it isn't a,

558
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,610
I can't remember what just went chair
and you can see here at two test tubes.

559
00:41:37,611 --> 00:41:40,130
This one had a methyl ketone in it.
That one didn't.

560
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:45,200
This one has a yellow precipitate.
So that was a handy way of, of uh,

561
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,010
of identifying methyl ketones
in the days before spectroscopy.

562
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,303
Okay.

563
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:55,960
Now you can do it with, you can do
this Alpha halogenation with other,

564
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,550
uh, carbon eel groups as well.
For example, carboxylic acids.

565
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,230
So we've seen before that you could
make a, an acid chloride in this way.

566
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,000
And since I had it animated,

567
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:10,030
I decided to put it here so you
can review it if you want to.

568
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,130
Right? And that's how you get
the acid chloride. Okay. Um,

569
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:21,450
yeah,

570
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:23,310
but the, one of the most, uh,

571
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:29,060
charmingly named reactions is the hell
Volart Zelinski reaction sometimes called

572
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:31,860
the HV z reaction.
But if you remember,

573
00:42:31,861 --> 00:42:36,360
Ha Hell Volart Zelinski that's another
one you can impress your, your, uh,

574
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,960
roommates with.
So it was held,

575
00:42:38,961 --> 00:42:43,050
did it first and then volart and then
Zelinski at about two year intervals,

576
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:48,120
a flanking 1885 so the hell ards Linsky,

577
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:52,980
I forget whether I've got this animated
here, are not involves PBR three

578
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:55,500
and bromine.

579
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,760
So the same way that SOCL to can,
can make an acid chloride from an acid.

580
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:07,710
So can PBR three in the,
so the HV z reaction,

581
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,110
a carboxylic acid

582
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,520
reacts with PBR three.

583
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:19,350
So you have the acid chloride or bromide.

584
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:22,620
Right.

585
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,950
But the acid bromide is very
good at forming an anal.

586
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,550
And if you have bromine present,

587
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:42,790
yeah,

588
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:44,810
bromine can attack the,

589
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:49,480
a double bond because the cad ion will
be stabilized with oxygen next door.

590
00:43:58,930 --> 00:43:59,763
Oh.

591
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,260
So then when you lose the Proton,

592
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,290
okay.

593
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,800
You have Alpha Broman nation,
Roman nation adjacent.

594
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:11,910
Yeah.

595
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,110
So the carbon nailed group.

596
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:19,010
So this was easy to do
because the [inaudible] acid
bromide is good at forming

597
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:23,780
the, uh, anal. But now it looks
like you would need a store.

598
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,770
You need to keep making the
acid bromide in order to,

599
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:32,610
to continue doing this reaction. But
in fact, this could be catalytic.

600
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:37,510
Yeah.

601
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,270
Why couldn't it be catalytic?
Why do you need only a little bit?

602
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:44,530
You need a full mole of this of course,
because this can react with acid.

603
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,910
Uh, uh, I said, yeah.

604
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,753
Okay.

605
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:02,840
So it displaces the
bromide and we have br,

606
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,540
so the brominated product,

607
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,900
but now in the form of
an acid and hydride.

608
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,243
Okay.

609
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,200
My different, uh, acid derivative.

610
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:19,630
But we also have br minus

611
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,753
yeah.

612
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,700
Which could attack here

613
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:33,110
and then, uh,

614
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:39,830
yeah, then this comes, let's see. Oh yeah.

615
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,710
And uh, what have I done
wrong? Oh, I'm losing the,

616
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:49,040
yeah. Uh, right. And
then, uh, yeah, back here,

617
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,920
because I didn't have the
br, I wasn't thinking, right?

618
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:53,843
Yeah.

619
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:01,690
So now we have the acid plus the
other product you can see is br.

620
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:13,700
So we traded, which one was acid bromide
in which one was carboxylic acid.

621
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,520
Right.
So now that's,

622
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:21,560
this can give this and this is that
this is a cycle that goes around.

623
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:23,690
Okay.

624
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:27,680
So you only need this to get that
started to get the first bromide and the

625
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:29,540
subsequent bromides can come from that.

626
00:46:29,541 --> 00:46:34,541
And the actual product then
ultimately is h plus came off here

627
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,250
of the ultimate product is
the Alpha brominated acid.

628
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:47,553
Okay.

629
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,330
Uh, I was hoping I'd get further
than this. I'm going to go, well,

630
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:57,510
let's see. Yeah, I'll
go, uh, just this slide.

631
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,460
So Alpha alkylation

632
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,160
we promised before that that the
real advantage of having these,

633
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:09,803
uh,

634
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,770
carbon nuclear files is the possibility
of putting an art group on there.

635
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,640
So, um, so you do this with, with, uh,

636
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,090
uh,
I have here.

637
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,110
So you use a base,
you get an analyte

638
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,460
okay?

639
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:42,670
From your ketone Aldehyde.

640
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,593
Okay.

641
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:51,910
And now this, you react with
something like methyl iodide,

642
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:57,300
so,
and electrophilic carbon sigma star.

643
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:02,760
Okay.

644
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,060
And you can make a new
carbon carbon bond alpha.

645
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:11,670
So the same way we could put roll
mean an Alpha or hydrogen and Alpha,

646
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:15,420
uh,
we can put a methyl in Alpha,

647
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:17,893
right?

648
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:23,510
But there's a problem here because we
also have the possibility that could react

649
00:48:23,611 --> 00:48:24,444
here.

650
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:36,680
So, which nucleophile
wins is the question. Um,

651
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:42,580
I think I probably should let you go
now and Wella go onto the resolve the

652
00:48:45,141 --> 00:48:47,860
perils of Pauline and next time.
Okay.
