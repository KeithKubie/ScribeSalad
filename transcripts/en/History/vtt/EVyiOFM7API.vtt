00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:04.637
MIKE: If you want
to find old stuff,

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.973
you have to go back
to where it all began.

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:08.074
The East Coast.

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.509
MIKE: Alright,
we're getting close, dude.

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.712
This is it.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:18.818
[knock on door]

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.387
MIKE: Hey, you Denise?

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.554
DENISE: Yeah, hi!
MIKE: Hey, I'm Mike.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:22.756
Nice to meet you.
This is Frank.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:23.857
DENISE: Nice to meet you.
FRANK: How are you doing?

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.091
Nice to meet you.
DENISE: Hi, Frank.

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:26.359
MIKE: Talked to Dani
on the phone?

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.094
DENISE: Yes, I did.
MIKE: Okay, she said Brad's got

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.429
...some stuff?
DENISE: He's got stuff.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.064
Do you want to come in?
MIKE and FRANK: Yeah, of course.

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:32.298
DENISE: Alright.
MIKE: Of course, thank you.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:35.635
DENISE: Brad!
We got some visitors.

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:37.103
MIKE: Hey!

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:38.571
You Brad?

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:39.672
I'm Mike, nice to meet you.
This is Frank.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:40.740
FRANK: Brad, how you doing?
Frank.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.075
BRAD: Nice to meet you.
FRANK: Pleasure.

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.243
So Danielle says
your dad used to

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.911
work with Marilyn Monroe.

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:46.780
BRAD: That's true.
He worked with her

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.817
on a very early movie that
she didn't even get credit for.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:53.052
FRANK: Was she Norma Jeane
or was she Marilyn Monroe?

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.654
BRAD: She was Marilyn Monroe.
FRANK: Okay.

00:00:54.654 --> 00:00:57.657
BRAD: My dad was a very
interesting person.

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.727
He was interested
in photography all of his life.

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:02.195
BRAD: So I gathered together

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:03.763
a couple of
pictures of my father

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:06.499
with Marilyn Monroe
in some of the early days.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:07.867
MIKE: Oh, Frank,
I'm standing right next to it.

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:10.203
FRANK: Let me see.
MIKE: These are original photos?

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:11.704
BRAD: These are the originals.

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.807
BRAD: My father
started out on set

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:16.876
taking still pictures,
and worked his way up

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:19.245
to being a motion picture
camera operator.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.380
BRAD: Here's a picture
of my father

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.681
dancing with Marilyn Monroe.

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:23.149
MIKE: Oh, get outta here!
Look at that!

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.350
FRANK: Wow, look at that.
MIKE: Frank, who?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.186
That's so awesome!

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.021
FRANK: That is... wow.
MIKE: [laughs]

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.089
FRANK: She's beautiful.
MIKE: Can you imagine?

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.391
FRANK: Can you imagine
how big a blow-up

00:01:31.391 --> 00:01:32.859
I would have of that
if that was me?

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.060
MIKE: [laughs]

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.795
FRANK: That would be like
poster-size, life-size.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:37.430
MIKE: Easy.
FRANK: Come on.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.299
MIKE: Brad's dad
was making big moves.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.669
Marilyn handed him the ball,
and he ran with it.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:43.770
God bless him.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.171
MIKE: Where else can
we look around at?

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.241
BRAD: Ah,
right up here to the left.

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:51.678
Have multiple generations
of accumulated things.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:52.912
FRANK: Whoa!

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:56.082
BRAD: I have so many
items in this house

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:57.884
belonging to the family.

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:01.554
At least five generations from
my great-great-grandparents,

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.523
great-grandparents,
grandparents,

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:04.924
parents, and myself.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.727
BRAD: In a way it's like
living in a historical society.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:11.197
In fact, all the time, I go
to visit historical societies

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:13.199
and you'll see things
in the house and I'll say,

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.434
"Oh, yeah,
I've got one of those.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.602
"Oh, yeah,
I've got that over there."

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:16.603
MIKE: Yeah, and they're like,
"What?"

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:17.537
BRAD: Yeah.
MIKE: [laughs]

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.772
BRAD: What my goals are,
I'm working on

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:22.375
restoring a lot of the house,
making it more functional

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:25.011
and you know,
I have too much to hang onto,

00:02:25.011 --> 00:02:27.547
so I'm trying to pare down,
and there's items

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.649
that I want to find
another home for,

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.285
because I just
have too many.

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.987
FRANK: Hey, Brad!
BRAD: Yeah.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.089
FRANK: What's the story
on this bear?

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:37.924
BRAD: That's an original
teddy bear that I believe

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:41.261
was my father's toy when he
was a, you know, a little kid.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:44.531
It's got to be going back
to the, you know, 1920s.

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.432
FRANK: I can see it's a Steiff.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.001
FRANK: You know, it's got
a little damage on here,

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.169
you can tell the age of it,
it's made of straw.

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.106
It would have had like
a little button here,

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:55.408
would have said "Steiff."
That's missing.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:56.943
FRANK: It's got some
damage on it, you know?

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.378
It's been well played with.

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:01.514
One eye's missing,
a lot of the fur's missing.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.349
But this still
is a collectible piece.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.886
FRANK: Now if this was in mint,
mint condition, I mean,

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.488
like never played with,

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.557
it could realize up to $1,000.

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:12.725
BRAD: Wow.
FRANK: Yeah.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:15.995
This, in this condition,
anywhere from

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.131
300 to 425.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.734
And there's enough of it here
that it's collectible.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.903
I would feel comfortable...

00:03:23.903 --> 00:03:27.840
$200.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.642
BRAD: Alright, sure thing.
$200, it's yours.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.744
FRANK: You got a deal.
Alrighty, I like it.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.446
FRANK: For an entry-level
collector,

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:35.848
or somebody that just
wants a Steiff bear,

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:37.750
this is a cool piece.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.920
MIKE: A lot of people have
passed in and out of this home,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.822
but their stuff is still here.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.358
MIKE: Brad understands
the importance of that.

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.360
But he's still trying
to navigate

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.028
what he wants to keep,

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.064
and what he wants to sell.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.968
Today wasn't a huge pick,
but we had moments...

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.302
and those moments were enough.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:57.804
MIKE: I tell you what.

00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:00.440
I saw a lot of stuff today
I've never seen before.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.674
And that's half of it
right there.

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:02.809
Thank you very much.
God bless you.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:03.876
FRANK: Thanks, Brad.
BRAD: Great seeing you guys.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.311
MIKE: We'll see you
down the road.

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.113
BRAD: It's hard to let
some of these things go,

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:10.550
but I'm happy that
they'll go to homes where...

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.785
than just sitting
tucked away in a closet.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:15.054
[honks horn]
MIKE: See you, buddy!

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:17.056
BRAD: Have a good trip!
