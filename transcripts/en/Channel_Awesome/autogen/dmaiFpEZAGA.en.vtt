very very hard to get them back if ever
so<00:01:22.439><c> I</c><00:01:22.830><c> think</c><00:01:23.220><c> it's</c><00:01:23.490><c> very</c><00:01:23.549><c> important</c><00:01:23.850><c> to</c><00:01:23.909><c> talk</c>

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 align:start position:0%

about that and this video uh I was not

it<00:01:30.329><c> I</c><00:01:30.540><c> was</c><00:01:31.170><c> really</c><00:01:31.350><c> just</c><00:01:31.590><c> sort</c><00:01:31.829><c> of</c><00:01:31.920><c> hoping</c><00:01:32.369><c> and</c>

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 align:start position:0%
it I was really just sort of hoping and
 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
it I was really just sort of hoping and
praying<00:01:32.729><c> that</c><00:01:32.970><c> maybe</c><00:01:34.040><c> you</c><00:01:35.040><c> know</c><00:01:35.189><c> that</c><00:01:35.640><c> there's</c>

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 align:start position:0%
praying that maybe you know that there's
 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.730 align:start position:0%
praying that maybe you know that there's
just<00:01:36.060><c> something</c><00:01:36.659><c> there</c><00:01:36.810><c> that</c><00:01:36.869><c> maybe</c><00:01:37.229><c> I'm</c><00:01:37.530><c> not</c>

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 align:start position:0%
just something there that maybe I'm not
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
just something there that maybe I'm not
seeing<00:01:38.100><c> that</c><00:01:38.340><c> maybe</c><00:01:38.640><c> people</c><00:01:39.540><c> like</c><00:01:39.659><c> in</c><00:01:39.960><c> anyway</c>

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 align:start position:0%

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.539 align:start position:0%

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
could be sort of a fast easy video I

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 align:start position:0%
could do that could also be entertaining
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.930 align:start position:0%
could do that could also be entertaining
when<00:03:08.940><c> I</c><00:03:08.970><c> was</c><00:03:09.150><c> half</c><00:03:09.300><c> right</c><00:03:09.540><c> I</c><00:03:10.519><c> was</c><00:03:11.519><c> fast</c><00:03:11.760><c> and</c>

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
when I was half right I was fast and
 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.699 align:start position:0%
when I was half right I was fast and
easy<00:03:12.060><c> but</c><00:03:12.390><c> it</c><00:03:12.540><c> wasn't</c><00:03:12.690><c> very</c><00:03:12.840><c> entertaining</c><00:03:13.140><c> um</c>

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 align:start position:0%
easy but it wasn't very entertaining um
 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.300 align:start position:0%
easy but it wasn't very entertaining um
and<00:03:14.489><c> I</c><00:03:14.849><c> think</c><00:03:14.940><c> part</c><00:03:15.390><c> of</c><00:03:15.420><c> that</c><00:03:15.480><c> is</c><00:03:15.569><c> that</c><00:03:16.310><c> you</c>

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 align:start position:0%
and I think part of that is that you
 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.430 align:start position:0%
and I think part of that is that you
know<00:03:17.430><c> when</c><00:03:17.760><c> I</c><00:03:17.790><c> first</c><00:03:18.300><c> tried</c><00:03:18.780><c> recording</c><00:03:19.019><c> this</c>

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
know when I first tried recording this
 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
know when I first tried recording this
and<00:03:19.680><c> they</c><00:03:19.739><c> didn't</c><00:03:19.980><c> work</c><00:03:20.099><c> I</c><00:03:20.280><c> mean</c><00:03:20.430><c> that</c><00:03:20.610><c> was</c>

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 align:start position:0%
and they didn't work I mean that was
 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.830 align:start position:0%
and they didn't work I mean that was
about<00:03:20.970><c> four</c><00:03:21.780><c> or</c><00:03:21.840><c> five</c><00:03:21.989><c> years</c><00:03:22.290><c> ago</c><00:03:22.560><c> and</c><00:03:23.010><c> I</c><00:03:24.000><c> think</c>

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
about four or five years ago and I think
 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.210 align:start position:0%
about four or five years ago and I think
something<00:03:25.140><c> you</c><00:03:25.230><c> have</c><00:03:25.379><c> to</c><00:03:25.409><c> keep</c><00:03:25.650><c> in</c><00:03:25.830><c> mind</c><00:03:26.010><c> when</c>

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
something you have to keep in mind when
 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.149 align:start position:0%
something you have to keep in mind when

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
you have an idea that you're really
 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.070 align:start position:0%
you have an idea that you're really

to<00:14:48.790><c> do</c><00:14:48.910><c> um</c><00:14:49.480><c> but</c><00:14:50.080><c> you</c><00:14:50.170><c> can't</c><00:14:50.410><c> do</c><00:14:50.500><c> it</c><00:14:50.590><c> too</c><00:14:50.770><c> much</c>

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:50.950 align:start position:0%
to do um but you can't do it too much
 

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:52.710 align:start position:0%
to do um but you can't do it too much
either<00:14:51.190><c> you</c><00:14:51.610><c> have</c><00:14:51.790><c> to</c><00:14:51.910><c> do</c><00:14:52.030><c> it</c><00:14:52.150><c> at</c><00:14:52.300><c> just</c><00:14:52.540><c> the</c>

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
either you have to do it at just the
 

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.330 align:start position:0%
either you have to do it at just the
right<00:14:52.870><c> amount</c><00:14:53.140><c> and</c><00:14:53.260><c> that's</c><00:14:53.470><c> hard</c><00:14:53.830><c> to</c><00:14:54.100><c> figure</c>

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:54.340 align:start position:0%
right amount and that's hard to figure
 

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
right amount and that's hard to figure
out<00:14:54.520><c> because</c><00:14:54.970><c> if</c><00:14:55.150><c> you</c><00:14:55.240><c> do</c><00:14:55.420><c> it</c><00:14:55.570><c> too</c><00:14:55.840><c> much</c><00:14:56.110><c> it</c>

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:56.470 align:start position:0%
out because if you do it too much it
 

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
out because if you do it too much it
sort<00:14:57.220><c> of</c><00:14:57.310><c> looks</c><00:14:57.580><c> like</c><00:14:57.820><c> you're</c><00:14:58.300><c> too</c><00:14:58.540><c> hard</c><00:14:58.780><c> on</c>
