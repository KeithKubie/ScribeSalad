00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.860
Welcome to level one
linear equations.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.990
So let's start
doing some problems.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:16.190
So let's say I had the equation
5-- a big fat 5, 5x equals 20.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.540
So at first this might look
a little unfamiliar for you,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.914
but if I were to
rephrase this, I

00:00:19.914 --> 00:00:22.920
think you'll realize this
is a pretty easy problem.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:31.170
This is the same thing as
saying 5 times question mark

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.920
equals 20.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.920
And the reason we do the
notation a little bit--

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400
we write the 5 next
to the x, because when

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.300
you write a number right
next to a variable,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.030
you assume that you're
multiplying them.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.060
So this is just
saying 5 times x,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.420
so instead of a question
mark, we're writing an x.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.520
So 5 times x is equal to 20.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.520
Now, most of you all could
do that in your head.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.990
You could say, well, what
number times 5 is equal to 20?

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.440
Well, it equals 4.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.960
But I'll show you a way to do
it systematically just in case

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.570
that 5 was a more
complicated number.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.800
So let me make my pen
a little thinner, OK.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.434
So rewriting it, if
I had 5x equals 20,

00:01:12.434 --> 00:01:14.350
we could do two things
and they're essentially

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.100
the same thing.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.000
We could say we just divide
both sides of this equation

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.620
by 5, in which case, the left
hand side, those two 5's will

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.490
cancel out, we'll get x.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.590
And the right hand side,
20 divided by 5 is 4,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.870
and we would have solved it.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.260
Another way to do it, and this
is actually the exact same way,

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.010
we're just phrasing
it a little different.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.950
If you said 5x equals 20,
instead of dividing by 5,

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.500
we could multiply by 1/5.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.620
And if you look at that, you can
realize that multiplying by 1/5

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.159
is the same thing
as dividing by 5,

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.950
if you know the difference
between dividing

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.560
and multiplying fractions.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.710
And then that gets the
same thing, 1/5 times 5

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.830
is 1, so you're just
left with an x equals 4.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.880
I tend to focus a
little bit more on this

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.120
because when we start having
fractions instead of a 5,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.980
it's easier just to think about
multiplying by the reciprocal.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.730
Actually, let's do one
of those right now.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:26.925
So let's say I had negative
3/4 times x equals 10/13.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.330
Now, this is a harder problem.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.820
I can't do this one in my head.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.890
We're saying negative
3/4 times some number

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.412
x is equal to 10/13.

00:02:39.412 --> 00:02:41.870
If someone came up to you on
the street and asked you that,

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.040
I think you'd be like me,
and you'd be pretty stumped.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.980
But let's work it
out algebraically.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.710
Well, we do the same thing.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.930
We multiply both sides
by the coefficient on x.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.390
So the coefficient, all that
is, all that fancy word means,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.820
is the number that's
being multiplied by x.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.390
So what's the
reciprocal of minus 3/4.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:12.470
Well, it's minus 4/3 times,
and dot is another way

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.070
to use times, and
you're probably

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.624
wondering why in algebra, there
are all these other conventions

00:03:17.624 --> 00:03:19.040
for doing times
as opposed to just

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.840
the traditional
multiplication sign.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.800
And the main reason is, I think,
just a regular multiplication

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.860
sign gets confused
with the variable x,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.770
so they thought of either using
a dot if you're multiplying two

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.170
constants, or just writing
it next to a variable

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.790
to imply you're
multiplying a variable.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.460
So if we multiply the left
hand side by negative 4/3,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.090
we also have to
do the same thing

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.280
to the right hand
side, minus 4/3.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.850
The left hand side, the
minus 4/3 and the 3/4,

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.280
they cancel out.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.920
You could work it out on
your own to see that they do.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.610
They equal 1, so we're just
left with x is equal to 10 times

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:01.740
minus 4 is minus 40, 13 times
3, well, that's equal to 39.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.180
So we get x is equal
to minus 40/39.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.930
And I like to leave
my fractions improper

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.170
because it's easier
to deal with them.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.185
But you could also view
that-- that's minus--

00:04:14.185 --> 00:04:16.310
if you wanted to write it
as a mixed number, that's

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.130
minus 1 and 1/39.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.220
I tend to keep it like this.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.160
Let's check to make
sure that's right.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.770
The cool thing about algebra is
you can always get your answer

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.230
and put it back into
the original equation

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.355
to make sure you are right.

00:04:29.355 --> 00:04:34.860
So the original equation
was minus 3/4 times x,

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.940
and here we'll substitute
the x back into the equation.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.150
Wherever we saw x, we'll
now put our answer.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:49.550
So it's minus 40/39, and
our original equation

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.786
said that equals 10/13.

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:54.170
Well, and once
again, when I just

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.260
write the 3/4 right next to
the parentheses like that,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.060
that's just another
way of writing times.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:08.132
So minus 3 times minus
40, it is minus 100--

00:05:08.132 --> 00:05:10.340
Actually, we could do
something a little bit simpler.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.370
This 4 becomes a 1
and this becomes a 10.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.740
If you remember when you're
multiplying fractions,

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.480
you can simplify it like that.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.390
So it actually becomes
minus-- actually, plus 30,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.970
because we have a minus times
a minus and 3 times 10, over,

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.550
the 4 is now 1, so all
we have left is 39.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:39.250
And 30/39, if we divide the
top and the bottom by 3,

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.130
we get 10 over 13, which
is the same thing as what

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.050
the equation said
we would get, so we

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.597
know that we've got
the right answer.

00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:50.680
Let's do one more problem.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:01.532
Minus 5/6x is equal to 7/8.

00:06:01.532 --> 00:06:02.990
And if you want to
try this problem

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.570
yourself, now's a
good time to pause,

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.400
and I'm going to start
doing the problem right now.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.010
So same thing.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.090
What's the reciprocal
of minus 5/6?

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.700
Well, it's minus 6/5.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.710
We multiply that.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.620
If you do that on
the left hand side,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.750
we have to do it on the
right hand side as well.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.430
Minus 6/5.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.920
The left hand side, the
minus 6/5 and the minus 5/6

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.660
cancel out.

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.030
We're just left with x.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.150
And the right hand
side, we have,

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.740
well, we can divide both
the 6 and the 8 by 2,

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.330
so this 6 becomes negative 3.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.882
This becomes 4.

00:06:42.882 --> 00:06:45.575
7 times negative
3 is minus 21/20.

00:06:50.087 --> 00:06:52.170
And assuming I haven't
made any careless mistakes,

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.045
that should be right.

00:06:53.045 --> 00:06:55.340
Actually, let's just
check that real quick.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.580
Minus 5/6 times minus 21/20.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.672
Well, that equals
5, make that into 1.

00:07:06.672 --> 00:07:08.940
Turn this into a 4.

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.205
Make this into a 2.

00:07:10.205 --> 00:07:12.680
Make this into a 7.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.280
Negative times
negative is positive.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.710
So you have 7.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.640
2 times 4 is 8.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.615
And that's what we
said we would get.

00:07:19.615 --> 00:07:21.290
So we got it right.

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.710
I think you're
ready at this point

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:25.220
to try some level one equations.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.040
Have fun.
