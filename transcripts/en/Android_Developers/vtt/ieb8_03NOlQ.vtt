JONATHAN KARMEL:
In a few minutes,

00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:04.300
I'll invite
Alasdair, PD manager.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.800
And together, we're going to
talk about the update to Google

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.120
Play Instant since we
launched Instant games at I/O

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.790
just five months ago.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.060
I'll then invite An from
Small Giant Games onto stage.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.053
And she'll talk about
her experience developing

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:20.720
an Instant game.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.040
So Google Play Instant--

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.970
the idea was to really
improve the user experience,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.240
and then directly
have a positive impact

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.650
on developers' businesses.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.480
And let's start
with the user side.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.160
So what is the user experience?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.400
Well, you click on a URL
or you click on Try Now,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.770
and you dive into a
native experience.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.530
And this allows you
to understand the game

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.510
before you install.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.690
And it also gives opportunities
for new discovery experiences

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.170
beyond the Play Store

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.460
And we believe this is
transformative to discovery.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.517
Because playing games is the
right way to evaluate games.

00:01:05.517 --> 00:01:07.600
I don't think you've ever
heard of someone saying,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.310
you have to play this game,
their app icon is amazing.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.140
You say, you have
to play this game.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.060
I played it myself.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.470
And it's awesome.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.600
And that's basically
how you do discovery.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.415
You play the game.

00:01:20.415 --> 00:01:21.790
And then you
determine, do I want

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.860
to spend hours and hours playing
this game into the future?

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.820
This is the exact way
you should discover.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.930
And we believe this is the right
evolution of the Play Store.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.830
So back in the day, you
had the Android Market.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.740
And you got a few beautiful
icons to assess and install.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.820
Then we evolved.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.830
And we said, OK,
what if we brought

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.100
some of the strength of
Google to the Play Store?

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.850
Personal recommendations,
better search,

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.460
a way for us to go deeper
into the catalog as a user

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.330
and discover more and more of
what is possible on Android.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.900
And more recently, we
launched the Play Games app,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.490
which was our first foray into
content-first experiences,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.710
where you saw preroll
videos and starting

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.060
to see the content that
you'll get once you install.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.160
But the future of
the Play Store is

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.290
where it is purely
content-first,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.192
where you get to play the
game first, and then install.

00:02:23.192 --> 00:02:24.150
And that is the future.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.650
And that is what
Google Play Instant

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.900
provides the Play Store.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.070
And we're really excited about
this, because this is not

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.790
a new playbook.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.510
There's been precedents
set in the media.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.770
Every time that media becomes
instant, consumption goes up--

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.160
both the depth of consumption
as well as the breadth.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.540
We've seen it with music.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.190
We've seen it with books.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.600
We've seen it with movies.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.100
We've also seen it with search.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.430
As we decrease
latency, usage goes up.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.910
And we think that's an
incredible thing for users,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.420
because they get to experience
more, but also for developers

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.330
and what is possible
to bring to users.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.580
So that's the user side.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.070
Let's now talk about
you, the developers.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.200
What is in it for you?

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.180
Well, with Google
Play Instant, we're

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.970
seeing better users coming
through your pipeline.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.710
We're seeing more installs.

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.020
And we're seeing
more opportunities

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.200
to bring your game onto
different surfaces, not just

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.890
the Play Store.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.050
When you have a URL
link, you can bring it

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.420
to many different surfaces.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.600
And the developer
community, you,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.770
are responding extremely well.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.010
We've just been live
for five months.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.730
And this is just a small
number of the game developers

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.700
who have adopted in that
short period of time.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.760
And what we believe is possible
with Google Play Instant

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.330
is an extension of the
whole developer lifecycle.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.210
It doesn't matter where
you are for a specific game

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:54.530
on this lifecycle.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.320
If you're a new game that
hasn't even launched,

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.810
use preregistration
and use Try Now

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.320
to drive that new usage
even ahead of launching.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.490
Or it will decrease your
feature development cost

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.920
by trying out new
features in Try Now

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.010
and, before you incorporate
it into your installed game,

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.710
testing it out and seeing
if your audience is going

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.140
to respond favorably to it.

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.260
Or if maybe you're in the
middle, one of your games

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.840
has launched and now you're
just trying to get more users,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.000
you're trying to
augment your user base--

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.280
so this is a mechanism
to reach new users

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.530
that you might have not been
able to reach in the past

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.440
because they were fearful
of that install friction.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.772
Or you have a mature game.

00:04:35.772 --> 00:04:37.230
And now, you're
thinking about, how

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.530
do I bring back some of
those churned users, people

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.820
who have uninstalled?

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.040
What type of experience
can I provide them

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.320
that is a new
feature, a new level,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.115
something they haven't
experienced yet

00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:49.740
and it'll bring them
back to your game?

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.660
One thing that we have
emphasized from the get-go

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.520
is that we might be
a new platform trying

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.090
to drive new discovery, but
we want the developer tooling

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.700
to be identical to
what you have and used

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.622
in the past for Android games.

00:05:04.622 --> 00:05:06.330
So it's the same game
engines that you've

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.770
used, the same tool chain.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:08.790
Everything is the same.

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.010
And we've worked really
hard to make sure

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.660
that convergence happens.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.820
And what that means
is that any game

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.020
that's live as an Android game
can become an Instant game.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.570
We've seen it with our
top grossing games.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.490
We've seen it with AR games.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.570
We've seen it with some
of our large games.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:27.930
So if you're 350 [? megs, ?]
if you're one gig,

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.910
there is a path for you
to become an Instant game.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.450
And we've seen it with
resource-strapped indie

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.080
developers have found ways to
launch through Instant games.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.610
And we'll get more
and more and more

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.810
into that in the coming slides.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.730
With that, I want to
invite Alasdair up.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.490
He's going to talk about how
you can get even more uplift

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.490
and how we have figured out
ways to decrease the developer

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.042
costs as well.

00:05:51.042 --> 00:05:53.006
ALASDAIR MCMASTER:
Thanks very much.

00:05:53.006 --> 00:06:00.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.940
So as you've seen,
Instant games is

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.090
designed to be an integral part
of all aspects of your game

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.620
design.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.370
So any part of
the lifecycle, you

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.493
can have an Instant
game made for it.

00:06:09.493 --> 00:06:11.410
So now, you can expect
to have bigger launches

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.180
by reaching more users even
easier before you actually

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.552
bring your game to the store.

00:06:16.552 --> 00:06:18.260
And then as you've
seen, when you already

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.130
have an existing title
in your portfolio,

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.165
why not bring some more virality
to it with an Instant game.

00:06:23.165 --> 00:06:25.340
But I think what's also
important to discuss now

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.250
is surfacing and how we
can do that in the store

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:31.020
and how there's different
areas for you, the developer,

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.145
to show your Instant game.

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:34.520
So some of you
here today, you're

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.140
already going to be
looking at Instant games.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.950
And hopefully, all
of you are going

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.242
to be looking into it by the
end of this presentation.

00:06:39.242 --> 00:06:41.450
But I think it's important
that you should understand

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.640
from the get-go that the
Try Now button is really

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:47.670
only scratching the surface of
what the opportunity here is.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.450
There's various placements and
collections in the Play Store.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.908
And then of course, there's
the all important store listing

00:06:52.908 --> 00:06:55.280
page, where you can work
to really drive conversions

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.490
on your page by having users try
your game before they download

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:59.870
it.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.570
Then there's the Play Games
Arcade in the Play Games app.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.370
And this is a brand
new surface where

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.290
you're able to showcase
your Instant game

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.040
and allow users to try it.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.130
And then, of course,
there's the old adage

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.903
of social linking and virality.

00:07:12.903 --> 00:07:14.320
Why not have the
option of letting

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.340
your users share
invites and invitations

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.695
to clans, for example, with
their friends and family?

00:07:20.695 --> 00:07:22.820
And I think what's really
interesting is that we've

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.487
been working very
hard to expand Instant

00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:28.560
games into new areas such as
premium and preregistration.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.680
As some of you here will
know, the premium games

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.230
was previously just a
screenshot and a video

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:34.492
on your store listing page.

00:07:34.492 --> 00:07:36.200
But now, we're very
proud to say that you

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.900
have the option of adding
an Instant game to this.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.690
And what's super important
and very exciting here

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.060
is this can really increase
your store conversion rate,

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.890
as you're giving the
user the opportunity

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.990
to try the game before
they actually commit

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.742
to purchasing it.

00:07:48.742 --> 00:07:50.450
And I think that that's
really important,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.120
as this lowers the crucial
entry barrier to your title

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.370
and also gives you, the
developer, a real platform

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:57.950
to showcase your premium games.

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:00.110
And we've also worked
hard on top of that

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.618
to bring some prelaunch
opportunities to Instant games.

00:08:02.618 --> 00:08:04.160
And what's really
exciting about this

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.830
is that you're able to create
virality around your game

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:09.050
by adding it to
your preregistration

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:10.850
before you've even
launched your game.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:12.890
So why wouldn't
you take advantage

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.070
of this when you have the
opportunity to drive sign-ups

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.010
by creating virality
and really giving

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:21.650
a first taste and a
sneak peek of your game

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.658
before it's even in the store?

00:08:23.658 --> 00:08:26.200
And I think this is going to be
really integral going forward

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:27.770
when you want to
have a big launch

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.090
and really create excitement
and hype about your titles.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.860
And I think looking forward--
this is also very important

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.860
is that coming this quarter
we have the ambition

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.799
to launch the Games Room
in the Play Games app.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.260
And this is really exciting,
as this will give users

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.760
a similar experience
to what they

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.560
know before with
something-- browsing

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.830
YouTube videos for instance, but
obviously with Instant games.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.813
So this will be an
immersive experience.

00:08:51.813 --> 00:08:54.230
And it will allow the users
to seamlessly switch from game

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:57.350
to game in the Games
Room not compromising

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:00.210
on the game quality or the
user experience at all.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.180
And you may be wondering
how we managed to do that.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.710
So as we roll this out, you
will see the Instant games--

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.750
funnily enough given the
instant in its title--

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.948
is actually how it
moves from game to game.

00:09:10.948 --> 00:09:13.490
And we're proud to say that this
is due to a new feature that

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.340
allows us to preload the
subsequent games coming,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.572
creating a seamless
experience and making sure

00:09:18.572 --> 00:09:20.030
that you, the
developer, don't have

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:22.530
to compromise on the Instant
game and the instant experience

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.200
that you've worked
so hard to create.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.740
So I think we can both
agree now that Instant games

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.640
and the opportunities it
offers is pretty incredible.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.300
And there's a variety
of applications

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.160
that you can do with
your instant games now.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.202
And this is only growing.

00:09:36.202 --> 00:09:37.860
And we're working
hard to make it

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.750
even easier for you to
develop these games in-house.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.600
So if you can cast your mind
back a little while to I/O,

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.760
you may remember that we
announced the Unity Beta

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:48.670
program.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.090
And that the Unity plugin
was available on GitHub.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.300
Well, today, any Unity
developer can easily

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.930
create an Instant game and
implement it on our store.

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.890
And we're very happy to
say that the plugin is

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.465
available in the
Unity Asset Store.

00:10:01.465 --> 00:10:03.090
And given the ease
of this development,

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:06.120
we're seeing significant
adoption from Unity developers

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.490
with roughly 50% of the
newly published Instant

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.050
games being Unity-based.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.230
And this is a similar
story for Cocos2d.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.090
At I/O, we announced
the alpha version.

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:16.830
And today, this
is fully launched.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.230
And the IDE experience
for Cocos Instant games

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.020
is phenomenal with the
drag and select feature.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.450
And given the fact that
Cocos is used by around 20%

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:28.223
of developers, this
really is great news.

00:10:28.223 --> 00:10:30.640
So you've seen our commitment
to developing and innovating

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.320
instant games and making it
easier for you, the developer,

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.703
to develop your own games.

00:10:34.703 --> 00:10:37.120
But we believe that this is
an incredible opportunity that

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.160
should be open to
every single developer

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.160
regardless of size,
engineering capacity, or even

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.200
your technical ability.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.200
So I've shown you ways
that you, as a developer,

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.090
using your own
current tooling are

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.970
able to easily launch and
implement your own Instant

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:51.940
games.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.520
However, some of
you simply might not

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.885
have the resources to
commit to development today.

00:10:55.885 --> 00:10:56.760
And you're not alone.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.010
We've heard this from
a lot of developers.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.860
Fortunately, we're
seeing growing ecosystem

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.890
of agencies, such as the ones
here, who you can work with

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.630
to develop an Instant game.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:08.660
So if you don't have the
development resources,

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:09.660
you don't have to worry.

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.920
You're not going to miss out.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.620
You can work with these agencies
to develop your own Instant

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.500
game.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.800
And what's exciting here
is that agencies like this

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.410
are user acquisition
and attribution experts.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.120
So they really know
what they're doing.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.090
And they know how to drive
installs to your titles.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.940
Jam City is just one
example of many developers

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.980
if you've seen that
are utilizing agencies

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.550
like this in order to create
a unique instant experience.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.220
As we go forward, Google Play--

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:39.730
we're going to work as hard as
we can to implement and invest

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:42.250
more in our game engines
and work harder to make sure

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.280
that we can really push forward
the discovery of your Instant

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.550
games on the Play Store.

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.550
We're going to work
incredibly hard to make sure

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:51.010
that we give you the best
opportunity to innovate

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:52.507
on this amazing technology.

00:11:52.507 --> 00:11:54.340
And we really are super
excited to see where

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.737
you're going to take this next.

00:11:55.737 --> 00:11:57.820
Now, I'm going to pass you
back to Jonathan, who's

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.153
going to take you through
some of the impact the Instant

00:12:00.153 --> 00:12:03.925
games can have for you in
a little bit more detail.

00:12:03.925 --> 00:12:07.885
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:10.255 --> 00:12:11.380
JONATHAN KARMEL: So, whoa--

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.233
hello.

00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:13.900
I get to come back
on stage just to talk

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.490
about our successes, which is
great, and talk about numbers.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.880
So let's dive into that.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.160
If you look at the top grossing
game developers, 50% of them

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.900
have already launched
an Instant game.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.032
So as I mentioned earlier on,
adoption has really taken off.

00:12:29.032 --> 00:12:31.240
And we're really excited to
see these numbers, again,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.580
in just five months
of being live.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.215
And then if you look
at just this week--

00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:38.590
so I just had to create this
slide, because I didn't even

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:40.840
realize it until last night,
that all these games just

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.270
started launching
just this week.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.090
So additional game
developers that have launched

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:50.560
includes Sega, Outfit 7, and
NC Soft, InnoGames, and Double

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.202
Down.

00:12:51.202 --> 00:12:52.660
So we're really
excited just to see

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.720
that we believe we're at this
inflection point right now.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:59.860
I think App On Board alone
launched eight games this week.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.170
So we're really excited to
see all the adoption that's

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.240
happening for Instant games.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.890
And I just took you through
the different life cycles

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.370
and how you can take advantage
of Instant games at each point.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.730
And we've already seen
this done by Scopely.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.730
Scopely has basically converted
their portfolio of games

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:21.120
into Instant games.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.270
So if you see for
preregistrations,

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:27.320
they used "Looney Tunes Mayhem"
to use it for preregistrations

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.730
before they even launched.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:32.540
And then for games that are
just in the growth phase,

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:34.760
like "Wheel of Fortune"
and "Walking Dead,"

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.650
they wanted to
augment the user base.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.160
So they focused on Try Now
and driving that virality.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.140
And then for their
more mature games,

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.510
like Yahtzee, they
decided that they

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:47.390
were going to try to bring
back churn users by showing

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.940
an experience that really
excites the user who

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:55.530
might have uninstalled it to get
back into installing "Yahtzee."

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.770
For the preregistration--
this is our first example

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.020
of using Try Now
for preregistration.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.560
And we already drove
20% of the installs--

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.960
sorry, 20% of the
preregistrations

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.580
were from Instant games.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.400
And the conversion, once you've
landed in an Instant game,

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.770
was 53% to preregistration.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.850
And this is a baseline.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.170
We haven't even optimized
these numbers yet.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:18.670
So we're really
excited to see this.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.570
And as we tune this, we
expect the 53% number

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.250
to increase significantly.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.080
But we also expect
that, as users

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.720
start understanding
what Try Now means

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.357
and what the experience
is going to be,

00:14:29.357 --> 00:14:31.440
you'll start seeing
click-through rates increasing

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:35.920
such that 20% can
increase as well.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.130
Now, we're also seeing
better users coming out

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:40.000
the other end of Instant games.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.190
So for Jam City,
"Cookie Jam Blast,"

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.120
they saw a 32% increase
in day seven retention

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.400
for users who
installed after playing

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.530
the Instant game versus just the
normal organic installations.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.300
And what about monetization?

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:01.380
Well, Playtika's "House
of Fun" saw a 48% increase

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:03.600
in revenue per
install if the user

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.970
had come through an
Instant game versus if they

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:08.840
came through an
organic installation.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.840
And for the indie
developers in the audience,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.120
I think this is a
huge value proposition

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.410
for an indie developer.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.930
You've focused on
a quality game.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.100
But you might not have
the same brand recognition

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.820
or same marketing dollars as
some other game developers.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.080
So usually, what happens
when a user clicks Try Now

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.577
for an indie game
developer, or an indie game,

00:15:29.577 --> 00:15:31.910
is they're pleasantly surprised,
because you've invested

00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:33.350
in that quality of game.

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:34.880
So they click on it.

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.220
And they end up
installing at a high rate.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.610
We've seen this with "Gungun"
having a 20% increase in user

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:45.710
acquisition, "Jungle Adventures
2" having an almost 9% increase

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:47.600
in user acquisition,
and "Bubble Shoot

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.940
Pet" having an 8% increase
in user acquisition.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:56.320
Well, I obviously am excited
about Google Play Instant,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.980
because I'm the
product manager for it.

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.740
But I really think
that you would

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.830
benefit by hearing about how
a game developer has actually

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.180
used Instant games
and developed for it.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:08.410
So I'd like to invite An
Vu from Small Giant Games

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.500
to talk about her experience
with Google Play Instant.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.191
Thank you.

00:16:12.191 --> 00:16:13.995
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:13.995 --> 00:16:15.800
AN VU: Thank you.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.930
Hello, hi, I'm An.

00:16:17.930 --> 00:16:21.890
I'm the director of performance
marketing at Small Giant Games.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.080
We are a company
based in Finland

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.790
and have launched
three games, including

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.850
"Empires and Puzzles," a
top 10 grossing game in 100

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:31.190
countries including the US.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.740
We also won the Best
Breakthrough Hit Award

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.690
by Google Play
earlier this year.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.480
So today, I'm going
to talk to you

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:42.230
about how we use data to
build our Instant Game,

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:44.270
what worked for us
and what didn't,

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:46.790
and some recommendations
going forward.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:53.190
Organic conversion benchmark
for the average RPG game

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:55.170
is at 8% on Google Play.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.190
That means that over 90% of
users who land at the app page

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:00.910
do not download.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.450
And we know that through
continuous AB testing

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.460
that App Store
optimization can only

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.060
move the needle a little bit.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.619
Optimizing the App
Store conversion

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.440
is especially crucial when
running high budget UA

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.780
campaigns.

00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:18.270
70% of our UA budget goes
towards driving traffic

00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.609
to the Google Play
Store, so that we

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:22.680
knew that we had to optimize
the store conversion

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.450
rate beyond just ASO testing.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:29.140
The user acquisition funnel
has a lot of friction

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:30.900
at every step of the way.

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.150
But bridging the gap
between decision and action

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.270
was really key for us in
optimizing user acquisition.

00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:44.480
When we introduced playable
ads compared to video ads,

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:48.860
we saw 170% more installs.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:52.910
And we saw that the
click-to-install rate improved

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:59.120
by 38%, thus increasing the
overall efficiency of our UA

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.065
campaigns by 25%.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.490
Encouraged by our
results, we were

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:08.680
encouraged to take
this experience

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.120
and try to scale it
as much as possible.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.130
How can we get as many users
to be hooked to this game

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.300
in under a minute as possible?

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.750
And this was around the
time that Google Play

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:21.010
introduced Instant games.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:27.600
We saw the opportunity when they
introduced the Unity plug-in.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.310
So we decided to
make the Instant

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.530
game available to all users.

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:35.760
The question was how to distill
this multifaceted game of base

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.810
building, hero collecting,
match-three, and PVP

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.920
into a single,
memorable experience.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.780
That's when we used
our performance data

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:52.560
to collect our experience
to build an Instant game.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.320
We partner with the
external developer called

00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.390
Seepia Games to build what
we want to be a streamlined,

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.300
optimized but fun
Instant game experience.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:10.940
In analyzing the data, we
took away some key learnings.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.160
First of all, don't cut corners.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.410
In this first
example here, we saw

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:18.740
that having a
non-optimized tutorial

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.510
does not convert
users very well,

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:24.350
because it left users feeling
confused and frustrated on not

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:25.580
knowing how to play the game.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.550
We solved this problem later on
by scaling down the game board

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:32.930
so that it's easier.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.550
But that didn't work
out well either,

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.230
because the players
dismissed that

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:40.430
as being too simple
and too basic.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.250
And then the final
step was getting

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.820
the right mix of an
immersive experience

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.640
that's complex enough to
hold the user's attention

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.690
as well as streamlined enough
to play without a long tutorial.

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:57.260
We also tested to see the
visual appeal of the game.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:59.750
We found out that
the players prefer

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.120
battling a dragon
over a random shark

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.370
with knives walking
on the beach.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.050
So getting the
visual appeal of it

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:10.800
was just as important as
getting the mechanics right.

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.080
We tested many different
levels and bosses.

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.380
And we found that experimenting
with the difficulty

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.230
rate or the win rate was
very important in getting

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.940
the users to convert.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.760
Our hypothesis was
that, if a user loses,

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:27.060
he'll be more likely to download
the game and try to beat it.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.600
So we create two versions
of every single level.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.210
We've made a hard
one and an easy one.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.580
And surprisingly,
the easy one was

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:38.265
more effective in converting
users to download.

00:20:41.175 --> 00:20:42.800
Building on the
complexity of the game,

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.830
we wanted to create a meta
game for the experience.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.440
So we moved away from
a randomized sequence

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.690
to a more coherent saga map
much like the real game.

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:57.720
And this experience here
saves your progress.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.950
So if you play two levels and
then you don't install it,

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:03.200
the next time that you
interact with the Instant game,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.460
it will take you to the
boss at level three.

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:10.730
Overall, we experimented with
over 30 different versions

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.210
to find the right complexity,
length, difficulty,

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.560
and visual appeal of the game.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:21.250
So if you want to
get started, I would

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:24.700
recommend finding
a developer who's

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.780
experienced in game design and
who has the technical know-how

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.480
to build many different
ideas and concepts

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.450
and iterate on those
ideas to collect data.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.690
Using that data, then you
can find the right length,

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:42.420
complexity, visual appeal, and
difficulty to build your game.

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.170
You don't want to cut
corners, because you

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:50.310
want to instantly wow the users
with the first time experience.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.150
Thank you.

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.500
