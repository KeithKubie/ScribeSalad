00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.610
What I want to do in this video
is take an expenditure view

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.280
of GDP, so that we can think
about how GDP can be accounted

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.050
for, how it can be
measured, and how

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.360
we can see how active the
different parts of an economy

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.770
actually are.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.920
So GDP, market value of all
final goods and services

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.100
produced, not just
changed hands,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.820
produced within a country
in a given period.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.810
And the symbol we use for
GDP, and I don't know why,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.980
but the symbol is Y. Y is GDP.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.560
And so let's think about it from
an expenditure point of view,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.910
to think about what
are all the pieces.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.930
Well, if we're thinking
about expenditure,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.190
who are all of the players
that might have spent money

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.310
on the goods and services,
on final goods and services,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:47.440
produced in our country?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.460
Who are all the people
that might have done it?

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, you could have your firms.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.230
The firms might have spent money
on these goods and services

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.700
produced in a country.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.680
You also have your households.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.300
They obviously could've
spent some money

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.430
on goods and services
produced in this country.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.790
Then you also have
in most countries,

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.460
in fact in all countries,
you have the government.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.640
The government could have
spent some of the money

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.620
on the goods and services
produced in this country.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.780
And if we assume that we're
trading with other countries,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.440
there are other countries
that might have spent money

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.980
on goods and services.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.960
Other, outside, so let's
just write foreign.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.530
People outside of the country
might have spent money

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.870
on goods and services,
so foreign purchases.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.340
And another way to
think about this

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.860
would have been this is exports.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.710
Our country is exporting it to
people outside of the country

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.410
and they are purchasing it.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.641
Now, this is almost complete.

00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:48.140
But if we looked
at all of the money

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.681
that firms are spending and all
the money that households are

00:01:50.681 --> 00:01:53.060
spending and all the money
that governments are spending,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.330
some of what they're
spending might not

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.000
be on goods and services that
are produced in this country.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.780
They might be spending
some of their stuff

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.422
on things that are produced
outside of this country.

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:04.880
So we would have
to subtract it out

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.700
if we really want to have the
goods and services produced

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.914
within the country.

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:10.289
So what we're
going to want to do

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.345
is subtract out
foreign products.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.070
Or another way, the more typical
way of thinking about it,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.740
we would subtract out imports.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.120
So if we think about all of
the goods and services that

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.470
meet this classification,
the final goods and services

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.040
produced in a country
in a given time,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.990
that firms spent
money on, and add that

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.200
to all the goods and services
that households spent money on,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.130
and add that to all the goods
and services that government

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.950
spent on, and all the goods and
services that were purchased

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.300
by foreigners, the
exports, and then

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.980
make sure we're not counting
the goods and services

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.290
that other countries produce--
so we subtract those out-- this

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.790
would give you a
pretty good measure

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.800
of all of the goods and services
produced within a country.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.570
And this is pretty close to
the way the economists actually

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.600
do measure it.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.480
So what they do is they say
Y is equal to investment.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.380
And we saw in a previous
video, investment

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.770
in the macroeconomics
term isn't quite

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.520
what it means in
the everyday term.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.530
It really essentially means
the spending by firms.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.410
So pretty much everything
that a firm spends in theory,

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.032
you're spending that money to
make future goods and services,

00:03:21.032 --> 00:03:22.490
or to make the
goods and services--

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.600
so that's all
considered investment.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.699
And then a little bit of
the household spending

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:28.740
is considered investment.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.372
And that is just new houses.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.142
But the bulk of
household spending

00:03:36.142 --> 00:03:37.475
is considered to be consumption.

00:03:42.917 --> 00:03:45.000
And then everything that
the government spends on,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.430
whether it's the military and
all the salaries for police

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.880
people and whatever
they do, you know,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.810
the groundskeeping
at the White House,

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.410
whatever else, if we
thinking about the US, that

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.010
goes straight to G,
government spending.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.120
And this thing
right over here, you

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.550
have foreign purchases,
exports, minus foreign imports.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.880
So you have exports
minus imports.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.705
So you could view
this as net exports.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.410
If this number is positive,
the net exports are positive.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.350
We're exporting more
than we're importing.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.670
If this number is negative,
net exports is negative.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.210
That means we are importing
more than we are exporting.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.340
But in traditional
expenditure view of GDP,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.580
this whole part
right over here will

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.265
be referred to as net exports.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.356
And so you sum up these things,
which are very closely related

00:04:38.356 --> 00:04:40.230
to maybe the slightly
more intuitive versions

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.400
that we started off
with, and you essentially

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.690
have broken down the
expenditure view of GDP

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.177
in the traditional sense.

00:04:48.177 --> 00:04:49.760
Then in the next few
videos, I'm going

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.660
to start thinking of a
bunch of different examples.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.070
And we'll think about which
bucket it would fall into

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.800
or how it would affect
one of these buckets.
