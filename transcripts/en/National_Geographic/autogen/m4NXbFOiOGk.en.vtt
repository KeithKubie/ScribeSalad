00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.450
- [Angeli] In ancient times,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.280
humans studied the night sky

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.840
and discovered the
worlds of Mercury, Venus,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.380
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.440
But beyond this realm of knowledge,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.890
another world shined brightly,

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.783
just waiting to be discovered.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.870
Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.230
from a distance of about
20 astronomical units,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.740
or 20 times the distance
between Earth and the Sun.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.160
Uranus orbits the star
once every 84 Earth years,

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.023
approximately the length
of a human's entire life.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.350
This orbit causes each season of Uranus

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.470
to last that much longer.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.100
Theoretically, a human living on Uranus

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.440
would experience the
four seasons only once,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.133
but each for about 21 years.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.970
Partially due to its
distance from the Sun,

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.120
Uranus boasts the coldest temperatures

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.950
in the solar system.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.360
These icy temperatures, dropping as low

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.390
as negative 370 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.960
are largely influenced by
the planet's composition.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.920
At about four Earths wide,
Uranus has an Earth-sized core

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.143
made of iron and magnesium silicate.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.430
The remainder,
approximately 80% of Uranus,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.230
is a worldwide ocean
of ices made of water,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.460
ammonia, and methane, the
chemical behind the planet's

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.410
cool blue color.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.930
This icy composition prevents
Uranus from emitting much heat

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.940
compared to other planets,
making the blue world

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.863
the solar system's coldest.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.640
In addition to its extreme
temperatures and orbit,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.213
Uranus has a dramatic orientation.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.820
While the other seven planets
spin on their axes like tops,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.810
Uranus appears to roll along its equator.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.710
The planet is tilted
at a near right angle,

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.390
in which polar regions point
toward and away from the Sun,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.503
rather than upward and downward.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.150
This tilt, thought to be the
result of Uranus' collision

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.720
with at least one celestial body,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.760
has also affected the
orientation of Uranus' 13 rings

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.540
and 27 known moons.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.940
Unlike the rings and
moons of other worlds,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.820
which orbit their home
planets horizontally,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.070
those of Uranus orbit in
a vertical orientation

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.880
along the planet's tilted equator,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.643
much like a Ferris wheel.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.670
Uranus and its many unusual
features were a mystery

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.640
to the ancients, and the
planet was actually thought

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.520
to be a star.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.040
But in the late 18th century,
astronomer William Herschel

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.260
discovered that the celestial object

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.423
was actually a new world.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.190
The scientific community
debated over what the planet

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.080
should be called, and
eventually chose a name

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.263
suggested by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.483
Bode believed that since Jupiter
was the father of the gods,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.370
and Saturn was the father of Jupiter,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.790
then this new planet should be
the father of Saturn, Caelus.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.800
But rather than following the tradition

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.570
of using names from
ancient Roman religion,

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.750
Bode instead opted for Caelus'

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.293
ancient Greek equivalent, Ouranos.

00:03:29.517 --> 00:03:32.340
Ouranos, the ancient
Greek god of the heavens,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.483
was then Latinized to be Uranus.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.220
To this day, Uranus is
still the only planet

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.930
that veered from tradition
with an ancient Greek namesake,

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.573
a status most fitting for
a planet beyond convention.
