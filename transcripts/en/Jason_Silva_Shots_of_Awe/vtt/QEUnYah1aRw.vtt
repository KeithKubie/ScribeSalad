00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.220
This is a fascinating
article making

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.770
the rounds on the
internet recently

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.530
about how the Instagram
generation now experiences

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.070
the present as an
anticipated memory.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.710
The success of photo
filtering apps on social media

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.012
has created a generation
of individuals

00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:41.960
who now believe that
every present moment needs

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.720
to be experienced
as something that

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.360
will be reflected upon later.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.190
And we take it upon
ourselves to design

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.950
what that later moment
is going to feel like.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.420
We're living in two
realities at the same time.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.160
It's what Daniel
Kahneman use to refer

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.940
to as the experiencing self
and the remembering self.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.420
And they're working in concert.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.450
They're saying, be
happy for this moment,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.050
for this moment is your life.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.550
But guess what,
this moment is going

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.150
to be gone like this and all
you're going to have left

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.140
is that photo filtered
vintage photograph.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.640
All you're going
to have left is how

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.520
you choose to
remember this moment.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.010
So you're given a pen.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.780
You're given a chance to
decide how this moment will

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.430
be remembered, and I
think that is fascinating.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.890
We all become artists.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.980
We all become architects
of our mental narratives,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.290
of our historical,
digital paper trail.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.880
We decide who we are.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.949
We're building maps and
those maps are subjective.

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:33.240
I don't think it's a bad thing.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.496
I just think it's fascinating.

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:36.870
I think it liberates our desire
to be artists, our desire

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.360
to be the authors
of our own lives,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.760
and to decide how we remember
things, to decide how we deal

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.960
with the fact that
every moment passes,

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.990
how we deal with that tragedy,
how we deal with that entropy.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.915
At least, we're going to
italicize the memory of it.

00:01:52.915 --> 00:01:55.960
And so yes the present is
lived as anticipated memory

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.435
because that's all we have
is the anticipated memory.

00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:00.300
The present's gone.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.625
It's rich, but it's gone.

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:10.845
And that haunts me,
but we deal with it.
