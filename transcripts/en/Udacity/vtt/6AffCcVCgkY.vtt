00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.670
Just like we learned in lesson three, that there are

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.450
different alleles for the ABO gene, there are also different alleles

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.230
for the lactase gene, but the difference is that the ABO

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.170
alleles, we're in the coding region. You can see here allele

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.680
1 and allele 2. There the star marks a change

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.540
here in the coding region. But in the lactase gene example,

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.400
the difference between allele 1 and allele 2 doesn't have anything

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.450
to do with coding region. It has everything to do with

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.750
the non-coding region. Now remember, you still get

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.930
two copies of every gene, including the lactase

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.400
gene. That counts the coding and the non-coding

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.580
regions. Which combination of alleles would result in lactose

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.730
intolerance? There are three options. Two cytosines, a

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.160
cytosine and a thiamine, or two thiamines. Remember

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.590
the order of the alleles doesn't matter, whether

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.530
it's CT or TC, so we still just have

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.810
three options total. Go ahead and select

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.860
any and all options that you think apply.
