00:00:00.762 --> 00:00:02.897
 Now I want to draw my attention 

00:00:02.897 --> 00:00:05.296
 Away from the madness that is happening in Europe 

00:00:05.296 --> 00:00:07.113
 I go to a place very far from them 

00:00:07.113 --> 00:00:10.277
 To one of the French colonies in the Caribbean 

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:14.181
 Namely St. Dominguez 

00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.529
 I know that I write words wrongly 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.531
 But St. Domingue, now called Haiti 

00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:25.647
 Is the western half of the island of Hispaniola 

00:00:25.647 --> 00:00:29.462
 Which Columbus found for the first time 

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.699
 When he discovered the new world 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.124
 The eastern part of the island 

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:33.741
 Which you can not see here 

00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:35.604
 Because I grew up on the western half 

00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:38.213
 The eastern section is now called the Dominican Republic 

00:00:38.213 --> 00:00:40.161
 It was called St. Domingue 

00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:42.294
 It was under the control of Spain 

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:43.413
 Let me write down what you said 

00:00:43.413 --> 00:00:44.479
 So here is Spain 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:47.321
 You probably do not see the yellow color well 

00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:51.950
 France colonized this aspect 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.281
 I will write Spain more clearly 

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:56.923
 Spain occupied the eastern part of the island 

00:00:56.923 --> 00:00:59.413
 France colonized the western half. 

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:03.461
 Let us move on now 

00:01:03.461 --> 00:01:05.846
 To 1492 when Columbus appeared 

00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:07.736
 It was a Spanish colony 

00:01:07.736 --> 00:01:09.581
 Now I am talking about the western side only 

00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:12.030
 The eastern side continued to be a Spanish colony 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.692
 In 1697, the western section was officially given to France 

00:01:16.692 --> 00:01:19.750
 It was a Spanish colony until then 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.612
 And from 1697 to the period 

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:24.062
 Which we are talking about now 

00:01:24.062 --> 00:01:26.329
 The end of the eighteenth century 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:28.380
 The period of the French Revolution 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.512
 The western half was a French colony 

00:01:30.512 --> 00:01:32.647
 French colony 

00:01:32.647 --> 00:01:34.745
 You probably ask .. you know .. 

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:36.830
 All this madness happens in France 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.098
 Kings fall, people are executed with guillotine 

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.548
 There is a war with all empires 

00:01:41.548 --> 00:01:44.563
 Why are they moving all this way to this side of the world? 

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.834
 And focus on this small island? 

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.504
 Well, the big answer or I think the main answer 

00:01:49.504 --> 00:01:51.165
 Especially from the point of view of the French 

00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:53.503
 There are other historical reasons 

00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:55.460
 I think it is relevant 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.385
 But the main reason is that St. Domingue was in this period 

00:02:00.385 --> 00:02:02.671
 The most - let me write this - 

00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:15.632
 The most profitable slave colony in the world 

00:02:15.632 --> 00:02:18.363
 In the world 

00:02:18.363 --> 00:02:19.930
 These colonists 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.913
 They care about profit most of their time 

00:02:22.913 --> 00:02:25.039
 To a great degree in history 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.330
 This is their interest 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.415
 But you have to think about it 

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:30.463
 Remember, what precipitated the French Revolution 

00:02:30.463 --> 00:02:32.422
 Or, I believe, was the main factor 

00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:34.914
 That France was bankrupt 

00:02:34.914 --> 00:02:37.630
 The bankruptcy of France 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.013
 So you have this small island here 

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:40.264
 Which is considered a slave colony 

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.164
 Their farms produce tons of cane sugar 

00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:45.096
 A business produces huge profits 

00:02:45.096 --> 00:02:47.647
 Nothing happens in St. Domingo 

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:50.216
 France will be embroiled in bankruptcy 

00:02:50.216 --> 00:02:51.010
 And not just bankrupt 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.182
 But also because of those wars 

00:02:52.182 --> 00:02:55.234
 With almost everyone in Europe 

00:02:55.234 --> 00:02:58.247
 So let us remind ourselves 

00:02:58.247 --> 00:03:00.514
 That is happening in France 

00:03:00.514 --> 00:03:01.579
 He will return to France 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.027
 So in 1789 

00:03:03.027 --> 00:03:07.237
 You have been invited by the legislature 

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:10.431
 People in the third district were upset 

00:03:10.431 --> 00:03:11.681
 So they met at the tennis court 

00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.919
 And called themselves the National Council 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:21.811
 They took the tennis court 

00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:24.367
 In fact they called themselves the National National Assembly 

00:03:24.367 --> 00:03:26.294
 Then they were driven out of the room 

00:03:26.294 --> 00:03:28.197
 Then they had to do tennis 

00:03:28.197 --> 00:03:31.222
 There they promised to make a constitution 

00:03:31.222 --> 00:03:34.002
 They began to talk about freedom and brotherhood 

00:03:34.002 --> 00:03:36.350
 And that all men were created equal 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.404
 All these great ideas of enlightenment 

00:03:38.404 --> 00:03:40.934
 And in the time of all this 

00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:46.845
 There was a businessman named Vincent Oger 

00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:48.816
 I do not know if I'm writing it right 

00:03:48.816 --> 00:03:53.498
 He was a rich, mixed-race man - let me write this - 

00:03:53.498 --> 00:04:00.883
 He was mixed race, he had a quarter of an African descent 

00:04:00.883 --> 00:04:08.847
 And three-quarters of them are of French origin 

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:10.497
 It was in Paris for work 

00:04:10.497 --> 00:04:12.811
 And when there was, the French Revolution 

00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:14.396
 And the call of the legislature 

00:04:14.396 --> 00:04:15.281
 Have begun 

00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:16.631
 He said: I know what? 

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:18.382
 I am a rich and educated man 

00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:21.737
 I own land, in what is now called Haiti 

00:04:21.737 --> 00:04:23.197
 But it was St. Domingue at that time 

00:04:23.197 --> 00:04:24.898
 In fact, he had slaves 

00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:26.314
 I would like to be clear about this 

00:04:26.314 --> 00:04:29.618
 He also had slaves 

00:04:29.618 --> 00:04:32.564
 His tongue says: I am good as all these 

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:36.099
 Europeans around me 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.249
 But I do not get equal rights for them 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:39.631
 But all these great things happen 

00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:42.614
 With a talk about a new constitution 

00:04:42.614 --> 00:04:44.048
 Let me delve deeper into this. 

00:04:44.048 --> 00:04:47.514
 So he had put pressure with many people 

00:04:47.514 --> 00:04:50.632
 Thinkers 

00:04:50.632 --> 00:04:56.589
 Pressure for equal rights began 

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:59.957
 Such as the right to vote 

00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:08.265
 And not treated as a second class person. 

00:05:08.265 --> 00:05:10.466
 At first they were ignored. 

00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:13.450
 The National Assembly wanted to do good things 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.383
 But they do not want to do anything too much 

00:05:15.383 --> 00:05:17.383
 As a rich and educated man 

00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:21.057
 As a man equal to them 

00:05:21.057 --> 00:05:22.417
 So they refused. 

00:05:22.417 --> 00:05:32.933
 But in March of 1790 

00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:37.062
 The National Assembly has amended 

00:05:37.062 --> 00:05:46.023
 Provides that all landlords must 

00:05:46.023 --> 00:05:47.539
 - There are other things - 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:56.640
 They must be active citizens. 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.860
 Mr. Vincent Oger and his assistants said 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.890
 It is their victory 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.504
 This is the wording that tells us 

00:06:03.504 --> 00:06:05.306
 That any man possesses 

00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:08.540
 - I own land, I am the owner - 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.290
 Must be an active citizen 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:16.454
 Giving us the right to vote 

00:06:16.454 --> 00:06:20.111
 So I declare that this is a victory for his rights 

00:06:20.111 --> 00:06:22.481
 And to people who have the same rights 

00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:27.193
 He returned to St. Domingue 

00:06:27.193 --> 00:06:28.212
 He said to the governor see 

00:06:28.212 --> 00:06:30.677
 All this madness is happening in France 

00:06:30.677 --> 00:06:32.478
 We have the National Assembly 

00:06:32.478 --> 00:06:35.060
 They gave me the right to vote 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:42.095
 Unfortunately, the governor ignored him 

00:06:42.095 --> 00:06:43.810
 He did not listen to him 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.861
 He did not listen to what he wanted to say 

00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:48.576
 He said he did not care what was happening in France 

00:06:48.576 --> 00:06:49.906
 I will not give you 

00:06:49.906 --> 00:06:52.529
 People like you have the right to vote 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:56.260
 He did not like the governor's response 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.010
 Everything seemed to be in his favor 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:00.078
 Even the National Assembly in his favor 

00:07:00.078 --> 00:07:01.577
 But the governor ignored him 

00:07:01.577 --> 00:07:13.045
 So he started a revolution when he returned 

00:07:13.045 --> 00:07:15.327
 He was treated harshly 

00:07:15.327 --> 00:07:21.827
 He returned in October 1790, ignored by the governor 

00:07:21.827 --> 00:07:23.376
 So he started a revolution 

00:07:23.376 --> 00:07:25.444
 Unfortunately, it did not succeed 

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:26.444
 I would like to be clear 

00:07:26.444 --> 00:07:30.511
 When the revolution began, its aim was not to abolish slavery 

00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:34.027
 He did not dare to give black men on the island 

00:07:34.027 --> 00:07:34.984
 Right to vote 

00:07:34.984 --> 00:07:40.312
 But rebelled to give free men 

00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:43.011
 Who have the right to vote 

00:07:43.011 --> 00:07:45.313
 This was his problem in the revolution. 

00:07:45.313 --> 00:07:48.711
 I want to give you an idea of ​​the demographic structure 

00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:51.563
 Of St. Domingo at the time 

00:07:51.563 --> 00:07:56.711
 There were 500,000 slaves of African descent 

00:07:56.711 --> 00:08:02.362
 There were 40,000 white colonists 

00:08:02.362 --> 00:08:12.446
 In addition to 28 thousand mixed race, free men 

00:08:12.446 --> 00:08:14.611
 Of different races or as you want to describe them 

00:08:14.611 --> 00:08:16.848
 If you want to start a revolution 

00:08:16.848 --> 00:08:21.545
 To defend your rights only 

00:08:21.545 --> 00:08:23.471
 You will need some of these 28 thousand 

00:08:23.471 --> 00:08:28.138
 Against 40,000 well-armed. 

00:08:28.138 --> 00:08:29.205
 If you think it 

00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:32.203
 Perhaps I should speak in a broader sense 

00:08:32.203 --> 00:08:34.306
 He was trying to become part of this club 

00:08:34.306 --> 00:08:36.474
 But if he tried to talk a little broader 

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.755
 Maybe you could have patted 

00:08:38.755 --> 00:08:41.338
 On one of those 500 thousand anxious 

00:08:41.338 --> 00:08:44.186
 But he did not, so his revolution did not work 

00:08:44.186 --> 00:08:45.587
 It was caught 

00:08:45.587 --> 00:08:59.238
 In February 1791 he was executed 

00:08:59.238 --> 00:09:00.675
 All this was futile 

00:09:00.675 --> 00:09:04.188
 He went through all these problems for some freedom 

00:09:04.188 --> 00:09:05.656
 Was ignored, began a revolution 

00:09:05.656 --> 00:09:07.255
 That revolution did not succeed 

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:08.704
 He was executed 

00:09:08.704 --> 00:09:14.674
 But he began to influence consciousness 

00:09:14.674 --> 00:09:19.973
 People of African descent 

00:09:19.973 --> 00:09:23.072
 His revolution has led 

00:09:23.072 --> 00:09:25.506
 To what will happen in the years to come 

00:09:25.506 --> 00:09:26.372
 Unclearly 

00:09:26.372 --> 00:09:30.121
 But it happened and he was the first person 

00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:33.496
 Who tried to start a revolution mainly 

00:09:33.496 --> 00:09:36.598
 But anyway, after he was executed 

00:09:36.598 --> 00:09:40.307
 People began to grumble 

00:09:40.307 --> 00:09:41.182
 Especially in the north 

00:09:41.182 --> 00:09:43.310
 Most sugar farms were in the north 

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:46.311
 More farms mean more profit 

00:09:46.311 --> 00:09:50.319
 There was a juggling ceremony 

00:09:50.319 --> 00:09:53.895
 Which were performed individually 

00:09:53.895 --> 00:09:57.973
 The name of the charlatan Dati Buckman 

00:09:57.973 --> 00:09:59.891
 I searched for his pictures but found nothing 

00:09:59.891 --> 00:10:00.941
 Unfortunately there are no photos of him 

00:10:00.941 --> 00:10:03.092
 This man was running the ceremony of sorcery 

00:10:03.092 --> 00:10:08.211
 Which instigated the slave uprising in Haiti 

00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:10.492
 Or what is now called Haiti but formerly St. Dominguez 

00:10:10.492 --> 00:10:11.940
 Now remember and look at the demographic structure 

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.874
 You can imagine 

00:10:13.874 --> 00:10:17.174
 If slaves rise 

00:10:17.174 --> 00:10:18.908
 Against everyone on the island 

00:10:18.908 --> 00:10:19.975
 You can imagine 

00:10:19.975 --> 00:10:22.558
 They will not be very regular 

00:10:22.558 --> 00:10:24.257
 Or they are armed like others 

00:10:24.257 --> 00:10:29.093
 Just because of their absolute number - will perform well 

00:10:29.093 --> 00:10:39.141
 And in August 1791 

00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:47.742
 The rebellion of all slaves began 

00:10:47.742 --> 00:10:51.348
 You can imagine how much this frightens France 

00:10:51.348 --> 00:10:54.278
 Put all the things of the revolution aside 

00:10:54.278 --> 00:10:56.714
 And new concepts of enlightenment 

00:10:56.714 --> 00:11:01.326
 Here is the most profitable colony in the world 

00:11:01.326 --> 00:11:03.286
 Suddenly a revolution breaks out 

00:11:03.286 --> 00:11:06.526
 People on both sides are being killed 

00:11:06.526 --> 00:11:08.078
 The farmer is burning 

00:11:08.078 --> 00:11:11.361
 And from the point of view of the Government of France 

00:11:11.361 --> 00:11:13.243
 All this will adversely affect their profits 

00:11:13.243 --> 00:11:15.958
 Because France is bankrupt as you remember 

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:18.488
 And engaged in wars with other States 

00:11:18.488 --> 00:11:20.459
 So she sent a delegation 

00:11:20.459 --> 00:11:25.970
 He is subordinate to this man 

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.426
 His name 

00:11:27.426 --> 00:11:29.412
 - I know I write words wrongly - 

00:11:29.412 --> 00:11:33.230
 Sonthanax 

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.746
 I do not know what is the best way to pronounce 

00:11:35.746 --> 00:11:42.779
 He had 6,000 or 7,000 soldiers 

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:44.812
 They were sent from France 

00:11:44.812 --> 00:11:47.129
 To end the slave rebellion 

00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:51.294
 To bring things back to normal 

00:11:51.294 --> 00:11:52.846
 And to make everyone 

00:11:52.846 --> 00:11:56.229
 Along with France here 

00:11:56.229 --> 00:12:07.121
 France in April 1792 - Let me write this - 

00:12:07.121 --> 00:12:09.829
 The Legislative Assembly may recall, 

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:13.905
 Which had prepared a new constitution 

00:12:13.905 --> 00:12:22.831
 Which involves a new legislative assembly 

00:12:22.831 --> 00:12:25.600
 They gave full citizenship 

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:31.760
 For free men of different races 

00:12:31.775 --> 00:12:35.491
 Unfortunately, it was Vincent Oger 

00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:37.092
 Somewhat premature 

00:12:37.092 --> 00:12:38.365
 He only waited several years 

00:12:38.365 --> 00:12:39.376
 There was no need for revolution 

00:12:39.376 --> 00:12:42.091
 Or that he has contributed to this 

00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:42.906
 So it's not clear 

00:12:42.906 --> 00:12:43.674
 It could be his revolution 

00:12:43.674 --> 00:12:47.712
 Led to the slave revolution 

00:12:47.712 --> 00:12:49.960
 Which has contributed to 

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.701
 Make the National Assembly reconcile with the idea 

00:12:52.701 --> 00:12:53.670
 Perhaps it may make it happen 

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.472
 Or it will happen anyway 

00:12:55.472 --> 00:13:10.753
 Because they made free people citizens 

00:13:10.753 --> 00:13:11.704
 They probably did it. 

00:13:11.704 --> 00:13:14.199
 You can look at it from both positive and negative sides 

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:15.720
 The positive sidebar was 

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.608
 It is compatible with the idea 

00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:20.521
 Enlightenment and Revolution 

00:13:20.521 --> 00:13:23.888
 Though you want a strategic look 

00:13:23.888 --> 00:13:24.888
 Maybe they say 

00:13:24.888 --> 00:13:27.171
 That all this madness is happening in Haiti 

00:13:27.171 --> 00:13:31.388
 If at least we can bring them to our side 

00:13:31.388 --> 00:13:32.779
 We will be able 

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:36.370
 People are probably suppressed here 

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:37.170
 Let us be clearer 

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.420
 Many people are free of mixed races 

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.638
 They own slaves themselves 

00:13:42.638 --> 00:13:44.222
 It is in their own interest 

00:13:44.222 --> 00:13:46.288
 They were similar to white colonists 

00:13:46.288 --> 00:13:48.822
 In Sant Domingo at that time 

00:13:48.822 --> 00:13:52.321
 If they are strategic on the subject 

00:13:52.321 --> 00:13:53.941
 Perhaps to become somewhat 

00:13:53.941 --> 00:13:56.288
 From the integration of free men's forces on the island 

00:13:56.288 --> 00:13:57.654
 Or landowners on the island 

00:13:57.654 --> 00:14:03.100
 But they sent that message with Sonthanax and six or seven thousand soldiers 

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.188
 To restore things to their nature 

00:14:05.188 --> 00:14:07.624
 You can remember 

00:14:07.624 --> 00:14:13.522
 That this made many men unhappy on the island 

00:14:13.522 --> 00:14:16.854
 Because some colonists at that time 

00:14:16.854 --> 00:14:19.038
 They were not the most liberal thinkers 

00:14:19.038 --> 00:14:20.471
 They probably did not appreciate this idea 

00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:24.472
 That all free men from all the various races receive the same rights 

00:14:24.472 --> 00:14:30.440
 So there was hostility against this man 

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.930
 Against Sonthanax here 

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.489
 It is possible to remember that in February 1793 

00:14:36.489 --> 00:14:39.754
 - We saw in the previous video or in several previous videos - 

00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:53.837
 In February 1793, France began a war with Great Britain 

00:14:53.837 --> 00:14:56.846
 Britain has control here 

00:14:56.846 --> 00:15:01.878
 This is Jamaica 

00:15:01.878 --> 00:15:11.341
 To be clear, Green is St. Domingue 

00:15:11.341 --> 00:15:13.988
 Here is Santo Domingo 

00:15:13.988 --> 00:15:17.283
 Which is controlled by Spain 

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:18.165
 So you have a big problem 

00:15:18.165 --> 00:15:19.933
 There is Sonthanax here 

00:15:19.933 --> 00:15:22.048
 He fights some eggs 

00:15:22.048 --> 00:15:24.736
 He tries to suppress the slave rebellion 

00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:26.787
 Or at least bring things back to normal 

00:15:26.787 --> 00:15:28.984
 Suddenly the British come here 

00:15:28.984 --> 00:15:31.624
 You have many white colonies 

00:15:31.624 --> 00:15:34.669
 Which makes him say that if France goes so 

00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:38.170
 We will stand by the British 

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:38.980
 We will stand next to the British 

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.381
 Or they will help us 

00:15:40.381 --> 00:15:42.381
 We will use that assistance from the British 

00:15:42.381 --> 00:15:48.735
 To restore our way in St. Domingo 

00:15:48.735 --> 00:15:51.533
 As far as I can tell that Sonthanax 

00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:54.685
 He had a conviction in emancipation 

00:15:54.685 --> 00:15:56.582
 He was sympathetic to people 

00:15:56.582 --> 00:15:58.650
 Of mixed races 

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:03.253
 And even to the plight of slaves themselves 

00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:04.836
 And also for strategic reasons 

00:16:04.836 --> 00:16:06.432
 He thought that bad things would happen 

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:09.758
 He told himself that he had 500 thousand slaves 

00:16:09.758 --> 00:16:12.750
 We want to repel the British 

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.605
 This is a bold reaction 

00:16:16.605 --> 00:16:18.605
 In the history of slavery 

00:16:18.605 --> 00:16:22.690
 This is rather one of the most important announcements 

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:28.817
 In 1793, in August of 1793 

00:16:28.817 --> 00:16:31.124
 It is likely to be a reflection of his own ideas 

00:16:31.124 --> 00:16:35.550
 Or because of the threat to Britain 

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:49.390
 Sonthanax declares slavery to all slaves 

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:51.558
 Did not say that they would get equal rights 

00:16:51.558 --> 00:16:53.357
 For men who own land 

00:16:53.357 --> 00:16:56.724
 But it eliminates slavery 

00:16:56.724 --> 00:17:01.759
 He did it at first only in the north 

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:04.225
 But in September and October 

00:17:04.225 --> 00:17:05.555
 So extended it included 

00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:10.008
 All French property is in Sant Domingo 

00:17:10.008 --> 00:17:10.750
 Now you can imagine 

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.839
 The slaves who were revolting all this time 

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.126
 Somewhat suspicious of this man 

00:17:16.126 --> 00:17:20.140
 It looks like it sends to St. Domingo 

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.774
 Or what is now called Haiti, to quell the uprising 

00:17:23.774 --> 00:17:26.774
 He appeared with 6 or 7 thousand soldiers 

00:17:26.774 --> 00:17:31.672
 Try to stand by the enemies of the slaves 

00:17:31.672 --> 00:17:33.023
 To quell the uprising 

00:17:33.023 --> 00:17:34.423
 Suddenly 

00:17:34.423 --> 00:17:36.356
 When Britain emerged as a threat 

00:17:36.356 --> 00:17:40.622
 His tongue was saying that he ended slavery himself 

00:17:40.622 --> 00:17:42.423
 I now declare the end of slavery 

00:17:42.423 --> 00:17:45.390
 But the people had been deceived before and say 

00:17:45.390 --> 00:17:46.873
 That's just a trick 

00:17:46.873 --> 00:17:50.083
 Only to make us shaken 

00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:52.672
 So they can come back to us 

00:17:52.672 --> 00:17:56.542
 Their leaders were skeptical about this 

00:17:56.542 --> 00:18:05.561
 But in February 1794, the order was confirmed 

00:18:05.561 --> 00:18:09.174
 Ad certified 

00:18:09.174 --> 00:18:21.675
 By the French National Convention 

00:18:21.675 --> 00:18:25.976
 With time, they began to spread to liberated slaves 

00:18:25.976 --> 00:18:28.542
 Or rather the rebel slaves on the island 

00:18:28.542 --> 00:18:35.720
 In May 1794, the commander of the slave slaves 

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.204
 - This name is very important - 

00:18:38.204 --> 00:18:50.281
 Toussaint Louverture 

00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:57.907
 He was the rebel leader 

00:18:57.907 --> 00:19:00.999
 He was a former self-taught slave 

00:19:00.999 --> 00:19:03.405
 He has proven himself repeatedly 

00:19:03.405 --> 00:19:06.940
 As one of the best military generals 

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.221
 And throughout history 

00:19:10.221 --> 00:19:13.915
 In Mayom of 1794, Toussaint Loftur decided 

00:19:13.915 --> 00:19:22.736
 - I will write his name again - 

00:19:22.736 --> 00:19:26.262
 Decided to join the French Republic 

00:19:26.262 --> 00:19:38.790
 Sonthanax side 

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.823
 Let's look at the numbers again 

00:19:40.823 --> 00:19:42.501
 You have Tucan Louvretor 

00:19:42.501 --> 00:19:44.034
 He is the leader 

00:19:44.034 --> 00:19:48.999
 For these 500 thousand slave editors 

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:54.579
 This is the island's army 

00:19:54.579 --> 00:19:58.034
 He is now the commander of the island 

00:19:58.034 --> 00:20:01.947
 Now you can look at it 

00:20:01.947 --> 00:20:07.940
 The general or ruler of the island, to this colony 

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:15.080
 Despite having good leadership qualities 

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:20.933
 He had a paranoid side to himself 

00:20:20.933 --> 00:20:30.225
 That is why he declared himself ruler of life 

00:20:30.225 --> 00:20:33.969
 In 1801, he issued a Basic Law 

00:20:33.969 --> 00:20:46.775
 He declares himself to be the ruler of life 

00:20:46.775 --> 00:20:48.059
 They are also in his protection 

00:20:48.059 --> 00:20:51.068
 This was not the unusual thing at that time 

00:20:51.068 --> 00:20:52.383
 I mean if you look across the Atlantic 

00:20:52.383 --> 00:20:53.742
 See what Napoleon is doing 

00:20:53.742 --> 00:20:55.894
 It is the Republic of France 

00:20:55.894 --> 00:20:58.147
 He declares himself emperor 

00:20:58.147 --> 00:20:59.891
 And not what for life 

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:02.460
 These people say I have the same right to do so 

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:06.058
 I was the leader of these people to their freedom 

00:21:06.058 --> 00:21:06.839
 They trusted me 

00:21:06.839 --> 00:21:08.931
 So I will declare myself a ruler of life 

00:21:08.931 --> 00:21:10.449
 And also her protector 

00:21:10.449 --> 00:21:14.457
 As well as being preceded by a step forward 

00:21:14.457 --> 00:21:16.526
 The rest of the rulers of his time 

00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:19.734
 He had not only had tactics cut and burned 

00:21:19.734 --> 00:21:21.977
 In fact there is discipline 

00:21:21.977 --> 00:21:22.938
 Among all his forces 

00:21:22.938 --> 00:21:26.980
 We will see some of his close men, Disallin 

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.217
 - I know I write it wrongly - 

00:21:28.217 --> 00:21:31.976
 It was more brutal with people 

00:21:31.976 --> 00:21:33.977
 Who is fighting against them 

00:21:33.977 --> 00:21:39.177
 Unlike the discipline of Tusan Louverture 

00:21:39.177 --> 00:21:41.147
 When he came to power 

00:21:41.147 --> 00:21:43.706
 He did not try revenge 

00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:46.897
 On people of mixed races and on the owners of white farms 

00:21:46.897 --> 00:21:48.261
 He realized this and said to himself: Do you know? 

00:21:48.261 --> 00:21:49.940
 We are new people 

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.906
 Officials for the new state 

00:21:52.906 --> 00:21:54.590
 - or it is a new state in his mind - 

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.755
 But let us try not to make a challenge 

00:21:56.755 --> 00:21:58.356
 Let us try to preserve our society 

00:21:58.356 --> 00:22:00.159
 He walks in a reasonable way 

00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:03.135
 So as not to destroy ourselves in oblivion 

00:22:03.135 --> 00:22:06.339
 France has yet to be declared independent 

00:22:06.339 --> 00:22:07.143
 This is also an important point 

00:22:07.143 --> 00:22:12.189
 He did not want to be completely separated from France 

00:22:12.189 --> 00:22:16.422
 So no independence 

00:22:16.422 --> 00:22:17.379
 He was happy 

00:22:17.379 --> 00:22:18.909
 Being part of the French Empire 

00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:22.179
 But he will nevertheless be the ruler 

00:22:22.179 --> 00:22:24.675
 You can imagine it on two levels 

00:22:24.675 --> 00:22:27.551
 Napoleon was not happy 

00:22:27.551 --> 00:22:30.749
 In 1799 and specifically in 1800 

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:33.777
 Napoleon came to power, calling himself the first chancellor 

00:22:33.777 --> 00:22:40.507
 Napoleon is not happy 

00:22:40.507 --> 00:22:44.198
 He is not happy for two reasons 

00:22:44.198 --> 00:22:47.462
 The first is that cocky man 

00:22:47.462 --> 00:22:53.390
 Who claims to be the ruler of life on the island 

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:54.979
 No one can do that except Napoleon 

00:22:54.979 --> 00:22:56.835
 The other problem is 

00:22:56.835 --> 00:23:01.300
 He had lost 500,000 slaves suddenly 

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.353
 They are now free men 

00:23:02.353 --> 00:23:06.873
 He should pay them better wages 

00:23:06.873 --> 00:23:08.769
 Rather than making them do what you want 

00:23:08.769 --> 00:23:10.473
 And take all the profits 

00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:15.623
 The island, the colony has become much less profitable 

00:23:15.623 --> 00:23:16.651
 A voice in his mind tells him 

00:23:16.651 --> 00:23:18.460
 To restore slavery 

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:22.327
 And you will find that it was later explicitly refuted 

00:23:22.327 --> 00:23:29.701
 So he does not like the freedom of slaves 

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:31.586
 That is why he sent his son-in-law 

00:23:31.586 --> 00:23:33.357
 If there is a dirty task to complete 

00:23:33.357 --> 00:23:34.995
 You should send a man you trust 

00:23:34.995 --> 00:23:43.232
 That is why he sent his son-in-law Charles Leclerc 

00:23:43.232 --> 00:23:46.893
 With 40,000 troops 

00:23:46.893 --> 00:23:50.658
 That is why Napoleon takes the situation seriously 

00:23:50.658 --> 00:23:52.318
 With 40,000 troops 

00:23:52.318 --> 00:23:55.209
 To recover the island 

00:23:55.209 --> 00:23:56.883
 From Tucson to Louvreur 

00:23:56.883 --> 00:23:59.077
 Imagine that huge battle 

00:23:59.077 --> 00:24:02.722
 Which takes place on the island of Sant Domingo 

00:24:02.722 --> 00:24:04.129
 On the western half of the island 

00:24:04.129 --> 00:24:06.055
 Which is controlled by France 

00:24:06.055 --> 00:24:10.573
 This is why it was useful to them 

00:24:10.573 --> 00:24:13.075
 But Tusan Louverture did not benefit 

00:24:13.075 --> 00:24:16.599
 That some of his close generals or close aides 

00:24:16.599 --> 00:24:18.624
 Bear in mind that bad things will happen 

00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:19.815
 When they saw that this man 

00:24:19.815 --> 00:24:20.676
 - which I will talk about in the next video - 

00:24:20.676 --> 00:24:24.383
 When they saw his barbaric actions 

00:24:24.383 --> 00:24:28.047
 But some of the generals of Tusan Louverture 

00:24:28.047 --> 00:24:29.407
 They started with the possibility that bad things would happen 

00:24:29.407 --> 00:24:31.674
 And they turned against him 

00:24:31.674 --> 00:24:33.392
 He was one of them 

00:24:33.392 --> 00:24:35.292
 Has actually completed the revolution 

00:24:35.292 --> 00:24:37.960
 But when he was fighting for Tusan Louverture 

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:49.231
 - This is John Jacques Desaline - 

00:24:49.231 --> 00:24:50.188
 He and some men 

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:52.318
 Close to Tusan Louverture 

00:24:52.318 --> 00:24:54.435
 Join Leclerc 

00:24:54.435 --> 00:24:58.089
 Leclerc makes it look like 

00:24:58.089 --> 00:25:00.075
 He is not trying to restore slavery 

00:25:00.075 --> 00:25:02.172
 He is not trying to take citizenship 

00:25:02.172 --> 00:25:04.460
 Of people of African descent 

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:05.235
 Makes it look like 

00:25:05.235 --> 00:25:10.353
 Trying to stop Tucan Louverture 

00:25:10.353 --> 00:25:11.137
 And this man said, Well 

00:25:11.137 --> 00:25:16.702
 In order to improve St. Dominghe I will be with you 

00:25:16.702 --> 00:25:19.799
 At that time was Toussaint Louverture 

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:22.359
 In a difficult position 

00:25:22.359 --> 00:25:24.901
 And he said to him, Let your lord be blessed 

00:25:24.901 --> 00:25:27.523
 Let us have some negotiations 

00:25:27.523 --> 00:25:30.841
 Perhaps we can find a way 

00:25:30.841 --> 00:25:33.152
 To make you and it is with you 

00:25:33.152 --> 00:25:36.910
 Within Napoleon's empire 

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.038
 - which now turns into Napoleon's empire - 

00:25:39.038 --> 00:25:40.450
 So Tosan stayed for Lovertor 

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.939
 He stood alone 

00:25:42.939 --> 00:25:45.331
 A man of honor who trusted people said 

00:25:45.331 --> 00:25:49.489
 Tarles Leclerc must also be a decent man 

00:25:49.489 --> 00:25:53.650
 So he met him to discuss that 

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.569
 But for Charles Leclerc turned 

00:25:55.569 --> 00:25:57.261
 He was not a fair man 

00:25:57.261 --> 00:26:01.390
 I think I must draw a demon horn on it 

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.078
 When Tusan appeared to Lofttor 

00:26:03.078 --> 00:26:07.186
 For a civilized meeting 

00:26:07.186 --> 00:26:11.133
 He brought some men to arrest him and catch him 

00:26:11.133 --> 00:26:13.290
 He then sent him by boat to France 

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:14.926
 Toussaint Louverture died 

00:26:14.926 --> 00:26:23.256
 In captivity in France 

00:26:23.256 --> 00:26:24.977
 I will stop at this point now 

00:26:24.977 --> 00:26:26.444
 It is a rather sad moment 

00:26:26.444 --> 00:26:29.563
 You have temporary freedom for slaves 

00:26:29.563 --> 00:26:33.449
 You have this important historical man Toussaint Louverture 

00:26:33.449 --> 00:26:35.533
 Lead the slaves 

00:26:35.533 --> 00:26:38.371
 Trying to establish a new government 

00:26:38.371 --> 00:26:41.489
 But it turns into a violent surprise 

00:26:41.489 --> 00:26:43.625
 Because of Napoleon's faithful follower 

00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:44.736
 Because of Charles Leclerc, who is his son-in-law 

00:26:44.736 --> 00:26:45.724
 I will finish the video now 

00:26:45.724 --> 00:26:49.477
 An article by Tusan Lovertor 

00:26:49.477 --> 00:26:51.434
 Because it will warn 

00:26:51.434 --> 00:26:53.388
 What will happen in the next video 

00:26:53.388 --> 00:26:54.695
 This argument 

00:26:54.695 --> 00:26:58.442
 He said it after being caught on the boat heading for France 

00:26:58.442 --> 00:27:02.624
 Let me clarify the statement here 

00:27:02.624 --> 00:27:05.562
 "By overthrowing me, you did not cut into St. Domingue 

00:27:05.562 --> 00:27:08.271
 Sawa trunk of freedom. 

00:27:08.271 --> 00:27:10.508
 It will be reborn from the roots 

00:27:10.508 --> 00:27:14.667
 Because they are many and because they are deep. "
