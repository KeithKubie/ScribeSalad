00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.420
Water is fundamental to all life.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.650
Digestion, brain chemistry, drug metabolism...

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.060
Almost all biology, even if you can't see
it, has to take place in water.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.270
It's the most important liquid of life.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.260
So most of the time when people think about
water they think about it as this magical

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.930
substance where biology happens.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.789
It isn't until quite recently that we really
paid attention to what water is doing in biology

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.470
on the atomic scale where everything is actually
happening.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.170
Hi, my name is Sylvia, I run a research group
at the University of Oxford in the Dept of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.220
Biochemistry,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.160
where we're trying to understand how water
interacts with the processes of life.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.910
What we're looking at is the structure of
molecules in solution.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.660
Biomolecules, things like proteins or DNA,
but importantly we're looking at thow the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.220
structure of molecules are hydrated by water
in solution.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.630
The difficulty with understanding water, especially
in solution and at the atomic scale, is it's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.930
difficult to measure by most techniques.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.219
In many techniques the water itself is invisible.

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:16.390
If you take a protein as an example, pretty
much every organism has proteins.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.759
They're the 'working horses' in our bodies.
DNA code gives the blueprint to make protein.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.459
Proteins are made from very long chains of
building blocks which we call amino acids,

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:32.209
which fold up into these complex three-dimensional
structures in order to function.

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:36.909
All of this for the most part takes place
in solution. More interestingly, it has to

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.299
fold in exactly the right way or it won't
work.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.549
And I mean exactly.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.729
Somehow, your proteins in your body, in solution,
fold into the same structure over and over

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.509
and over and over again.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:02:02.100
But nobody really knows why.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.919
If you can understand the mechanisms that
control the way proteins fold,

00:02:06.919 --> 00:02:12.780
you would have a very good way of trying to
prevent different forms of disease.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.890
My name is Alan, I'm an instrument scientist.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.120
I do neutron scattering experiments on a whole
variety of liquids and disordered material.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.210
Cancer, Alzheimer's, dementia, any of these
diseases are almost invariably something to

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.959
do with proteins not folding the way they're
suppose to.

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.450
So there's been a huge debate going on about
what interactions with the water cause these

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.110
proteins to fold the way they do.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.680
The current theory as to what water is doing
in this process is that water is basically

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.680
passive,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.400
that's it's just a medium where proteins fold
up.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.390
Traditionally the idea has been that the water
forms like a shell,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.950
around groups in the protein molecular that
are called hydrophobic:

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.069
they are 'water fearing'. They dont' like
water being around them.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.400
Water doesn't like to form bonds with them.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.489
The idea was that it was these hydrophobic
groups that were pushing the protein into

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:07.819
the structure it had.

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.610
Most of this theory is based on computation,
which is a good thing,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.909
but it needs to be experimentally verified.

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.720
So some of the work that we've been doing
is showing that water's playing a more active

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.740
role than previously had been thuoght.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.110
We think that it's actually doing things like
providing a helping hand and allowing proteins

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.159
to start that folding process.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:36.700
We're using a technique that's more commonly
used in physics to look at the structure of

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.420
water around biological molecules in solution.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:46.629
To do this, we go to the ISIS Neutron and
Muon Spallation Source in order to do our

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.629
experiments.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.840
Well, ISIS is a neutron source, obviously.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.519
Accelerates particles of protons, hit heavy
metal targets, which produce a neutron pulse

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:57.819
by a process called spallation.

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:06.120
We have a linear accelerator, and then a synchotron,
which groups the protons together into packets,

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.510
then we run them down and hit them into a
target, and once they hit the target they

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.139
spallate, and the neutrons then come off really
fast so we have to cool them down, it's a

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.760
process called moderation.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.580
Then after moderation we guide them in a collimator
down to be incident on our sample.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.660
We're firing neutrons at our sample, which
is in solution, so it's in the liquid state,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.160
and they bounce off your nuclei and interact
with each other when they bounce off and create

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.789
a pattern which we can use to understand the
three-dimensional structure of what's happening

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.650
in our solution.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.760
If you think about a molecule that's moving,
you're going to take individual snapshots

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.090
here, here, here, here and here...

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.720
So in a way we can trap different bits of
our protein in teh process of folding.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.750
But at each stage we can see what the water's
doing because we're building up a comlpex

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.970
snapshot of everythings that's happening.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.419
Then you can put it all together in a picture
of how water is hydrating the molecules, how

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.419
different the sizes of the chains are, how
far apart they are.

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.150
Importantly we're measuring on the atomistic
scale, so you see the atoms and how close

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.180
the water atoms get to each other.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.840
I think the overarching theme that keeps emerging
to us is that water really is being active.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:32.080
It's not just being passively excluded from
a protein interior adn then going about its

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.080
business,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.180
it's actually doing something. It has to be
there,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.039
and it has to be there to drive this process.

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:43.080
So the water is acting as an intermediary
between the hydrogen bond sites on different

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.460
parts of the protein and pulling them together.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.660
That seems to be the picture we're getting
out of this.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.840
We don't see evidence for this so-called hydrophobic
interaction.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.449
If we're right about water-mediated processes
and water has a quite integral role to biology,

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:02.470
then this has significant implications.

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.139
It has implications for disease control, it
has implications for designing better drugs,

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.650
that hydrate in the right way so that they
can map for instance the way hydration is

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.520
in the place in a protein where the drug has
to bind to in order to have its function.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.680
But we may not be right either.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.870
This is the way theories develop in science.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.139
You take a set of evidence, and then you come
up with your best theory of that evidence

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.340
and it works great until you get another piece
of evidence,

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.669
and then it all falls apart, and so you have
to restructure your theory or modify it or

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:35.849
just be proven wrong.

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.110
I think as a scientist you're not really doing
your job if you're not proven wrong at least

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.750
once or twice in your career.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.840
We're working at the edge of stuff and just
starting to get new data so it's not something

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.840
that's old.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.320
We're pushing the boundaries of our techniques
and the way we think about things,

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:58.389
and that's the fun part.
