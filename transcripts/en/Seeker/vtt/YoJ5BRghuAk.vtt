This episode of DNews is brought to you by Canon PIXMA Pro,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.900
professionalling jet printers exactly as you envisioned.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.900
If you're living in a three dimensional space

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.900
passing through the fourth dimension in

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.900
one direction, what happens if a

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.900
fifth dimension baseball breaks

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.900
a window? Everything happens.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.900
Yeah. Physics is messed up.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600
Hey everybody! Thanks for watching DNews today.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.600
I'm Trace. Get your brains ready!

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
The new Christopher Nolan science-fiction

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.600
epic, Interstellar, was...

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.600
well, it was epic! It's a beautiful movie

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.600
filled to the brim with

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
so much science and they

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600
explain some of it, but not all

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.600
of it. So, that's why I'm here. For example,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.600
they explained how a wormhole might look,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600
easy, but didn't explain the idea

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.600
of higher dimensions as

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.600
thoroughly as I would have liked. I was

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.600
watching and there were times when I got lost

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.600
in just the massive quantity of

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.600
science! So I figured

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.200
let's do some explainin'!

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.200
Dimensions of space-time are

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.600
really complicated. Really, really complicated.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.600
We understand the first three

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.600
because we live within them, we have mastered

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.300
them even as babies.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.300
The first dimension is a point, a single

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.300
point, think of it as like a coordinate.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.300
If the whole universe was a number-line from 0

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.300
to 10, one dimension

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.300
would be like... 6,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.300
or 3. You'd know exactly where that

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.300
was in the universe. Two dimensions

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.300
is also pretty simple, two lines,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
two numbers. Maybe a six

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300
on the X-axis and a 3 on the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.300
Y-axis. We now know where that is.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.300
We live in the third dimension, so we add another number

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.300
line. That's the Z-axis. And those

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.300
three numbers tell us exactly where we are

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300
in space. In Interstellar,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.300
they get into higher dimensions.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.300
According to theoretical physics, String

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300
Theory requires 10

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.300
dimensions! So we are only in 3

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.300
but physicists say that at least

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.300
10 dimensions exist.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.300
I know this is tough, but bare with me.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.300
So sticking with the coordinates in

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.300
space, let's think of you, right now. Keeping it

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.300
simple, you're at a latitude,

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.300
a longitude, and an altitude. Those are 3 numbers

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.300
that determine your 3-dimensional location, right?

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.300
What about your fourth dimensional location?

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.300
The fourth dimension in this case would use

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.300
time. A timeline would be the fourth

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.300
line in our group. With 4 numbers

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.300
we know exactly where you are

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300
in 4-dimensional space. You're on top

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300
of a mountain on January 5th, at

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.300
12:06 and some odd seconds.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.300
And moving any of those numbers shows

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300
a different location anywhere in the past,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.300
present, or future, or anywhere in

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.300
space. It's not too difficult to imagine

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.300
so far, I hope. If you were a 4-

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.300
-dimensional being, instead of a 3-dimensional one,

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.300
moving along your timeline

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.300
would be as easy as any other

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.300
number-line, just like walking down the road.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.300
So, that being said,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.300
let's blow them out the airlock a little bit.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.300
So try and imagine a world without

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.300
linear time, where time is just

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300
another thing that you can move through, like swimming

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.300
or walking. moving backward,

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.300
forward...easy. It's crazy right?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.300
Now what if you want to move left?

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.300
or right?

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.300
That is the fifth. What about up

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.300
or down in time? Now

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.300
you're in a 3-dimensional place and you're moving

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.300
around in time, based on probability

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.300
and permutations of what

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.300
the 3-dimensional spot

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.300
could have been, is,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.300
was, or will be

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.300
on different possible timelines.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.300
Quantum physics says the fifth and sixth

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300
dimensions are the exploration of all

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.300
of these possibilities and all of

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.300
permutations of the choices made.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.300
Now, for the last 3

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.300
dimensions. If we could take a point

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.300
and move through it in space and time

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.300
including all the futures and pasts

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.300
possible for that point.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.300
What about moving along a number line where the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.300
laws of gravity are different, the

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.100
speed of light has changed.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.100
Dimensions seven through ten are

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.100
different universes with different

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.500
possibilities and impossibilities

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.500
and even different laws of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500
physics. These grasp all the

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.500
possibilities and permutations of how each

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500
universe operates and the whole

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.000
of reality with all the permutations

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
therein throughout all of time

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and space. The highest dimension

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
is the encompassment of all

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
of those universes, possibilities,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
choices, times, places

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
all into a single thing.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
This is heady stuff, for

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
sure! But it comes into play in

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Interstellar, a little bit, with the idea of

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
"Them". No spoilers here, I can't

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
go into too much. But  this is

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
basically a rundown of what the

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
dimensions are. Ten dimensions of space-

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
-time sounds kind of crazy, but

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
mathematically it jives with how

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
physicists are beginning to understand the universe

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
using a single grand theory. Of

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
course, there's another theory that says there

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
aren't 10 dimensions, but 11 dimensions

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and that's a whole other thing. Let's

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
not get into it, my head already hurts. In the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
end knowing more about dimensions and how

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
they exist won't really help you in your day-to-day

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
lives, unless you're a theoretical

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
physicist. But, there

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
are people out there who study this this stuff every single

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
day and are trying to learn more about

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
how gravity affects time, how the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
higher dimensions affect quantum theory.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
This is huge big brain stuff

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.800
and it is stupid cool.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.800
If you see Interstellar and you want to know more

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.800
about the relativity, or black holes,

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.800
or whatever, let me know down below

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.800
