00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.523
- [Instructor] We're asked
to graph the equation

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:06.547
y is equal to one-half times x minus six

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:08.214
times x plus two.

00:00:09.662 --> 00:00:11.528
So like always, pause this video

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:12.988
and take out some graph paper

00:00:12.988 --> 00:00:14.575
or even try to do it on
a regular piece of paper

00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:17.339
and see if you can graph this equation.

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.182
All right now, let's work
through this together.

00:00:19.182 --> 00:00:21.000
There's many different ways that you could

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.546
attempt to graph it.

00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:25.549
May be the most basic is
try out a bunch of x values

00:00:25.549 --> 00:00:27.906
and a bunch of y values and
try to connect the curve

00:00:27.906 --> 00:00:29.822
that connects all of those dots.

00:00:29.822 --> 00:00:31.560
But let's try to see if
we can get the essence

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.233
of this graph without
doing that much work.

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:38.232
The key realization here without
even having to do the math

00:00:38.232 --> 00:00:39.532
is if I multiply this out,

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:42.257
if I multiplied x minus
six times x plus two,

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:43.608
I'm going to get a quadratic.

00:00:43.608 --> 00:00:45.774
I'm going to get x-squared,

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:47.787
plus something, plus something else.

00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:51.281
And so this whole thing
is going to be a parabola.

00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:54.684
We are graphing a quadratic equation.

00:00:54.684 --> 00:00:57.434
Now a parabola you might remember

00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:01.847
can intersect the x-axis multiple times.

00:01:02.742 --> 00:01:04.287
So let's see if we can find out

00:01:04.287 --> 00:01:06.562
where this intersects the x-axis.

00:01:06.562 --> 00:01:08.024
And the form that it's in,

00:01:08.024 --> 00:01:09.485
it's in factored form already,

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:11.559
it makes it pretty straightforward

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:14.139
for us to recognize
when does y equal zero?

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:16.414
Which are going to be the
times that we're intersecting

00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:17.760
the x-axis.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.766
And then from that, we'll
actually be able to find

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:21.502
the coordinates of the vertex

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:23.498
and we're going to be able
to get the general shape

00:01:23.498 --> 00:01:26.755
of this curve which is
going to be a parabola.

00:01:26.755 --> 00:01:27.792
So let's think about it.

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:30.251
When does y equal zero?

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:33.155
Well to solve that we just
have to figure out when,

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:36.046
if we want to know when y equals zero,

00:01:36.046 --> 00:01:37.790
then we have to solve for

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.822
when does this expression equal zero?

00:01:39.822 --> 00:01:41.079
So let's just solve the equation.

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.053
One half times x minus six,

00:01:44.053 --> 00:01:47.136
times x plus two is equal to zero.

00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:50.515
Now in previous videos we've
talked about this idea.

00:01:50.515 --> 00:01:53.022
If I have the product of multiple things

00:01:53.022 --> 00:01:54.793
and it needs to be equal to zero,

00:01:54.793 --> 00:01:56.261
the only way that's going to happen

00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:57.785
is if one or more of these things

00:01:57.785 --> 00:01:59.514
are going to be equal to zero.

00:01:59.514 --> 00:02:01.057
Well one half is one-half,

00:02:01.057 --> 00:02:02.663
it's not going to be equal to zero.

00:02:02.663 --> 00:02:05.229
But x minus six could be equal to zero.

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.317
So if x minus six is equal to zero,

00:02:07.317 --> 00:02:10.271
then that would make this equation true.

00:02:10.271 --> 00:02:13.000
Or if x plus two is equal to zero,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.323
that would also make this equation true.

00:02:15.323 --> 00:02:17.658
So the x values that
satisfy either of these

00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:20.093
would make y equal zero
and those would be places

00:02:20.093 --> 00:02:23.531
where our curve is
intersecting the x-axis.

00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:26.050
So what x value makes
x minus six equal zero?

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.043
Well you could add six to both sides,

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.038
you're probably able to
do that in your head,

00:02:30.038 --> 00:02:32.608
and you get x is equal to six.

00:02:32.608 --> 00:02:36.588
Or you subtract two from both sides here

00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:39.615
and you get x is equal to,

00:02:39.615 --> 00:02:40.850
these cancel out,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.529
you get x is equal to negative two.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.680
These are the two x values

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.140
where y will be equal to zero.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.330
You can substitute it back
into our original equation.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.504
If x is equal to six,

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.086
then this right over here is
going to be equal to zero,

00:02:54.086 --> 00:02:56.286
and then y is going to be equal to zero.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:58.010
If x is equal to negative two,

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.984
then this right over here is
going to be equal to zero,

00:02:59.984 --> 00:03:02.483
and y would be equal to zero.

00:03:02.483 --> 00:03:05.793
So we know that our parabola
is going to intersect

00:03:05.793 --> 00:03:10.217
the x-axis at x equals
negative two right over there,

00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:12.328
and x is equal to six.

00:03:12.328 --> 00:03:14.578
These are our x-intercepts.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.361
So given this, how do we
figure out the vertex?

00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:22.118
Well the key idea here is to recognize

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:24.802
that your axis of
symmetry for your parabola

00:03:24.802 --> 00:03:28.570
is going to sit right between
your two x-intercepts.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.278
So what is the midpoint between,

00:03:30.278 --> 00:03:33.325
or what is the average
of six and negative two?

00:03:33.325 --> 00:03:34.745
Well, you could do that in your head.

00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:38.912
Six plus negative two is
four divided by two is two.

00:03:40.491 --> 00:03:41.566
Let me do that.

00:03:41.566 --> 00:03:45.246
So I'm just trying to find the
midpoint between the point,

00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:46.786
let's use a new color.

00:03:46.786 --> 00:03:47.979
So I'm trying to find the midpoint

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.494
between the point negative two comma zero

00:03:51.494 --> 00:03:53.077
and six comma zero.

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:55.541
Well the midpoint, those are just

00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.582
the average of the coordinates.

00:03:57.582 --> 00:04:00.023
The average of zero and zero
is just going to be zero,

00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:02.232
it's going to sit on the x-axis.

00:04:02.232 --> 00:04:04.891
But then the midpoint
of negative two and six

00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:09.520
or the average negative
two plus six over two.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.772
Well let's see, that's four over two,

00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:11.932
that's just going to be two,

00:04:11.932 --> 00:04:13.542
so two comma zero.

00:04:13.542 --> 00:04:14.890
And you see that there.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.765
You could have done that
without even doing the math.

00:04:16.765 --> 00:04:17.798
You say okay,

00:04:17.798 --> 00:04:19.022
if I want to go right in between the two,

00:04:19.022 --> 00:04:21.993
I want to be two away from each of them.

00:04:21.993 --> 00:04:24.307
And so just like that,
I could draw an axis

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:26.640
of symmetry for my parabola.

00:04:27.724 --> 00:04:32.436
So my vertex is going to sit
on that axis of symmetry.

00:04:32.436 --> 00:04:35.078
And so how do I know what the y value is?

00:04:35.078 --> 00:04:36.392
Well I can figure out,

00:04:36.392 --> 00:04:38.743
I can substitute back
in my original equation,

00:04:38.743 --> 00:04:41.765
and say well what is y equal
when x is equal to two?

00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:45.492
Because remember the vertex
has a coordinate x equals two.

00:04:45.492 --> 00:04:48.477
It's going to be two comma something.

00:04:48.477 --> 00:04:50.769
So let's go back, let's see what y equals.

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:54.091
So y will equal to one-half times,

00:04:54.091 --> 00:04:55.521
we're going to see when x equals two,

00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:57.522
so two minus six,

00:04:57.522 --> 00:04:59.105
times two plus two.

00:05:00.331 --> 00:05:03.237
Let's see, this is negative four,

00:05:03.237 --> 00:05:04.792
this is positive four.

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:06.675
Negative four times four is negative 16.

00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:10.547
So it's equal to one-half
times negative 16,

00:05:10.547 --> 00:05:13.255
which is equal to negative eight.

00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:15.590
So our vertex when x is equal to two,

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.518
y is equal to negative eight.

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:22.948
And so our vertex is going
to be right over here

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:24.767
two common negative eight.

00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:27.701
And now we can draw the general shape

00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:29.569
of our actual parabola.

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.786
It's going to look something like,

00:05:31.786 --> 00:05:33.992
once again this is a hand-drawn sketch,

00:05:33.992 --> 00:05:35.565
so take it with a little
bit of a grain of salt,

00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:38.523
but it's going to look
something like this.

00:05:38.523 --> 00:05:41.307
And it's going to be symmetric
around our axis of symmetry.

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.985
That's why it's called
the axis of symmetry.

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:45.774
This art program I have,
there's a symmetry tool,

00:05:45.774 --> 00:05:48.745
but I'll just use this and there you go.

00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:53.506
That's a pretty good sketch
of what this parabola is

00:05:53.506 --> 00:05:57.269
or what this graph is going
to look like which it is,

00:05:57.269 --> 00:05:59.519
an upward-opening parabola.
