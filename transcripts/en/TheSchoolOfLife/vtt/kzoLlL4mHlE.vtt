00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120
The things that get us (and others) sexually excited often sound rather improbable and mysterious.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.140
Yet, beneath the surface, many of our erotic enthusiams are motivated by something very touching

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.200
and very sane: a desire for total closeness.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.500
Take BDSM. There's huge pressure in our society to be independent and strong,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.820
and yet inside us, some of us are deeply attracted to, and therefore also turned on by,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.400
the counterbalancing thought of throrough passivity and submission,

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.340
as a form of escape from the over-strenuous demands of grown-up life.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.260
The wish to be a ‘slave’ means that someone else will know exactly what you should do,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.620
and take all choice away from you.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.360
This could sound appalling because most slave owners we can imagine (indeed most authority figures) are pretty awful.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.100
We so badly want to be independent,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.940
in part because there doesn’t seem to be anyone around nice enough to deserve our weaker selves.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.340
But the deeper hope, which can come out in sex, is that we would be with someone

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.240
who could be worthy of our complete loyalty and devotion.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.420
As for the dominant partner, there's an analogous dynamic at work.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.380
Modern life generally demands extreme politeness and restraint.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.020
We have to keep our bossiness in check.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.560
But in our hearts, we might think we know exactly what someone else really needs.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.800
We might like to be quite bossy, and enforce absolute obedience.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.500
We just lack the necessary authority and power in the real world.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.100
So the exciting fantasy is that someone will at last acknowledge our strength and wisdom,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.220
will recognize our talents and will put us wholly in charge of them.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.220
No more need for skepticism about who we are,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.020
and therefore no more restraint, no more need to hold our tongue.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.820
The games of submission and domination offer opportunities to investigate wishes,

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.300
but are far from being simply peculiar, pointless or even slightly demented.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.960
They offer brief utopian interludes in which we can, with a rare and real friend,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.840
safely cast off our normal defenses,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.580
and share and satisfy our longings for extreme closeness and mutual acceptance

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:19.420
which is the real, psychologically routed reason why these games are so exciting.
