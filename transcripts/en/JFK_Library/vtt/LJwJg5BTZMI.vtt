00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:03.248
- Good evening, everyone.

00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:06.174
I just want to thank the
John F. Kennedy Foundation,

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:08.484
the entire selection committee,

00:00:08.484 --> 00:00:12.037
also Daniel Finn, whom I had
the honor and pleasure to meet,

00:00:12.037 --> 00:00:14.231
for being an inspiration,
and also Harvard University

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:17.430
for really investing in leadership

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.073
and the next generation.

00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:22.323
This is an amazing and
prestigious honor for me

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:24.111
and I can truly tell
you that I never thought

00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:25.528
that I'd be here.

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:31.251
When I think about John F.
Kennedy, President Kennedy,

00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:33.864
and the legacy that he's left for leaders,

00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:36.600
a few things have come to mind.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.614
Change has arrived on the shoulders

00:00:37.614 --> 00:00:41.573
of those bold enough to
believe in new ideas,

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:45.782
a realm of possibility, and
daring enough to take a stand.

00:00:45.782 --> 00:00:47.540
We must continue to
believe in the possibility

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.638
of a brighter shared future

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:52.823
and the ingenuity that youth brings.

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:55.540
However, we must be diligent in protecting

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.830
our foundational values that
have made this nation great.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.654
I believe in order to secure
our future as a nation,

00:01:03.654 --> 00:01:05.497
we must be intentional in the pursuit

00:01:05.497 --> 00:01:09.541
of building our next
generation of leaders.

00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:11.619
When I was just a new mayor, I was blessed

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.987
to attend the Harvard
Institute of Politics

00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:17.373
for New Mayors, and we spent a week here

00:01:17.373 --> 00:01:18.736
learning about all the challenges

00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:21.105
that we would ultimately face.

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:23.654
That experience had a
profound impact on me,

00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:26.225
and I realized that I wasn't
the only person crazy enough

00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:29.684
to take this position, but
also that there are many others

00:01:29.684 --> 00:01:32.111
just like me that had a heart for service.

00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:34.224
As part of that experience,
I had the privilege

00:01:34.224 --> 00:01:36.082
of visiting the Presidential Library

00:01:36.082 --> 00:01:39.415
right here on this very special grounds,

00:01:40.656 --> 00:01:44.267
and it impacted me for a variety of ways.

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:46.586
As a young girl, I was inspired by

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:49.647
the legacy and the
leadership of John F. Kennedy

00:01:49.647 --> 00:01:52.730
and he was not only bold, courageous,

00:01:53.623 --> 00:01:56.107
but also had a magnetic personality

00:01:56.107 --> 00:01:58.285
and the compassion that really, I think,

00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:01.470
permeated all generations, and regardless

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.820
of your race or your
nationality of ethnicity.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.363
I was equally inspired by
Mrs. Kennedy's dedication

00:02:08.363 --> 00:02:11.107
to her family and her country.

00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:12.813
I was so impacted that
I said a little prayer

00:02:12.813 --> 00:02:14.960
that my husband and
family could experience

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.014
this library and they're
here with me on this evening,

00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:19.347
so I'm thankful.

00:02:21.376 --> 00:02:23.626
(applause)

00:02:27.098 --> 00:02:28.981
The John F. Kennedy Library
stands as an institution

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:31.544
that is dedicated to
educating future generations

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:34.761
and providing the tools
and historical perspective

00:02:34.761 --> 00:02:36.852
that we need to lead our communities

00:02:36.852 --> 00:02:39.082
and to serve our country.

00:02:39.082 --> 00:02:41.112
Although I have been equipped with one

00:02:41.112 --> 00:02:42.588
of the best educations in the nation

00:02:42.588 --> 00:02:45.305
and spent thousands of
hours in the library,

00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:47.336
nothing could have prepared me

00:02:47.336 --> 00:02:48.970
for the amazing journey of being mayor

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.702
of the city of Compton.

00:02:51.702 --> 00:02:53.083
Since taking office, I've been challenged

00:02:53.083 --> 00:02:55.533
at every side, I've been stretched,

00:02:55.533 --> 00:02:59.259
yet I have not been uprooted
in my mission and my commitment

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.114
to my community because I truly believe

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:04.426
that every individual breathing deserves

00:03:04.426 --> 00:03:07.083
a decent quality of life.

00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:10.217
I'm committed to the children
and the families that I serve

00:03:10.217 --> 00:03:11.949
and I believe that as a nation,

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:14.538
if we pull together, especially
at a time such as this,

00:03:14.538 --> 00:03:16.811
that we can make it through
any obstacle or challenge

00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:18.787
that we face together.

00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:22.073
One of my core qualities
is my transparency.

00:03:22.073 --> 00:03:23.734
I am not a politician.

00:03:23.734 --> 00:03:25.800
I never thought I would be a politician,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.087
and I can tell you that
I was just one person

00:03:28.087 --> 00:03:29.817
that was committed to my community

00:03:29.817 --> 00:03:32.139
that wanted to make a difference.

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.961
We have to encourage our young people

00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:38.037
that have strategic minds to not only get

00:03:38.037 --> 00:03:39.639
their education and
leave their communities,

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.353
but really come back to the same places

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:43.912
that have invested in them.

00:03:43.912 --> 00:03:46.605
I believe that our next
generation of leaders,

00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:49.334
they're present now, and that they need

00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:51.528
the Daniel Finns and those
that have had the history

00:03:51.528 --> 00:03:54.010
and the legacy to really
transform and transport

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.691
that information that we need in order

00:03:55.691 --> 00:03:58.977
to activate in this special time.

00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:00.847
It is young leaders like
President John F. Kennedy

00:04:00.847 --> 00:04:02.279
and Reverend Martin Luther King

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:03.936
that remind me every single day

00:04:03.936 --> 00:04:08.444
that age does not determine
my ability to make an impact.

00:04:08.444 --> 00:04:11.369
Like my fellow honoree, Max Keener,

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:13.215
we must all be ever more committed

00:04:13.215 --> 00:04:15.742
to helping the least of those,

00:04:15.742 --> 00:04:17.592
those people that have been out-casted

00:04:17.592 --> 00:04:21.447
and those communities that
have been counted out.

00:04:21.447 --> 00:04:22.848
President Kennedy said it best.

00:04:22.848 --> 00:04:26.829
If a free society cannot
help the many who are poor,

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:30.060
it cannot save the few that are rich.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.915
I am truly honored to accept this award,

00:04:31.915 --> 00:04:34.067
and although I don't
feel worthy of the honor,

00:04:34.067 --> 00:04:36.001
I'm humbled to be here
and share this occasion

00:04:36.001 --> 00:04:37.883
with my family and my team.

00:04:37.883 --> 00:04:40.615
To my husband, Van, who has invested in me

00:04:40.615 --> 00:04:43.111
as a person and a leader,
and that courageously

00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:45.549
allows me to follow my dream, I thank you

00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:48.538
because I wouldn't be here without you.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:50.788
(applause)

00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:55.497
And to Melissa, who's telling me no,

00:04:55.497 --> 00:04:57.377
not to acknowledge her, my chief of staff.

00:04:57.377 --> 00:04:59.151
I call her Command because she literally

00:04:59.151 --> 00:05:01.081
is my right hand for everything in life,

00:05:01.081 --> 00:05:02.869
and so I love you to pieces,

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:05.386
and to Debbie, who's also
my executive secretary

00:05:05.386 --> 00:05:07.664
and been a friend for many many years

00:05:07.664 --> 00:05:08.941
and her husband Tony.

00:05:08.941 --> 00:05:11.495
We're a small team, but God really uses us

00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:13.732
to do mighty things, and
so I'm really thankful

00:05:13.732 --> 00:05:16.426
that you all are here to
share this special day.

00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:19.236
Thank you all, God bless you.

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:21.486
(applause)
