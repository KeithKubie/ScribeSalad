very very important yes I suppose that
is<00:29:45.600><c> sorry</c><00:29:46.200><c> I</c><00:29:46.290><c> keep</c><00:29:46.530><c> on</c><00:29:46.650><c> finding</c><00:29:47.040><c> new</c><00:29:47.160><c> tracks</c><00:29:47.460><c> to</c>

is sorry I keep on finding new tracks to

00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:49.559 align:start position:0%
go but I suppose the social side of
 

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:51.169 align:start position:0%
go but I suppose the social side of
science<00:29:50.070><c> is</c><00:29:50.250><c> so</c><00:29:50.400><c> important</c><00:29:50.850><c> to</c><00:29:50.910><c> get</c><00:29:51.030><c> across</c>

00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
science is so important to get across
 

00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:53.060 align:start position:0%
science is so important to get across
because<00:29:51.570><c> again</c><00:29:51.900><c> I</c><00:29:52.049><c> think</c><00:29:52.080><c> science</c><00:29:52.559><c> is</c><00:29:52.679><c> quite</c>

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:53.070 align:start position:0%
because again I think science is quite
 

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.110 align:start position:0%
because again I think science is quite
often<00:29:53.220><c> thought</c><00:29:53.580><c> of</c><00:29:53.640><c> as</c><00:29:53.820><c> a</c><00:29:53.940><c> rather</c>

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
often thought of as a rather
 

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.409 align:start position:0%
often thought of as a rather
individualistic<00:29:55.049><c> activity</c><00:29:56.240><c> yeah</c><00:29:57.240><c> it's</c><00:29:57.360><c> a</c>

00:29:57.409 --> 00:29:57.419 align:start position:0%
individualistic activity yeah it's a
 

00:29:57.419 --> 00:29:59.150 align:start position:0%
individualistic activity yeah it's a
very<00:29:57.600><c> cooperative</c><00:29:57.780><c> activity</c><00:29:58.620><c> basically</c><00:29:58.830><c> I</c>

00:29:59.150 --> 00:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
very cooperative activity basically I
 

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.930 align:start position:0%
very cooperative activity basically I
mean<00:29:59.400><c> the</c><00:30:00.140><c> a</c><00:30:01.140><c> good</c><00:30:01.710><c> laboratory</c><00:30:02.309><c> is</c><00:30:02.370><c> really</c><00:30:02.910><c> a</c>

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
mean the a good laboratory is really a
 

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
mean the a good laboratory is really a

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.190 align:start position:0%
sort of social social microcosm isn't it
I<00:30:05.580><c> mean</c><00:30:05.700><c> you've</c><00:30:06.150><c> got</c><00:30:06.270><c> all</c><00:30:06.299><c> these</c><00:30:06.540><c> interactions</c>

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
going on and a lot of what we do because
 

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
going on and a lot of what we do because
you<00:30:10.200><c> have</c><00:30:10.350><c> to</c><00:30:10.470><c> do</c><00:30:10.650><c> so</c><00:30:11.040><c> many</c><00:30:11.220><c> different</c><00:30:11.669><c> types</c>

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:11.970 align:start position:0%
you have to do so many different types
 

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
you have to do so many different types
