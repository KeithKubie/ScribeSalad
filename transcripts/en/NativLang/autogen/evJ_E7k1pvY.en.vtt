00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.210
 Languages ​​change over time, but do some change faster than others? 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.299
 Let's say you get into a coma while you hear your language spoken all around you. 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.160
 Suddenly you wake up in the same place, but in a different time. 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.210
 They still speak the same language, but you don't understand a single word of it. 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.670
 How long have you been away? 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.820
 We try to answer that question in the next two videos, this time starting with the speed 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.300
 of language change. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.140
 Gerbil. 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.140
 Hahaha! 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.310
 No, Dyirbal, the name of a language in Queensland, Australia, which is a very peculiar language, that for the first time 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.490
 our attention came at the beginning of the twentieth century, and full of so many unexpected qualities, that 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.300
 the grammar written about it acquired a status like that of a linguistic epic. 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.730
 Thanks to this book - already in the first linguistic lesson - I heard fantastic stories about Dyirbals 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.100
 fascinating features. 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 Features like ... that it has four genera: male people and animals, female people and fire 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.080
 and water and harmful things, edible things, and other or inanimate objects. 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.299
 It has a great free word order. 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.030
 For the layman, sentences in the Dyirbal can look just as clear as word soup. 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.220
 The Dyirbalŋan people have an unambiguous policy. 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.620
 They can't say vaguely: she made me laugh. 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.570
 They should be more specific: she told a joke and I laughed, she stumbled and I laughed, 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.550
 she tickled me and I laughed. 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.710
 And in this language there is not even a general word for 'language'! 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.630
 If that is not enough to arouse your curiosity, consider my favorite of Dyirbal's remarkable things. 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.700
 A woman had to speak differently within hearing distance of her father-in-law, and 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.730
 likewise a man near his mother-in-law. 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.600
 They called this Dyalŋuy. 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.259
 It had the same grammar as normal language, Guwal, but the substantive words were swapped 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.200
 to prevent offense. 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.110
 Dyalŋuy was useful for other complex social situations, but it always involved speaking 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.670
 with a completely different vocabulary. 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.300
 It sounds extreme, but that's what happened. 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.390
 Dyirbal was so unique and influential that linguists even went so far as to 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.120
 say that without Dixon's grammar our understanding of secular linguistic diversity 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.500
 would be much worse. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.240
 Something strange happened when a few decades later linguists returned to study the language. 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.090
 The Traditional Dyirbal was only a memory. 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.260
 A new Dyirbal - the Young Dyirbal - had taken its place 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.540
 The class system was converted. 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.620
 The word order was now fixed, with the basis subject-verb-object sentences, just like English. 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.310
 The native language had disappeared. 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.430
 Some everyday words were used in other ways, and others had disappeared forever. 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.190
 Did we see Dyirbal dismantling itself before our eyes? 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.180
 Can the basic properties of a language really change so quickly? 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.510
 What is the language change speed, and how could we measure it even then? 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.500
 Well, ask Morris Swadesh. 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.800
 He is the first person I know that he has a method for calculating 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.910
 developed the speed of language change. 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.879
 He developed a solution that could be used anywhere that he swore would work for any language 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.300
 the world, from Norway, all the way to the northern rainforests of Australia. 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.600
 Make a list of words. 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.349
 Basic words that children learn at an early age. 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.100
 The type that ideally should not be replaced quickly between generations. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.959
 Compare the list with the same word list in a native language. 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.730
 What you would find is that some words have been replaced, but many are still essential 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.100
 be the same word. 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.300
 Certainly, some sounds will deviate, and it may need the eye of an expert to 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.879
 recognize their agreement. 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.530
 Now Dixon tells us that the Dyirbal word for "dog" is "guda." 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.159
 But when he investigated a neighboring language, Mbabaram, the speakers told him their word for it 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.020
 "dog" is "dog." 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.120
 Really. 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.769
 However, it has nothing to do with English; it's a coincidence. 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.280
 It appears that this word is related to 'guda'. 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.209
 For Swadesh this counts as a detention. 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.780
 On the other hand, "water" is "bana" in all Dyirbal dialects, one excepted, in which it is "gamu"; 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.690
 this counts as a change. 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.910
 Before you know what the proportion of words you hold is the fun part: glottochronology, 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.060
 '' language time measurement ''. 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.009
 Swadesh thought that the basic vocabulary worked just like radioactive decay, or all languages 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:22.000
 replace words with a constant speed over longer periods. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.300
 And he felt justified when he tested his assumption against history; see the time 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.830
 that it actually took for Latin before it changed to the Romance languages. 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.580
 The method looked solid. 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.990
 After a thousand years, a language retains 86% of the 100 words on Swadesh's list. 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.669
 It is a special thought. 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.819
 Just looking at a word list of a language, he could calculate how old it was and how big it was 

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:45.490
 the distance is from her relatives. 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.200
 He could even design a lexical time meter! 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.550
 The most nasty thing I've said so far. 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.849
 But, it predicts how long it will take until important vocabulary milestones are reached and it ends with 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.740
 an entirely new language. 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.300
 Do you remember our hypothetical coma patient? 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.169
 Yes. He will wait a long time before Dyirbal changes to a new language. 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:09.449
 Another 900 years, because languages ​​change at a constant speed! 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.710
 But ... this is not the case. 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.379
 Come back next time to see why not, and learn more about Australia's languages ​​while 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.830
 we ask: how long can a language stay before it becomes unrecognizable? 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.669
 Exactly, a divide! 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.589
 Because this is too interesting, and because my drawing hands need rest. 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:31.500
 So stay here and subscribe for language.
