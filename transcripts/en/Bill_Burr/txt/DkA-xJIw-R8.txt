Speaker 1:          00:00:00       All right. Hey, what's going on? His bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcasts and I am just checking in on you. I didn't yell this time. I did yell at this time because I'm sitting across from a man who is currently setting the Guinness Book of World Records for podcasting in a day, promoting his new show on Netflix. Stand up in a way for episodes, uh, debuting Christmas Eve. Ladies and gentlemen, what are the greatest debt of comedians and say the middle life. Please welcome Mister Brian Regan Bell. How are you man? I'm excellent. How are you doing? You look like you've already to glaze over here. You're on the whole media tour, right? Did they get you? Did you do some morning TV? Did you do have that crap and morning TV? I am not comfortable with those morning shows. I tend to love doing these with other comedians.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       Oh, okay, good, good. You know when it's, when it's not another comedian, it's, I'm, I am so horrible at them. Find your funny Brian. Oh boy. It's what can people expect from your show? That's the moment, like if I'm doing a phone interview, like a radio and phone, radio interviewer, well as soon as they say, what can people expect people for people who aren't familiar with you, what can they expect from your show? I know right away they're not familiar with the person asked me the question. Yes. And I just want to hang up. Like I just want to get a few to be over at that moment. It's your show going to be the exact same thing I just watched on television. Yeah, that's another one. Did you write any new material? Now it's going to be exact same shit. See, after I finally got a special, I then wanted to ruin it by boring people by doing the exact same stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:01:43       Uh, Brian in this company asked you all hacky questions in this current comedy climate, how do you find the altitude to fly at with your current presentation of, of satire? I'm going to fucking cry. It's a, it's a, it's an insane world. It's in the same world right now. But um, anyways, tell me about your show. It's a hybrid half stand up, half sketch. A lot of the older bits that I used to do years ago when I do my shows around the country, people at the end of my show sometimes like to hear some of the older stuff and I'm like, well what can I do? Maybe I could do something with this. So I'm just, you get, you're like that good that you have like classic jokes that's harder than a classic song. Yeah. I'm not going to use that word on myself, but, uh, it's nice of you to say that, but uh, you know, so I'm like lay it on thick. The Johnny Cash. Yeah. Well it feels good that people still like to, you know, hear some of these routines and I thought, well, maybe I can do something with them, but I don't want to just do the standup. I mean, people don't know that. So I thought maybe if I do like a standup bit, and then that segues into some sketch or something like that. And, uh, Jerry Seinfeld got involved.

Speaker 2:          00:03:00       Oh, here you go. Um, he was the one who reached out and he's always been cool with me and said that he wanted to help spearhead me having a show. I mean, what better phone call is that? It's an a life that's a big phone call. You know, like, like you're, you're on the phone going, look at these goosebumps. I got goosebumps. Yeah. You know, it's funny when you said this when you were describing your show is I, that's, he's the first person I thought I was like, Jerry would like to show. He was so, you know, was cool. He said that he had this idea, he didn't have the idea. He said he wanted me to have a show. He said, let's get together sometime and see if we can talk about this. And I was like, go, you know, of course, you know, and um, he was performing in Las Vegas where I live, so I went to go meet him at his sweet.

Speaker 2:          00:03:52       They have sweets and hotels that are like, that I didn't know were possible, like piano and a segues to take it from. What kind of room is this? You know, so I go, we go meet and we chat. And he said, yeah, you know, he thought that I was one of the comedians that have, should have a show, which was just a huge, huge honor even hearing that. And he said, well, you know, maybe we'll get together and talk about it sometime soon. And I said, well, I have an idea. And he goes, okay. And I, I know he likes coffee, right? So I said, do you mind if we order some coffee? And we chat about it. So called room service. They brought up a pot of coffee. I pitched it to him in about three minutes, you know, and he goes, I like it, let's do it. And um, I got emotional. I swear to God, I started like, I got a tear in my eye because it show business doesn't work like that. Say we had his shell business does. Yes, exactly. I knew when he said,

Speaker 3:          00:05:00       yeah, yeah, let's do it. And then you do it. And I knew it was happening. I mean, I'm on belittling all the work he does, but like he has like the, uh, whatever that is. Like, he knows when an idea is good and then he goes, let's just do it. And then he does it. He does it way he wants to do it. Everybody responds.

Speaker 2:          00:05:21       And then, uh, and I knew back the bank truck up exactly that. The money part as isn't even that important to me, you know, I mean right now, but just his cloud agent just slapped his forehead. It goes renegotiations wait, are they going to play this

Speaker 3:          00:05:40       wait is still be down to earth crying some point. Would you be a little bit of a diva?

Speaker 2:          00:05:46       Yeah. But I knew when he said he wanted to do it, that it was going to happen. Right. Who's going to say no to him? You know? And I knew that he's the one shepherding this. So anyway, it was like really that uh,

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       that uh, he's supporting this. Yeah, I would say, I would say that would be a, uh, if you're going to go in with anybody, that would probably be something he did for them. How long does it take you to shoot an episode? I'm fascinated with this aspect of it. Of the Wendy, you get to go home aspect of showbusiness. Well there was a lot of writers' meetings, you know, a a bunch of weeks of that, you know, just coming up with the sketches. A lot of the sketch ideas I had already had. Um, and then we shot the sketches also. Not everyone of them is based on one of your older bits. It's just some of them are and some of them are newer ideas. None of the sketches are stand up done as a sketch. I didn't want to do that. Stand up. I love stand up and stand up.

Speaker 1:          00:06:42       Should be stand up. So do the one where you wanted to do the cattle prod and the person who's just standing where they're supposed to be walking in the airport. It was one of my favorites. I like to see somebody, maybe that one, maybe that one, I'll do it. But I wanted to stand up to be stand up and then I wanted some type of transition into a sketch. Sometimes it's a natural lead in, sometimes you have to kind of like horseshoe it, you know what I mean? And um, but that was part of the fun too, is like manufacturing these segues into sketches. So we shot all the sketches and then we shot all four episodes in two nights in front of a live audience where we would throw, I do stand up and then throw to the schedules effect. Yeah. So in theory, if you got 10 episodes, you could be done by Wednesday for foreign to do a half day on Wednesday like they have as a PTA meeting and then you're done.

Speaker 1:          00:07:32       Yeah, it was cool. It was cool. And then, you know, the final night, you know, it was, uh, happened to be my birthday and had a big birthday celebration after that. So it was like a nice, uh, it was a cool experience. That's awesome. Well, my next, next time I do a TV show, I don't think I'm going to do animation again. I tried. Donna was being so smart. I love my show. I love doing the show, but it's just like there's always, you know, all, you know, every gay shut the episode in three days. I'm like, Jesus takes us a fucking year. You get this thing done. Um, so any who, some of the cast members, anybody I know, I didn't want a normal cast. I cast pur sketch, you know, so it isn't like there's a from Isis, how against the grain dejected Dick did you cast here?

Speaker 1:          00:08:25       I want it. Like if it was a particular sketch where you had three characters we would cast for that particular episode or that particular sketch. You know, I didn't want like a, like a mad TV or uh, oh, you don't want to know kind of thing. People know whoever services the thing, you know. Okay. And uh, so there's some obscure people, but uh, they were all great. Soon did not be obscure when this thing debuts, like I said earlier, four episodes on Netflix, Christmas Eve. Um, so you're a Florida Guy, right? Yeah. Um, what can people expect from a Florida guy with a sketch show? Sorry, I just love those questions.

Speaker 3:          00:09:04       Oh, what do you think about occurred? Prevalent. Is that crazy? You get a Lotta let him material that event. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:09:11       So heat in a, uh, a social situation. When you meet somebody who just finds out you're a comedian and like every single thing that said they have to throw in. I bet this going to end up in your routine. You should talk about this. You know, somebody has a chip and they put some, you know, some guacamole on it and it falls on a table. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:09:35       I bet that's going to end up in your act in front of you in the buffet line. Don't put this in your APP. Yeah, usually try to avoid bombing. My job is to entertain, I mean I might put this in the act there. Right, right. That's this because now we are, we're actually, they're actually, we're putting it in the act. You described the Guac falling off the chair. Do you know what I want more of? I want it

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       more celebrities, uh, celebrities. If I can say the word telling me about their political opinions, I can't get enough of it. You know, cause I'm very unsure on what I think about the world, in which way I'm going to vote. And then all of a sudden the f the six lead on a sitcom, you know, informs me about fitting or something. And I'm like, oh, okay. That's, that's how, that's how I need to think about that. I want to see the flip. I want to see in an og duration ceremony for a congressman and during his swearing in, he says, who should have one for wardrobe design in a movie? You know, criticized, criticized the wardrobe winners, you know, um, which of course is absurd, but I know it's a weird, it's a weird time. And you know, I, I've never felt, uh, I don't feel old, you know, I fill out, I just feel like, uh, it started with the music.

Speaker 3:          00:10:56       I didn't know what people were listening to. I didn't know where the popular bands was. And then I started to not know who the players were playing sports. And now it's like a, yeah, I don't know the words,

Speaker 1:          00:11:07       you know, I don't, I don't know. No other words that I'm not that bad. I just, I just, I, I, uh, I don't agree with it. When, uh, the academy awards come out, the, it used to be, I had seen all of the movies that are up for best picture than it was like, oh, I didn't see that one. Then it was like, oh, I saw a couple of them. Right. And then it got, now it's gone to the point where I've never even heard of any of them. Yeah. I've never even heard of them. Yeah. I haven't even heard of him. Well, now there's so much stuff to watch you or they just got rid of another Oscar host. Yeah. Evidently he tripped somebody in like outdoor recess it like in 1983. Oh, that was it. And there was some sort of getting me in kindergarten.

Speaker 1:          00:11:52       Kindergarten thing. Yeah. Yeah. On a final plan. I don't blame him because that was a mistake. That was a mistake that he made in his past. Yeah. And tripping is never to be a times you apologize for it. It's never cool. No, I think all, I think all mistakes in life should disqualify everyone from any future endeavors. If your acumen. Yes, yes. No mistake should be allowed for in, in the human condition. Perfect people. Perfect. People should host award shows. Perfect. People should, when Heisman trophies, they should uh, um, host award shows the savvy people like us. Perfect. People like us.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       So I want to add for younger kids now because so much of this shit is like on video and just some of the, again, they're going to be fun. I think the amount of the population that won't be able to run for any sort of office, I just wonder, you know, there's always pendulums and everything and right now the pendulum is over. Two people want to, is it pendulum? A pendulum? You might be right. I don't know anybody. Geez. Aaron Pendulum Pendulum. Oh, I'm getting a nod that I'm right. Look at that. Look at that. But once pendulum, well it's a angel. You know what? The Florida schools pendulum well there did you go to Ponce De Leon High School? I went to pendulum high school. I went to fend the Hi Fountain of Youth Junior high. I went to Christopher Columbus high school coach should talk about, you know, politically incorrect in today's world.

Speaker 1:          00:13:23       You know, another guy who stand where, where like where all of that new evidence came. If he did all of that shit, what did he write it all down? He tweeted it a toy they went back to, is this tweet to do you got to do a sketch about that case on the lumber? Say go back in, hey, you know, it was on the Santa Maria, you know, and it's a lot of time going from Spain or wherever they left from over to the new world. So we would just sit back in his cabin and tweet. Uh, yeah. Uncredible Wifi is, he went across the ocean.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       Um, so anyway, I, yeah, I do. I went to a Columbus high school. I forget the point of, I forget the question and what my answer is. I don't know, but I'm enjoying it. All right, good talk anytime you can talk about Columbus Tweeten when he should be captain on the Santa Maria. Uh, that's actually a great premise. Like how quickly would Hitler get kicked off at Twitter? The second you got on Hitler, you said Queer. You can't say that. That's a great sketch. All these people, and then you've got to have like, you know, Mother Teresa when she was young, something she did. I don't know. Who knows? Uh, anyways, what's your, are you still see you a college football guy? What was your deal? I played, I played college ball. That's what it was. Um, a small division three.

Speaker 2:          00:14:52       So, um, it was sorta like a school, Heidelberg College in Tiffin, Ohio. Loved my years there. Just, you know, Midwestern school, just like if you were to film a movie and a Midwestern campus, this is the perfect place. You know, just a thousand students. Everybody knew each other and uh, fix your supreme court justices either. Okay. Yeah. Right, right. It was a perfect tablet. Wasn't underneath what was happening. So I played football there. Love that. I actually tried out for a semipro football team. When did it happen in those leaks, by the way? The a F A, I'm sure you've heard of that. No, nobody has the American Football Association. Okay. And uh, they had a, they were forming this new league, so there was a team going to form in Orlando called the Orlando Americans. They were going to play in the Tangerine Bowl. Nice. Have Buddy of mine went up and tried out and they invited him to camp.

Speaker 2:          00:15:53       He's a quarterback. He played at Notre Dame and he said, Reagan, you should go up there and try out as a receiver. I played receiver in college and I'm like, Guy, I was out of shape, you know, it was that a year and a half after college because no, the, the talent up there is the kind that you could fit in. So I went up and try it out of this big mass tryout and he invited me to camp. Wow. They invited me to camp. They brought a nine receivers in the camp. But when, then we had to try out from there. They were only going to keep three receivers. They had like a skeletal squad, like two starters in one backup, you know, and they cut down to five. I was one of the five, I was one of the five left. Nice. And then they, uh, I had, I did a post corner pattern and through my hip out and um, I don't think I would've made it anyway, but they cut me. Cut me. I'm just picturing you running in your, your standup crouch. Like that's why you threw your hip up. What year was that?

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       How will I was to hold? Are you

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       um, well I was like 20. No. Yeah, it was probably 20 to 22. I already too out of shape. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       Well if it is, no, no, I was, I meant that as like a compliment to athletes item. I think I had a cousin, uh, played a little semipro football. Um, does those leaks still exist? Is that an actually an actual way into, I feel like it's the CFL or you walk on and you know, that's it. Like as far as getting into the after college to try and get into the NFL, I figured either going to stand out at the CFL and even then that's a long shot or you just try to get a walk on right after college.

Speaker 2:          00:17:29       Well, I, I had no aspirations of making it in the NFL zero, you know, like, but the fact that my buddy thought I could make this one team, I thought, well this could be a good experience for a year or two if I could get on the team. And uh, no that, that particular league doesn't exist anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       So what exactly did you do to your hip? I did a post corner pattern. Yeah. You know, you see 45 degree angle and then cut back out. I had these hip pads that were too tight and I just remember feeling like a sprawling, oh no. And I have no idea. Like I didn't have money to go to a doctor or anything like that. I just couldn't walk. Kind of hard to make a team when you can't walk. So

Speaker 4:          00:18:14       waiting for that feeling to go away. And then you just thought it still hasn't gone away. Continued on with your life.

Speaker 1:          00:18:19       Yeah. It still hurts. It still hurts. My knee hurts from football, you know? Uh, when I was in college, I had a knee thing and they would shoot me up with cortisone for the games because we had to keep this ONH streak going.

Speaker 4:          00:18:34       Oh yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       You know what I mean? And they would shoot bit with cortisone. It was, it was amazing because, uh, the pain was so intense when they didn't shoot me up. Like I could barely walk and then they would shoot me up before the games and I'm going to field running around like a deer, you know, like I felt like Bambi like, but while I'm running, I'm practically hearing crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch. It's just twisted my knee up, you know? And I finally quit. I quit college because of the knee. I was worried that I was going to do permanent damage to it. Did you want me to still hurts it a little bit here and there, but uh, yeah. Yeah. He, one of those weather guys, Nice. Starts acting up. You're like, this is going to be a twist. That's my hip. It's going to be a cold front. Um, I can tell asteroids when an asteroid is coming. Oh really? That's interesting. Yeah. Um, is that your hip or your knee? My hip is like if there's an incoming asteroid and mine, my knee lets me know if there's an earthquake coming on. Wired bizarre. You know what I think here at all things comedy, we could cut a side deal with the weather channel. You know, let's cut over to Regan, anything hurting the Regan report

Speaker 4:          00:19:50       and here we go. Oh, oh, oh

Speaker 1:          00:19:55       I feel a magnitude six coming on. You know, I really resent to channels that I used to actually enjoy was the weather channel. I actually used to like watching it and for some stupid reason enter the discovery channel and both of them, you know, I dunno. I Dunno what they did. I don't like how the, you know, the discovery channel further like makes sharks look out like they're just inherently mean things, you know, with all this shit going. Like, now we sit there and then whenever you watch, you know something on sharks, they're always telling you. Now people has a misconception about them. But then the whole way they sh they sell shark week is that jaws vibe, right. You know, they put a ski mask on him and stuff. They always said that they'd been typecast and I would think with all this progressive talk out there that someone would speak up for them.

Speaker 1:          00:20:43       And then the weather channel, they went away, the food network where they used to just tell you what the weather was and they'd have some Weirdo and now it's like all personality driven and they got to make it sound like Jesus is going to show up every time it fucking rains as of my issues. Those are the things that keep me up at night. I would feel that about um, CNN, headline news, not regular CNN, CNN, headline news used to be 30 minutes of just news would the most middle of the road news anchor. Right. And I'm like, this is the way it's supposed to be. Just a guy just telling you nice and straight. What's going on and now it's personality driven. The APP, just like you're talking about these other gems, angry people, hot chicks, this person, that person. Yeah. I saw one the other night, the local La news here, and they teased this for half an hour.

Speaker 1:          00:21:30       A guy got cut off on a motorcycle, went over his handlebars and the highway, get a couple of bumps and bruises, but was fine. Right? But he filmed it. He had a little camera on top of his head, so they just kept filming the footage on the flag itself. May Am happens. It's this guy splitting lanes. I mean it's legal out here, but that's what he still in. The guy just went, you know the guy with to change lanes, didn't see him. He had went up and over and they're like, yeah, after eight teased it, the whole fucking like this. This is an actual news, right, that if you ride a motorcycle in La, you could probably going to go down at some point. And he didn't even get fucking hurt. If he died, I'd be like, wow. All right. But it wasn't, it was like a, it was like the first draft of a script where it's like, but you got to raise the stakes.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       Can he go? Can he go over the handlebars into the oncoming traffic? Can we get some, can we get some of that? But the whole thing, and it just led for 20 minutes. They teased it and then I finally see the footage that I already been watching. They didn't have any more footage. And then they interviewed him and you're like, how do you feel? He's like, yeah, you know I'm all right. Yeah, I guess it was news because the guy who hit him walked up to him said, are you okay? And he said yes. And then he got in the car and peeled away. So they had his face looking at them, you know? So I guess that, I guess that was the news aspect, like whether it was a hit and run, like he looked like he didn't care enough. The guy who hit him, he took off.

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       Yeah, I think he did plenty. He did. He got out. He got out. He said you are. The mistake he made is he peeled away. That indicates guilt. What he should have done was just signaled and got back on the highway and just be a guy. I thought it was fine. I got out. I asked him, I knew he had the Gopro on. I knew I was on camera so I didn't do anything wrong. He had a helmet on offense attorney. I didn't have a helmet. I was fine. I figured he'd be fine to look. Look at the side of my car. I was out here in la one time watching the local news. They said we have a breaking news. Right, and they had a helicopter footage of a home who's the garage was on fire and I'm like the only person that would possibly give a damn about this garage being on fire is the guy who lives in that house.

Speaker 1:          00:23:37       Yeah. At least probably about our target audience. Nobody else would care about that garage band on fire yet. It was breaking news. Well, it used to be when I lived out here in the 90s, I remember I was just like, this news out here is a fucking joke. And then somewhere along the line, national news caught up to what they were doing out here in la. Cause when I, I kinda stopped, I don't know if this is probably a bad thing, but I kind of stopped watching the shit like at least seven years ago. Um, like right now I'm trying to remember the name of the vice president and the first one that I thought was Joe Biden, but that was the last one. Mike Pence. Mike Pence. Yeah. Okay. Let's see that. I mean that's literally the backup quarterback to the United States. I don't know his fucking name. I can understand not knowing the, uh, was it the secretary of defense? The treasurer, the uh,

Speaker 2:          00:24:28       well if I know those, the coordinator of a, cause they keep changing in the current administration. So it is hard to keep up. But usually when they, when they ride for years, I can remember them all. Oh, is that, what is that? I don't, I don't pretend to know. All right. So what else can we talk about here? Anything? Anything else you want to promote? You get some standup dates coming. I'm in a, I'm in a, I get to where the actors hat in a show called Loudermilk, the fairer milk. Fairly brothers Peter Fairly dumb and dumber and all that. They've done some things. Yeah. Well the huge, they're like, well, the funniest fucking people ever. Well, Peter Fairly and a guy named Bobby Mort created a show called louder milk. It's about substance abuse, dark comedy. It's on direct TV's audience network. We just got picked up for our third season.

Speaker 2:          00:25:14       I play a guy recovering from substance abuse and uh, I, I love it. I never did, never had an opportunity to do a lot of acting and a sounds great. I, it's just so much fun. What is your character? Addicted to a alcohol quaaludes the whole thing had a big family and had a falling out with his family and the whole thing. And uh, but it's funny, but serious and funny. Mostly funny. And Ron Livingston please. The, the main dude. And it's like yeah. And it's like a group discussion thing, you know like an AA meeting. But it's about people's, I have direct TV. How can I see this? It's on the audience network every Tuesday night. Audience Network. So is that somewhere in my thing? If you have directv, you should have the audience network. It's just a channel on there. What channel? I think two 39 to 39 500 500 Jesus Christ. You weren't even close. Three. I just thought you this fucking thing. You don't know what channel? I know it's on two 39 where I live. Is it on 500 as well? Oh I don't know. But uh oh on

Speaker 1:          00:26:19       the bus it's 500 all right. So if you're in a house it's two 39 if you cause the channels at the same but direct TV, that's what I like cause I haven't direct TV. You go on the road and I like going to the hotel. I already, I know ESPN is going to be 206207208. You know, uh, the red head channel is a 798 I get the ginger report. Let's see if it's okay to go outside that day. Um, Jesus Christ, looking, playing everything close to the vest. What else you got going on? He had talked to you fuck fucking half hour before I find out you weren't in the third season of a show. That's all right. A lot of people don't know about it. You know it, it's an obscure, it's hard. A lot of people haven't seen it yet, but it's getting a lot of good buzz and starting to get some traction.

Speaker 1:          00:27:02       Don't you feel like you almost have to do three seasons of a show now, just for the general population to know that it exists? It's amazing to me. I mean, when I started in this business, if I would have thought that I would be on a TV show that my friends don't even know about, and I'm not exaggerating, I have friends who go, oh, really? You're on a show? And it's like my parents have never seen the show that I'm on just for the simple fact that I can't figure out Netflix like they can from an age. You just walked up, you just told the Knob, turned on the TV for five or seven, what do you want to watch? So they're not going to sit there. I got to do what? And then they got it. They can then they got to type in and search like they just going to be, I'm not, I'm not, you know, I'm not fucking doing that.

Speaker 1:          00:27:42       They, they are, uh, they are old schools, so, yeah. Um, I actually talked to somebody, you've told this story before. I talked to one night, I was talking to another comedian and I was telling her how much she liked how much I liked her show she was take, oh, that's great. Well, I mean we talked for 10 minutes before she realized the show was talking about, had already been canceled and she thought I was talking about a different TV show that she was on that I had never heard of. That's crazy. Then I told her that I had a TV show and she had never heard of that. And I was like, do you understand how fucked I could see if we both worked at a lumber yard or one of us did, but we're both in this business. You're like, you're like shooting, you know, you don't even know what you're aiming at.

Speaker 1:          00:28:24       And we're both on beyond the first season. So there is some sort of success to both that shows that we're on and we still have. We still haven't heard about them. Wow. Um, anyways, where are you going? I saw, um, I had an embarrassing moment with the Colin Quinn. It showed tough, tough crowd and, uh, you know, I saw him at a charity event or something like that and said, hey man, just want you to know I'm loving you on tough crowd. And he said, it's off the air for like four years, you know? Oh God. It would just feel so stupid. You know? That's, that was the conversation. First Conversation I've had with Colin Quinn, I s he, there was a movie out that he was getting credit for writing. Uh, oh my God, what the fuck was it called? It was, it was the one with Damon Waynes and the Celtic Celtic pride.

Speaker 1:          00:29:12       Okay. I met him at my first comics come home and we're literally out in front of the crowd. I can't believe I worked with Colin Quinn, Denis leary and all of these guys. The crowd's doing a standing ovation, fucking Cam Neely standing there. I'm like three years into the business, I can't believe I'm a part of this. And I see Collin and I'm like, oh my God, that's Colin Quinn from our remote control SNL. And I'm like, what do I say to this guy? So I, and I was just, oh cause I auditioned for the movie. So, um, I lied and said, I saw it cause I didn't see it. I said, hey man, I really enjoyed Celtic pride. And he goes, I didn't write that piece of shit. They took that away from us. I was like, oh my God. I said the exact wrong thing. That's what I get for trying to kiss ass.

Speaker 1:          00:29:56       Uh, but I made a mental note to never tell somebody that I saw movie that didn't see again. And I've broken that. You have to, in this business, you have to do it. Uh, speaking, uh, golf, golfing. Did you say you were golfing with right? Look with Colin. Is that we have we met and you met them on a Gulf Chin thing? No, no, no. Just at a charity show. It was where I saw him. Jesus, I'm so fucking burnt out. I can listen to my goddamn guests. Well you, you, you do you have golf. I gotta go. I gotta go on this thing. When is this thing gonna be here? Brian can comes out to me. He goes, dude, you got to go on this this three day. It's like, it's like a spa. Right? Yet you sober up, you got chill out and eat nothing but are a lot of fruits and vegetables and we golf probiotics. We do hot yoga, we go back, we have a, we do hot yoga can kep aligned again and a lot of meditating, a lot of meditating. And it's just so, it's so good for all, all the fellows to get together. We'll do that.

Speaker 1:          00:30:53       So when did you gotta be the fall? When is the next one? Uh, probably May, but uh, yeah, I'd love to help you get involved man. I always feel like whenever I run into the, the few times that I go on the wagon, I then that's when I run into you. I, last time I boost with you is, was in New York and that was that time. It was, it was, it wasn't just the guys, it was men and women. So they pick like this fancy fucking place in that waiter came over and you, you ordered like a Budweiser or something like that again, sorry. I miss here. We didn't have it. Uh, we have as a divinity for the day and you just staring at him, waiting for him to finish. You're like, is that a bear we miss? And you're like, okay, I'll have one of those when I love you weren't even trying to be funny.

Speaker 1:          00:31:41       You're looking at this guy like, is there going to be a fucking test at the end of this? Um, and then I saw you more recently at that, a bar in New York and you weren't, you weren't having cocktails at the time. And then I felt guilty. I'm like, I'm like six in here. No, I every once in awhile I just, I, you know, I shut it down for a little while. Um, I'm going to hopefully shoot another special coming up soon and I just don't want to go through the whole fuck. I gotta drop, you know, 20 pounds of pizza and beer. I don't, I don't feel like doing that this time around. So I'm like, oh, so doing it during the holiday. So my game plan is, uh, I'll be three weeks in on Saturday. I'm taking one night off, which is dangerous for me because I'm a big binge drinker, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       I'm, I'm, I'm goal oriented, you know, I see a bottom, I want to finish it right. Then one of these, these PAF asked people that leave sink in the dish dishes in the sink. Sorry, can you speak, um, now, so I'm going to make a dinner for my wife and then I'm going to, we're going to drink a split, a bottle of wine there you can in the game plan is to immediately go, okay, back on the wagon. However, one of my buddies from New York is also in town and he said, hey, let's hang out Monday something, well maybe Sunday and Monday and this is what happens. Then it becomes Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, right. And next thing you know, you know, I uh, I love, I think we chatted about this in the past. I, I, I get my work done. You know, I work hard and what I do and I put my nose to the grindstone, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:33:13       But giving me the classic, I work hard, play hard hit. But when you guys can see that the, when I did more hand movement, Trump's got to get this [inaudible] it's like the thumb and index finger. Everything else is lined up and then the pinkies up like you get a little tea cup. But when I, I'm going to go out, you know, like, and I'm safe about it. Car Service, the whole thing, guys together, you know, getting ballistic. I like those moments or those evenings. Um, and it's good. No, I love those months. You know, when you get lit up half the year. I hate the winter. I don't want to remember it. That's right. I want to be warm. That's what hibernation is all about. Yeah. Um, so it's probably not a good message for people out there, but uh, everybody has to have that fucking problem with it.

Speaker 1:          00:34:05       It's like Jesus Christ my advice. That's my vice. Yeah, that is mine too. So I, I, you know, I shut it down for a couple of months and then I slowly start back up again. And then when I just, I just feel like it's getting out of control of like, I'm just, you know, I'm just living too much of a, a, you know. Okay. I Dunno. Just too much of a slothful, they'll say, because what happens is everything goes off the rails. It's not just, okay, I'm having too many cocktails. It's like, I'm also eating a steak and cheese. You want to fry side salad? I'll take the fries. Well done. I start doing that shit. So, um, you know, every once in awhile I just, I sort of dial it back and uh, and I dial it back and I get eight hours sleep and I, I'm just sort of a, I like it in the morning, but the rest of the day I'm sad.

Speaker 1:          00:34:49       Hmm. So you like waking up like having not yanked the night before and go ahead. It's found like good flat, you know, eight hours sleep. Nobody do apologize too, but then, you know, once after breakfast, man, it's just really, yeah, like the gloom. All right, man. The next weekend you're in. Yeah, I'm definitely in for that. Is it? Well, you're in Vegas, right? Isn't going to be out there. I don't know if I could do, I don't think, I think I know it's a good idea. This next one's in Florida. We do it in a different place every, every day. The pick of the year, it's all him. He on the other side of the fucking country. I'm gonna, I'm, we'll spring for a private jet for you can, you know, can you just book me at a Magellan's fucking comedy club?

Speaker 7:          00:45:25       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:45:25       it's the holiday season. Dooby dooby do. Who thinks that? Sa What's up? It's built births. The Monday morning podcast for Monday, December 13th, 2010. How the hell are you? I've had that fucking song in my head. I heard it on the radio and like the grocery store, you know, I was growing going in there to go buy a ham, some glaze Jenelle gelatinous shit. Right. And I was in there and there was this song on the uh, the speakers there, the sealant of the grocery store that I just mentioned I was at, if you forgot already, you know, and I'm driving around, I got this big fucking ham sitting in my grocery cart and elk through the speakers. Is this, this guy, it sounded like it was from maybe the fifties you know, it's the holiday season. Doobie Doobie do, I can't remember if you went Doobie Doby do or that's just how I remember hearing it.

Speaker 8:          00:46:26       I'm trying to give you more lyrics cause I got to know the name of this song cause I want to download it. I want to drive around La and 80 degree weather on Christmas, you know, with this stupid look on my face listening to that song. Other, the rest of it go. It's the holiday season, Doobie Doobie. Do Hey, just take care of Katie and you cook something like that. I can't remember. You know how that is, you know when the, you know the, the, uh, what is it when they do that thing where uh, no, that that elevator music from the 1950s where they actually took like sorta like blues progression and I don't know what they did to it. So it's almost like still has like date bet, but that, but there, but that data, maybe that's more swing and you fucking stick it in your cut, something like that.

Speaker 8:          00:47:13       But obviously it's a lot more, uh, has a lot more family values two one, whatever. It's the holiday season. So please, for the love of God. So I'll stop singing this fucking song. Somebody, somebody let me know what the name of that song is. Okay. And before I forget, which, I don't know how I would, all right. Um, you know, we do underrated overrated every week. Do you guys remember that from the last three fucking years of me doing it? Just about every Monday I got one for you. Underrated. The black Crowes underrated despite the fact that the selling out these huge venues, this still underrated. I went to go see him a Saturday night. I say as they say in Boston, it's amazing. They actually take that word that has so many continents and they remove all of them like a cancer when you're going to come on and come over Saturday, um, Saturday night at the palladium, the same place where Richard Pryor tapes live on the sunset strip.

Speaker 8:          00:48:19       I went down and I saw the black Crowes play truth and salvage company opening up and the black Crowes played three hours people three hours, hour and a half acoustic set. And then they take a break like fucking barely 12 minutes and they come back out again. Basically after kicking the shit out of the crowd for an hour and a half, they take a 12 minute break, right? Just to go back, you know, have a cigarette and a little shot of Gatorade and they go right back out again and kicked the shit out of the crowd for another hour and a half. Uh, it's easily the best show I've seen in like 10, 12 years. And um, I don't, I just go see them. They're up in San Francisco. If you're in the area, they're playing the Fillmore, all this, uh, all this week. And uh, they, they were unbelievable. And the greatest thing that I liked about it was everything that you were hearing was being produced by human beings that the humans that were on the stage as opposed to all this other shit that you go to see.

Speaker 8:          00:49:26       Now, I'm not saying these people aren't talented, but you know, I've been flipping through the channels like an old man, you know, four fingers inside the fucking waistband and my pajamas, you know, the guy, you know, the fucking was said married with children just sitting there, you know, you got the remote, the other hand clicking through and you see like, like a, you know, these little pop tarts. Even a guy like usher who is tremendously talented, the singing and the dancing and all that shit. You're hearing all of these instruments that are not on the fucking stage. And then you're also hearing like, I can't say with him, I can't remember who exactly it was, but like you here at least it's like the person who's singing with themselves, they have the track going and it's like, so I dunno, musically, socially acceptable. Now, like back in the day, if you've got busted doing that, that was like the end of your fucking career.

Speaker 8:          00:50:23       Everybody's just saying he's the fucking sell out man. And that was it. It didn't shit. So the fuck am I trying to say? It was awesome. Who unbelievable show. And uh, recently I finally started, uh, downloading us actually some little feet. It's a band like 20 years ago. Guys I worked with in this warehouse with telling me I should get into them. And I finally got around to doing it and downloaded their greatest hits and that live album, uh, uh, Christ, what's it called? Waiting for Columbus, I believe. And uh, they have a song on there called Wilson. And I had listened to it and someone was saying, Oh yeah, the guy wrote it and that's why he got kicked out of fucking Frank Zappa's band. And then he made fucking, you got with little flock story short, the Black Crowes ended up, uh, they closed out their set singing that song and it was, it was, I was just a shit.

Speaker 8:          00:51:17       It was even the way they ended their set. They didn't do the big fucking, you know, you know where they're just sitting there strumming that one note and the Getapp, Eh, is a fucking drum is sitting there smashing all these symbols. Thanks. A lot. Can afford you mean great, good. I didn't even do that. They played this really cool fucking song and it ended on this nice just I was, it was the shit. It was the shit. So if you get a chance to see them, please go see him. And uh, the drummer of that band, Steve Gorman, uh, has a podcast and a few baseball fans out there to, uh, or sports fans in general. It's a sports podcast and a this week, Tuesday, I believe he's going to upload it. Uh, he interviewed a useless from the, uh, the red sox. So please check that out. And if you're not into sports, please go see them.

Speaker 8:          00:52:06       At the Fillmore. I'm sure there are already sold out, but it was, it was fucking awesome. So there you go. There's my plug. I am in a generous mood this week. You know why? Because it's the holiday season. Doobie Doobie do. And you stick it up. Your fucking comment. Sorry, I just, I got a jar this loose in my head. I'm going to figure out what it is. So anyways, well, well well a lot has happened since the last time I did my podcast has an invoice and girls, a lot of things have happened. Does anybody know what I'm talking about? Just, you know, isn't that amazing thing about life that in six short days, seven days, if you're into math, how many fucking things can happen and just a little seven day period. If you go back eight days and you think of what you thought about certain aspects of the world and how different your opinion is a mere eight days later, what would be a good example of that ass shit? I don't know. Let's see. Let's, let's just take your average fucking Joe from eight days ago. Like, I don't know. Let's say like a jets fan and fan. Eight fucking

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       days ago. Huh? What did, oh my God. I was just looking at my fucking Mike Recorder. I thought that whole thing. I thought, I thought he didn't record it at died. I taught, I taught, I taught. He said you wanted one. Um, I thought the thing is shut off. Let's continue here. God Damn it. I just fucked up my momentum. A jets fan eight days ago. What the fuck were they thinking? Huh? I'm walking around now. People eight days ago, those motherfuckers thought that they were going to win the Superbowl. You know, probably taught this day we're going to go into Foxborough grabbed fucking Tom Brady with his by his updated mullet. Slap them around a little bit, put a couple of more dimples into his chin. That's what they thought was going to happen eight fucking days later. Eight days later. Right now, every jet fan in the country eject them, has their green fucking head between the knees looking at their fucking green balls, shriveling up, pulling up into their fucking abdomen.

Speaker 4:          00:54:36       All right, now here's the deal. I'm not going to talk shit. I talked a little bit of Shit. I had to because of all the fucking emails I've been getting and not just from jet fans. That fucking Dick from Philly. You know who you are when you've sent me that email. Go Bill. Give it up. Give it up already. You sound like a more on the jets are a fucking, we'll have the best team in the AFC and all that shit. All right. I'm going to say this. Say it real quick cause I don't feel like I need to say anything, but I'm a cunt so I'm going to continue talking about this. Okay. What did, what, what the fuck did I tell you? What did I say?

Speaker 4:          00:55:14       Everything I fucking said. I'm not even say that they can't still pull it together and maybe win the Superbowl. But to refresh your memory at the beginning of the season when I was watching those fucking morons on that HBO hard knocks thing, running their mouths, that's what I say. Why are they talking all this shit? They're talking as if they already won one, two, three fucking championships. And you remember what I said? I said the Patriots, the fucking Ravens, the Steelers, the chargers, or even the dolphins could beat this fucking team on any given Sunday. And Lo and behold, within six days to fucking losses yet. No. So that's it. I had to give you one. I told yourself, all right, and here's one for you jets fans. If you think I'm thinking that the Patriots are fucking going to win the Superbowl and that the defense I saw the last two fucking weeks is their defense. Now you're sadly mistaken. This is why you fuckers get disappointed every year is because you see, you see half

Speaker 8:          00:56:24       a ray of sunlight and you think, dad, that's what it is. I still don't like our defense. All right to fucking great weeks in a row does not make up for the fact that you shit the bed and let up 24 to 30 points for the first fucking 11 weeks. So whatever the hell nine weeks, whatever, I don't know. No, 11 weeks we were nine and two. That's right. The first 11 weeks. So I don't know. Who Do you like for some reason I'm thinking the ravens sitting there all quietly nestled in Baltimore, right? No one's paying attention to them. Joe Flacco. I Dunno. I know we beat them this year, but I don't know if trying to beat those guys twice a one year so I'm not, I'm not fucking saying anything. So there you go. That is it. And having said that, how fucking Hilarious, I really felt as there's something here.

Speaker 8:          00:57:16       I felt really bad for the strength and conditioning coach who stuck his knee out and knocked that dolphin guide down. I felt really fucking bad for that guy because that was such a classic spur the moment completely out of character move for it was just the right set of circumstances. Had they beat the Patriots suite before, he wouldn't have done that shit. And they bounce back and they were beaten. The dolphins, he wouldn't have done that shit. He's never done anything like that was just the classic that's spur of the moment. Like it was just fuck we got killed by the Patriots. Fuck we're losing this game. He's a competitive psycho cause that's how you get to that level, right? It would just all lined. I'm telling you that guy like I don't think he's a bad guy. I really don't. It was a, it was a piece of shit thing to do, but you know, there's so many fucking people in jail because of a moment like that.

Speaker 8:          00:58:30       They had never committed a crime their entire fucking life and just two major shifts happened in their fucking life. And then an opportunity presented itself to think about how many times you go down this, you walked down the street, you see somebody bent over tying his shoe and your brain just goes, why don't you just go fucking boot him in the ass? Right? But you don't because the other side of you is going, wait a minute, you can't put this guy in the ass. What if he knows that fucking UFC shit comes over and fucking, you know, blows out my eye and I look like fucking Josh Koscheck over the fucking crosscheck, obviously his fucking name. Right? Or what if, what if I get arrested for assault? What if I get sued like that voice just beats down that other voice going, God damn, look at those titties.

Speaker 8:          00:59:14       Why don't you go home and just grab them? Just grab those titties. They're right there. Grab them, but you don't because you have a job. She got a family because you're working towards something and it's, it's going relatively well. You're on course. Then what happens? You know girlfriend dumps Hsa, you know you lose your fucking job. It starts to unravel and when it starts to unravel that voice in your head, you know I should just fucking kicked that guy right in. The balls become so fucking loud that that other voice of reason is now it's way in the back of your head. No, you don't do that. It hurts. You can't even hear it anymore and that's what the fuck happened to that guy. It was just, it was too. I'm telling you last night, last night, that dude was sitting there. Yeah. Why is this fucking thing saying on peak and I was a too loud. I'm trying to overcompensate for the fact that people were saying that my, my podcast with too quiet. Trying to overcompensate. There we go. Why is that light sitting there going peak. Hello. Test one, two, test one, two. Oh fuck you.

Speaker 8:          01:00:29       Okay, so evidently the reason why it said peak was because I had reached the memory limit from my ls 10 all right. Deleted some shit. I'm back. So anyways, the fuck was I taught, I was talking about that guy. I guarantee you he's not a bad guy. Last night he was sitting there talking to his wife. He couldn't even sleep. His wife or his girlfriend, you know, she's sitting down in the corner, you know, holding her knees, sitting in the corner going, why did you to that? And he's like, I don't know. I don't know why I did it. Like Gus Grissom and the right stuff. It was, there was a glitch. The hatch just blue. I don't know why. I didn't know standing there, we were losing the fucking gay with a guy came by it. I just, I only stuck it out a little bit, man.

Speaker 8:          01:01:19       I just stuck it out a little bit. He's, he's, he just fucking muttering to himself. Why did I do that? Why the fuck? Why did I do that? That was so fucking stuff. There's guys in prison right now. Why did that, why didn't I listen to that voice? Why I paid my taxes? I was a cub scout. Right? I fucking made sandwiches for my kids, send them off to school and then just set one day. My fucking neighbor. Excuse me. Carl, can I talk to you for a second? Um, I know we've discussed this before. Is there any way you could just not have your dog relieve himself on my lawn? And that just happens to be a fucking shovel and you're just looking at his mouth. Yeah. Now that you

Speaker 4:          01:02:21       pedal with the shovel, Bang, you fucking do it. Then you like, fuck, get up. Please get up. Please get up. Did anybody see that? Bury the shovel man. And then you just go down that road and you've never committed a fucking crime and then you end up in jail. It was just because of that one diff circumstances were there. I don't think that that guy's a bad guy. I don't, it was just, you know, the problem is they're being led by a crazy man. Rex Ryan is out of his fucking mind. Another thing that I've said since last fucking year, okay, that guy, I don't know if he's bipolar or fees, manic depressive. All right. But I am a psycho and I can spot another psychopharm a fucking crossed the room. That guy is out of his mind and what the, you know, you gotta buy into your coach's philosophy.

Speaker 4:          01:03:22       Alright, so they bought into his shit. Talk in fucking John Wayne Horse Shit when he was having, they didn't realize he was having a manic episode. You know, all the coaches sign in that bus as he's walking up and the depths of his insecurity saying that, you know, you don't even deserve to be here. He had to so overcompensate for it. He just, by the time he grabbed that Sharpie, his manic episode was so through the fucking roof. He just starts writing on the board. Whooo. So long we're going to win the Superbowl. He did that and he brought all his players up to this manic fucking level.

Speaker 4:          01:04:08       And when you go that high, you crashed that fucking low. And that's what happened in two weeks. This motherfucker, the strength and conditioning coach, no pain, no gain. You got awarded that guy whose dad was probably like Emilio Estefan Fez. I have the festivals, however the fuck you say his name, his dad and the breakfast club, word, word, word. I hate you. You son of a bitch. That was his dad. So he's got that information up there. He's gotten rex. Ryan's manic right in his fucking head. And here comes this dread lodic locked jackass running right by a sticky nail. Stick your fucking knee out. And he just, he went with it. You saw him. He's trying to fight it. Is other niece going, no, no, no. Stay back here with me and the other needs like, fuck that. I'm going in. I'm fucking go in. And he stuck it out and that fucking dude Jesus.

Speaker 4:          01:05:07       Did you ever think that you could take down a professional athlete that easily? He looked like he fell out of a car. He got kneed in the side of the leg on the 40 yard line. He didn't stop rolling until the fuck a 12 yard line. Okay. Oh, can you imagine that? The second he did that shit, that poor bastard. I bet it felt like a cold. Like he was standing under a fucking ice water waterfall. That even makes sense. And then that would be like hale. I could've just said hail whatever. It's fucking cold. And he stand in it and I bet he could even feel this fun fucking from his, his goddamn heart down. He probably couldn't feel anything just going like, oh my God, what did I just do? Oh my God, please get up. Please. Please get up. Oh fuck. Did anybody see that? Did Wreck? See that? Why did I do that? Oh my God. Oh my God. What if I get fired? But if I get fired, he fucking went through all of that shit. That poor bastard. You know? But I got to admit, as a patriots fan, I don't ever have to listen to the fucking jets fans talk about cheating anymore. Do I?

Speaker 5:          01:06:18       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:06:18       Is The post going to have that caught cheating with a little asterisk next to it for the rest of the fucking season. Are you green cuts? Um, so there you go. Whatever. So that's, that's this weekend football that is this week in football. How about those fucking Minnesota Vikings with their inflatable roof, you know, can you imagine if that happened during the game? Even with helmets on, I think somebody could die. It's a weird thing because it's snow. Do you think like, it's just going to be like, you know, getting a snow storm over with in like a half a second. But, uh, that was probably a good couple of hundred pounds of snow and a, I don't know about you guys. I don't want a couple hundred pounds of anything landing on me from the top of a fucking Dome Stadium. Jesus Christ. Yeah. That was one of the saddest moments I've ever seen for a professional franchise. You know, getting ready to play the New York giants, New York football giants. How you guys want it? You want it? They're fucking big blue. Fucking bring it. The 20 minutes you've got to call back. Yeah. Listener, you know about that football game or is there a way we could do it on Monday? Monday would probably work a little bit better cause uh, stadium collapsed and uh, okay. We have to, we have to get a bicycle pump and we have to repair it. We'll duck tape. Yeah. But uh,

Speaker 5:          01:07:44       okay.

Speaker 4:          01:07:45       I figured Detroit's in between your city and our cities. Okay. Yeah. You know, sort of equally distant and uh, yeah. And it's just a suggestion. I yeah, just call me back. Okay. All right. Bye Bye.

Speaker 5:          01:08:02       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:08:04       Oh fuck. So anyways, let's, let's get into the podcast here this week. So that's it. I'm done fucking talking shit. Uh, and I got to tell you something. I'm going to pat myself on back. I could have been a lot

Speaker 8:          01:08:16       meter. I could have been a lot meter. And you know what, I gotta be honest with you. If I believed in our defense a little more, I think I would've been, I think I would have been. How are you doing down there in San Diego? Paez your team slapped you around enough this year. Jesus Christ. Whatever you do, do not bet on the fucking charges. You don't know who the fuck's gonna show up. It's kill or be killed. Rape or be raped. That's what the fuck's going on down in San Diego. They're either going to win 41 nothing or lose 56 to eight. They got a safety. That's how they got the eight. All right. The two field goals in a safety right is that another works maybe then went for a two point conversion. I'm just trying to cover all the basis for the fucking mathletes out there.

Speaker 8:          01:08:58       All right, let's move. Let's move on here. Um, Papa, Papa, Papa, papa bear. Oh, here's something that somebody sent me. They mentioned that they'd seen Paul Mccartney, uh, a beetle on. Uh, why don't I just read the email? What I, let's, who's kidding who, let's be honest. Why don't I just attempt to read this email? Okay. Hey Bill. I just finished watching last night, Saturday night live with Paul Mccartney and I think it's time for Paul to hang it up for good. I feel like a bit of an asshole for thinking it because we're all supposed to be in awe of him because he's a beetle. Uh, they let them do four songs last night because everyone is in awe of him and that's the problem. No one wants to tell the 68 year old man with the dyed brown hair and saggy man boobs that he doesn't have the voice for a live performance anymore.

Speaker 8:          01:09:52       I fear getting old and being irrelevant too. But I hope that when it's my time to retire, I can except that I'm not what I once was and move on to something else that better suits that stage of my life. Paul should look to someone like Bono. Not that I'm a big Bono Fan, but I think he's done it right by, um, imitating Bob Geldof's example of rock and roll for philanthropy. How about a pat on the back for getting through that sentence without fucking it up? Uh, Youtube won't draw a stadium size crowds forever. So Banos set, set himself up as a jet setting friend of the world's poor. Even if he never gave another concert of sung another note, he'd still have a meaningful, he'll still have meaningful work beyond his music. Uh, it's like you were saying in previous podcasts, it's good to have a side business in case show business doesn't work out best regards.

Speaker 8:          01:10:45       Um, yeah. Um, I kind of see what you're saying a little bit, but uh, I know a lot of people saw Paul Mccartney last year on tour and said he was fucking unbelievable. And then I also think that the Beatles right now are a victim of a backlash because of something that they didn't create. I think apple, not apple is a whatever. Itunes. That's right. Itunes. I got real confused there because they had apple and then Macintosh has a fucking apple and that's all it takes to really just send me flying down the fucking sideline. Like that. Dreadlocked son of a bitch. You got tripped anyways. Um, I think iTunes has been trying to get the Beatles catalog. Obviously it's probably the first band you would want to start with as far as if you wanted to make money. They finally got them and they are from the baby boom generation, Steve jobs and all those guys.

Speaker 8:          01:11:41       So this is, you know, this is there Jesus. So they present the band as their Jesus and just eventually it's just inevitable that it's going to a annoyed the generations after. And not to mention, because we weren't born when they were putting out albums, it's impossible for us to see how far ahead of their fucking time they were. You know? And that's something I also see in comedy where I've actually gotten emails from people going, what's the big deal with Richard Pryor? You know, 35 years of people ripping off his shit. They've actually made, you know, some of his stuff. You know, like after 35 years people finally caught up with them, you know, so or like an f at athletic things. Somebody, somebody sent me a fucking email this week. We talking about that a, that running back on Cleveland. Remember that guy I was talking about who has the face mass? Makes them look like the front of a dodge ram pickup truck. Someone was saying they thought Jim Brown of the Cleveland browns was overrated and that they are so sick of hearing about this guy that if this fucking white dude played back in that era with those skinny people who played football, he would have run all over. Which uh, a lot of people say shit like that and it's complete bullshit

Speaker 4:          01:13:05       because

Speaker 4:          01:13:08       is if he played back then look, if you want to stick them in a time machine, yeah, he would run all over those guys. But that doesn't mean he's better. You know what I mean? That's like, okay, I have a big test on Tuesday, um, the me on Friday, we'll go back in time after I've taken the fucking test and then I'll know all the goddamn answers. That's what it's like. If you take today's athletes and you put them back then, which you have to do is just say, okay, if you take that guy and you had him born the same year Jim Brown was born, you know, he'd still be what he is today because of the nutrition. The A, the level of, of, uh, just intelligence about sports and what is possible at that moment, the workout equipment in all of that. But you know, obviously if you take a fucking guy

Speaker 8:          01:13:54       you don't have, the big flaw in that

Speaker 4:          01:13:56       is that kid today is not the Jim Brown of this era or any fucking error, you know? And if you took Jim Brown from back in the day, you had him born in 1980 instead of 1940. And whenever the fuck this guy was born and he had access to all this,

Speaker 8:          01:14:12       all this information about nutrition, sports science and all that, he would have been much bigger than he was. He still would have fucking dominated. All right? So that's one of those sports arguments that they, that, that people have when they're like, they'll talk about Kobe Bryant because they see Coby doing everything that Jordan has already done. They, they equate it, therefore he's as good as Jordan and they forget the fact that no one had ever done that shit until Jordan Jordan changed the game. All right? Same thing with the fucking Beatles. The Beatles was so fucking far ahead of everybody, but now it's, it's 40, almost 50 fucking years later. Yeah. Now you're going to look back on it and have to, everybody's ripped him off as can be like, dude, what the fuck was the big deal? All right. So there's that. And then the last thing is I'm sick of people throwing old people out in the fucking yard.

Speaker 8:          01:15:04       You know, like they're your old iPod speakers. Eh, there's a loose wire. Fuck him. He's out the Goddamn door. I think it's bullshit. All right. I like all people, even that fucking asshole downstairs. I like them. I respect him. And uh, you, you, what it is, is you look at them and you see they're dyed hair and you see their saggy man boobs, right? It wrinkled up tushies. Right? So you equate that with their level of intelligence rather than this fucking guy has walked this planet for 65, 75, 85 fucking years. And uh, you know, what's that expression? As much as things change, they stay the same stitch in time saves now with other fucking him. I remember expressions, whatever, you know, this guy has seen everything that you're about ready to see. He's already seen it. Okay? He didn't have a fucking iPod. Who gives a fuck?

Speaker 8:          01:16:00       All right. A cunt is still a cunt. All right? Some things don't fucking change. And this guy has this whole wealth of knowledge. They, here's a guy's been playing live gigs for 50 something fucking years. All right? He can still physically play. Why wouldn't you want to go see him, you know, with all his fucking experience, you know? Yeah. I mean, I could see if he was jumping off the piano, trying to do splits and touches fucking toes. And then he came down and blew out his knee and they had to give him the fucking, a Geritol rub right on is blown out knee then. Yeah. You know what I mean? But like I don't like that whole fucking, it's like, it's like a corporate mentality. Why your skin's wrinkled up. We have no you, we don't like looking at you beat it.

Speaker 8:          01:16:46       I Dunno. I'd still go pay to see the rolling stones. I would. Why wouldn't you? Why the fuck when those got red. Those guys give me hope that I can sit there and drag my ass out on a fucking stage. 80 years old. What's up with Medicaid, you know, out on a cruise ship. But I do understand what you're saying because I definitely want to, uh, if I'm on stage in my sixties and seventies and sixties is fine cause I'm still going to be fucking annoyed and want to be out there. But in my seventies, if I'm still on fucking stage, I want it to be because uh, because I had not because I need the money because I want to be out there. All right. I remember Keith, Richard's saying like, someone was like, when are you guys going to hang it up? He's like, never, I'm a musician.

Speaker 8:          01:17:39       This is what I do. I will do this in front of two people or 200,000. It's what the fuck I do. You want me to put down my guitar? You know, he has a great line in his book where he talks about how much he loves guitar. I don't know if I said this last week, Keith, which is, has this book called life. It's the fucking shit. And um, he talks about how he loves guitars so much that to this day, like he opens a guitar case and just the smell of a guitar, he wants to crawl in there and close the lid. All right? So if you ask this guy to stop going up playing live, you might as well put a bullet in his brain. You're killing the man. Okay. So having said that, let Paul Mccartney do is fucking thing. Has any been through enough? I mean that guy truly found the love of his life.

Speaker 8:          01:18:27       All right, you fucking dies then. He's in a bad place. Like the fucking jets strength coach. He goes out, he married some gold digging whore with one leg, you know, which was the classic fucking misdirection. Cause I bet the back of his head, he kept going, you know, I think she's a fucking gold digger. And then the other place like dad, she only has one leg man. Stop being so mean. Right? And then he just gave into that and they go, hey, you think if you tried to trip her, you stuck your knee out? Like maybe there was a possibility that she's athletic enough that her fake leg would just fall off and she would just be able to continue hopping down the sidelines and make a play. Granted, she'd get a penalty if she, if she ran out of bounds on her own. You know, that's a question for you this week.

Speaker 8:          01:19:17       If that fucking gold dig in more with the one leg. If she ran down, she had a fucking dolphins uniform on, right? She went to the islands and got her hair braided by some dude in Jamaica. Right. And she comes flying down the sideline. If you stuck your knee out, hit her fake knee. Right. Knocked her fucking leg off. Why am I repeating what you just heard? Everything I just said. Do you think that she would have the ability running full speed? All right, we'll, we'll uh, we'll adjust it a little bit. You tell her you're going to do it. You tell her you're going to do it. You didn't really have legs going to fucking pop off. Now the fake one. Jesus Christ. We think I'm an asshole, but just shut up. You're dumb whore. All right, I'm going to fucking not shut up. I'm going to knock your fake fucking leg off, sweetheart.

Speaker 8:          01:20:03       When you're running full speed, if you can keep your balance. All right, we'll give you some shiny shit. You're gold digging whores. Do you think she could do it? That is my question for you. During the holiday season. Doobie Doobie do and we knock off your fake leg. You can't. Um, all right, what else do we got here? You guys want some youtube videos for the week? MMM. Okay. Once again is great as the black Crowes were. Let's, let's talk about some fucking music that, um, I respect, but uh, I, I have to shut it off every time I hear it. And that is basically the melancholy singer songwriter. Put a gun in your mouth early to mid 70 shit. You know, did I talk about this last week? I can't remember. Like Carol King [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          01:20:59       hey baby [inaudible] is too. They [inaudible] [inaudible] has died and fucking kill yourself.

Speaker 8:          01:21:12       View douchebag. [inaudible] fuck it goes that song. James Taylor, I see. He found, I've seen rain. My fucking friend died in a plane crash and I always thought that I'd see you once again, Carly Simon. That's the way. That's the way I've always heard it should be. I'm telling you right now, don't ever listen to that song on a rainy fucking day. If you put that song in, you have a 40% chance of doing something really harmful to yourself. Joan Baez, diamonds, and rust. You know, and I have the song. If you ever one of those songs ever comes on, you're in a car and you don't have control of the radio and you just feel yourself getting dragged down this bottomless pit. I have the song that is basically like that in adrenaline injection to the heart, like in pulp fiction. Just put on Huey Lewis hip to be square.

Speaker 8:          01:22:13       All right? I can't take 100% credit for that. Me and a young Joe Derosa. All right. The teen idols sensation of the opiate Anthony Program we're taught was, was actually a segment that we'd love to do on the uninformed shelf that we do once every nine years. At this point, uh, we were talking about how it's impossible to be depressed if you listen to Huey Lewis and the news put on hip to be square. I challenge you not to fucking get a smile on your face. It's like trying to hold off a yawn. You know, you can't do it. It's impossible. So, uh, I don't know. I don't need a why I'm bringing this shit up, but like, I don't know what it is about that music. I respect it once again. Get back to the black Crowes thing cause it's actually human beings producing all the sounds that you're hearing.

Speaker 8:          01:23:01       All right. But uh, yeah, you know Jesus Christ already. Do those people have any happy songs? Who's another one? Oh, that that fucking girl sings in the false set of, with a weird eyes. Joni Mitchell singing about a paved, paved the parking lot, pay paradise, turned it into a parking lot. You don't know what you got till it's gone. I'll write Joanie. I got it last week was better. Jesus Christ. You fucking, you know, I don't know. I did, I it, was there any, was there a point that was made there? Other than the fact that I can't sing? Um, oh, here's a music question for this week. As you guys also know other than playing drums, I a I fuck around and guitar. Um, and uh, I recently bought ACDC flick of the switch, another underrated, which I know I did last week. Underrated ACDC flick of the switch. I just want to know what tuning of those people in are.

Speaker 8:          01:24:09       They tuned down like half a step because it's like I listened to the album, I shut it off. Then I go and I go to figure it out. Let's take the first song for you. Guitar players out there. Rising power. All right. He's doing a pull off down to a B court. Right? But are they tuned down like half a step? Because last night I'm sitting there in my jam jams and I got my guitar that I can't even fucking play. And I'm like, you know what, I'm gonna have a little geek moment by myself that nobody can see. I'm going to put on my just fucking record. I'm going to play along to this song. Cause I figured it out the Malcolm part and it sounded like shit. And I tried tune it down half assed and I just could not fucking figure it out. And beyond the fact that I suck, can somebody help me out? What are they doing there? I know it's not a drop d drop d tuning. Cause I know what that sounds like. That sounds like Satan is your bitch and you got, you got some errands for for it to run. I know what that sounds like.

Speaker 8:          01:25:13       And I challenged somebody to come up with a riff in drop d tuning. That doesn't fucking rock. It's just, it's just, it's the shit. Right? But does that tune down half a step that I, I can't fucking get. Come on man. You heard how I sing? Help me out here. Help me out or I'm gonna fucking sing for the rest of this podcast. All right. It's [inaudible] season. All right. Wait, let's, let's continue on here. Um, oh, I got my, uh, I tell you somebody rear ended my Prius. You know what I mean? Which really is like fucking boot in eight year old in the ass when you really think about it. Um, and got it just hard enough where I couldn't walk away and be like, Eh, don't worry about it. You know, my hatchback wasn't quite closing correctly. Um, you know what I mean?

Speaker 8:          01:25:59       Wasn't quite, didn't quite work on the hatchback area. Kind of like a girl with a big booty. You know what I mean? There's always a little bit of butt crack coming out. Who's got a tug? You know, that's how you can judge if you see a girl with a nice ass, whether or not she's a whore or not. If she's constantly trying to adjust their genes and pull them up, sir, ass crack isn't coming out of the back of her pants. Uh, that's a good girl. That's when you can take home to mom. Just make sure she wears a dress.

Speaker 8:          01:26:30       But if she's just standing there with like an inch and a half coming out and she doesn't give a fuck, I can't even say that she's a fucking whore, but either that or she's just accepted who she is. And for some reason that they don't make jeans for girls like that. All right. That's one of those references that it just was such a visual to me that I completely forgot what the fuck I was talking about. Let's go back. We were talking about talking about guitar. Who gives a fuck? Oh, was talking about my car. So anyway, so I'm getting it fixed this week. And uh, so I went down to the rental car place and it was a usual, I go down there and I asked for a fucking, uh, uh, an economy car. You know, I don't give a shit. I really have no pride when it comes to cars, even though I fucking love him.

Speaker 8:          01:27:15       I don't give a fuck. I'm just so into not having debt that I, I'm, I'm, I'm a little miser, so I get this a con I go down and they go, well, the economy car isn't quite ready. We could give me a free upgrade to this four door fucking pickup. And uh, then it just became my, you don't even get outweighs my miserly ways is, uh, I don't like waiting. I refuse to wait. So I go, yeah, fuck it. I'll take it. And then immediately my girl was just like, why did she get that? I can't try that. It's so big. What am I gonna do? I'm like, we only got until Monday. Fucking relax. Plus we got to get the Christmas tree this weekend. All right, well, you know, Dasher red area, Vic said Ledson if you want, how I did that, there was not some Phil Spector Shit that's called just, you just spin it around three 60 away from your mouth and you just keep talking, cause back around you like that. It's a new recording process I just invented. Um, so anyways, uh, I go, yeah, we got to go get the Christmas tree. So for the last two years, I have to admit something to you people. All right. I have been going down to get these fucking Christmas trees and I've been getting the traditional Christmas tree and we all know what it looks like. All right. It looks like someone on the biggest loser about four weeks in. That's what a Christmas tree spots about that full, you know?

Speaker 8:          01:28:43       But there's these other Christmas trees that I noticed, not the scrawny ones, but they are minimalist Christmas trees where you can see the entire trunk and it's like they still have the branches, but there it's very like symmetrical. It looks fucking cool as hell. Clean look and Christmas tree, right? It looks like one of those trees. And like the doctor Seuss books, you know? So I go, you know what? Fuck this. I'm going to get something different. I liked this tree. It looks fucking cool. I think the ornaments are going to hang off it much better as if you know when you get one of those full trees, you know this. Yeah. It's just, it's a fucking pain in the ass. And then the end of the end of the Goddamn, you know, Christmas season, if you're not a dick and you just don't throw it out the side of your car, like a fucking some, you know, some piece of degenerate gambler that owed you money.

Speaker 8:          01:29:44       I said, have it by Tuesday and then you just throw it out the fucking car, right? If you actually do it the right way and you just saw it up, it's a pain in the ass and makes it unbelievable mess this thing, you know, it's like, it's like you have a walk into like, uh, like when I'm out with, with a, with Nia and we'd go out to one of her, uh, her clothing stores and um, if it's like a corporate place, the place is just jam packed with Shit. But if it's like a privately owned, they go out and they buy these individual pieces. They'll buy a couple of sizes of each things that they like. And you go in there, you pray to God that they have your size and it's, and you go in and it's very minimalist. That's the sort of Christmas tree that I bought and uh, you know, knee as a fashion Easter.

Speaker 8:          01:30:29       So I thought she would like it. So I bring this Christmas tree in and the second she looks at it, cause I think she's going to be like, you know, like I live, she just have like techno music on like I'm so far into the fucking future here. The second she looks at it all my confidence just drains out the bottom of my shoes. And I go, yeah, this is the Christmas tree. And she goes, oh yeah, because where's the rest of it? And I'm like, no, no, that's the style. That's the style it's supposed to look like that. I go, doesn't it cool? I mean it looks like one of those trees and Dr Seuss, she goes, yeah, she goes, I think it looks more like that. That Christmas tree in that Charlie Brown cartoon snow, I feel like an asshole. So because I love the verbal abuse that you guys give me every fucking week.

Speaker 8:          01:31:18       I'm actually going to be dumb enough to send a picture of my Christmas tree. Now granted it's naked. It's not all dressed up. It's not all dolled up. All right? It's like Charlie's thrawn in that stupid movie monster that rather than chastising her for being a murderous cont, they actually made a movie that said, maybe guys outta look at themselves and treat bitches a little bit better before they go and start killing you after a blow job. It wasn't that the message in the move SMS a gy got so anyways, it doesn't have any makeup on, which I think should automatically give it a golden globe for being that courageous. It was so brave. It was such a brave performance. I'm just take a look at the Christmas tree. Tell me what you think. I think it looks fucking Badass. I love it. I fucking love it.

Speaker 8:          01:32:08       And uh, I stand by it. You know, I'm breaking a little tradition here. So, uh, go on the [inaudible] podcast.com. Take a look at my Christmas tree. We'll have a whole section where you can leave your goddamn comments about what a moron you think I am. Um, or maybe you actually like. Um, and along with that, you can also look at these youtube videos, the youtube videos of the weak people. I just felt like I should have had a theme, some theme music right there. At some point, at some point, I'm going to have a make enough money in this fucking business. I'm going to make a little studio and I'm going to have all those little sound effects, like a real radio show like Anthi on opiate, Anthony, you know, he's got all those little buttons he pushes and ops got all his little buttons that they push, you know, those button pushing son of a bitches.

Speaker 8:          01:32:57       I want to be one, two, I have dreams. Um, and when I do, I'll have a little fucking theme music here. Uh, but until then, you'll just sit there and listen to the awful silence. All right. Youtube videos of the week that you can watch on the MLM, podcast.com, the official, uh, Fan Webpage, whatever the fuck you call it of the Monday morning podcast. All right, youtube video. Uh, this is one of my favorite ones. Uh, if people puking makes you sick, please don't watch this. But, uh, you know, the great thing of watching a videotape of somebody puking is you don't have to smell it. So you can just enjoy the hilarity that it is. You know what I mean? It's like that shit that people, they, they, the vaporizer with weed, you know, where it gets rid of everything, all the toxins that just keeps the shit that gets you high.

Speaker 8:          01:33:49       This is, this is the vaporizer version of watching somebody puke. Watch this video is this, this is such, this video literally made me cry. Laughing. Uh, epic beer pong puke. Um, it's just, it's got it off the, the, the volume of Puke, the noises kids making when he's puking and then the fucking good natured attitude that this dude has. He actually, he has poise while puking. I think Mark Sanchez could learn a little something about this. You know, a little poison under fire by the way. One of their offensive lineman got hurt. Now Watch your run for his fucking life. All right. This game management son of a bitch. Oh, you're so right about those mother fuckers. All right. Um, all right. Youtube video. Another one. Uh, this one is just so fucking creepy. Um, I love this. I want to go on a date with this woman.

Speaker 8:          01:34:50       Uh, it's called the best model in the world and I'm sure a lot of you guys have already seen this and I'm sure tosh 0.0 is already put up. Uh, but it's the best model in the world hand model and is this woman talking about being a hand model? And for a lot of people it's what she says, but for me it's the way she just keeps stroking her hands. I don't know what she's doing, but it is so fucking creepy. I want to go on a date with her. I want to take her out to dinner, have her sitting across from me as I tell her about how many brothers and sisters I have and my hopes and dreams in life as she sits there nodding, just stroking her hands. And that it would just, it would really, you know, I don't know, call me a fucking psycho, but I would really love to just have that experience.

Speaker 8:          01:35:31       It's on my bucket list. Um, ah. Did I spell this right? The next one is Cammy secret parody, boob apron. You know that thing, that commercial they have out there where a women with the big titties and then all their boobs are always fallen out of their shirt, but they don't like wearing something underneath it to alleviate the problems. So they created this little napkin that hooks onto your bra straps. Uh, first of all, let's pause and just say how fucking brilliant an idea that is. Um, as far as just making $1 million, you know, this checks out there who just have, you know, efficient boobs. It's trying to think of a nice way of saying small boobs, um, um, comparable, capable titties, right. This still going to buy them just because I like having different colors and sometimes I don't want to wear a shirt.

Speaker 8:          01:36:21       And then those other girls who lie to themselves about how big their boobs are and for some reason they've, they buy a D Cup Bra, you know, when they got BEACOPP titties, I don't know why they do that. Kind of like the guy who goes in and buys the magnum condom and then it slips off and he becomes a fucking father for the ninth time. Uh, yeah, just watch that. It's a parody of that. And um, this next one, all I have is a website, but my, uh, my web guys definitely going to have it up. Uh, if you want to watch a video of somebody who's about ready to get arrested by the FBI, watch this video. This guy took one of those, uh, um, you know, as those nerds who rather than going out and getting a pilot license, they go down to an open field and they just fly like a, a fake playing around a model airplane motorized.

Speaker 8:          01:37:07       There it is motorized playing around. This guy put a camera on it and he flew around the New York City skyline. Oh yeah. I'm sure this guy isn't going to get in trouble at all these, they had the brains to blur out their faces, but the dude is talking on the video. You can hear his voice. They're going to get caught. Some Kuntz gonna recognize his voice that he went to high school with. You know, by the way, people, if you do something illegal, if you're going to be dumb enough to videotape it, don't put it on fucking youtube and of all the fucking cities to do it too. I mean it's definitely, the footage is fucking cool, but this guy buzzes the statue of Liberty with this model fucking airplane and considering the military has those drones that can fly around and just vaporize people, it's probably not a good idea to have one of those flying around.

Speaker 8:          01:37:57       I'm going to go out on a limb, so I'll look for that news. Everybody, these guys getting arrested in the next couple of weeks. Um, okay. We also have the youtube video of the uh, the jets strength coach tripping the Dolphin. If you just want to watch that and just watch that with my psycho analysis. Is that all right? My psycho psycho analysis of that guy? Uh, is that it? I think that's it. Those are the youtube videos of the week. And what are we up to here at this point? Ah, by Golly, will you look at that 53 fucking minutes? Um, I know what I need to do. I need the height. My last stand up Gig, my last official, one of the official one of the year. I am going to be at the Improv out here in Bray, California. Beginning this Thursday and I'm can conclude on Sunday and it's going to be a, what's that?

Speaker 8:          01:38:54       December 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th. Um, and I gotta tell you my new hour is, I'm really happy with where it's at. A sign. I figured something out somewhere during Seattle, right through the cobs Gig in San Francisco and I'm really excited, really excited to go out there. So, um, you know, come on out and see me. How about some Latino people? Ah, trying to break into this market out here. Like I, I don't, I don't know how to get in touch with you guys. You know, I started doing that Rosetta Stone Shit. I fucking, I quit it. You know, I really want to learn how to speak Spanish and I'm realizing that if it did a little bit of Rosetta stone and I just had somebody who spoke Spanish or Mexican, whatever the fuck it is, you skip call it. Not trying to offend anybody. I want to know how to do it.

Speaker 8:          01:39:47       I think it's fucking, I don't know, it's a cool language. I want to learn how to say it. Then I can talk to some Spanish women. Who the fuck am I kid? Alright, so that's it. I'm going to be there this Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. All right? If he, if he can't make it there and you're in the San Francisco area, I'm telling you, go see the black rose. Go see them because, uh, I think they're going to take a little bit of a break after this tour from what I've heard. Uh, you know, it just fits into my whole, don't go to the automated checkouts. Don't go to see these fucking auto tune jackasses. Go, go see the real fucking deal. All right there. I'm done with that shit. And with that, is that the podcast for this week? I'm coming up a little short. All of a sudden, am I running out of gas?

Speaker 8:          01:40:29       You know what it is, is I'm, I'm in a, I'm in my vacation mode already and I'm in a silly fucking mood. I got my Christmas tree and I'm going to be singing out those fucking holiday songs this weekend on stage or just society that just for the podcast listeners, and I'm not even going to explain why I'm doing it. I'll be telling Joe Ganim this guy can go fuck himself and style today. Cs Ed Beagle Bay though. Um, all right. Who's kidding? Who am I going to keep repeating that fucking joke? Is that what I'm going to do, Bill? Are you pulling the Paul Mccartney right now and you don't know when to get off stage according to that one fucking listener? I think I am. Did I have any underrated, overrated, underrated? A four door pickup truck like I rented this week, couldn't believe how convenient was I went to go see the black crows. I put me in for other adults in that thing. We went to go see him and then the next day I got a, I got a fucking a Christmas tree in the back, standing upright.

Speaker 8:          01:41:31       You know, it's funny when I put it in the truck, uh, these three people walk, we're walking down the street. One of them was some Mexican dude, any in Spanish. He said something and started laughing and I was convinced he was laughing at my tree. You know another reason why I would have loved to gotten through the Rosetta stone so I could've said in Spanish, um, actually it's not the Charlie Brown tree or right Hector, it's supposed to look like that. Thank you. Very classy is very much just a freak them out. You know what I mean? Cause you know, nobody thinks a white do can speak Spanish. Like how many times did George Bush catch somebody's saying something fucked up as he sat there in his fucking white elite fucking brown penny loafers with no socks in his Pete Carroll coach and pants, right. Jesus Christ to the Seahawks, get their fucking asses kicked this week or what I went to and to this week, everybody, I finally went 500.

Speaker 8:          01:42:29       I got something for, for gamblers out here that I know you're all going to agree with. All right. And, uh, oh before I say, you know, one of the reasons why I didn't do an extra podcast because a lot of people were asking me how come right after the jets game, you didn't do a podcast making fun of the jets. That's because I didn't, I didn't believe in our defense and I thought we had a really good chance of not, uh, you know, of losing that game by a couple of points just because you know, when you let a 24 to 30 points, that's what, you know, that's definitely a possibility. And a, I just thought it would have been bullshit if I came. Yeah. You know what the fuck you, you fucking lost. That's also why I kind of took it easy on you this week, which you probably don't think I did, but hey, I did defend your fucking strength and conditioning coach, didn't I will.

Speaker 8:          01:43:18       All right then why don't I just talk about that and I can't remember what I was talking about. Here's one for the gamblers out there. So I took the eagles last night. All right. Given three and a half against the cowboys. Had they won, I would have gone three and one which I desperately needed instead, you know, and they drive down, write down the fucking field, all right there down by three points and they can kick a field goal and win the bet. But because it doesn't matter, they just want to win the game. They take a knee and they run out the fucking clock. And this is a rule that I think the NFL should do, you know, subtly without letting the public now because they really can't line up with gamblers in anything. I really think that is in a sign of solidarity for the regular Joe out there.

Speaker 8:          01:44:05       We actually had the balls to put money. So believed in your fucking team. If you put money on your fucking team and you have a chance to cover the spread and the final fucking second, she should. God Damn it. You should do it. Andy Reid kicked a field goal. You're fucking asshole. Oh, I needed three in one. I needed that. So fucking bad. Now I'm two with two. I can't pick a game to save my fucking life. You know, it was funny was I took Tampa this week, Tampa and Atlanta had been my goto teams and I, for some reason Carolina has been a little Jekyll and Hyde, so I, the game scared me. It's a divisional game. I just didn't fucking like it. I stayed away and I went with the ramps because the saints have been Jekyll and Hyde and I wasn't buying into this. Oh, here they come, shit that they've been doing the last couple of weeks at Sam Bradford has been shown that he can play at that level. Yeah, hundred percent wrong on that game and I can tell you this right now to save yourself a fucking ulcer. When the team, you bet on throws a pick six I don't give a fuck if it's in the first quarter. Shut the game off. It's over the goddamn 14 point. Turn around. All right, whatever. I Bitch Moan and complain enough.

Speaker 4:          01:45:16       What? Common right up on an hour. I think that's a good, that's a good, that's a good number, isn't it? That's it. God bless all of you. I hope you enjoyed the podcast this week. Get out there and go do your quads at Christmas or a Hanukkah is it over yet? I saw a couple of people driving around with Menorahs on top of the car is not even bullshitting. Um, I thought only idiots did that with Christmas trees. Uh, they mocking the idiocy of Christians or they like, we can be dumb to, you know, like how women do, how come only you guys get to box and have brain damage. We want to do it too. You know, why are women so convinced that everything guys do is so fucking worthy of getting involved in too? You know, we're dumb. Just sit back and think a minute. Just sit back and think a minute. I want to join the workforce rather than sitting around hanging out with cute little kids. I know it's a job. What the Fuck's wrong with you?

Speaker 8:          01:46:16       Wouldn't that be awesome as a guy? Just think about that right now. If the roles were reversed, you know, and you had the option of just marrying some rich broad who just go out there and just take care of you and all you gotta do is just keep the house clean and make a meatloaf a couple times a week you can just tap out.

Speaker 4:          01:46:39       Yeah. You know, I'm not saying you have to do that, but there's a lot of us out there who would, yeah, I do that for a couple. I think I'll be in fucking stay at home dad for a couple of, and just chill the fuck out.

Speaker 4:          01:46:52       Right. Getting incredible shape. So sick. All those broads out there talk. Well, I get, I understand what they're out of shape because they had to carry the baby. But if you're a guy, there's no fucking reason why you can't be in shape. You didn't have to carry that kid around. You know, you got all day long to work out. Oh my God. There'll be the shit. I know what you think of. Oh, these kids, they never fucking go to sleep. Yeah, they do. They take a nap every fucking you can nap with them. You can figure out a time, you can go out and go buy all kinds of healthy food and then just chill out. I would get the fucking NFL package. I would just whined to my rich wife, just be a, come on guys, I won. Yay. Would you, you do like the, you know they do the little girl thing when they want something.

Speaker 4:          01:47:42       Oh I just drive. I just draw. Maybe you'd buy it for me. I do that with the NFL package. Right. Do you know, just make it a little easier when the kids are screaming, all right, and I would fucking tape every goddamn game. It would be my mission every week that I was going to watch all 16 NFL Games or whatever the fuck they have. Cup people have by weeks, 14 games, whatever the fuck it is. And I would sit there like a fucking defensive coordinator who was waiting for the phone to ring, you know, and what's going to get picked up or some shit. And I would just, I would watch all of those games and I would get a gate, I get a, a padded fucking play room where the kids couldn't hurt themselves and I just fucking get a gate where they couldn't get out and I just stick them in there all day and uh, play amongst yourselves and that I would just watch all these games and every once in awhile I would just throw food in there. Like they were like, you know, animals at the zoo.

Speaker 5:          01:48:44       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:48:46       You know, rather than make it three sandwiches, I make one big one and I just throw it in the middle and then just film it like the discovery channel, you know, with the pecking order, like the, the most dominant male lion gets to eat first, then all the other ones sitting there, you know, Growlin and shit. Waiting to see when the, when the biggest one is full, when they can go in. I think I'd like that. Uh, all right, that's it. That's a podcast for this week. Please help me out. I want to know about that one legged gold dig and whore running down the sideline. If she could keep going. I want to know what tuning ACDC is using on the flick of the switch album, particularly. Uh, uh Oh, it houses on fire and rising power. And, um, it'll be funny if it's standard tuning my ears just that bad. And, uh, what's the last thing? Was there anything else? I know I fucking asked you something else. I don't fucking know what. All right, that's the podcast for this week. Have a great week. Hope you enjoyed it and go [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          01:49:53       Yay.
