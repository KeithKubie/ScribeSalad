00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.520
&gt;&gt; Let's be clear, drinking milk is a really

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.680
important trait. In fact, it defines an entire group

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.780
in the animal kingdom called mammals, which we are.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.920
Mammals are defined as a group of animals that

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.230
can breast feed their young with breast milk. And

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.660
this is possible because we have a lactase gene

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.460
that's transcribed and translated into the lactase protein, which

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.490
is able to metabolize lactose found in breast milk.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.030
&gt;&gt; And breast milk is one of the best sources of nutrients

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.940
for newborn babies. But eventually we grow up and we

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.680
grow out of drinking breast milk and on to solid foods.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.110
&gt;&gt; This process, this transition from going from breast milk to solid food is

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.960
something we call weaning. And there are lots of changes that happen when an

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.240
animal actually is weaned off of breast milk. And one of the most important

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.110
changes relevant to what we're talking about

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.050
is that, that lactase gene turns off.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.063
&gt;&gt; However, a recent mutation at least in

00:00:51.063 --> 00:00:54.845
an evolutionary sense, allows the lactase gene to stay turned on, which

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:59.134
allows us to drink lactose products throughout our life. For example, milk.

00:00:59.134 --> 00:01:01.910
&gt;&gt; This mutation or change in the DNA sequence.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.702
I want you to tell me if you think it

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:06.454
actually occurs in the coding region of the lactase

00:01:06.454 --> 00:01:09.471
gene or the non-coding regions of the lactase gene. Go

00:01:09.471 --> 00:01:11.559
ahead and pick which answer you think is the

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:13.705
best, and put in your best reason in the text

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:14.458
box here. Don't worry about getting the text box

00:01:14.458 --> 00:01:14.682
answer right or wrong, just give it your best shot.
