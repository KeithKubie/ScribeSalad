00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.250
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Hello everyone.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.930
My name is Reto Meier and welcome to This
Week in Android Development.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.630
This week in Android developers live Roman,
Nick and Adam will be hosting the first episode

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.540
of Android Design and Action live out of our
New York and London studios.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.520
This week's theme is transit apps so they'll
be taking some of the apps that Ian and I

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.070
looked at in the app clinic last Friday and
giving them a design makeover.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.849
On Wednesday, we have three Android developer
Office Hours scheduled, starting with our

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.769
European friendly broadcast coming out of
our London studio starting at 2 pm British

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:31.769
summer time.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.160
A few hours later at 2 pm Pacific Time, join
hosts Joe Melon and Trevor Johns as they answer

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.230
your Android developer questions live.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.610
This week's topic is building Android apps
using the web so make sure you put your questions

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.500
in the moderator or join us live via hangout
to participate during the broadcast.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.820
Then on Thursday, Bruno, will be broadcasting
live from Sao Paulo for a Portuguese language

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.570
addition of Android Developer Office Hours,
that's at 7 pm Sao Paulo time.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.650
Ian Ni-Lewis and I will be putting stopwatch
and timer apps on the table during the app

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.580
clinic on Friday at 1 pm Pacific time.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.390
Our goal is to help developers learn the tips
and tricks that it takes to make a good app

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.720
and make it great.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.200
So be sure to use the moderator page linked
here to nominate the stopwatch and timer apps

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.960
you would like us to take a look at.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.189
Straight after the app clinic join Dan Galpin
and this week's celebrity hat winner for another

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.820
episode of the Friday Games Review.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.890
That's at 2pm Pacific time.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.030
Dan's decided to go freestyle this week so
there's no set theme.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.810
Just use the moderator page and let us know
which games you'd like Dan and his hat to

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.220
review this week.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.259
As always you can keep track of what we've
got coming up on Android Developers Live at

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.400
Developers.Google.com/live/Android.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.830
And that's got a complete schedule of all
of our upcoming broadcasts as well as links

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.350
to all of our previous shows.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.580
Speaking of which, in addition to our regular
Office Hours last week, Ian and I looked at

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.530
transit apps, particularly Offi, M-Parking,
QuickMuni, London Underground, STM and the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.869
UK Bus Checker.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.970
And on the Friday Games Review, Dan and Koh
reviewed collectible card games.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.170
Both of these videos are now available for
you to review on YouTube.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.230
In other Android developer news last week,
we now learned that have over 480 million

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.510
Android devices activated with another 1.3
million devices being activated every day.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.220
As always, there were many apps launched last
week and some upgrades including an upgrade

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.730
from Q&amp;A app Quora, the official US Open app,
Quotes, a new app for tracking your investments

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.790
and a new update from note taking app, Catch.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.340
That's all from this week in Android Development.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.220
My name is Reto Meier, thank you for watching.
