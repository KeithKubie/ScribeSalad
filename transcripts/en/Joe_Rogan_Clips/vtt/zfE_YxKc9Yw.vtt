00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.510
A barber shop was,

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.440
was a male domain because you'd also get advice on sexual diseases because of

3
00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:07.710
course everybody had like syphilis.
Oh,
right.

4
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:10.810
So this is a fake nose.

5
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.820
So everybody sort of lost their noses.
Okay.

6
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.560
So something you probably don't,

7
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.950
something you probably don't know about syphilis.

8
00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:25.270
I don't know if we have that image of,
um,
of syphilis that I sent.
Um,

9
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.200
poor Jamie.
I told the,
I'm your booking manager,
Matt stags.
I said,

10
00:00:29.201 --> 00:00:32.080
send these images to Jamie and don't tell them any contacts,
you know,

11
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:34.840
and you're like,
hell,
is this podcast going to be on?
Um,

12
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.540
but they lost their noses.
So syphilis,
um,
attack,

13
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.040
sort of the soft tissue and the image that I sent through,

14
00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:44.040
which we'll show in a minute on the,

15
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:48.310
the guy has holes in his scalp as well.
Yeah.

16
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:51.910
It's a photograph that is a photograph from the 19th century.
So he actually,

17
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.930
he held onto his nose though.
So you could just cover that with a hat.
Oh,

18
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.460
but,
but it was,
it was incredibly painful.
And you,

19
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.490
Al Capone had syphilis and so you lost your mind.

20
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.470
It attacked the soft tissues to the brain.
It was really,
so people today,

21
00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:08.681
you know,

22
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:11.410
I'll show these images on my Instagram or Twitter and people will be like,
wow,

23
00:01:11.411 --> 00:01:14.650
I didn't know syphilis was so bad.
It's like people died from it all the time.

24
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.560
And the focus was also responsible for powdered wigs.

25
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.700
You know that story right now for an 18 cent?
No.
Yeah,

26
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:23.950
you got something when it was a,

27
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.010
I forget some noble person got syphilis and started wearing a wig and when they

28
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:31.570
started wearing wigs,

29
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:34.900
other people started to emulating them because they were the celebrities of the

30
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:38.530
kingdom.
I feel like this is a drunk history.
No,
she's real legitimate.

31
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.080
And the more wealthy you were like,

32
00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.210
cause it's syphilis makes your hair fall out as well.
Yeah.

33
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.440
I mean it wasn't your fault.

34
00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:48.700
Your teeth fall out and so the more wealthy you were,

35
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.670
the bigger and taller your wig would be.

36
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.370
That is where the term big wigs.
Oh,
that's interesting.
Yeah.

37
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.400
I knew that in the 18th century that the wigs were getting bigger as the,

38
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.350
like the fashions.
In fact,
um,
uh,

39
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.050
my husband illustrated book called the join link is at,

40
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:09.100
and as it's sort of like an 18th century newspaper and as the newspaper on moves

41
00:02:09.101 --> 00:02:13.750
on,
the women would have to sit at the bottom of the carriage because their wigs

42
00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:15.700
were so high in some cases,

43
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.770
but in the women had syphilis.
Oh my gosh.
Yeah,
absolutely.

44
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:23.980
Cause it would be passed on or so that's probably why they had wigs as well.

45
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.980
Yeah.
And I'm with syphilis,
you know,

46
00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:30.820
your nose fell off and it was so prevalent in the 19th century that they had no

47
00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:34.510
nose clubs.
So people would get together.
Yeah.
And they would,

48
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.230
in London they would share the fact that,
you know,
we don't,
yeah,

49
00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:41.830
we lost her nose.
We have syphilis smell.
Anything either.
No.
I mean it was awful.

50
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.280
And actually one of the ways that they treated syphilis was through mercury,

51
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.870
which is very poisonous.

52
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.320
And so when you talk about the loss club writers,

53
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:52.080
and I don't know if that's the no nos glow,

54
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.770
but they might not have STDs with those

55
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.610
top hats and underwear.
Pull up the thing though about bigwigs.
Oh,

56
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.990
so I can show her.
Do you see that one right up there?
Oh,
oh yeah,
that's,

57
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.190
that's fine.
If you go up,
wait up Jamie and go.
Yes.

58
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.500
So that man didn't lose his notes for syphilis,

59
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:15.180
but that's an early form of a rhinoplasty that they,

60
00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:18.760
that dates back to the renaissance and you'd have to stay in that position for

61
00:03:18.761 --> 00:03:21.590
weeks.
While that grafted,
um,

62
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.500
I believe this man was injured,
had a cut of,
as for people just to listing,

63
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:31.501
there's a slice off of his arm that's connected to his nose and they have taped

64
00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.230
and strapped his arm to the top of his head.

65
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.420
So he's to stay in this position while his,

66
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.370
the trunk of his arm grows into his face and then they're going to cut it and

67
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:46.870
remove it when it develops its own blood supply.
It's like,
it's like the nick,

68
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:51.460
if people have watched that show nick on,
they have a scene with us.
So yeah,

69
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:56.020
it was so uncomfortable on you're better off with no nos.
Yeah,

70
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:56.920
you might be better off.

71
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.300
And Mercury of course you would lose your teeth and it just really awful kinds

72
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:05.570
of things.
I did your now and how long did that last for the mercury thing?
Uh,

73
00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.580
all the way into the 19th century.
And so there's a phrase,

74
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.400
a bunch of people died when they go,
hey guys,
this paper's still copying.

75
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:16.320
You know,
I mean based on the,
yeah.
Okay.
Syphilis hidden between powder.

76
00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:19.270
Whey civil is ever going to leave 15 hundreds year of left people with patchy

77
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.180
hair loss.
Um,
go to go to the actual,
um,

78
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.860
the who was it was what?
Yeah.
So these nobleman,

79
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.460
they're all gross.
Disgusting people with STDs.
What about,

80
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.490
what is the name of the guy?
Hold on,
don't scroll.
Go back up here.
Yeah.
Okay.

81
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:39.240
There it is.
Louis the 14th,
only 17.

82
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.650
His mom started saying words baldest might hurt his reputation.

83
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.060
Louie hired 48 wig makers to save his image five years later.
King.
So,

84
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.100
but if you scroll down then likely had syphilis.
Boldman luckily had syphilis.

85
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.900
So this is what started it all out.
Yeah.
That's interesting.
Yeah,

86
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.960
that's hideous to like.
Well,
there were some modern sensibilities,

87
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:02.740
like that just looks so bizarre.
Well,
not only,
yeah.
I mean,
everything's gross,

88
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:06.910
right?
No one's washing themselves.
They don't know what germs are.

89
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.460
Still forced to watch a Hollywood movie.
They're like,
oh,

90
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:13.000
it'd be so beautiful to live in the pet now.
We're such assholes with that is,

91
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.250
that drives me crazy when people want to pretend that it was so lovely.

92
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.300
There are terrible things about life today.
There absolutely are.

93
00:05:19.301 --> 00:05:23.080
But this is the best time to be alive ever by far.
Yeah.
People say on,

94
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:26.770
is this the best time medically?
And it's like,
well,
hopefully that's always true.

95
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:29.770
Right.
Yet,
hopefully tomorrow is the,
is better than,
you know,
hopefully we're,

96
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.980
we're advancing and learning more or no.
