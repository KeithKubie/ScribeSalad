00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
The game is gonna involve three dots.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.460
They could be anywhere.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.560
I said I wasn't going to put them in a triangle

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.080
but that's kind of difficult to avoid.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.660
Uh, it's not particularly meant to be a an equilateral triangle.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.340
Let's call this 'A', 'B', and 'C'

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.640
And I'm going to put a starting point

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.980
just randomly on the paper.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.780
And all we're going to do is roll

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.120
this lovely dice...

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.040
die? dice? (who cares?)

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.900
...to decide which point to go towards,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.020
and whatever point we choose

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:23.840
we're gonna go half way.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.620
So let's call 'A' 1 or 2.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.160
If we get one or two, we'll go half way towards 'A'.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.540
And this is gonna be 3 or 4

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.120
and C can be 5 or 6.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.680
Uh, so, I just rolled a 2, so I need to go halfway to the point that has been chosen at random

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.080
which is A in this case.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.040
So, um, we could measure this.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.920
For the sake of speed I'm just gonna go roughly half way

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.180
I think you could believe that, if you run a line there, we're gonna put a dot there.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.940
And we're going to keep doing this for a while.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.200
We're iterating, so we're repeating - we get the last result and work from that.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.940
But the start point could be anywhere. I could have put the start point outside of the triangle

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.240
and I could still head towards one of these dots.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.660
Let's just see what happens when I keep rolling the dice.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.960
I've just rolled a two again, so from-- that was the dot I had before, and I've gone halfway from the previous dot.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.680
And that's my halfway point.  So if I roll this one again...

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.040
One!  Uh, I wish I'd rigged this now.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.700
From this dot (the last dot I had) halfway towards the 1, so it's gonna-- we're just aiming towards 1.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.780
This is unlikely to keep going, but, I dunno. Place your bets now.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.760
Four! Four is the B dot, so I've got to go, kinda from the previous dot, halfway on this line is about there.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.560
And I've jumped a long way this time.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.620
One, back towards A, so we're going there. And I'm gonna just keep doing this.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.720
So, you got the idea I think now. From the previous dot, we go towards one of these.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.040
Two. Your dice is rigged Brady.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.480
Six. Excellent, we've gone all the way.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.660
This was a dot-- kind of halfway over there.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.240
Six.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.380
One.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.100
Back up here...

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.080
Two.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.420
Five. All the way down here.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.860
I'm going to do this a lot now, Brady. Maybe this would be worth speeding up.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:12.320
[music]

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.540
Ah, I'm bored. [Laughs]

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.040
But, it's not that exciting. The interesting thing that's happening is that it created kind of some lines,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.500
but basically I've just made a lot of dots on the paper.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.480
It's possible that something interesting would happen if I could do this quick enough

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.280
that I wouldn't get so bored that I have to stop.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.940
Uh, but maybe we want a computer to do this.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.480
We have a problem with the computer though on random numbers.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.980
Like, uh, generating random numbers, uh, it's difficult when a computer has to do what it's told.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.660
But, let's, uh, park that issue for another video, perhaps.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.830
If I could get a computer to roll the dice for me and put the dot on,

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.390
then we could see what happens quickly,

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.580
and, let's do that.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.780
This screen has, just as we had,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.450
we've got three dots, they're not even in a nice equilateral triangle,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.220
they can be anywhere. This thing says 'trace point',

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.880
it's just going to trace where that goes,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.700
and the computer is, with its magic, gonna choose A, B or C,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.280
and move that point halfway -- accurately this time.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.220
So you see that it's leaving a mark anywhere it goes.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.140
So it's gone to A several times in a row, jumped to B,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.040
and then back to A, and then to C.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.760
But, I mean, doing a running commentary on this for any longer than I have done

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.180
is probably not going to make anyone's day.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.570
So let's speed it up, ah, go a little bit faster and you begin to see something similar to the

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.800
structure I had. The outlines get defined quite well.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.720
But I'm just going to speed up a little bit more because the outcome of this,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.600
I genuinely think is slightly surprising, but also a little tiny bit frightening,

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.340
because you start to wa-- wait... is that structure I'm seeing...

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.900
am I imagining that?

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.900
How is it dodging those little weird patches in the middle?

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.650
Why is it never going in those?

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.220
They're definitely triangles now.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.680
And then I start to see a shape which actually if you've done any sort of

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.280
investigating bits of recreational maths, this is a familiar shape.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.520
It's full of triangles.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.212
It looks like that trace point, wherever it's going, which is definitely going randomly,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.400
I haven't rigged this, this is doing it differently every time we run it,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.860
but it is dodging those triangles and it's making

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.440
a shape, which I think everyone can see now.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.600
This is called the Sierpenski Gasket. It turns up all over the place.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.740
This is a fractal thing you get, actually you can see now,

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.960
I think we've got enough to see that the big triangle,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.380
uh, has a black triangle in the middle, and...

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.380
three copies of itself around the outside of that black bit.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.820
But then each copy of itself has a black bit in the middle and three copies around itself.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.860
And that's what a fractal is, the self similar thing, you zoom in and you see a little copy of itself.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.660
But the fact this is genuinely coming from rolling a dice on a computer and doing it quickly...

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.380
Makes me... sss-- I don't know, just slightly disturbed about reality.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.800
Brady: I would have thought every point... had-- had a chance of being filled at some stage,

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.580
but there are lots of areas that will just never get touched.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.040
Right, and so I mean-- And you can rig it so, I-- I said you could start anywhere, right?

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.000
So I could start with my point right in the middle.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.660
And then we definitely have a point right in the middle, in that black.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.600
But what happens if you iterate enough, it veers away from that.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.020
So, the long-term behavior is what's interesting, is that even if you start in a black thing...

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.040
the-- the random going half way moves you away from that black area and you...

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.240
Actually, the technical term for this shape is called an attractor.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.740
Um, some people, you may have heard of these things called strange attractors in chaos theory.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.990
Well it's kind of advanced maths in it, but this shape is the attraction and it's also just, it's just pretty.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.180
The fact that random behavior produces something which is very structured, it is a nice outcome.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.140
Well, we had three points. I mean, we could have four, we could have five, we could, pick a number, um,

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.200
uh, probably a whole number, otherwise counting the points is difficult.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.840
We could have four points and say, well, let's roll a dice, or a four-sided dice (a d4) to go to one of those.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.720
What pattern would you get? You could say, instead of going half way, go a third of the way,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.280
or 3/4 the way, what will happen?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.080
Do any of them make patterns? Do they go chaotic?

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.100
People have spent a long time fiddling with the rules.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.920
It's nice to find out for yourself, but there's one rule I'll show you which does something

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.060
which nobody really expected. So I-- I'm not going to go into details. This is worth looking up.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.960
But I've got a red shape and a blue shape, and they're kind of just summarizing...

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.020
two possible outcomes of the rule. Like...

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.480
we'll start with a point and with some probability would go to one of the corners of the red triangle...

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.640
um, but with a small probability will-- will flip over to the blue triangle.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.120
And every time you kind of roll a dice to see where to go...

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.840
you-- you follow this slightly more complicated set of rules but just, they're just random.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.460
Like, you go here with a certain probability, and then you flip back to the red one with a certain probability.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.140
And...

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.100
if you look up, uh, this particular rule, you get this picture after a while you start to see these

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.719
green dots appearing in what looks like

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:19.219
a very structured way in fact it becomes

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:20.659
very obvious if you run it long enough

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.420
that the picture you're getting looks

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.900
like something real. It looks like a fern.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.860
That's crazy!

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.700
This is called Barnes Lee's fern

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.280
compare it with a real fern it's

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:31.579
surprisingly accurate. This is a nice

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:32.869
example of how you don't have to draw

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:34.909
something natural by hand. All the

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:37.009
information for this fern is captured in

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:39.110
a few lines of probability like the

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.449
rules of the game are the fern or are a

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:43.069
picture of a fern. It's actually really

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.140
useful if you want to program video game graphics.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.820
You don't want to draw every tree,

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.300
every fern. So if you can just kind

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.050
of store all the trees and ferns as a rule

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.369
and say whene- whenever you want a fern you

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:54.679
just do that for a while. That is a much

00:06:54.679 --> 00:06:56.599
easier way to sort of ca... And lots of

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.579
natural things turn out to have this fractal

00:06:58.579 --> 00:07:00.769
structure, self similar things which

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:02.620
means you can generate them by iterating stuff.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.260
Genuinely good graphics coming

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:07.759
from the fractal generated graphics

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.619
rather than hand-painted. To get the

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:11.479
structure of a tree on repeat if you

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:12.939
just add one tree and you copied it,

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:14.629
it becomes really obvious when you're

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:15.889
running around the forest like it's just

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:17.539
a computer forest. But if it looks,

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:19.099
has this natural sort of variation with

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.500
some randomness in it, you get much more realistic looking

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.940
trees and ferns and things.

There's also a link in the video description.

00:08:11.602 --> 00:08:15.610
I'd recommend this one about the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas,

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.365
bit of an interest of mine. It's got some really cool stuff

00:08:18.365 --> 00:08:21.380
about how mountains are formed and, would you believe it,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.520
it's part of a 36 part series of lectures

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.680
called "The World's Greatest Geological Wonders".

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.440
Have a look at that, that's seriously interesting stuff.
