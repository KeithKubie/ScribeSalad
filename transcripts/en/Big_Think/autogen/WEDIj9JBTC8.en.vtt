really not worth talking about today the

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120
really not worth talking about today the
 

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.430

important point is that equity gets

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:12.440
important point is that equity gets
 

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.139
important point is that equity gets
everything that's left over after the

claim now the good thing about the
 

00:12:17.899 --> 00:12:19.449
claim now the good thing about the
residual claim is the business grows in

00:12:19.449 --> 00:12:19.459

but all that value goes to the

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:24.829
but all that value goes to the
 

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:26.560
but all that value goes to the
stockholder so the question is why was

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:26.570

put some money inside you start
investing money let's say you could save

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:51.930
investing money let's say you could save
 

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:55.070
investing money let's say you could save
$10,000 at 22 and you can earn a 10%

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080
$10,000 at 22 and you can earn a 10%
 

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.720
$10,000 at 22 and you can earn a 10%
return on that money between now and

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:56.730
return on that money between now and
 

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:58.850
return on that money between now and
then time you retire what would you have

00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860
then time you retire what would you have
 

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.550
then time you retire what would you have
in 43 years the answer is you put aside

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:01.560
in 43 years the answer is you put aside
 

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.400
in 43 years the answer is you put aside
$10,000 you don't save another penny and

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:04.410
$10,000 you don't save another penny and
 

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.290
$10,000 you don't save another penny and
you invested it in your 10% of your

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:06.300
you invested it in your 10% of your
 

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.180
you invested it in your 10% of your
money each year you'd have six hundred

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:08.190
money each year you'd have six hundred
 

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.060
money each year you'd have six hundred
thousand dollars in your 43 and the

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:11.070
thousand dollars in your 43 and the
 

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.430
thousand dollars in your 43 and the
reason for that is well in year one your

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440
reason for that is well in year one your
 

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.620
reason for that is well in year one your
$10,000 would become 11 your two year

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:15.630
$10,000 would become 11 your two year
 

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.290
$10,000 would become 11 your two year
$11,000 would grow by 10 percent and so

00:22:18.290 --> 00:22:18.300
$11,000 would grow by 10 percent and so
 

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.150
$11,000 would grow by 10 percent and so
you'll be earning interest not just on

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:20.160
you'll be earning interest not just on
 

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.950
you'll be earning interest not just on
your original principle but you'd earn

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960
your original principle but you'd earn
 

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:23.900
your original principle but you'd earn
interest on the interest you during the

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:23.910
interest on the interest you during the
 

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:25.460
interest on the interest you during the
previous year and that compounding

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:25.470
previous year and that compounding
 

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.560
previous year and that compounding
effect allows money to grow in an almost

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:27.570
effect allows money to grow in an almost
 

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.630
effect allows money to grow in an almost
exponential fashion now obviously if

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640
exponential fashion now obviously if
 

00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.270
exponential fashion now obviously if
ever more than 10% you can earn even

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280
ever more than 10% you can earn even
 

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.730
ever more than 10% you can earn even
higher returns no that's if you put

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:34.740
higher returns no that's if you put
 

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.910
higher returns no that's if you put
$10,000 inside in 22 you have $600,000

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:37.920
$10,000 inside in 22 you have $600,000
 

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.350
$10,000 inside in 22 you have $600,000
in 43 years that's pretty good

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360
in 43 years that's pretty good
 

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.940
in 43 years that's pretty good
what if you had to wait not until you

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:40.950
what if you had to wait not until you
 

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.670
what if you had to wait not until you
were 32 the problem there is a year 33

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:43.680
were 32 the problem there is a year 33
 

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.780
were 32 the problem there is a year 33
you'd only have two hundred and thirty

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:44.790
you'd only have two hundred and thirty
 

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.010
you'd only have two hundred and thirty
two thousand dollars maybe that's not

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:46.020
two thousand dollars maybe that's not
 

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.780
two thousand dollars maybe that's not
enough to retire so a key thing here is

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:47.790
enough to retire so a key thing here is

okay now let's talk about the risk of
losing money now let's assume that in
