00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.987
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:01.987 --> 00:00:02.820
SCOTT BERKUN: Hello.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.540
How you guys doing?

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.060
Good.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.485
You guys are awake.

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:07.360
You're all around me.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.280
You're surrounded.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.967
I'm surrounded.

00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:10.550
Which is good.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.750
I am wearing pants.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.600
Have no fear.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.130
Most of you seem to be
wearing pants, as well.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.400
As best I can tell.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.700
Very good.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.660
So I have an unusual
story to tell you.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.780
About an unusual book.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.920
So as a writer--
so I'm a writer--

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.190
I make a living writing books.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.900
This is my fifth book.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.470
And I'm a critic of other
writers, as most writers are.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.300
I think that we have a problem
with expertise and punditry

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.450
right now.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.460
That it's very
easy for people who

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.030
maybe used to do something
years and years ago

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.540
and became famous for giving
advice or being experts

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.170
about things,
arrogantly give advice

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.640
and write books about the five
ways to be more innovative.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.400
Or the ten ways to do this.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.755
And they get a lot of
prescriptive advice

00:00:57.755 --> 00:00:59.380
about things that
they probably haven't

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.360
done in a very long time.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.060
And I think that's a problem.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.340
And as someone who's made a
living for the last decade

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.320
as an author, I've
been afraid that I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.130
have become victim
of the same thing.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.070
So I've been looking
for an opportunity

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.280
to go back into a real job.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.650
Of course writing is very
difficult and very real,

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.080
but it's not real in the
same sense of actually having

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.530
to manage a team of
people, and make a product,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.950
and try to make revenue
and all those sorts

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.594
of challenging tasks.

00:01:26.594 --> 00:01:28.010
Then I thought
that at some point,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.430
I should go back and
see how much of what

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.200
I had written in
other books and advice

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.860
I had given other people
that I actually practice.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.690
So that's the story behind this
book, "The Year Without Pants."

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.450
I spent a year working
for WordPress.com.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.870
And I'll tell you more about
WordPress and about what

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.910
I did there, but this
is an unusual story

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.280
to tell because the book is
not structured around the ten

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.290
tactics, or the ten
tips, or the five tricks.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.260
Instead, what I wanted
to do with the book

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.870
was to actually
honestly document

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.410
what it's like to be a manager
at a new company on a new team

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.130
in a culture that is still
figuring out what it is.

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.550
I don't know of any
book that has done that.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.279
There are many books that you
read that profile companies.

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.070
And there have been
many books about Google

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.600
that I'm sure you have read.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.440
But those books are typically
written by outsiders.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.320
They're typically
written by journalists.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.250
People who are not engineers.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.220
People who are not veterans
of start-up companies

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.680
or making products.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.820
And often they have
to trade their sharper

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.590
words or their more
critical thoughts

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.160
to get access to write the
book in the first place.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.130
So this opportunity
was unusual in that I

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.760
had no restrictions on
what I could write about.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.230
And the story as to how I got
hired is also very interesting.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.260
So before I started
this career as a writer,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.550
I worked for a decade--
about a decade,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.855
nine years-- at a little
company called Microsoft.

00:02:56.855 --> 00:03:00.130
And I worked on a product
called Internet Explorer.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.820
I worked on Internet Explorer 1.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.870
And I worked there
for about nine years

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.660
and then I left to write books.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.630
And one of those
books happened to be

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.770
read by the founder
of WordPress.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.450
A guy named Matt Mullenweg,
who started WordPress,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.810
the open source blogging
platform project in 2003.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.490
So he and I knew each other.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.974
We'd exchange email
here and there.

00:03:19.974 --> 00:03:21.390
Every now and then
he might ask me

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.760
for a little bit of advice
about project management.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.100
Or managing teams of people.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.110
And at some point he decided
that the company, which

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.100
up until 2009 had been
completely flat, so of the 50

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.960
employees there, they all
reported directly to him.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.390
All the developers
and designers,

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.757
completely flat company.

00:03:39.757 --> 00:03:42.340
They started to recognize that
there were limitations to that.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.730
And that maybe they needed
to try something else.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.310
And what they're going to try
was this radical, crazy idea

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.440
called teams.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.370
Form into teams.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.900
But they had never
done this before.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.260
They weren't sure what to do.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.210
And part of Matt Mullenweg's
mad genius notion

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.170
for how to figure
out how to do this

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.700
would be to form the
company to about 10 teams.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.840
And to pick one person
from outside the company

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.790
to manage one of those teams.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.160
And that person was me.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.020
So I was hired to be one of the
first team leads at the company

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.570
and to help them try to figure
out how to change their culture

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.890
and how to make a slightly
more structured environment

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.010
work at the company at all.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.510
So

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:29.480
That's my story and if you
choose to tweet or broadcast

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.260
anything I'm saying,
that's great.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.620
My hashtag, my handler
rather, is berkun

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.750
and the hashtag
for any discussions

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.990
of the book while I am
on this tour is #nopants.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.070
Which I think is really cool.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.750
One Of the pleasures of being
up there and using names

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.736
for books is if you
pick the right name,

00:04:48.736 --> 00:04:50.610
you get to come up with
crazy little hashtags

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.090
and other jokes.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.730
So I take great pleasure in
that and I hope that you do,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:56.960
as well.

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.960
So let me tell you a
little bit about WordPress.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.980
How many of you have
heard of WordPress?

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.590
Just sanity check.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.630
How many of you-- I shouldn't
ask the second question.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.070
I won't ask that question.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.720
So WordPress has
had enormous success

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.110
in part because of
it's open source roots.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.280
Currently, it has about
70 million websites

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.440
that run on WordPress.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.690
It's about 1 in 5 of all blogs
and websites in the world

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.350
are powered by WordPress.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.550
WordPress.com, which
is where I worked,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.900
is actually a
corporate entity that

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.100
runs WordPress in
a hosted format.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.490
WordPress's software is free.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.865
Wordpress
WordPress.com where you

00:05:33.865 --> 00:05:36.620
go to get free hosting, as well.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.400
WordPress.com
recently passed Yahoo!

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.020
to be the 8th most
popular trafficked website

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.490
in the United States.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.430
So WordPress.com is
amazingly successful.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.270
And it's continuing to grow.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.067
It gets about 4 billion
page views a month,

00:05:50.067 --> 00:05:51.650
just to give you
guys a sense of scale

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.600
I know you guys all know
about these sorts of numbers

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.300
and metrics and how that
compares to other popular web

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.532
properties.

00:05:59.532 --> 00:06:01.740
So a lot of the interesting
things and bizzaro things

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.040
I'm going to tell you about
how WordPress.com worked

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:08.560
and the experiment and how it
went with me working there,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.350
that there are a
lot of start-ups

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.060
and small
entrepreneurial companies

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.770
that do crazy, wacky things.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.730
It's very popular for Fast
Company or Newsweek magazine

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.360
to write stories about these
cute little start-ups that

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.986
have crazy ways of working.

00:06:21.986 --> 00:06:24.110
But I offer you these
statistics not to impress you

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.860
about WordPress or anything,
but just to represent the fact

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.120
that this is not some jokey,
cute little start-up that

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.000
just has nothing to lose.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.290
The company has been in
existence since 2005.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.815
So this is a stable business
that's worked for a long time.

00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:41.315
And the fact that
they're continuing

00:06:41.315 --> 00:06:45.640
to experiment and try new
things, I think is admirable.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.730
At least admirable.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:51.520
So this is the rundown of
all of the unusual things

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.280
that I had to try to
figure out how to navigate.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.430
So the first is that no
one there uses email.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.520
No one uses email.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.240
Everyone gets an email account.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.330
There's not some
mandate that says,

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.104
thou shall not send email.

00:07:06.104 --> 00:07:08.270
But everyone has an email
account, but almost no one

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:09.090
uses it.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:12.370
So in the year and a half that
I worked at WordPress.com,

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:16.080
90% or so of all the email
that I sent or received

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.610
was with people
outside the company.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.160
Other partners,
or other customers

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.430
that I had to work with.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.320
And that's kind of mind
blowing if you think about it.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.070
You guys probably spend
a lot of your time

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.370
in Gmail, you spend a lot
of your time sending mail,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:31.970
reviewing mail, and all that.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:34.280
Most of the modern
workforce does.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.826
And they completely
work in a different way.

00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:38.200
I'll talk more
about specifically

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.802
how they do that in a second.

00:07:39.802 --> 00:07:41.400
Second, everyone works remotely.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:46.020
And that's one meaning of the
title "The Year Without Pants."

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.140
So the entire
company, there's now

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.260
about 200 employees
that work there.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.380
I was hired as employee
number 58 or so.

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.460
So the book covers the time when
the company was about 55 people

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.680
to about 120.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.740
But from the origins
of the company,

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.200
everyone worked remotely.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.850
So it's built into the culture.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.710
That every new hire
it's assumed you

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.990
will work from anywhere on
the planet that you wish.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.000
It does not matter,
nobody cares.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.810
The company is
naturally very diverse.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.990
Geographically and in
terms of time zones.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:19.930
There's people working
in every time zone.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.680
So at any time, no matter
where you are in the world

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.230
or what time zone you're in,
you can log into the chatroom

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.146
and you'll find other
people that are actually

00:08:26.146 --> 00:08:28.840
working at the same time
as you somewhere else.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.354
There are very few
rules, obviously.

00:08:30.354 --> 00:08:31.770
The fact that
there's remote work,

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.440
by default, eliminates a
lot of the normal structure

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.299
and process, and procedure.

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:39.039
Even if you wanted to
be very micromanage-y,

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.370
it'd be hard to do.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:44.350
Simply because you don't have
control or even predictability

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.390
about when people are
going to be online

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.181
and where they're going
to be working from.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.835
They use what's called,
the fancy word for it

00:08:53.835 --> 00:08:55.154
is continuous deployment.

00:08:55.154 --> 00:08:57.070
So another reason why
they're able to get away

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:59.060
with so much autonomy
is that WordPress.com

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.790
is a live service.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.690
And they have very
few restrictions

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.650
about how features launch.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:06.640
So if you're a
designer or developer,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.310
there's not some
review board for how

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:10.520
do you pitch ideas
for features, or how

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.680
you decide what bugs you're
going to fix this week,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.600
it's very self-directed.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.460
And autonomous.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.680
Which means that there's never a
large dependencies between code

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.540
bases.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.560
There's very rarely
a huge schedule

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.020
that's going to block
some work from being done.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.040
Which eliminates a lot
of the normal politics

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.855
you have in most workplaces.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.320
So I'm going to talk to for
another 10 or 15 minutes

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.590
about how some of
this stuff worked

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.400
and what my experience was like.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:43.940
But since you guys have a
fascinating culture, as well,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.110
you guys are on the cooler
end, and more liberal end,

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.750
and future-thinking end about
how workplaces should work.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.265
I know that.

00:09:50.265 --> 00:09:51.640
So I'm going to
talk for about 10

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.267
or 15 minutes just about to
give you more of the story.

00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:55.850
And then open the
floor for questions.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.380
So you should start thinking
now about what specific things

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.960
you hoped I would
talk about and if I

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.880
don't cover that in
the next 10 minutes,

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.950
that's what the
microphones will be for.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.126
Cool?

00:10:06.126 --> 00:10:08.590
Not that you guys really
have a choice in the matter,

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.750
but that's how
we're going to roll.

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:17.240
So one reason why this
project was fascinating for me

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.880
as a writer, most the
books I've written

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.870
took about a year to write.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:23.850
Research and
everything included.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:25.917
This project took
me three years and I

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.500
had to actually go and work at
a company for a year and a half

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:30.083
in order to actually
do the stuff that

00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:30.990
would be in the book.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.120
So this was a real big
investment of time and energy.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.740
And one of the main reasons
I was interested in this

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.340
is I think that there's
fundamental problems

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.610
with the workplace.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.710
With the modern workplace.

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.625
With the knowledge workplace.

00:10:43.625 --> 00:10:45.541
I think that there are
things that are broken.

00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:47.900
And it's not that hard
to find evidence of this.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:50.180
To find data that
supports that argument.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:51.800
There was a recent
study by Gallup.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.960
The Gallup polling agency
of American workers.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.610
This was done, I
think last year.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.040
And the study was
focused on engagement.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.220
Which is an unusual
thing to try and measure.

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:04.530
Engagement was a
self-reported evaluation

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:07.730
of how engaged people
were with their job.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:09.070
How engaged they were.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.780
And about 70% of the people
who responded to this survey

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.430
and participated said they
were not engaged at work.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:22.140
About 30% of that number said
they were actively disengaged.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:24.230
Actively disengaged.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.910
That means you're
not even faking

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.530
being interested in
what you're doing.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:27.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:28.850
That's what that means.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.630
That means you're
like a brain surgeon

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.384
and you're operating
with you've got

00:11:32.384 --> 00:11:34.050
a scalpel in one hand
and the other hand

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.110
you're playing Angry
Birds or something.

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:37.710
That's what actively disengaged.

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.849
So that's about a
third of the workforce.

00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:42.140
And if you think about the
experiences you have in life

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.780
with people who you know who
work at other places, people

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.300
you experience in your daily
life at the coffee shop

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.372
or at the insurance
agency, it show.

00:11:51.372 --> 00:11:53.080
We all have these
experiences with people

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.070
where they are clearly
not interested in what

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.240
they're doing.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.920
Now I know from
my own experience,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.370
I've had a fair number of
lousy, lousy jobs in my life.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:04.970
I've done telemarketing,
I've been a waiter.

00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.710
Then all sorts of odd
job just to make it

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.210
through college and whatnot.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.370
And I know that some of
those jobs, I was engaged.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.440
Not all of them, but
some of them I were.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.060
And it depended on
who I was working with

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.280
and who I was working for.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.980
So I look at this number as
an indictment of management.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.380
As a discipline.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.630
That this means there's
something fundamentally broken

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.590
about the basic notion
of how managers function

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.585
and how they evaluate
their own work.

00:12:31.585 --> 00:12:32.960
And so, I was
interested in going

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.750
to work at WordPress.com
for a bunch of reasons.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.340
First, it was a culture
that had no managers.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.390
Up until the point I was
hired, there was no such thing.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.040
And they were experimenting
with introducing

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.990
a layer of management.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.350
Which is an unusual
situation to observe,

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.020
much less participate in.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.750
And second, having had previous
experience as a manager,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.170
most of my career
at Microsoft was

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.810
spent as a team
leader kind of guy.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.040
I was interested
to see what I could

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.520
do to bring the good parts of
what good managers do and see

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.140
if I could possibly use
that in a valuable way

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.177
inside the culture.

00:13:07.177 --> 00:13:08.510
So that's the story of the book.

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.240
The book follows
my year of trying

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.490
to hey, do any of these things
that I have in my toolkit

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.790
actually matter anymore?

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.949
Do they work?

00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:19.240
And the book follows me
experimenting and trying things

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.990
out and failing in many cases.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:22.280
Succeeding in others.

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:24.890
And eventually arriving
at some conclusions about

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.800
how the function of management
in these nontraditional more

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.960
employee centered environments.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.880
There's good reasons why
management is so flawed.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.610
The primary one being that
the origins of management

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.820
as a profession come
from the industrial age.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:45.190
And it was the robber baron
era of the industrial age that

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.000
funded most of the major
business schools, at least

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.030
in America.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.130
Not all of them,
but many of them.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.619
Vanderbilt, the Oil
Barons, Rockefeller, these

00:13:54.619 --> 00:13:57.160
are the people that funded most
of the major business schools

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.240
that we have.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:03.670
And those industries,
banking, oil, railroads, most

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:06.780
of the work that needed to be
done was industrial age work.

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:10.070
So the central point of what
was thought to be creative work

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.920
was done by management.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.530
So it's no surprise the people
who come from MBA schools

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.450
are largely trained
at executives

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.580
are the most important
and central visionary

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.597
force in any organization.

00:14:21.597 --> 00:14:23.680
And that may be true if
you're managing people who

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:28.350
are doing repetitive work.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:31.100
Who are in a factory
and they are basically

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.310
applying Taylor's time
and motion studies

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.760
to how many widgets they can
make per minute or per hour.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.760
You could argue that maybe
that stuff make sense

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.340
there, but as we have moved
into this knowledge age

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.150
where most people
are making things,

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.220
could be writing code, or
designing software, or writing

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.700
blog posts, or it could
be making documents,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.300
or spreadsheets, but when
people are making things,

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.590
that centricity on executives
I think is dubious.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:57.650
That's rarely where the most
important visionary work

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:58.895
is going to happen anymore.

00:14:58.895 --> 00:15:01.270
And there's a lot of evidence
that support for the theory

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:04.420
that innovation and progress
always happens on the margins,

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.150
it happens on the people
who have the least at stake.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.930
So this notion that we've
inherited about what managers

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:12.630
do and how they work
I think is flawed.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.037
And I wanted to
investigate that.

00:15:14.037 --> 00:15:16.620
The other interesting question,
it's probably the most popular

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.080
thing that WordPress.com
and Automatic

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.700
is the name of the
company that runs

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.990
WordPress.com. is this
notion of remote work.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:27.220
It's the question that
comes up the most.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.930
Right now, about
20% of all people

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.310
who work in professional
jobs work remotely.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:34.940
And that number's been climbing.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.780
And will probably
continue to climb.

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.160
So right now it's about 1 in 5.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.800
And if you consider
the number of companies

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:45.100
that have liberal
remote work policies,

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.350
where you're allowed to work
from home one day a week.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:50.080
Or a few days a month,
the number's even larger.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.880
And I think as tools
get better and better

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.690
and there's more things where
the work is done primarily

00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.230
through computers, I think this
number will continue to climb.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.857
There's lots of
workplaces that I've

00:16:01.857 --> 00:16:03.190
been talking about the book now.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.360
It's been out for just a few
weeks, but I'm on book tour

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:07.443
right now so I got to lots
of places like you guys

00:16:07.443 --> 00:16:08.652
and I talk about in the book.

00:16:08.652 --> 00:16:10.942
And there's lots of companies
who are just very freaked

00:16:10.942 --> 00:16:12.260
out by this remote work notion.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.970
And I am actually not a
super zealot about it.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:16.820
I don't think everyone
should work remotely.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.195
But I think the
questions that it

00:16:18.195 --> 00:16:20.600
raises are really good
about why should you

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.220
care about where people are.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.390
You should care about
how productive they are.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:29.700
And if they can be productive
on a jeep on safari in Africa

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.000
that happens to have good Wi-Fi,
and the code they check in

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.430
and the writing they do,
whatever their job is good,

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.940
why should you care?

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.740
If their coworkers are happy
with the collaboration that's

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.609
going on, why does it matter?

00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:43.150
So a lot of these
places where people

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:47.490
get these very defensive
responses about remote work,

00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:50.300
I usually ask them
a simple question.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.940
What percentage of
your time in an office

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.360
is spent working with
your coworkers purely

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.480
through a computer?

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.040
And they think about
it and it's high.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.890
50%, 60%.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.530
It's really high.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:10.849
And I'm thinking email, anything
you do through a web browser.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:15.260
Could be a chatroom, it could
be a message board, Skype,

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:16.972
or even on the telephone,
which is really

00:17:16.972 --> 00:17:19.180
one of the first kinds of
remote work we've ever had.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.220
It's high.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.675
So if your work is mostly
mediated through a computer,

00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:25.240
your location is irrelevant.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.609
Does not matter.

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.860
For the 30% or 40% of the
time that you actually

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.590
need to be at a whiteboard
together, or at a meeting

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:32.694
together, fine.

00:17:32.694 --> 00:17:34.110
But for the majority
of your time,

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.568
if it's spent through computers,
which most workplaces are.

00:17:36.568 --> 00:17:38.490
This number should not
be that surprising.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.674
You're already
doing remote work.

00:17:40.674 --> 00:17:42.590
If you've ever had the
experience where you're

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:45.290
in a conference room where
one person is talking

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:46.750
and the other 12
people in the room

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.560
are staring at their laptop,
who here has had that happen?

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.580
Most of you, right.

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.320
What is going on there?

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.830
You have one person talking,
12 people on their laptops

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:00.470
doing something else, that
could be entirely done remotely.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.940
Anyway, so that's the other
big question that comes up.

00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.670
20% that number's on the rise.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:07.430
So I had all of these
questions coming

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.230
in to taking on this project.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.949
One was personal about my
own figuring out my relevance

00:18:13.949 --> 00:18:15.490
as an expert and
wanting to challenge

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.884
myself to see how
much I practiced.

00:18:18.884 --> 00:18:21.050
Then there's all these other
questions that come up.

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:22.760
What other work
conventions do we

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:28.800
have today, even in successful
workplaces, that make no sense

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.770
or have no data to support them?

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:33.697
Working 9:00 to 5:00 is one.

00:18:33.697 --> 00:18:36.030
I have yet to see a study
that says working 9:00 to 5:00

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.721
makes you more productive.

00:18:37.721 --> 00:18:39.720
There's lots of evidence
to say that it doesn't.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.261
Because usually that
means a commute.

00:18:41.261 --> 00:18:44.240
So that means 35 minutes,
40 minutes, an hour a day

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.150
spent in frustration.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:51.900
Spent sacrificing time
just to get to a place.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.870
Where you're going
to stare at a screen.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.170
I wanted to ask that question.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.550
Then there are other ones
too about dress codes.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.600
I'm talking to you guys
in the software industry

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.620
and I can tell by looking at
you, you guys are well dressed,

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.245
but we're in the
software industry here

00:19:03.245 --> 00:19:06.010
and dress code is not really
an important problem anymore.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.960
For most the working
world, that's not true.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:09.790
Dress codes are
still something that

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:12.190
is mandated in most workplaces.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:13.565
Then other things
like hierarchy,

00:19:13.565 --> 00:19:15.755
and meetings, this
question about email,

00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:18.130
I had all these big questions
I wanted to try and answer.

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.150
So I'm going to give you
some of those answers

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.190
and then I'll open the
floor for questions.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:27.850
So this picture is my
team when I was hired.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:31.044
So this was taken in
September of 2010.

00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:32.710
And when I was hired,
my team was small.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.934
We had three developers and
we were all in the same place.

00:19:35.934 --> 00:19:38.350
What's interesting, of course,
we're all in the same place

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.266
and what are we doing?

00:19:39.266 --> 00:19:40.308
We're staring at screens.

00:19:40.308 --> 00:19:41.807
And on these screens,
we're actually

00:19:41.807 --> 00:19:42.910
chatting with each other.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:44.254
This was a common occurrence.

00:19:44.254 --> 00:19:46.420
I'm sure it's been a common
occurrence for you guys,

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:47.052
as well.

00:19:47.052 --> 00:19:48.760
What's unusual about
this photo, and what

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.426
you can't tell from
the photo is that it

00:19:50.426 --> 00:19:52.930
looks like we're in some
kind of dumpy apartment

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:54.165
with bad lighting.

00:19:54.165 --> 00:19:56.290
We were not in a dumpy
apartment with bad lighting.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:59.950
We were in a dumpy hotel room,
I'm sorry dumpy hotel lobby

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:00.980
with bad lighting.

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.850
And we happen to
be Athens, Greece.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:05.440
The reason why we were in
Athens, Greece is very simple.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:07.560
The people in this
room, all these guys who

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.380
worked on my team were all from
different parts of the world.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:12.470
So Mike Adams on the
left was from California,

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.830
Andy Peatling in the
middle was from Ireland,

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:18.000
and Beau Lebens on the
right was from Australia.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.569
And the company
supported the notion

00:20:19.569 --> 00:20:21.610
that periodically, every
team should get together

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.730
to be face to face to capture
all the intangibles you can't

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:25.930
get remotely.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.610
So even for a
company that's 100%

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:30.860
distributed and is a poster
child for remote work,

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.190
there's this believe from
the founders of the company,

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.120
periodically you need to refresh
all these little things you

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.160
get only when you're together.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.907
Having the team
newly formed, no one

00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:41.490
had done one of these
meet-ups before,

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.060
so we decide to go
and try to figure out

00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.600
how these things
would even work.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.700
And this is that photo.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.369
Now the challenge I had with
this team of developers,

00:20:55.369 --> 00:20:56.785
so I'm actually
not a developer, I

00:20:56.785 --> 00:20:58.660
have a background
in Computer Science,

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.900
I knew halfway through my
Computer Science degree

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.560
that I would never
be a good developer.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.630
So I tried to find
something else to do.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.160
I learned about UI design
and Project Management

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:10.120
and that's allowed me to
be a manager at Microsoft.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.840
I had enough of a
technical background

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.010
to collaborate and
evaluate developers,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.680
but I've never really been one.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.840
So my role on the team, I
didn't write a line of code.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:22.404
My job instead was that a
meta-job of figuring out

00:21:22.404 --> 00:21:24.570
what is a lead need in the
structure of this company

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.740
and if I could figure
out how to do that,

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.435
can I teach other lead at the
company to do the same thing?

00:21:29.435 --> 00:21:31.310
Now this was a huge challenge.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.790
This was a terrifying challenge.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:35.980
How do I figure out how a
team should work and add

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.000
some kind of structure?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.690
Because that's what a team is.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.010
Into a young, very
non-corporate, chaotic,

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:45.240
developer-centric,
autonomous culture.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.880
What is my approach going to be?

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.560
What tricks am I
going to employ?

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.930
What tactics?

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.630
Most of management
literature is just

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.307
methodologies
where you just tell

00:21:55.307 --> 00:21:57.390
people what to do and put
boxes around everything.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:58.450
And I knew none of
that stuff would work.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.230
I didn't like any of
that stuff anyway.

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:02.090
But I knew none
of it would work.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:04.210
So I thought really
hard about this

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:07.730
before I got hired to come up
with some kind of playbook.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:15.070
And the answer that I came up
with was embarrassingly simple.

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:18.560
That I needed to provide
clarity and trust.

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:19.405
Clarity and trust.

00:22:22.492 --> 00:22:24.950
It seems underwhelming that
this was my grand strategy just

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:25.970
these two things.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:29.290
But I was convinced that part
of why that 70% engagement

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.780
number in the general
workplace is so low

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.130
is because managers failed
to provide these two things.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.510
They failed to earn the
trust of their employees,

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.444
they failed to trust
their employees as well,

00:22:39.444 --> 00:22:40.860
and they failed
to provide clarity

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.450
about why certain
decisions are made.

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:46.396
So this is my playbook
in my approach.

00:22:46.396 --> 00:22:48.270
And when I was first
hired, the first thing I

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.160
did as a lead was nothing.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.980
I decided that in
order to earn trust,

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:54.614
I had to be patient
and just listen.

00:22:54.614 --> 00:22:56.780
So for the first few weeks
that we worked as a team,

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:57.988
I didn't really do very much.

00:22:57.988 --> 00:23:00.360
I was basically the scribe.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.460
I was a scribe.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.750
It was the only tool I
could use to earn trust.

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.410
We'd have a conversation
in IRC or on Skype

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:11.980
and I'd write up a summary and
I'd post it on our team blog.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:14.200
And I'd show that I
reflected what I heard,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.225
I distilled it down.

00:23:15.225 --> 00:23:17.804
And little by little, I
showed that I was not a moron

00:23:17.804 --> 00:23:19.220
and that I'd been
paying attention

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.070
and I could think well.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:25.719
As management goes, that's
a good curve to get over.

00:23:25.719 --> 00:23:27.510
I'm sure you've had
managers at your career

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:29.507
where they didn't
quite meet those bars.

00:23:29.507 --> 00:23:31.090
And then little by
little, I converted

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:32.714
from being the scribe,
to being someone

00:23:32.714 --> 00:23:34.750
who initiated conversations.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.560
And then initiated
how we make decisions.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.326
And then eventually,
I tried to work my way

00:23:39.326 --> 00:23:41.200
to having enough trust
that I was effectively

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.630
the leader of the team.

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.045
And help decide the
direction and decisions

00:23:45.045 --> 00:23:46.670
and which things we
would do or not do.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.270
The technology here,
this is the thing

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.520
that people usually
most want to know.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:57.450
Is how did we actually work.

00:23:57.450 --> 00:23:58.400
What was a day like?

00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.280
What was a week like?

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.020
How did you get around email?

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.770
And there were
three simple tools

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.530
that we use for most
of our communication.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:12.044
IRC, Internet Relay Chat,
ancient program from like 1985.

00:24:12.044 --> 00:24:13.710
Very popular in open
source communities,

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.500
which is why WordPress used it.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:16.270
Two is Skype.

00:24:16.270 --> 00:24:18.690
And three was blogs.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.640
Also not a surprise,
given that WordPress.com

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.065
is a blogging company.

00:24:22.065 --> 00:24:23.690
Of course you're
going to use the thing

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:25.190
that you think
everyone should use.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:26.273
Those are the three tools.

00:24:26.273 --> 00:24:29.030
So 90% of our communication,
my communication

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:33.260
with the team and the company
went through these three tools.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.270
IRC, which is in the photo
all the way in the left

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:38.110
is effectively the hallway.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:41.860
That's how I tried
to map my outsider

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.030
experience at WordPress.

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.640
It's the hallway.

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.760
It's where you go to
interact with people

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.310
you wouldn't normally meet.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.780
The whole company's
usually there.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:50.930
Whoever's working.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.330
You can go in there and talk
to anyone about anything.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.495
If you have a
question or some bug

00:24:54.495 --> 00:24:55.930
you're trying to
fix or something,

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.021
you're trying to track
down, you go in there

00:24:58.021 --> 00:25:00.270
and you ask a question and
someone invariably be, hey,

00:25:00.270 --> 00:25:01.990
yeah sure I'll help you
take a look at that.

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.630
It's also where you go to have
social chats where something's

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.610
going on in the news,
you can go in there

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:07.710
and have a conversation.

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:08.900
It's the hallway.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:11.070
That's where the
serendipity happens.

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.220
And that's where
meetings often happened,

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.650
as much as there were
meetings, which there were not

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:16.710
very many of them.

00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:18.990
Skype was the equivalent
to one on one conversations

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.974
and communication.

00:25:19.974 --> 00:25:22.140
So all the interactions,
or most of the interactions

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:25.010
I had with my team,
would often be in Skype.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.520
Certainly, any
conversation I have

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:29.400
with someone who's on my team
where it was manager employee

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.270
conversation, it was about
performance, or critique,

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.910
or feedback, that'd
be done in Skype.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:39.040
And then blogs was
the dominant medium

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.384
for all team interaction.

00:25:41.384 --> 00:25:44.050
So all the stuff that often goes
on an email, where there's long

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:45.840
discussion threads
about should we

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.550
design it this way or that way?

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.480
What about this?

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.780
Most of that stuff
was done on blogs.

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.340
Instead of being
in an email thread,

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.380
it would be in a comment thread.

00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:00.280
The upside of this was that
all this stuff, certainly

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.415
IRC and the blogs, are visible.

00:26:03.415 --> 00:26:04.871
It's transparent.

00:26:04.871 --> 00:26:06.620
So anyone at the company
could go and read

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:07.900
any of these things.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.470
Unlike email, it's all
searchable and archival.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:12.429
Stuff lives on forever.

00:26:12.429 --> 00:26:14.178
[INAUDIBLE] you don't
have to do anything.

00:26:14.178 --> 00:26:15.800
You get all of that for free.

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.610
The downside was that
all the stuff is public.

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.580
All the stuff is
visible to everybody.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.020
So I had some
challenges, and some

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.480
of the critique that I have
with the culture of the company

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:34.280
was that I found it was
hard to get truly, brutally

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.142
honest critiques of work.

00:26:36.142 --> 00:26:37.600
Because people did
not want to look

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.050
mean in front of
the whole company.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.850
It was also hard for
people, in some cases,

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.276
to be truly expressive
of their opinions

00:26:45.276 --> 00:26:47.400
because they knew this
stuff would live on forever.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.170
And I could talk
more about how I

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.270
tried, at least on my own team,
to overcome those challenges.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.400
Anyway, technologically
speaking, this is the story.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.395
This explains the
remote work process,

00:26:57.395 --> 00:27:00.380
it explains how we got
away with not using email.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.075
And it should be
maybe a mild surprise,

00:27:03.075 --> 00:27:07.100
these are all free tools.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.530
There's no magic here.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:11.140
It's like there was some special
video conferencing software

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.800
that they used or invented.

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:16.810
These are all cheap
and fairly old tools.

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:20.940
Which I think is incredibly
telling about many answers

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.150
to questions about why certain
workplaces function and why

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.790
certain workplaces don't.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.550
That it's not about
the management method,

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:29.160
it's not about the technology.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.970
It's about the culture.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.370
The culture being
the basic units

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.790
of interactions and
assumptions in protocols

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:38.010
that people have
naturally about how

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.770
they interact with each other.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.950
So it turned out that at
WordPress.com, I was shocked.

00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:49.120
That one of the biggest shocks
I had was everybody writes well.

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.269
Everybody writes well.

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.935
It was shocking.

00:27:51.935 --> 00:27:52.890
It was mind-blowing.

00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.300
I never thought that
would be a secret.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:01.310
Because every company in the
world has the same rhetoric.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.350
We are excellent communicators.

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:08.130
We write clearly and
which, most people don't.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.060
But that explains why
there was so little

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.930
need for structure, why these
tools could be so lightweight.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:16.720
Because the tools can
never do the hard parts.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.934
Of having people have high
reading comprehension.

00:28:19.934 --> 00:28:21.850
Or people who are willing
to write generously,

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.380
and carefully, and thoughtfully.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.610
Every team had its own blog.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:30.730
There's a special theme,
WordPress theme that they use

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.770
called P2, which solves
many the annoyances

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.930
of blogs in terms of teamwork.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.720
So the P2 theme which is a
publicly available open source

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.570
theme, works sort
of like Twitter.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.880
You go to the P2 or the team
blog, there's a box at the top,

00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.130
you can type it whatever
it is you're working on

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.390
and you hit post.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.930
So there's no dashboard or any
other admin UI to deal with.

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.640
And that allows for very quick,
very fast, very lightweight

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.580
updating and posting of things.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.320
And also they were
very personalized.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.160
So once the teams
were formed, there

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.550
was this question of whether
teams would work at all.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.890
I think the P2 is the fact
that every team had one.

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:11.770
Enabled some kinds of
tribalism to start.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.010
Where teams would
start to embellish,

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:15.500
we're all designers
and developers,

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.570
they'd start to embellish
their team blogs.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:24.170
And that helped team cultures
to develop on their own.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:27.730
So I'm going to wrap up and
open the floor for questions

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.900
in just a second.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.810
The story about my
experience there, I think

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:37.620
is important not because I
advocate people copy everything

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:42.330
that WordPress.com does, but
the example and the questions

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:45.686
that they ask I think
are very important.

00:29:45.686 --> 00:29:47.060
About questioning
the assumptions

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.190
we have about how work is done.

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:54.910
And also forcing the
responsibility or making

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.940
visible the responsibility
that managers and executives

00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:02.460
have to experiment
and be open to trying

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:05.520
different ways of working.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.830
To be open and try
different ways of working.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.985
Remote work just being
one example of that.

00:30:09.985 --> 00:30:12.730
Any executive who
tells me that they

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.294
have a good performing
employee who said,

00:30:15.294 --> 00:30:17.710
I want to try to work remotely
and they say, I would never

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:19.400
let them do that, I
think is an idiot.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.980
I think they're a fool.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.850
What do they have to
lose by experimenting

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.900
and let someone try
working remotely?

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.360
If they can actually work
remotely and perform just

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.290
as well, that's an advantage.

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:34.360
You now have an employee
that is really happy doing

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.390
the same amount of
work and will continue

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:39.270
looking for ways to
work better and smarter.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.910
Which is what every executive
and manager should want.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.650
And maybe it's not
working remotely.

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:48.200
Maybe it's trying to work
with less email centricity.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:51.260
Or maybe it's trying to work
where a different tool was used

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.950
to communicate or to manage
progress or whatever.

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:56.740
There's so much resistance
to even experimentation

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:57.240
and trying.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.550
And I think that's
the fundamental lesson

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.550
I hope people get
from reading the book

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:03.880
and hearing the story
of me experimenting.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:08.150
And them experimented but having
me come in as an employee.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.270
These numbers I think
are going to get worse

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.000
in terms of employee engagement.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.750
I also think the numbers
of remote workers

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:14.660
is going to go up.

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.220
And those two trends
along makes WordPress.com

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.600
an interesting example
that I hope people study.

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.870
So that's my talk.

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:26.648
Thank you for listening so far.

00:31:26.648 --> 00:31:30.842
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:30.842 --> 00:31:34.520
SCOTT BERKUN: Thank
you, Mr. First Clap guy.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.480
It's an important role.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.021
So I'll open the
floor for questions.

00:31:37.021 --> 00:31:37.980
You guys came here.

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:40.000
I am an open book, literally.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.010
So I will answer any
question that you're

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.140
brave enough to ask.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.310
Yeah?

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.055
AUDIENCE: So was it
your experience that

00:31:46.055 --> 00:31:47.790
with this
nontraditional workplace

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:52.010
that 100% of your employees
were engaged and productive?

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.820
And if not, how did
you deal with that?

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.350
SCOTT BERKUN: I think that
engagement was very high there.

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:01.020
I couldn't give you a
number because it wasn't

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.210
the kind of place that did
employee surveys and polls

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.270
and whatnot.

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.900
But certainly, my
team was very engaged.

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.520
I had a really solid team.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.130
The company because of
its open source roots

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.005
and because of how
they hire, engagement

00:32:16.005 --> 00:32:16.880
is a different story.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.338
So I should tell
you how they hire.

00:32:18.338 --> 00:32:19.580
Because it's very unusual.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.130
And really clever.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:24.280
They don't do interviews.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.230
Instead, and this will
blow your mind, it's crazy.

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:31.510
They hire you by trial.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.550
So if you make it
through referrals

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.440
and they decide that they
want to possibly consider

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:40.380
hiring you, you are
given an actual project

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:41.860
that needs to be done.

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:43.900
And hey, here you go.

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:44.500
Go do it.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:48.290
Here's access to some of our IRC
chatrooms, some of our blogs,

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.550
some of our code base.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.050
You have access, go.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:55.120
We'll pay you a little bit
of money, go build the thing.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:00.430
And that's a radical idea in
the tech community, the business

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:01.652
community, it's radical.

00:33:01.652 --> 00:33:03.360
Oh, it's too expensive,
it's too painful.

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.370
Then you think about how you
hire people in your own life.

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:10.660
Like if you were having a
wedding and you wanted a cake,

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.110
you wouldn't go to the
bake and go, why don't you

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:16.400
tell me about your strengths
and weaknesses as a baker?

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.800
Tell me about a baking
project that went wrong

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.530
and what you've learned from it.

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.390
Like you would
never, ever do that.

00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:24.155
You'd say, make me a cake.

00:33:24.155 --> 00:33:26.750
I'm hiring you to make
cakes, make me a cake.

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.150
So they do the same thing.

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.350
And because they are a tech
company, most of the employees

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.750
are either designers,
or developers,

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:37.190
or writers, people
who make stuff.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.300
They say, OK, go make stuff.

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:43.860
And that process eliminates
many of the challenges

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.480
that most workplaces do.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.220
Because a lot of the
trial projects fail.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.190
Some people are not
willing to put in the time.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:53.890
They already have a job, they
don't want to do more work.

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:56.391
To do a trial project, and trial
projects are usually small.

00:33:56.391 --> 00:33:58.223
But it's going to take
a couple of weekends,

00:33:58.223 --> 00:33:59.550
it's going to take some time.

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.600
A lot of people
who say they want

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.990
to work there, they just
give up on the trial.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:06.440
So that's about engagement.

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.679
How interested really
are you in WordPress?

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:11.860
How interested are you
really in blogging?

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:14.130
And maybe you think
you are because you've

00:34:14.130 --> 00:34:16.889
heard about remote work or some
other attribute of the company,

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:19.460
but really, here's a project.

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.159
And that project,
that trial project

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.480
also helps with filtering
people out there

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:26.300
who are not suited
to be remote workers.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.429
Trial projects,
there is no schedule.

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:31.560
No one tells you how much of
your trial to get done today.

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.719
Which is the same way
the culture works.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.219
Even though we have teams
now, and I was a lead,

00:34:36.219 --> 00:34:38.461
it's a very, very
hands-off culture.

00:34:38.461 --> 00:34:38.960
It's

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.170
Assumed that because you
are a developer or designer,

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.100
you know how to
manage your time.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.210
You know how to get stuff done.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:49.179
You have a basic ability
to time management.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:50.730
So people who fail
the trial project

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:53.230
are probably people who wouldn't
make good employees anyway.

00:34:56.133 --> 00:34:56.799
Other questions?

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:06.050
AUDIENCE: Perhaps you
were a little too generous

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:09.825
to the existing
management paradigm.

00:35:09.825 --> 00:35:12.770
I mean if you look at the
auto companies that do well,

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.250
they're places like
the Japanese ones which

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.490
get 2000 pieces of advice
from the floor each year,

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.276
and through a
continuous improvement,

00:35:20.276 --> 00:35:21.275
get a better engagement.

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:26.089
Your comments?

00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.880
SCOTT BERKUN: Sure.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:37.640
I think engagement is
largely about respect.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:39.440
And there's lots
of workplaces where

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.750
employees know
they're not respected.

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:45.014
It's a very basic emotional
anthropological principle.

00:35:45.014 --> 00:35:47.430
I don't think you need any
sort of fancy management method

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:48.506
to know that.

00:35:48.506 --> 00:35:50.130
It's about treating
people like people.

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:51.920
And when people are
treated like people

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.220
they tend to behave better.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:56.690
Because they feel better
about how meaningful the work

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:58.610
they're doing is.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:01.010
So you could look
at Toyota, which

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:03.910
has a history of implementing
a lot of these methods

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:08.920
that the US auto companies have
been trying to emulate or copy

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:12.801
or whatnot, but we're
prone to copying the method

00:36:12.801 --> 00:36:14.300
and believing that
there's something

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.950
magical in the techniques.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:18.190
It's a very logical
view of the world.

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:20.530
But there's just something
natural and human

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:23.866
about being willing
to treat people well.

00:36:23.866 --> 00:36:25.240
And that's part
of the principles

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.550
that I learned at
WordPress.com about not just

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:32.724
the platitude of it, but
you're hired, you're smart,

00:36:32.724 --> 00:36:33.390
you're an adult.

00:36:33.390 --> 00:36:35.490
Why would we treat
you in a way that

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:37.220
pretended like you're a child?

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.420
Which is how most
workplaces operate.

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.890
Most restrictions
that workplaces

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.500
have are very parental.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.250
Oh, that'd be bad for
you if you did that,

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.510
so we're not going
to let you do that.

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:47.160
And that's the
logic that they use.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.820
And we're executives
and managers,

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.750
so therefore, we
should be parenting.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:52.680
That's our job.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:56.526
If we are not creating rules and
structures, what are we doing?

00:36:56.526 --> 00:36:57.900
There's a sort of
nervous energy,

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.460
I think, that managers have that
if they don't feel like they're

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.880
active, they feel like
there's something wrong.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.400
And therefore,
that's a huge part

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.725
of what leads to how much
micromanagement there is.

00:37:08.725 --> 00:37:10.100
They believe that
they have to be

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:12.520
actively managing and
managing and controlling.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:17.530
Which defeats the purpose
of the organization itself.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:18.360
Yes, sir?

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.230
AUDIENCE: So
WordPress is a company

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:23.280
where almost everybody
works remotely.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.310
I'd love to hear your thoughts
on how to make a company

00:37:27.310 --> 00:37:30.000
culture work where
say, most people

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.020
are in an office and some
people work remotely.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.620
Like how do you
get the people who

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:35.930
are working remotely plugged
in with the conversation.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.041
Like what additional
things do they need to do?

00:37:39.041 --> 00:37:40.540
And people in the
office need to do?

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.165
SCOTT BERKUN: So that
is a great point.

00:37:42.165 --> 00:37:45.440
That when you have a company
that has 100% or mostly remote,

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.410
some of the
challenges are easier

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.500
because everyone's remote.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.820
So there's no central
office with a bunch

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.270
of people who are
remote workers.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:55.420
But what that means though is
that during the year and a half

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:59.080
that I worked there, we
had every different flavor.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.030
That in some cases,
we'd all be remote.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.040
That was the majority.

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.732
Sometimes we'd all be together.

00:38:03.732 --> 00:38:05.190
Sometimes we'd have
these meet-ups,

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:08.380
but there'd be two or three of
my team that couldn't make it.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:11.480
So we'd try, I ended up
with every different dynamic

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.660
that I had to figure out.

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:19.810
My answer is that there has
to be someone, at least one

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:32.160
person, who takes into
account how much is not made--

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:34.900
let me think about
this for a second.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.120
How much of what
goes on in the office

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.620
is not manifested all digitally.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.330
Someone needs to be
thinking about that.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.890
Having had the experience,
or having thought about it,

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:48.010
if I'm the only remote
worker on a project,

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.320
we have our meeting on
Google Hangout or whatever.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.380
We have our meeting.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:53.550
Now I'm in the meeting,
I'm like, yeah I'm engaged,

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:55.040
I get what's going on.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:56.783
Then the next day,
stuff happens and I'm

00:38:56.783 --> 00:38:58.770
like, what the hell's going on.

00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:00.430
And what happened is after that
meeting, or that [INAUDIBLE],

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:01.840
there was some
other conversation

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.676
in the hallway where
people go, oh, we

00:39:03.676 --> 00:39:05.710
shouldn't do x, we should do y.

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:07.160
And they start doing y.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.240
Meanwhile, I'm a
thousand miles away

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:12.100
thinking we're still doing x.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.550
So nobody thought
about how this stuff

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:17.880
has to be reflected so the
other remote workers can see it.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.160
Now usually what happens, if
you're the sole remote worker,

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.410
you end up becoming
like Sherlock Holmes.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:25.100
Where you're constantly
investigating,

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.445
you're doing like
investigative journalism,

00:39:26.445 --> 00:39:27.840
you're trying to track down.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.210
Hey, did you guys meet after?

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.960
What happened?

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.950
You're constantly in this mode
of fear that there's stuff you

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:34.700
need to know that you don't.

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.110
So the solution is
there has to be someone

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:41.220
that is in the office,
probably whoever the lead is.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:44.620
Whoever has more accountability
for the project, who's

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.855
ensuring that that person does
not have to be Sherlock Holmes.

00:39:48.855 --> 00:39:51.920
That they're getting
advice and tips and insight

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.250
into what they didn't
capture, because they're not

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.520
in the same building.

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:57.140
That that stuff gets reflected.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.660
The easiest way to do that
is if the manifestation

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:02.570
of the project is digital.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.414
So we had these habits,
the P2, our blog,

00:40:05.414 --> 00:40:07.580
that was the repository for
all of our conversations

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:09.390
and all of our decisions.

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:11.934
So even when two
of us might meet,

00:40:11.934 --> 00:40:14.350
our team eventually had eight
or nine people, if two of us

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.224
happened to be the same
city at the same time

00:40:16.224 --> 00:40:18.370
and we did some work
together at a whiteboard,

00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.750
as soon as we were done,
we'd go and post on the blog.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.610
Hey, Fred and I just
met for an hour,

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:25.760
here's what we just
discussed and decided.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.670
So even though
people weren't there.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:29.762
They at least understand
something has changed.

00:40:29.762 --> 00:40:31.845
And didn't just go, Scott,
how could you guys meet

00:40:31.845 --> 00:40:34.560
without-- OK, and then we'd
have a conversation about it.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:36.410
So the burden is
on the people who

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:40.645
are in the same shared
space to document.

00:40:40.645 --> 00:40:42.020
AUDIENCE: Makes
sense, thank you.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:42.290
SCOTT BERKUN: Yeah, sure.

00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:44.690
AUDIENCE: So I just want to
point out one more thing.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:47.250
So Google has a lot
of remote offices,

00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:50.530
so a lot of the insights that
you've just shared with us

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.187
and they're in your
book are very relevant

00:40:53.187 --> 00:40:55.270
even though a lot of us
are not working from home.

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:56.728
I think a lot of
people would agree

00:40:56.728 --> 00:40:59.760
that the relationship between
Mountain View and New York

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.100
and other remote offices
sometimes reflects.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.755
SCOTT BERKUN: Sure, yeah.

00:41:05.755 --> 00:41:06.499
Yes, sir.

00:41:06.499 --> 00:41:08.290
AUDIENCE: I wonder if
you have any thoughts

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:09.820
about the issues of scale.

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:12.210
I mean I don't know what the
headcount at WordPress was,

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:14.550
but I assumed it was
probably much smaller

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:15.980
than a place like Google.

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:17.810
Do you think that
a model like that

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:19.404
could scale up too
many thousands?

00:41:19.404 --> 00:41:21.070
SCOTT BERKUN: Yeah,
I think they it can.

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.300
I think scale is an
interesting question.

00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:24.950
This is one of the most common
questions I've gotten so far.

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:26.158
Just to give you the numbers.

00:41:26.158 --> 00:41:30.140
So when I was hired in 2010, I
was employee number 58 or so.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:34.830
And the time that I left, which
was 2012, the company was 110.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:39.070
And now they just crossed 200.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:42.920
As best I can tell,
at 200 there's

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.260
no signs of scale
affecting any this.

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.780
And I don't think that it will.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.700
I think that you think
of a product unit

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.120
at any organization,
software wise

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.280
or otherwise, a product unit
is about 100 to 200 people.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.780
You also have
Dunbar's number, which

00:41:57.780 --> 00:42:00.895
is like 250, which says-- I
think that number's probably

00:42:00.895 --> 00:42:01.620
a sweet spot.

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:05.270
I could imagine if the
company continues to grow,

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.569
which it probably will.

00:42:06.569 --> 00:42:08.485
That there may end up
being product units that

00:42:08.485 --> 00:42:10.350
are about 150 to 200 people.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:11.680
And there'd be multiple ones.

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.090
And at those levels in those
units, it would work fine.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:18.290
The challenge with them become
do you have now executives?

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.130
Like another level of hierarchy?

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:23.600
The culture's very
resistance to hierarchy.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.835
What would those people do?

00:42:24.835 --> 00:42:27.070
They're not makers anymore.

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:32.030
So now they had this very strong
notion that leads were roles.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:33.930
It was not a profession
to be a manager.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:35.150
A lead was a role.

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.000
And you need to be in
that role for a while,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.720
but you should have
some other skill set.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:41.160
Valve, the game company,
has a similar notion.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.780
That you're hired because you're
skilled in at least one thing.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.022
So I think that would
be the challenge.

00:42:47.022 --> 00:42:49.480
The other challenge, the other
way they get around this is,

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.230
again, they do
continuous deployment.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.850
So there's never this
huge dependency tree.

00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:56.197
And that's what usually
causes problems at scale.

00:42:56.197 --> 00:42:57.780
Because you have a
group of 300 people

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:00.010
that are waiting for this team
of 20 to get something done.

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:02.051
And that creates all these
logistics and planning

00:43:02.051 --> 00:43:03.650
and any bureaucracy around that.

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:07.010
And they avoid that because
everything is almost always

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:07.830
live.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:11.549
It's very rarely a
huge pile of work

00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:12.840
that is waiting to be deployed.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:19.630
AUDIENCE: So it's actually
a two part question.

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:22.067
So the scale example, actually,
I think a lot of people

00:43:22.067 --> 00:43:22.900
were thinking about.

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.700
Its fine when you think
of a small company,

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.010
but what if WordPress starts
releasing other products?

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:29.790
Like how does accounting,
HR, how does it all work?

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:31.880
And like the concept
of hiring by trial

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.817
is fine because of
the field they're in.

00:43:34.817 --> 00:43:35.650
How would that work?

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.140
Like how did you
interact with HR?

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.850
What if you had an issue
with something else?

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:40.520
It's fine if you're
working development

00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.585
and you could do it
offline, and like sync up.

00:43:42.585 --> 00:43:45.040
But HR and things like that.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.910
And the second question
I had is how do you

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.390
evaluate performance?

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:50.446
SCOTT BERKUN: OK, so
the first question

00:43:50.446 --> 00:43:52.070
I don't really know
how to answer that.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:59.710
I mean I think first and
foremost, forget WordPress.com.

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:06.160
Most things and most
companies don't scale well.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.390
Like most companies fail.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.570
Most companies go out
of business in a year.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:13.010
Some crazy statistic
right there.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.030
Most companies don't scale well.

00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:17.770
You happen to work for one
that has scaled really well,

00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:19.300
that's abnormal.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:21.050
That's unusual.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:24.700
So the same challenges
that any organization

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.860
has to grow and deal
with growth and scale,

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.140
those are big challenges
for any company.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.010
It's not clear yet how remote
work factors into that or not.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:36.330
That's really the best
answer that I can give.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:37.790
From my experience
working there,

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.050
it seemed like
because of how much

00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.020
emphasis is placed on
employees, which I think

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:46.200
could be said about Google's
culture, as well, that

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:49.820
diminishes risk of scale.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.375
There's very little belief that
added a layer of management

00:44:52.375 --> 00:44:53.740
would solve any kind of problem.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:02.300
The second question
about performance.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.920
This is a weird,
fascinating thing.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.894
I still haven't quite
rationalized in my head.

00:45:07.894 --> 00:45:09.310
There's a bunch
of these questions

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:13.540
that the book as someone
trying to be a manager,

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.250
I was an outsider
and the book follows

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:17.219
me trying to sort some
of this stuff out.

00:45:17.219 --> 00:45:18.760
Some of it I still
haven't completely

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.840
sorted out how I feel about it.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.570
Very complicated.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.160
But the performance thing.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.860
so the performance
thing, about two months

00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:32.100
into my tenure at
the company, my team

00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:34.040
was actually together
in the same place

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.860
and the same physical
location for the first time.

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.535
And we talked about some
stuff and it went fine.

00:45:39.535 --> 00:45:40.910
And I had enough
trust, I thought

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.076
I could start asking some
of these bigger questions.

00:45:43.076 --> 00:45:45.335
I asked my team,
I asked them, how

00:45:45.335 --> 00:45:46.960
do you know if you're
doing a good job?

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.070
And they all looked at each
other and shrugged and went,

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:52.630
I don't know.

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:56.350
I was, OK.

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.720
At the same time,
that's a bizarre answer,

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.340
I kind of expected it.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.400
When you have an
open source project,

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:10.910
you inherit a whole bunch
of values that are uncommon.

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:13.880
A lot of the people who
get hired at the company

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:16.540
believe in this project.

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.020
And they worked on
it as a volunteer.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.530
It was something
they did anyway.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:24.500
And now they're hired and get
paid well to work on a project

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:26.140
that they believe in anyway.

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:29.890
A project they would help along,
even if it wasn't their job.

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:33.530
So they're not motivated
by getting a scorecard.

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:36.610
They're not motivated
by getting promoted.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:38.480
There's not even a lot
of emphasis really,

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:40.640
there's some emphasis,
but not a lot of emphasis,

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.890
certainly much less than
your typical company,

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:45.490
on getting raises.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:48.960
People decide that
they want to work here

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.430
after the trial
and all that stuff

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:54.090
because they really like
the work life balance

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.840
culture that it offers.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:58.710
That you can work
anywhere you want.

00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:59.750
No one cares.

00:46:59.750 --> 00:47:01.252
No one cares about your hours.

00:47:01.252 --> 00:47:02.960
There's that much
independence and you're

00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:05.096
allowed to be good
at what you do.

00:47:05.096 --> 00:47:08.120
So because people are so
happy with that trade,

00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:10.360
and it's part of why
they chose to work there.

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.470
These are not the performance
and raises and bonuses,

00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:15.530
all that stuff does
not come up much.

00:47:15.530 --> 00:47:19.720
Now that may be something that
changes five years from now

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:21.860
when the company maybe
isn't growing as much.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.560
Which is not as much free
reign about what you work on,

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.980
but that remains to be seen.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:34.370
Anyway, I worked at Microsoft
for nine years, a decade,

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:35.020
as an author.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:36.330
I visit lots of companies.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:38.940
I go to lots of places, big
companies, small companies.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:40.440
I've never seen a
place where people

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:48.750
were so happy with the total
trade offs of working there.

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:52.230
These people just
they like what they do

00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:54.110
and they love how
they're treated.

00:47:54.110 --> 00:47:56.770
And they like the trade.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:57.865
Their lives are good.

00:47:57.865 --> 00:47:59.740
And they feel they get
that good life because

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:04.620
of the unusual choices that
Matt Mulleweg and Tony Schneider

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:05.730
at the company have made.

00:48:05.730 --> 00:48:08.470
That was at least
my experience there.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.880
So their retention's really
high for that reason.

00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.800
Some people may
want more structure

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:15.940
and may want a bigger
house and that's

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.170
their focus for why
they have a job.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:20.695
They probably wouldn't choose
to go through the trial.

00:48:20.695 --> 00:48:22.111
Because they realize
their culture

00:48:22.111 --> 00:48:24.740
isn't focused on those things.

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.780
Yeah, sure, the mics are open.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.370
AUDIENCE:So the follow-up would
be I think some of the things--

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:29.745
there's a part
about being happy,

00:48:29.745 --> 00:48:32.042
but then there's also part
about pushing yourself.

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:33.500
Like a lot of times
in your career,

00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:36.277
you get pushed into a stressful
situation and you make it out

00:48:36.277 --> 00:48:38.110
of there, so you know
you're a better person

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.660
but, if I always wanted to be
happy, I'd never force myself--

00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:41.190
SCOTT BERKUN: You're right.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:42.190
Happy is the wrong word.

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:44.310
Fulfillment I think
is a better word.

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:49.060
But I should say though, that
because these are open source

00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:52.490
cultural roots, on an
open source project ,

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:54.830
no one's ever really
forcing you to do anything.

00:48:54.830 --> 00:48:55.982
It's a volunteer project.

00:48:55.982 --> 00:48:57.690
And there are certain
pressures depending

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.870
on what responsibilities
you've take on.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.580
But any open source
project always

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:06.730
has the flavor of volunteerism.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.990
And that's just rooted in how
the company culture is set up.

00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:14.550
No one really ever, except
in certain situations, that's

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:17.890
not the fundamental driving
force as an executive,

00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:20.990
say, we must get this done
by Friday otherwise x, or y,

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:23.880
or it's not like a sports
team where there's, we

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.720
must get points tonight.

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:29.230
It's that Microsoft
was more like that way.

00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:32.690
Most American companies have
more of that spirit in them.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:35.290
This culture was not like that.

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:36.665
And for better and for worse.

00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:43.430
I don't mean to offer
it as idealized.

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:47.042
I probably would have
more of that personally.

00:49:47.042 --> 00:49:48.750
That there was more
of like a clear goal.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:52.200
We had a this high
pressure situation.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:53.870
I probably would've
liked more of that.

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.245
One of the challenges
in the book

00:49:55.245 --> 00:49:56.750
was one project
that we worked on

00:49:56.750 --> 00:50:01.210
was a project called Jetpack,
which was actually plug-in

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:03.039
for WordPress that's
an important plug-in,

00:50:03.039 --> 00:50:05.080
but it had to be done by
a certain date and time.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.479
Which no other project that
my team worked on had to do.

00:50:08.479 --> 00:50:10.020
So that was a
challenge to figure out

00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.610
how does this company and
this team that'd never

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:14.250
worked on a structured project,
or worked on a release cycle,

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.125
how could we figure
out how to do that?

00:50:16.125 --> 00:50:18.500
So there's two chapters in
the book that are all about me

00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:23.160
trying to figure out how
to put into place some kind

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:28.822
of structured process
for making that happen.

00:50:28.822 --> 00:50:30.700
Yeah?

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.330
Last call for
questions, anybody else?

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.340
One more question.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.170
AUDIENCE: This is maybe a
quick follow-up on that.

00:50:38.170 --> 00:50:42.800
It's open source, but I don't
know the exact business model.

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:45.750
But at some point,
you're hosting,

00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:48.730
you're allowing people to host
their blogs with WordPress.com

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:52.030
and you have these IRC servers.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:54.690
So you have some amount of cost?

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:55.440
SCOTT BERKUN: Yes.

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:57.420
AUDIENCE: So you need to
make some amount of money

00:50:57.420 --> 00:50:58.419
to pay for those things?

00:50:58.419 --> 00:51:00.720
So somewhere there's
a motivator to say

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.339
this isn't all just volunteers.

00:51:02.339 --> 00:51:03.130
SCOTT BERKUN: Sure.

00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:04.130
AUDIENCE: It's hey,
get things done.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:04.540
SCOTT BERKUN: Yes.

00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:05.430
AUDIENCE: Maybe you
could talk to that.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:06.420
SCOTT BERKUN: Sure, absolutely.

00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:07.750
So that was one of
the big questions

00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:08.890
I had going into the company.

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:10.264
And there's a
chapter in the book

00:51:10.264 --> 00:51:13.337
that talks all about
their business model

00:51:13.337 --> 00:51:15.420
and how they're thinking
about that in the future.

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.760
That the simple answer is that
WordPress is an open source

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.570
project that started in 2003,
WordPress.com and the company

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:26.340
Automatic was formed in 2005.

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:29.606
And the primary ambition was
to solve this hosting issue.

00:51:29.606 --> 00:51:31.230
That WordPress free
software, you still

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.040
have to put it somewhere.

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:34.950
But it's also a corporation.

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:36.840
Their ambition is to make money.

00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.300
And to support WordPress,
but to make money.

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.580
WordPress.com makes
money three ways.

00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:43.720
One is through advertising.

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.730
Very small amount
of advertising.

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:49.230
How much that will change as the
company's ambitions, who knows.

00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:50.410
But right now, it's tiny.

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:52.126
But because of how
much traffic they get,

00:51:52.126 --> 00:51:53.500
it's a substantial
revenue stream

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.160
for a company of 200 people.

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.730
Second is upgrades.

00:51:57.730 --> 00:51:59.350
It's a freemium model.

00:51:59.350 --> 00:52:02.350
So if you want more storage
space, you want a better theme,

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:04.900
you want more
control over CSS, you

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.050
pay a subscription
for those things.

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:10.780
That's they're most substantial
and probably the most growth

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:14.430
is probably with upgrades
and services around that.

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:16.660
The third is VIP hosting.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.730
So there are some premier media
companies and corporations

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:22.650
that host their blogs
and, in some cases,

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:26.317
their entire websites on
WordPress.com's architecture.

00:52:26.317 --> 00:52:27.650
And they pay a premium for that.

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:29.520
It's not a
consumer-oriented service.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.666
And WordPress.com gets
revenue from that.

00:52:31.666 --> 00:52:33.290
So those are the
three revenue streams.

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:37.920
Ads, upgrades, and VIP hosting.

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.090
And the book does
talk about this.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:44.770
I had this having worked
at most corporations,

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:47.430
there was a surprisingly
small amount

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:49.590
of pressure on
revenue ambitions.

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:51.260
In terms of feature direction.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:54.090
That most of the
emphasis was on growth,

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:55.920
not surprising for
a young company,

00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.690
but they're not young anymore.

00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:00.620
And on activity.

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:02.250
So one of my team's
jobs was trying

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:04.610
to increase to do
user experience design

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:06.780
work to increase
user engagement.

00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:09.330
How often people posted,
how often people commented,

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:11.930
that was one of
my teams charters.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:14.350
The one other
thing I should say,

00:53:14.350 --> 00:53:18.610
it's been fascinating is
many of these trade offs

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:22.460
that they have made about giving
employees so much independence

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:27.080
and these revenue choices
is a very long term vision

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:30.350
for what WordPress and
WordPress.com should be.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:32.630
And I found that inspiring.

00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:35.272
It's very easy to talk
about our long term vision

00:53:35.272 --> 00:53:36.980
and then where is our
quarterly earnings,

00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.590
where's our quarterly earnings?

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:41.720
And most of the decisions
that Matt and Tony made

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:45.360
were-- even if I didn't agree
with them, which in some cases

00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:49.260
I didn't, but I understood why
they felt that was in the best

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:51.700
long term interest
of the company

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.852
and the WordPress
project itself.

00:53:53.852 --> 00:53:54.685
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:54.685 --> 00:53:57.060
SCOTT BERKUN: Sure.

00:53:57.060 --> 00:53:59.550
OK, well I hope
you guys check out

00:53:59.550 --> 00:54:01.570
the book and thanks
for listening.

00:54:01.570 --> 00:54:02.170
Thanks, yeah.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:06.497
[APPLAUSE]
