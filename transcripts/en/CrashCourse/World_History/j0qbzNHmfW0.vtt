00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.240
Hi, my name is John Green, This is Crash Course
World History. Oh my gosh! Today we're going

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.519
to talk about war. Ah! Explosions everywhere!

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.849
So, traditionally, historians are pretty keen
on wars, because they feature clearly delineated

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.650
beginnings, and middles, and ends, and because
they always have a fair bit of death and drama

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.170
and mortally wounded generals who have great
last words like

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.470
"Let us cross the river and rest under the
shade of those trees,"

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.770
whereas the last words of, plague victims
are always, like, "Unggggg."

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.590
Sorry, plague victims. As if you don't have
enough troubles. Now you've got me teasing

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.960
you about your uninspired death throes.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.960
Wars have easy whens, wheres, whos, and whys:
1861-1865. The United States. The North vs.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.769
the South. To end slavery and save the Union.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.399
Mr. Green, Mr. Green. Are you gonna show us
the hidden complexities behind something we

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.269
already think we understand again?

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:56.249
Sorry me from the past, but yes. However,
to placate you, here are some more explosions.

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:59.719
The 17th and 18th centuries saw a bunch of
top-notch wars, but today we're going to focus

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.359
on the 7 Years War, also called the French
and Indian War, because it was the first truly global war.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.690
In fact, no less a historian than Winston
Churchill called it "The first world war."

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.030
But we've been so Eurocentric here on Crash
Course that all we are going to say about

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.370
the ENTIRE WAR IN EUROPE is that Prussia and
Great Britain fought France and Austria, and

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.470
that the Austrian Hapsburgs wanted to win
back Silesia, which they failed to do. THERE.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.940
THAT'S ALL YOU GET, EUROPE.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.660
So the Seven Years War lasted for...anyone...anyone...

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.280
Twenty three years.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.600
I hate you, Me from the Past. But, as it happens,
by sheer coincidence, you are not necessarily wrong.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:43.330
[theme music]

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.860
So, the when: The Seven Years War began in
1756 and ended in 1763.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.030
Unless you believeâ€”as many historians doâ€”that
the 7 Years War lasted 23 years, because it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.160
was really a continuation of the War for Austrian
Succession.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.220
Then you have the fact that much of the information
in today's episode is taken from a book called,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.070
"The Global Seven Years War: 1754-1763," a
nine year period.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.500
As for the who: It was mainly fought between
the British and the French, seen here reenacting

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.310
the knife fight from either Beat It or West
Side Story, depending on your age.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.560
But some of the British were actually Americans,
and both the British and the French were supported

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.040
by American Indians. And there was fighting in India
between Indian Indians, the British, the French.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.080
And as previously noted the French were fighting the
Prussians and the British were fighting the Austrians.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.140
The where: Europe, the continental U.S., the
Caribbean Sea, off the cost of Africa, India.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.480
Basically, the world.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.540
And the why: Ostensibly, land. British colonists wanted
to expand into land west of the original 13 colonies.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.870
And that land was technically held by the
French, who left it alone except for a bunch

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.010
of trading posts. And they were like, "Je
de veux pens l'anglais."

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.870
Thank you, four years of high school French.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.650
Anyway, the war wasn't really about land;
it was really about our old friend trade.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.709
The British wanted to expand into the American
interior to allow for more colonists, because

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.709
the British benefited from both the export
of raw materials from the Americas and the

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.790
import of British consumer goods to the Americas.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.640
So, more colonists meant more trade, which
meant more wealth, which meant ever-fancier hats.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.760
And the French realized that this British-Atlantic
maritime trade was making Britain so rich

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.280
that British might come for France's actually
valuable coloniesâ€”which were not in the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.209
continental U.S. but those slave-based sugar
plantations in the Caribbean.

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.989
So the fighting began around here. And while
the British did send over actual British troops,

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.060
much of the early fighting was done by colonial
militias.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.540
Probably the most famous commander of British
troops was a Virginia colonel named George Washington.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.220
In fact, he may have actually started the
shooting at the battle of Fort Necessity in

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.849
May of 1754. Washington was captured in that
battle and then he was immediately released

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.560
because 18th century war was super weird.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.180
Anyway, the real North American action was
in New York and Canada. At the battle at the

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.800
Plains of Abraham in 1759, for instance, the
British defeated the French and captured the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.000
city of Quebec. Both the British commander,
General Wolfe and the French commander, General

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.890
Montcalm, were killed at this battle, with
the death of the former being immortalized

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.140
in this famous painting, by Benjamin West:

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.890
As indicated by the picture, almost all the
battles in North America featured significant

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.050
participation by Native Americans.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.800
Different Native tribes sided with both the
British and the French, but as a broad generalization,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.489
Native Americans were more likely to support
the French.

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.650
Up to this point, shrewd Indian tribes had
been able to play the British and the French

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.609
off each other and maintain a degree of autonomy
for themselves.

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.060
And as long as the French were present, the
British were prevented from encroaching too

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.060
much on lands Native Americans were using
for hunting and agriculture.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.490
Now, we haven't talked much about American
Indians, mostly because they were geographically

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.310
isolated and didn't have a written language.
But let's at least give them a Thought Bubble.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.620
Before the arrival of the Europeans, most
Native Americans lived in tribal groups. And

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.930
they subsisted on a combination of small-scale
agriculture and hunting and gathering, depending

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.310
on where they were situated.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.300
There were too many tribes to generalize about
specific social structures but it's probably safe

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.300
to say that in terms of gender they were much more
egalitarian than the Europeans who they met up with.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.910
Which may explain why European women who were
taken captive by Indians sometimes preferred

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.530
to stay with the tribe rather than be rescued,
although that's somewhat controversial.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.120
One thing we can say about the Indians: their
notions of what it meant to hold property

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.850
were very different from those of the Europeans.
Individual Indians did not "own" land in the

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.080
European sense; they used it, and not always
particularly intensively.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.070
Europeans, when they came to North America,
had a hard time even recognizing that the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.139
Indians were raising crops because their forms
of farming were so different from European

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.419
agriculture, so the French and especially
the English just assumed that the Indians

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.610
weren't improving the land, which meant that
they didn't own the land, so that meant that

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.240
it was ok for Europeans to take it. As you
might imagine, that was problematic for the Indians.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.740
In general, Indian tribes initially got along
better with the French than with the Dutch

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.960
or English because
1. The French did not settle in large numbers,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.990
as they were mostly traders and fur trappers,
and 2. French missionaries who made the journey

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.770
to the Americas were Catholic, often Jesuits,
who were so intent on converting the Indians

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.250
that they took the time to learn Indian languages
and try to make Catholicism more amenable

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.760
to Indian religion.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.550
The end result of the war, a greatly reduced
French presence on the American mainland,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.280
meant that Indians could no longer easily
play the British and French off each other,

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.710
which opened the floodgates of British settlers.
In the end, the American Indians were perhaps

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.190
the biggest losers of the 7 Years War.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.540
Thanks Thought Bubble. So, two thousand miles
south, in the Caribbean, there was also quite

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:22.330
a lot of fighting between the French and the
British over sugar colonies.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.560
Most of these were naval battles, and by 1761,
Spain got involved, because, you know, they

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.350
had some sugar colonies of their own.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.540
While these battles get a lot of ink, it's
interesting to note that by far, the greatest

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.610
threat to combatants, was disease.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:40.460
By October of 1761 the British had lost about
1,000 men to war and 5,000 to disease.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.860
Meanwhile in West Africa, the British and the French
were fighting there too. Because, you know, why not?

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.040
The British attacked the French at a trading
post called Saint Louis. Aw, Stan, don't make

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.520
me say it right. Fine. Saint Louis.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.720
And at a town called Goree, both in Senegal.
Why? Well, trade, of course.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.520
Senegal was the major source of gum Arabic,
which is notable for many reasons but most

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.699
importantly, it is a key ingredient in the
Diet Coke and Mentos phenomenon, so of course

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.380
the British wanted lots of it.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.990
The French were also fighting the British
in India.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:13.110
In the 18th century India was nominally ruled by the
Mughal empire. I bet I'm saying that wrong, aren't I?

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.560
HowJSay: Mugal.
John: Yeah, that sounds more plausible.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:19.070
But as throughout most of its history, the
real power in India lay with local kings and

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.240
princes, sometimes called nawabs.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:24.210
And these princes, just like their European
counterparts were constantly vying for power

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:25.690
and control over more territory.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.690
And to get it, they often enlisted the help,
especially the military help, of Europeans.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.760
This is what happened in the most notorious event
in the 7 Years War in India, the Black Hole of Calcutta.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.620
In June of 1756 the British governor of Calcutta,
Roger Drake, made the mistake of insulting

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.600
the emissaries sent by the nawab Siraj-ud-daula,
who duly besieged and captured the English

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.080
garrison of 500 with his own army of 30,000.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.600
Drake escaped to nearby ships with the town's
women and childrenâ€”you know the old saying,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.169
women, children, and governors first.

00:07:53.169 --> 00:07:57.240
But the town's defenders remained, and the
survivors were imprisoned in a small windowless

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.870
room that came to be known as the Black Hole.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:02.310
And 40 of 63 prisoners suffocated overnight.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.580
This story is mostly famous, in a war that
killed a million people, because the British

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:09.910
press exaggerated the numbers in order to
build support for the war in India.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:14.630
Not the last time that exaggerations of enemy
brutality would be used to gin up support for a war.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.319
Perhaps the most interesting thing about the
military campaigns in this part of the world

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:21.389
is that, at least initially, they were not
undertaken by governments themselves, but

00:08:21.389 --> 00:08:23.870
by corporations that had their own armies.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.259
The British East India Company was the most
successful of these corporations primarily

00:08:27.259 --> 00:08:29.789
because of the military skill of its leader,
Robert Clive.

00:08:29.789 --> 00:08:36.789
Oh, it's time for the open letter? An Open
Letter to Robert Clive.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.630
But first, let's see what's in the secret
compartment today. Oh, bubbles. That makes

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.270
sense, Stan. The British East India Company
was involved in several early market bubbles.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.760
Mmm, bubbles.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.120
Dear Robert Clive,
You were a complicated man, and not entirely

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.120
likable, but you did win a very important
battle at Plassey in 1757.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.870
And the way you won it says a lot about the
relationship between Europe and its colonies.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.970
So, the key to your success was a conspiracy
to overthrow the existing nawab orchestrated

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:16.970
by a Bengali banking family, called the Seths.
No, Stan. The Seths. Yes. Come on.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.810
And in thanks for your support of their conspiracy,
the new nawab quickly signed a treaty with

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.990
your company, the East India Company.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.350
And thereafter, the British had effective control over
trade in Bengal and the French were excluded from it.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:32.560
This was an incredibly valuable region because it
produced silk and inexpensive cotton cloth for export.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.040
And it gave the British a decisive advantage over the
French and eventually allowed them to control all of

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:42.600
India. And you accomplished this, Robert Clive, primarily
by fomenting revolution. Why does this work

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.960
for you and it never works for the CIA?

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:46.500
Best wishes, John Green

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:51.360
So, by now you have probably figured out that since the
French kept losing battles they eventually lost the war.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:55.880
The main peace treaty, signed in Paris in
1763, limited French presence in the Caribbean,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.020
in India, and in North America.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.800
Although not completely, otherwise they couldn't
have sold Louisiana to Thomas Jefferson in 1803.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:06.080
So, France was obviously dramatically weakened.
But overall, so was Britain.

00:10:06.089 --> 00:10:10.470
One thing rarely mentioned is the actual human
cost of war. As many as a million combatants

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.580
died in the Seven Years War, but even that
doesn't tell the whole story.

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:17.740
In the 18th century armies usually fed themselves
by foraging, which really meant just pillaging

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.760
the countryside. In Europe, a single Prussian province
lost a fifth of its population to pillaging. And

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.510
in North America settlers in frontier regions
lived in constant fear of raids.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:30.310
And, one of the perhaps lesser known outcomes
of the war was the systematic deportation

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:34.450
of the French Acadians from Maine to Louisiana
where they became Cajuns.

00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:39.019
Meaning that the stars of the television shows
Lobster Wars and Swamp Wars are basically

00:10:39.019 --> 00:10:45.290
the same people. What's that? There's no television
show called Swamp Wars? STAN, CANCEL EVERYTHING

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.860

One last thing about wars: they are expensive.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:58.600
In 1756 the British national debt was Â£75million;
in 1763 it was Â£133 million.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.500
Someone had to pay for this, and the British felt it was
only fair that American colonists should foot the bill.

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:08.580
And those taxes, which helped fuel the American
Revolution, were a direct result of the Seven Years War.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.370
So in one way, winning the Seven Years War
cost Britain its first empire.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.550
But, when we remember that it was a global
war, and especially when we think about what

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:19.390
happened in India, then the Seven Years War
also begins to look like the beginning of

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.850
Britain's second, and much greater empire.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:27.130
Winning is losing is winning is losing. Such
is life, and such is history.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.350
Thanks for watching. See you next week.

Last week's phrase of the week was "you're a grandfather." You can take a guess at this week's phrase

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:48.840
of the week or suggest future ones. You can do so in comments where you can also ask questions about

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.680
today's video that will be answered by our team of historians. Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.180
say in my home town: Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
