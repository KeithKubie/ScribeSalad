00:00:00.886 --> 00:00:02.660
SAGE: OK.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.820
Hi, I'm Sage.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.070
I'm happy to introduce
Michael Witwer.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.380
Michael's a professional actor,
a marketing professional,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.990
and most importantly
to us today,

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.080
he wrote a book called
"Empire of Imagination"

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.040
that dives into the
history of Gary Gygax

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.700
and the games of
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.350
Bringing Michael here is
particularly exciting for me

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.490
because I'm a gamer
and a D&amp;D fan.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.200
And sharing an interest in D&amp;D
is a surprisingly personal bond

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.980
to share with people,
gamers, all over the world.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.820
So it's only fitting
that Michael's book

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.566
is a personal history
of Gary Gygax that

00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:38.190
goes into family
stories, and anecdotes

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.060
and tells it from a
narrative point of view.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.366
So please join me in
welcoming Michael Witwer.

00:00:44.366 --> 00:00:47.712
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.001
MICHAEL WITWER:
Thank you very much.

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.000
I'm thrilled to be here.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.806
I mean, honest to goodness.

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.660
When Sage reached
out and told me

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.457
that Google wanted
me to do a talk,

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.290
I couldn't get my head
around, to be honest.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.945
I'm like, are you sure they
shouldn't be talking to me?

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:03.070
How am I talking to Google?

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.324
That doesn't make any sense.

00:01:05.324 --> 00:01:07.490
So I was really humbled and
I was thrilled about it.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.920
And the more I thought
about it, it occurred to me,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.240
you know, of course
it makes sense

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.230
of that the most relevant
technology company out there

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.290
would want to know
more about Gary Gygax.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.520
And in fact, this group is
exactly the kind of group

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.270
that understand how
important this guy really

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.950
has been to pop culture.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.150
Especially, kind of, now
more than ever, really.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.350
As these concepts of
tabletop role-playing games

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.060
have kind of silently
and subversively

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.080
taken over our culture
to a certain extent.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.890
Today, what I'd
like to do is talk

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.869
a little bit about how and
why I came to write the book.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.160
And the reason I want to talk
about that actually is it

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.530
can't really be
separated from how

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.787
the book-- about why the
book, I guess, is important.

00:01:47.787 --> 00:01:49.870
Or why Gary's story-- I
guess, more of the point--

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.540
is important today.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.686
To everybody that's out there.

00:01:54.686 --> 00:01:56.228
And I will tell you
right off the bat

00:01:56.228 --> 00:01:58.060
that this is a book I
did not mean to write.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.690
I did not set out
to write a book

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.830
about Gary Gygax or anybody
else for that matter.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.389
This is something that
happened very organically.

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:06.680
And that was, kind of, one
of the interesting takeaways

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.679
for me is that, really,
it was Gary's importance

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.835
and Gary's contribution
that, kind of, made

00:02:10.835 --> 00:02:11.960
it happen very organically.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.375
It wasn't me pushing it along.

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:15.000
And I'll get into
that in a little bit.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.180
And that's one reason I want
to share my story about it.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.412
So a little bit about myself.

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:23.870
I've been playing role-playing
games, tabletop role-playing

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.940
games since I was
five years old.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.370
My brother and my
dad and I all went

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.520
to a neighborhood
friend's house who

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.820
was selling all of his
late '70s AD&amp;D books.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.050
And I'll never forget it.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.184
So we bought this two foot high
stack of AD&amp;D books for $80

00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:41.100
and we took them home.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.099
And my brother was three
years older than myself

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.400
so he was really into it.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.390
For me, I was just a little kid.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.900
And so he devoured these books.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.570
And he was so intrigued
by the concepts.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.361
And he's always been
a very theatrical guy.

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.592
So I was one of his guinea pigs.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.550
Me and my friend Nick,
we were his guinea pigs.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.950
We made our fighters and
we would explore dungeons.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.339
And we were just ruthless
because we were five years old.

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.505
So we would make fighters
and we would kill everyone

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:06.600
and anything that we could.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.270
And sure enough, my
brother would always

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.769
get really frustrated
with us and he

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.320
would kill us in
some terrible way

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.200
because he's
frustrating with us.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.980
So I've been playing
tabletop role-playing

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.200
since I was very little.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.890
And we ended up transitioning
into Star Wars role-playing

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.590
game, the West End d6 version.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.260
If anyone knows that.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.120
And we play that
for years and years.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.610
And we've played many, many
iterations of both Star Wars

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.830
and D&amp;D at this point.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.080
So I've got a pretty good--
and everything in-between.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.980
I mean, the Amber
Diceless Roleplaying Games

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.271
you get really in the weeds on.

00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:35.835
And all kinds of
different things.

00:03:35.835 --> 00:03:38.220
So I love role-playing
games and that's always just

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.120
been a passion of mine.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.275
And perhaps not incidentally,
I fell into theater

00:03:44.275 --> 00:03:45.170
and performing arts.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.390
It was something that I
was very interested in.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.848
Something I did
through high school

00:03:47.848 --> 00:03:49.270
and did it through college.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.290
And I ended up
actually graduating

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.780
with a theater and music
degree at Northwestern.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.350
And so that's what I
wanted to do for a living.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.660
My ambition was to be a theater
performer, and so I came out

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.850
and I started doing that.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.990
And I realized that, despite
what anyone might tell you,

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.294
theater is not very profitable.

00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:07.960
And it's just not a
very good lifestyle.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.070
It's a hard profession.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.270
You do it for the
love of the game.

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.357
So I'm out there doing
that and I basically--

00:04:14.357 --> 00:04:15.773
not to get to in
the weeds on it--

00:04:15.773 --> 00:04:18.390
I fall into proposal writing.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:19.740
I fall into product marketing.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.540
It was a job that came
along, I needed money

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.790
and I happened to be a writer.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.040
So I took it.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.911
And probably better
lucky than good,

00:04:26.911 --> 00:04:28.536
but I had a lot of
early success in it.

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:29.320
It went very well.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.210
And, in fact, to
this day I continue

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.020
to lead a team of
proposal writers

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.630
for the company I
work at these days.

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.215
It's a health care company.

00:04:36.215 --> 00:04:38.340
So I've been in proposal
writing, business writing,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.310
grant writing for more than
10 years at this point.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.499
So the writing I'm doing,
what most of us do, we grind.

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:48.540
Life is not done exactly
what we expect it to do.

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.123
I wasn't on Broadway, instead I
was writing business proposals

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:53.010
for a company.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.060
And I entered a Master's program
at the University of Chicago

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.470
to, kind of,
broaden my horizons.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.651
I was thinking at
this point, well, what

00:04:59.651 --> 00:05:00.900
am I going to do with my life?

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.710
And I thought doing
a liberal arts

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.035
program might be a really
fun thing to, kind of, get

00:05:05.035 --> 00:05:05.980
me diversified.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.877
To see what I might
want to do next.

00:05:07.877 --> 00:05:09.460
And I knew, at the
end of the program,

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.137
there was going to be a Master's
thesis that would be, kind of,

00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:13.970
another stepping stone
for whatever I wanted

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.220
to do with my life at the end.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.979
I would take all that
I've learned here,

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.020
and, kind of, summary it
in a big Master's thesis

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.290
and then I would go and
launch into something else.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.470
This is going
somewhere, I promise.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.102
So I'm in the program and
I'm, kind of-- and again,

00:05:27.102 --> 00:05:28.310
this is a continuing program.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.765
So I continue to write my
business proposals on the side

00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:33.930
and I'm taking this
management program.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.650
And as the thesis gets
closer and closer,

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.960
and as the program expiration
gets closer and closer,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.717
I've got nothing
on the thesis side.

00:05:41.717 --> 00:05:43.550
I think I'm going to
have this great clarity

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.349
and I've got no clarity.

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.140
And I'm down a rabbit
hole with the concept

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.181
I've been working on for
about a year and a half.

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.569
Which was about
Mayan urban planning.

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:53.068
OK.

00:05:53.068 --> 00:05:55.110
Didn't think so.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.110
There was nothing there.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.310
I was down a rabbit hole.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.020
And it was at this time that
I stumbled on an article

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.485
about Gary Gygax.

00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:02.860
It was an article
written shortly

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.110
after he passed away in 2008.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.250
And what struck me about
it was-- keeping in mind,

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.640
that I knew role-playing games.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.098
To me, Gary Gygax was just the
name on the front of a book.

00:06:13.098 --> 00:06:15.542
I had never thought a
lot about Gary Gygax.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:17.250
If anything, he was
the shadowy character

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.291
that lived up the road in
Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:21.200
I'm from Chicago.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.690
And he had all these
shadows around him

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.110
because he was associated
with this game that

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.180
was all about Satan worship,
and psychological dangers,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.260
and all this stuff.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.760
So I never thought
about Gary Gygax.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.120
But I read this article and I'm
just stunned at how interesting

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.550
and how full a life he had led.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.750
And not just the things
that he had, kind of, done.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.940
But it just seems that his story
was just a really interesting

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.337
rags-to-riches-to-rags
story by itself.

00:06:45.337 --> 00:06:47.795
Independent of any of these
interesting company things that

00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:49.780
had happens at TSR,
his company, or any

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.076
of these controversies that
existed around the game.

00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:53.950
So I thought, wow, what
an interesting topic.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.270
So I actually went to find
a biography about Gary Gygax

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.020
and I couldn't.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.870
And I thought, whoa, this is--
this was a mind blower to me.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.820
Now, can you give a raise of
hands how many people here

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.720
play tabletop role-playing
games or some derivative game?

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:08.300
Awesome.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.800
OK, great.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.074
I was hoping you'd say that
so I don't have to explain

00:07:11.074 --> 00:07:12.240
what a role-playing game is.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.840
Which is good.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.460
So, to me, my mind was blown
because I thought to myself--

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.210
as someone who's been playing
role-playing games since I was

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.275
five years old, I'm
looking around today

00:07:21.275 --> 00:07:24.410
and I'm seeing huge, major,
multimillion dollar pop culture

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.649
phenomenon that have a lot
of their roots in tabletop

00:07:27.649 --> 00:07:28.440
role-playing games.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:31.240
Concepts that used to be
unique to the tabletop

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.240
have started to show up.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.460
Whether it be MMOs, such
as "World of Warcraft,"

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.070
or whether it be "Final Fantasy"
computer role-playing games.

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.695
I mean, the list goes
on and on and on.

00:07:39.695 --> 00:07:42.119
I mean, even elements-- as
many people in this room

00:07:42.119 --> 00:07:44.160
would attest to-- even
elements of social media--

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.670
the gamification,
character building aspects

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.660
of social media-- have some
of the roots, at least,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:50.760
in tabletop role-playing.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.285
So I thought, how can this
guy not have a biography?

00:07:53.285 --> 00:07:55.110
He set into motion
something that

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.890
has hugely, far-reaching
consequences.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.620
So that's what really got my
brain spinning on this issue.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.440
And so that's when I actually
shifted my thesis project

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.602
to be a biographical
project about Gary Gygax.

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:09.060
I mentioned earlier that it
was a book I didn't mean write.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.217
It still wasn't a
book, it was a project

00:08:11.217 --> 00:08:12.800
that I was just very
passionate about.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.902
So I dove into this thing.

00:08:15.902 --> 00:08:18.360
And one thing that occurred to
me about the writing process

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.140
of it, which I thought
was really cool,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.400
was that being from the
role-playing community,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.250
I realized that, gosh, the hall
of famers of role-playing game

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:28.091
design are uniquely
accessible people.

00:08:28.091 --> 00:08:30.590
It wasn't like I was trying to
write a biography about, say,

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.909
Bill Gates where I probably
wouldn't have access

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.990
to the people that I would
need to speak to really get

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.880
this great scoop.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.470
This was a situation where I
can go to gaming conventions

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.559
and see the hall of famers,
kind of, around you.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.400
And these were people that were
eager to share their story.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.103
And in, kind of, be able to tell
you what their experiences were

00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:47.603
with Gary.

00:08:47.603 --> 00:08:50.012
And in most cases, they
were extremely generous

00:08:50.012 --> 00:08:50.970
with their information.

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:52.470
They were dying to
tell their story,

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.930
their experiences with Gary
and their personal stories.

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:56.560
So that's what was really cool
was that, all of a sudden,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.185
I actually had the
access to the people

00:08:58.185 --> 00:09:00.790
I knew I could
really get the scoop.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.930
So I dove into this process,
both feet first, really.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:07.020
Or head first, whatever
the expression is.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.680
And what I figured
out really quickly

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.110
was that-- so A, Gary's life was
hugely interesting by itself.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.610
I mean, it was
rags-to-riches-to-rags.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.710
His personal life, it
had highs and lows.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:21.050
And it was really just
an interesting and very

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:22.560
dynamic story.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.620
And when I paired that with what
I knew about TSR, when I began

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.010
to really realize about TSR.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:29.490
Now TSR was the
company that Gary

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.690
founded to produce
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.870
Now this story,
in and of itself,

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:35.979
is every bit as interesting
as Apple or Facebook.

00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:37.520
Or maybe Apple and
Facebook combined.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.634
I mean, there was, basically,
all kinds of back biting.

00:09:41.634 --> 00:09:43.300
There ended up being
a hostile takeover,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:46.482
that's how Gary Gygax,
kind of, left the company.

00:09:46.482 --> 00:09:48.565
So I thought there's, kind
of, a second point that

00:09:48.565 --> 00:09:51.424
was really interesting, in terms
of what was there company wide.

00:09:51.424 --> 00:09:53.090
And then there's was
this third element,

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.506
that's kind of
incomparable, which

00:09:54.506 --> 00:09:56.010
is the controversy
around the game.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:58.360
The thing that
actually both kept it,

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.360
kind of, in the shadows
for it's life but also

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.240
propelled it to front page news
and great success as it were.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.893
So I found a story that was
really interesting one and one

00:10:05.893 --> 00:10:09.760
that I really had to
tell at this point

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.910
So I went through
this process again.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.447
As many interviews, as much
reading as I could possibly do.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:16.280
And, fortunately, Gary
was a prolific writer

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.457
and left behind a huge record,
as did a lot of his associates,

00:10:19.457 --> 00:10:21.665
so you could really get a
really good picture of what

00:10:21.665 --> 00:10:22.930
was happening here.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:25.095
So good news is I
finished the project,

00:10:25.095 --> 00:10:26.530
that I got my Master's.

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.550
So there we have that.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:32.440
That took, I don't know,
maybe 14, 15 months.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.867
And at this point, it was
kind of mission accomplished.

00:10:34.867 --> 00:10:37.340
I was like, OK, I did
what I set out to do.

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.924
I got to do all
these cool things.

00:10:38.924 --> 00:10:40.590
And it occurred to
me-- I had, probably,

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.270
maybe 50,000 words
at that point--

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.130
and I thought, well, jeez.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:47.776
This probably wouldn't take
that much more to be a book.

00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:49.650
So that's when my wheels
really got spinning.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.721
And this whole time, I continued
to work on the manuscript,

00:10:52.721 --> 00:10:53.220
if you will.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.510
I continued to do interviews,
I'm doing more research.

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.140
I'm digging more
into the material.

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.370
And, I figured,
let's check this out.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.120
Let's see if there's
actually a book here.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.635
So I started the
agency query process

00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:05.051
and I go through
that whole thing.

00:11:05.051 --> 00:11:08.240
And I was very fortunate that
we got picked up pretty quickly

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.100
on the agency side.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.770
And we got the book sold
in a couple of short months

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:12.480
after that.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.610
So that really speaks
to how much, at least,

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.690
some people understood how
important this Gary Gygax

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:19.460
guy really was.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.370
So that was the
story of the book

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.670
and how it came about
very organically.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.590
What I wanted to
tell-- what I wanted

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.600
to talk about a little bit today
was Gary himself, of course.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.952
I'm sure you didn't come to
this to hear my story of how

00:11:31.952 --> 00:11:32.660
I wrote the book.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.620
But, in fact, who was
this guy, Gary Gygax?

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.800
What did he do and
why do we care?

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.370
For me, Gary's story is
hugely inspirational.

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.225
This is a guy that-- so
he was born in Chicago.

00:11:46.225 --> 00:11:48.600
And I'm not going to bring
you through the whole history.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.000
In fact, that's why we have the
book just so you could read it.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.416
If it could be
told in 30 minutes,

00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:55.240
there wouldn't be
much of a book.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.240
So he's born in Chicago.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.320
He's a Midwestern guy.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.700
He moves to the small town
of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.211
And he lives a very, kind of,
normal, Midwestern lifestyle.

00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:06.710
Midwestern mischief is what I
call it somewhere in the book.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.750
I mean, he's out there,
he's doing pranks.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.247
He's wandering around the
abandoned insane asylum

00:12:11.247 --> 00:12:13.080
in town which, of course,
sparked, I'm sure,

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.800
a lot of interesting
imagination.

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:19.250
But it's a guy that
also had a lot of really

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.522
interesting challenges.

00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:22.230
And this is some of
the stuff that really

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.257
got my attention about Gary.

00:12:24.257 --> 00:12:25.840
A couple things I
wanted to point out,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.650
you can call them items
of interest, if you will.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:32.661
So Gary, as a kid, had two
paranormal experiences,

00:12:32.661 --> 00:12:34.660
or what he thought to be
paranormal experiences,

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.080
that were very formative to him.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.810
Things he talked about
later in his life.

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.740
And again, you look at Gary
later on, you look at his work,

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:41.750
you think, wow.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:43.416
Interesting. "Tomb
of Horrors" and a lot

00:12:43.416 --> 00:12:46.970
of these modules, this
work that he had worked on.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.150
You can see the
roots of this stuff

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.990
in some of these
experiences that he had.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.050
And that was one reason why
it was really important for me

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:55.570
when I took on the work, that
the piece be comprehensive.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:58.415
That we cover Gary from his days
as a young child all the way

00:12:58.415 --> 00:13:00.220
through his death in 2008.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.636
Because what really
occurred to me

00:13:01.636 --> 00:13:03.136
was that Dungeons
and Dragons didn't

00:13:03.136 --> 00:13:05.610
start in a single day in
1974 when Gary published

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:06.767
the first 1,000 copies.

00:13:06.767 --> 00:13:09.100
It really started when he
played his first game of chess

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:09.850
at five years old.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:12.430
Or when he used to roam the
abandoned insane asylum.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:16.420
Or when he had these
paranormal experiences.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.680
These are formative stuff,
they're the seeds of D&amp;D,

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.137
if you will.

00:13:22.137 --> 00:13:23.720
Another important
thing that I thought

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.678
was worth a mention at
least is that Gary never

00:13:25.678 --> 00:13:27.650
had a driver's license.

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.677
Which is, to me,
kind of a big wow.

00:13:29.677 --> 00:13:31.760
To think that a guy that
did so much with his life

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.959
couldn't drive a car-- or
didn't drive a car, to be exact.

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:37.375
There were some very interesting
circumstances around that

00:13:37.375 --> 00:13:39.480
that we talk about in the book.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.720
But pretty amazing
story in that respect.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.860
This guy's a high
school dropout.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.830
He dropped out his junior
year of high school

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:47.621
and never returned.

00:13:47.621 --> 00:13:49.376
He did a short stint
in the military

00:13:49.376 --> 00:13:51.000
and then went off to
work in insurance.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.240
He was an insurance underwriter
for 10 years there after.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.480
Got married young,
had five kids.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.702
I mean, this guy had so
much going on with his life,

00:14:00.702 --> 00:14:02.160
it's kind of
incredible that he was

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.590
able to build this
thing that he did.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.300
And that's why the story
was so inspirational to me

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:07.300
is that here's a guy
that, if you could really

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.900
get into his head-- that's
something I really tried

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.560
hard to do with the book--
let's think about a guy that

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.240
is taking the train from
Lake Geneva to Chicago

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.320
where he works every day.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.020
So an hour and a half there,
an hour and a half back.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:21.540
He gets home, he sees his,
well, ever-growing family.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.930
It was, one, then two, then
three, four, five kids.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.230
And then he's spending
all-nighters writing games.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.605
And, of course,
he was doing this

00:14:28.605 --> 00:14:31.004
for years and years and
years before D&amp;D ever

00:14:31.004 --> 00:14:31.670
hit the shelves.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.911
This is, kind of, an
amazing and inspiring story.

00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:35.660
I mean, it was
all-nighters, all the time.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:39.120
That was how much passion and
how much energy Gary Gygax

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.035
had for this whole thing.

00:14:41.035 --> 00:14:42.660
Another item of
interest that I thought

00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:45.790
I would point out that a
lot of you probably know

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:49.830
is Gary founded GenCon in 1968.

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.276
Now, of course, GenCon now
is one of the largest gaming

00:14:53.276 --> 00:14:54.400
conventions in the country.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.177
It's over 60,000 people.

00:14:56.177 --> 00:14:58.510
It's a huge deal, it happens
in Indianapolis every year.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.760
Well, this was
all the brainchild

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.425
of Gary Gygax, who founded
this thing in Lake Geneva.

00:15:03.425 --> 00:15:05.780
It was called the Lake
Geneva Wargames Convention.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.145
And it was one of the
first efforts of somebody

00:15:08.145 --> 00:15:09.520
who really figured
out that there

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.860
was this disparate audience of
wargamers and miniature players

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.800
and diplomacy players
and that they all

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.050
needed to be brought together.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.030
That wouldn't it be great if
we could get all these gamers

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.342
together, from all around
the country, to play games?

00:15:20.342 --> 00:15:21.300
And that's what he did.

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.110
And this, of
course, was how Gary

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.510
was able to leverage these
communities into something

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.710
bigger with D&amp;D later.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.990
And this is all very
much part of his story.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.770
But again, I think very
much worth a mention.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.360
So, as the history
goes-- and I'll

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.380
get a little bit into
the history here just

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.050
to whirl in everybody--
so he founds

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.675
Gencon and he's
building this community

00:15:41.675 --> 00:15:43.780
of wargamers and
miniature players

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.290
and these types of things.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.780
And he meets a young
gentlemen named Dave Arneson

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:49.450
from the Twin Cities.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:52.170
And Dave is very interested in a
lot of the same things Gary is.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.211
He's working on a lot of
his own gaming variance,

00:15:54.211 --> 00:15:57.170
he's working with miniatures,
he's working with wargames.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.670
And Gary and Dave meet
at GenCon 2 in 1969.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.920
And they start talking and
they're both interested,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.520
of course, in a lot
of the same stuff.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.200
And they start collaborating
on some games, some games that

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.500
actually have some of
the root concepts of D&amp;D.

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.020
So this takes a few years.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.650
Dave is, kind of, doing his
own thing in the Twin Cities

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:15.733
with his own gaming group.

00:16:15.733 --> 00:16:18.330
Gary is doing his own stuff
in Lake Geneva with his gaming

00:16:18.330 --> 00:16:20.600
group.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.810
So the collaboration
goes back and forth.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:26.380
And so by 1974, they've
put all the pieces together

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.210
of these formerly disparate
audiences-- so, you could say,

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.097
board gaming, miniatures
and diplomacy--

00:16:31.097 --> 00:16:33.430
and they come out with this
one of a kind game, Dungeons

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:34.230
and Dragons.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.790
Of course, a game that is unlike
anything else that's out there.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.630
It has this character
assumption, first person

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:43.042
narrative, group
storytelling aspect to it.

00:16:43.042 --> 00:16:45.000
But it also, of course,
has very real mechanics

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.514
in which you can play the game.

00:16:46.514 --> 00:16:48.180
No one else is doing
this type of thing.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.510
Well, I think, the
history, kind of,

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:52.700
is written on the
wall from there.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.630
The game takes off.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.100
It becomes a really
exciting thing

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.980
among the wargaming
community as well as

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.327
the miniatures community.

00:17:00.327 --> 00:17:02.160
People don't know what
to do with this thing

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:02.770
but they love it.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.103
And they can't get enough of it.

00:17:04.103 --> 00:17:07.015
So the company begins
to grow very quickly,

00:17:07.015 --> 00:17:09.390
and like so many companies
that are started with passion,

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.099
people that are doing for
the love the game, here's

00:17:12.099 --> 00:17:14.666
a situation where
this company, TSR,

00:17:14.666 --> 00:17:16.040
that they form to
make the game--

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.450
and this is not Dave Arneson
but Gary and a couple

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.160
of his partners-- neither one
of them is a good businessman.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.020
They're all bad
businessmen and they're not

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.270
good at what they do.

00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:27.414
So as a result, they're
designing great games,

00:17:27.414 --> 00:17:29.080
but they don't know
how to take of money

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.120
as it starts rolling in.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.722
And they don't know
how to structure

00:17:31.722 --> 00:17:33.680
fair royalty agreements,
a lot of other things.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.292
So the company has
a lot of problems.

00:17:35.292 --> 00:17:37.750
And as I mentioned, it's every
bit as interesting as Apple,

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:41.010
Facebook, you name it.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.900
By 1976, Arneson is brought
into the company to work,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.330
and 10 months later, is
either fired or leaves.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:53.345
That is still open to a little
bit of debate and mystery.

00:17:53.345 --> 00:17:56.890
And I get into that a little
bit in the book as well.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.220
That's important because, a
couple years later, Arneson

00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:02.900
ends up filing a lawsuit against
TSR for copyright infringement

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.720
for some things that
happened between them.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:08.350
So really, all of this
success starts to unravel,

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:10.200
starting around 1979.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.160
Where things at TSR are going
great, then all of a sudden,

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.946
they've got a lawsuit on their
hands with the co-creator.

00:18:14.946 --> 00:18:16.821
And that, kind of, equals
bad press and a lot

00:18:16.821 --> 00:18:20.660
of stress for Gary personally.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:23.220
The thing that really
propels TSR though,

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:27.460
from the hobby channelist to,
really, the mainstream front

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.810
pages is an incident
that happens

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:33.360
in Michigan State University
in Lansing, in East Lansing,

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.244
in 1979.

00:18:35.244 --> 00:18:38.530
A young Michigan State student
named James Dallas Egbert

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:43.490
III disappears mysteriously.

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.120
James Dallas Egbert
III was two years

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.600
younger than his
fellow classmates.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.982
He had a lot of problems.

00:18:50.982 --> 00:18:52.940
He was, kind of, a geek
in the classical sense.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.180
He was two years younger.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:56.710
He was very interested
in technology.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.570
He was a little
guy, he was 5' 3".

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.950
He had a lot of issues,
like anybody has,

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:03.791
and he disappears mysteriously.

00:19:03.791 --> 00:19:06.165
And people are trying to figure
out what happened to him.

00:19:06.165 --> 00:19:10.050
Well, James Dallas Egbert
III happens to play D&amp;D.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.295
So his parents send in
a private detective,

00:19:12.295 --> 00:19:14.420
a guy named William
Dear, to investigate

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.890
what happened to their son.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:21.580
And Dear finds these D&amp;D books
in James Dallas Egbert's room

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.120
and comes up with
a theory that he

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.710
has disappeared
because the game has

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.180
blurred the lines between
fantasy and reality.

00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.350
That the human mind simply
cannot deal with the fact that

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:35.680
you can assume a character at
a tabletop but you can also be

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.370
in this world as we know it.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.060
So, yeah-- no, it's-- right.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.790
I mean, this is
what he suggests.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.400
So this is an idea that
he leaks to the media.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.860
Well, so this becomes
a media circus.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:52.610
It becomes a feeding
frenzy for media attention.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.850
A couple weeks later,
this particular theory

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:56.655
makes the front page--
not the front page

00:19:56.655 --> 00:19:58.071
but it makes "The
New York Times."

00:19:58.071 --> 00:19:59.856
It becomes a national story.

00:19:59.856 --> 00:20:01.480
So all of the sudden,
TSR is scrambling

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.730
because they're being accused
of being psychologically

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:06.680
dangerous to people,
teenagers specifically,

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:12.685
because their game blurs
this tenuous balance of fact

00:20:12.685 --> 00:20:14.570
and fiction.

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.160
The irony of the whole thing
is that a couple weeks later,

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.580
James Dallas Egbert III is
discovered in Louisiana.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.170
Dear finds him.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.210
He's safe and sound and it has
nothing to do with the game.

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.360
He just ran away because
he has lots of problems.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:31.200
And yet, this theory that had
become pervasive in the media

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.360
was never expressly retracted.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.660
So this theory about
the game, kind of,

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.190
grows unfettered in media minds.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.680
So much so that the
following year, a big novel

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.260
is released by Rona Jaffe
called "Mazes and Monsters"

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.689
which becomes a 1982 TV
film, starring Tom Hanks.

00:20:48.689 --> 00:20:50.730
A great film, by the way,
if you haven't seen it.

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.830
It's a must.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:55.560
So here, this game,
this theory continues

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.060
to grow even though this case
has been resolved years ago

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.470
and was all based on
complete speculation.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.670
No fact in it.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:04.090
And it was this
level of scrutiny

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:05.620
around the game,
this is bizarre,

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.660
intellectual game
some people called it,

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.590
that led to some of these
further accusation of the game

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:13.770
associated with Satan worship
and all of these crazy things

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:15.340
that had nothing to
do with the game.

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.760
Now, of course, religious
fundamentalists and censors,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.770
kind of, teamed up to really
throw this game into the fire,

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:22.270
as it were.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.600
So it became a really
interesting thing.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.840
But here's the big takeaway
of this whole thing.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.190
All press is good press, right?

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.920
So once the story broke
and became national news,

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.605
TSR's revenue quadrupled
in the year that followed.

00:21:36.605 --> 00:21:38.230
And it had been doing
well before that,

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.200
but it quadrupled because, of
course, the same game that you

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.740
were reading about in the
tabloids, of course, now

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.360
you could find on the shelves
of your local bookstore.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.610
It was a pretty amazing thing.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.280
And so the very same thing that
still hangs over this game--

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.935
this weird black
cloud, if you will,

00:21:51.935 --> 00:21:53.560
that hangs over this
game, to this day,

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.660
in some circles-- is the
same thing that actually

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:59.270
propel its success
and made it, really,

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.140
a fairly mainstream thing.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:07.550
So I thought that was, kind of,
worth going over a little bit.

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.080
I also wanted to
talk about the fact

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.027
that for Gary, business
as much as it was great

00:22:16.027 --> 00:22:18.610
that for him that business was
good, this was very hard on him

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.650
personally.

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.854
Because my book focuses
very much on the man,

00:22:21.854 --> 00:22:23.520
I really wanted to
get into the head of,

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.061
kind of, what he's going through
as these accusations come up

00:22:26.061 --> 00:22:27.660
because that was
very hard on him.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.102
A lot of really rough things
happened between 1979 and 1985,

00:22:32.102 --> 00:22:33.810
and all of this
culminates with him being

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.730
ousted from his own company.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.802
I mentioned that Gary
had to do a lot of things

00:22:37.802 --> 00:22:39.260
to get this company
off the ground.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.870
One which is he had
taken on a lot partners

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:46.280
and he made a lot of
royalty agreements

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.130
that we're not very
favorable for the company.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.700
For the company or for Gary.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.680
So by 1985, he briefly
regains control of his company

00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:00.550
but, basically, his former
partners sell their interest

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.260
to somebody who
had been brought in

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:03.960
to help stabilize the company.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.050
And they kick Gary out.

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:08.277
So Gary's ousted from his
own company about 10 years.

00:23:08.277 --> 00:23:10.610
And I thought that was so
interesting because, again, it

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:12.180
really mirrors so
many things that you

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:14.388
see in these companies that
are founded with passion.

00:23:14.388 --> 00:23:18.450
Whether it be Steve Jobs
stories or Jerry Yang.

00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:20.910
I think it's really interesting
that these guys that

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.368
start-- these
people, I should say,

00:23:22.368 --> 00:23:25.180
that start these companies with
a certain amount of passion

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.971
can end up with very
little to show for it.

00:23:26.971 --> 00:23:28.470
I think that's the
case with Gary.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:31.547
He led a very dynamic
life but he, kind of,

00:23:31.547 --> 00:23:33.130
come out with very
little to show for,

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.770
at least financially, after
TSR and Dungeons and Dragons

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.160
came and went.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.890
And he spent the
rest of his career,

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.740
kind of, trying to recreate
what was Dungeons and Dragons.

00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.860
You know, lightning never really
struck twice for Gary again.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:50.160
But I think what
became really cool,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.150
is that late in the
'90s and the 2000s,

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.120
Gary started to get some
interesting attention

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.840
from those who had played his
game and grew up playing it.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.800
And I think this
is really where--

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.550
this is a very important
part of my book--

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:05.345
is that Gary has this
really interesting reversal.

00:24:05.345 --> 00:24:06.720
That he starts to
be acknowledged

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.620
for these great
things he had done.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.578
And he had never really
thought of it that way.

00:24:09.578 --> 00:24:12.410
It just kind of happened.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:16.960
And, at the end of the day,
I think the big takeaway--

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.840
for me, anyway--
was that Gary had

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.560
created this empire
of imagination

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.410
because the early people that he
had played in his game happened

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.174
to be the same people that we're
working on early computers.

00:24:26.174 --> 00:24:28.340
And they were early performing
artists and directors

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:30.904
and they were into all
these interesting things.

00:24:30.904 --> 00:24:32.570
And in aggregate,
what ends up happening

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:34.950
is that people that he built
this empire of imagination

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.587
because he's fostering these
people's imagination, and all

00:24:38.587 --> 00:24:40.420
of a sudden, these
people become the masters

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.420
of the information age.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.910
And they're starting to
give Gary Gygex credit.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.630
So that was, kind
of, the big a-ha

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.540
for me was that this guy, almost
by the transitive property,

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.030
based on how big a lot of
these concepts have become,

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:54.530
is a very, very important guy.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.260
Thank you.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.240
Thank you back there.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.650
I did want to go to
jump into some questions

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.570
because I know there's
going to be a lot.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.350
At least, I hope there are.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.270
So, why don't we open the
floor for questions, please.

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:06.770
Yes.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.260
AUDIENCE: Were you able
to talk with Arneson?

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.210
MICHAEL WITWER: Was I
able to talk with Arneson?

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:10.720
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.570
MICHAEL WITWER: Arneson
passed away in 2009.

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:14.040
I didn't start the
project until 2012.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.900
So no, I wasn't able
to speak with Arneson.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:17.424
Naturally, I read
a lot of his work,

00:25:17.424 --> 00:25:19.090
and saw a lot of
interviews and whatnot.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:23.525
But no, I wasn't able to
speak with Arneson directly.

00:25:23.525 --> 00:25:24.025
Yes.

00:25:24.025 --> 00:25:25.456
AUDIENCE: Who created Chainmail?

00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.080
MICHAEL WITWER: Good question.

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.880
So the easy answer is Gary
Gygax created Chainmail.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.882
Chainmail was a
miniatures game that

00:25:37.882 --> 00:25:40.340
was published about four years
before Dungeons and Dragons.

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:43.470
As I mentioned,
before D&amp;D came out,

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.720
there was a lot of
different types of gaming.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.750
And they were all disparate
factions of gaming.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.240
You had miniatures over here,
you had wargaming over here.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:54.500
Wargaming was, basically, think
of hex max maps and cardboard

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.060
contras or pogs.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:58.160
And then you've got diplomacy
in the middle, which

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:00.260
is kind of this game
where you could play it

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.840
a few different ways--
you can play it by mail--

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.298
but it's a game where there's
a certain amount of character

00:26:04.298 --> 00:26:04.910
assumption.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:07.260
And you play the game
through negotiation and guile

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:07.960
and other means.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.637
So it's a very
different type of game.

00:26:09.637 --> 00:26:11.470
And you could argue,
again, that these three

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:14.090
disparate components
make up the elements that

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:15.830
become a role-playing game.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:21.070
So Gary Gygax had founded
this local gaming group

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.800
in Lake Geneva and they
used to play miniatures

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.119
on his sand table that he
had built in his basement.

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:28.660
And they came up
with these, kind of,

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.395
homebrew rules about, basically,
the mechanics of how one

00:26:32.395 --> 00:26:33.779
would play minutures wargames.

00:26:33.779 --> 00:26:35.070
There's a lot of ways to do it.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.080
Some people use rulers
and measurements,

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:38.950
there's just a lot of ways.

00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:42.420
And Gary had teamed up with a
fellow named Jeff Perren, who

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:44.300
was a member of his
local gaming group,

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.920
and had started to
refine miniatures rules

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.720
for their homebrew game.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.640
And that became a rule
set known as Chainmail,

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.810
published by Guidon Games.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.400
Chainmail had a
lot of the classes,

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:01.520
and a lot of even
the combat mechanics

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.820
that one would recognize
in Dungeons and Dragons.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.410
And so you could say Chainmail
was an important predecessor

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.230
piece.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.530
And, in fact, it was
this game, Chainmail,

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:13.345
that became a major
inspiration to Dave Arneson

00:27:13.345 --> 00:27:15.470
when he was rolling out a
game he called Blackmoor.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:18.250
Dave Arneson was
playing what most of us

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:20.635
would recognize as the
first role-playing game

00:27:20.635 --> 00:27:23.010
or something that at least
resembles a role-playing game,

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.920
with his Minneapolis
gaming group.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.890
He called it Blackmoor.

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.556
He would use the Chainmail
rules for his combat.

00:27:28.556 --> 00:27:30.430
And he would use some
of these other concepts

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.046
he had gotten through
diplomacy, and

00:27:32.046 --> 00:27:34.045
through some other concepts,
that he had come up

00:27:34.045 --> 00:27:37.770
in the Minneapolis gaming group
for this kind of role-playing

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.720
game called Blackmoor.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.230
This is a game he showed to
Gary in 1972-- demonstrated,

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:44.410
I should say, for Gary in 1972.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.630
That's when those two really
got together and start

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:52.130
working on what has become
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.634
Yes.

00:27:52.634 --> 00:27:56.094
AUDIENCE: Did you ever chance
to speak with his first wife?

00:27:56.094 --> 00:27:58.010
MICHAEL WITWER: I spoke
quite a lot with Mary.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.650
Mary Jo.

00:27:58.650 --> 00:28:00.066
AUDIENCE: So what
was her thinking

00:28:00.066 --> 00:28:02.614
of having a husband who spends
his nights doing this stuff

00:28:02.614 --> 00:28:03.780
with five kids and all that?

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.196
MICHAEL WITWER:
It didn't go well.

00:28:05.196 --> 00:28:05.776
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:05.776 --> 00:28:07.400
You had mentioned,
it's his first wife.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.990
There's a reason why
it was his first wife.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.776
So one really
important thing to me.

00:28:12.776 --> 00:28:15.234
I had mentioned that is was
really important that this book

00:28:15.234 --> 00:28:16.140
be comprehensive.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.790
I don't mean it covers every
fact and detail of Gary life.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.209
Rather that I cover
every area of his life.

00:28:22.209 --> 00:28:23.750
And one really
important part to that

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.627
was can I find somebody
that's was there

00:28:25.627 --> 00:28:26.710
at every part of his life.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.781
That was really
important because I

00:28:28.781 --> 00:28:30.780
write the book in a
narrative, nonfiction style,

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:33.776
there is an oral history
element about the whole thing.

00:28:33.776 --> 00:28:35.150
I wanted to get
into Gary's head.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:39.070
And I wanted to be beyond
facts and figures, per se.

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.610
And so the question
is, could I get

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:42.330
to people that knew Gary
at every different part

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:42.830
of his life?

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.980
And the good news was not
only was Mary accessible--

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:49.190
and I spent a lot
of time with her--

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:51.820
but she knew Gary since
he was five years old.

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.302
They met in Lake Geneva when
they were five years old.

00:28:54.302 --> 00:28:55.760
And so, all of a
sudden, I actually

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.384
had somebody that
knew Gary through all

00:28:57.384 --> 00:28:59.190
these critical parts
of his early life,

00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:02.180
that frankly, there's nobody
else there to talk about them.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.070
Everyone else's is
either deceased--

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.910
And, of course, Gary writes a
lot about these things as well.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:07.868
So you can, kind of, fill
in a lot of the gaps.

00:29:07.868 --> 00:29:09.900
But I worked quite
a lot with Mary Jo.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:11.850
And to answer your question.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:14.827
So they had a very tumultuous
relationship, extremely.

00:29:14.827 --> 00:29:16.410
And there's a lot
of reasons for that.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:19.400
I mean, for one thing, Gary
was obsessed with hobbies.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.370
Namely gaming but
a lot of things.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:23.537
Gary was just that type.

00:29:23.537 --> 00:29:25.495
He was your classic, kind
of, eccentric genius.

00:29:25.495 --> 00:29:27.260
He just was.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:30.196
He could not turn the spout off
of ideas that were rolling out

00:29:30.196 --> 00:29:31.740
of him all the time.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.550
And that was very hard
on their marriage.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:35.426
This is a guy that would
come home many days.

00:29:35.426 --> 00:29:37.008
after an hour and a
half on the train,

00:29:37.008 --> 00:29:38.740
working as an
insurance underwriter.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.490
He would sit down, he
might read his mail.

00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:42.865
He might see whatever
diplomacy play-by-mail game

00:29:42.865 --> 00:29:45.480
he was playing at the time.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.450
See his kids briefly.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.950
And he would retire
to his den where

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.950
he'd be writing on his next
game or his next gaming variant.

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:54.396
And the thing that was
striking about Gary,

00:29:54.396 --> 00:29:56.850
when you looked at his
early life especially,

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.610
is the amount of production this
guy was able to keep up with.

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:02.634
Knowing that he had a
family and a full time job.

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:04.050
When you see how
much writing he's

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:05.383
doing in these various fanzines.

00:30:05.383 --> 00:30:07.660
Fanzines are basically
early gaming newsletters,

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.330
for lack of a better term,
that these gaming groups would,

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:11.900
kind of, coordinate through.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.670
And Gary's contributing to
these things on a monthly basis.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:17.000
New gaming variants, new
letters, you name it.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.582
He's constantly cranking out
material, he can't turn it off.

00:30:20.582 --> 00:30:22.540
And, of course, that's
very hard on a marriage,

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.581
especially one that has
so many responsibilities.

00:30:24.581 --> 00:30:27.800
And of course, meanwhile, they
don't have a lot of money.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.234
They're struggling and when
Gary loses his job in 1970, when

00:30:31.234 --> 00:30:33.025
Mary Jo is eight and
a half months pregnant

00:30:33.025 --> 00:30:34.452
with her fifth child.

00:30:34.452 --> 00:30:36.910
One can imagine this was quite
a strain on the relationship

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:38.610
also.

00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.586
So, again, that's
something that I

00:30:40.586 --> 00:30:42.410
think is very worth
reading in the book

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:45.382
just because it's such a
tumultuous relationship.

00:30:45.382 --> 00:30:46.590
And a wonderful relationship.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:48.131
It bore some really
wonderful things.

00:30:48.131 --> 00:30:51.920
But by 1983, they were
ships passing in the night

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.020
and the love, kind
of, started to fade.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:56.580
Yes.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:00.134
SAGE: So there's been a number
of great books on the history

00:31:00.134 --> 00:31:02.050
of Dungeons and Dragons
and role-playing games

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.610
the last few years.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:06.320
Why do you think that now all
of these books are happening?

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.651
MICHAEL WITWER: Hmm.

00:31:07.651 --> 00:31:08.650
That's a great question.

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:12.670
I mean, I think it comes
back, to a certain extent,

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:15.110
that the people who grew
up playing these games

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:18.457
are the ones that are the
most relevant in our society.

00:31:18.457 --> 00:31:20.040
Oh, I shouldn't say
the most relevant.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:21.180
That's an unfair thing to say.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.060
Just that a lot of these
people have really become

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.310
the masters of the generation.

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:25.750
I mean, take John Favreau.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.660
As a director, he
talks about D&amp;D

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.476
taught him to be a storyteller.

00:31:29.476 --> 00:31:31.350
Junot Diaz, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning author

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.020
of "The Brief Wondrous
Life of Oscar Wao,"

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.130
says that D&amp;D was my
apprenticeship in storytelling.

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:39.570
Sam Lipsyte says that I
became a writer because I

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:40.900
couldn't be a Dungeon Master.

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.810
I wanted to be a Dungeon Master,
I wanted to control the story.

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:45.730
And the list goes
on and on and on.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.300
Whether it be Steve
Colbert or Anderson Cooper.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.980
A lot of these people that are
out there doing amazing things

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:52.127
found a lot of their
roots, and a lot

00:31:52.127 --> 00:31:54.252
of their early creativity,
in Dungeons and Dragons.

00:31:54.252 --> 00:31:55.840
So, I think, now
is the time where

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.548
there's a confluence
of all those things.

00:31:57.548 --> 00:32:00.010
And I think people that were
early computer programmers

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:02.500
are starting to realize, wow,
I got a lot of these concepts

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.251
from the tabletop.

00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:05.583
And, of course, they're showing
up on people's browsers.

00:32:05.583 --> 00:32:08.250
And people that didn't grow up
playing Dungeons and Dragons,

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:10.333
or another role-playing
game, wouldn't necessarily

00:32:10.333 --> 00:32:11.830
recognize that
these are concepts

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.430
that used to be unique
to a role-playing game.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.590
So I think, to a
certain extent, I

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:20.600
guess the easy answer is
that we live in a time

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:22.616
when it is geek to be chic.

00:32:22.616 --> 00:32:24.240
Or, it is chic to be
geek, to be exact.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:24.990
Not geek to be chic.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:26.156
I don't know what the means.

00:32:26.156 --> 00:32:27.070
It's chic to be geek.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.945
And so, who is more
relevant than the guy who

00:32:28.945 --> 00:32:32.670
created the geekiest game of
all time, Dungeons and Dragons.

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.400
And honestly, I've been
thinking a lot about this.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.480
Why is it cool to be geeky now?

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.260
What does that even mean?

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.270
And for me, geekiness,
all it means,

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:44.080
is it's unadulterated,
unencumbered enthusiasm

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:45.657
for something.

00:32:45.657 --> 00:32:47.240
And it's funny because
when I grew up,

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.512
it wasn't cool to be a geek.

00:32:48.512 --> 00:32:50.220
I mean, I guess that
goes without saying.

00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:52.810
But it wasn't cool to be
really into something, right.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.940
It was cool to pretend like
you didn't care and to not try.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.190
That was the cool thing to do
in the '80s and '90s, right.

00:32:59.190 --> 00:33:02.604
But so why is it
chic to be geek now?

00:33:02.604 --> 00:33:04.520
To, really kind of,
really focus on something.

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:06.228
People can be geeky
about anything today,

00:33:06.228 --> 00:33:09.090
whether it's gardening
or pottery or whatever.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:11.570
And so, again, I
think the answer

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:14.120
is that it's cool to be
into things these days.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.540
I think that's, kind of,
what our society demands, is

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.420
that we really focus and that we
apply ourselves to do something

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:22.120
greater than ourselves.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.870
But then, I guess, the
big question for me

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:25.530
is, well, then why D&amp;D players?

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.530
How are these people some
of the original geeks?

00:33:27.530 --> 00:33:30.460
What was it about this
game that made it, kind of,

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:35.360
this fountain of creativity
in all these things?

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:37.600
And I think the answer
is that the game doesn't

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.390
work without a lot of
engagement and commitment.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.640
So the people that were
playing this game in the '70s,

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.556
you couldn't play D&amp;D--
And, in fact, the game

00:33:44.556 --> 00:33:47.480
sucks if there's something
at the table that is not

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:48.850
committed, that is not engage.

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.909
It requires that everybody
really commit to this group

00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:52.700
storytelling thing.

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.840
So, I guess, what
I'm trying to say

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.790
is that the game lends itself
to a culture of geekdom,

00:33:57.790 --> 00:34:01.790
to a culture of unadulterated
enthusiasm for something.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.850
You have to be enthusiastic
to play the game.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.870
So, again, I wear it
as a big badge of honor

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:09.830
that we were some of
the original geeks

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:12.500
and this has become a
cool thing now, I guess.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.389
An important thing.

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.040
Yes.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.706
AUDIENCE: So, on the
cover of your book,

00:34:18.706 --> 00:34:21.622
you have, sort of, a
homage to Unearthed Arcana.

00:34:21.622 --> 00:34:23.809
I was wondering,
why does that seem

00:34:23.809 --> 00:34:26.500
like one of the more
iconic books for what

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.674
seems like a relatively
obscure rule supplement?

00:34:29.674 --> 00:34:31.340
MICHAEL WITWER: That's
a great question.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.979
I actually-- I talk about
it a little bit in the book.

00:34:34.979 --> 00:34:37.520
Unearthed Arcana, first of all,
the cover art is spectacular.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.610
I think we can agree that--
yeah, the original Jeff Easley

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:41.159
cover art.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.630
So you'll notice that the
cover of my book, of course,

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.719
is a referential piece
if you know that piece.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:50.210
It's originally a wizard
with a big tome in his castle

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.790
and whatnot.

00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:52.850
And I got the same
artist, Jeff Easley,

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:55.486
to do my cover, which is Gary,
of course, at his typewriter.

00:34:55.486 --> 00:34:56.860
Instead of the
wizard, it's Gary.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.443
It's a typewriter
instead of the book.

00:34:58.443 --> 00:35:01.840
It's in his little den and
his various effects around.

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.180
And the reason that
we did that was A,

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.480
it was a cool thing to do.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:07.021
I guess I thought
it was a neat thing

00:35:07.021 --> 00:35:08.900
to do once I got to
know Jeff Easley.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.227
But Unearthed Arcana was a
particularly important book,

00:35:12.227 --> 00:35:14.560
not because it was a great
supplement, as you suggested.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.310
It's kind of an
esoteric rule supplement

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:21.860
and it's really,
kind of, aggregated

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.110
pieces from the last few
years of Dragon Magazine,

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.369
as some of you probably know.

00:35:25.369 --> 00:35:26.910
And they, kind of,
put them together.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:28.870
It was, kind of,
hastily put together.

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:30.940
And one reason it was
is because the company

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:32.320
was strapped at the time.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.880
When that book came
out, Gary had recently

00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.130
just taking control,
retaken control, of TSR.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:39.266
He had kicked out
his former partners

00:35:39.266 --> 00:35:41.015
and the company was
in financial shambles.

00:35:41.015 --> 00:35:42.409
It was bleeding money.

00:35:42.409 --> 00:35:43.950
They had taken on
way too many staff,

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:46.170
they had really overgrown.

00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:48.590
And so, that company--
that book, I should say,

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:52.130
was an important part in getting
that company back on track.

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:53.810
When they released
that book, I think

00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:56.480
it sold 80,000 copies
in its first month.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.460
It was a huge success
and it was actually

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:00.835
one of the first steps to
really getting the company back

00:36:00.835 --> 00:36:01.890
to financial solvency.

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.187
So really, the story behind
the story in that case,

00:36:04.187 --> 00:36:05.270
was particularly relevant.

00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:08.165
And knowing Gary's contribution
to that book and his driving

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:10.850
behind that book, it
actually became, kind of,

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.290
symbolic for the book itself.

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:16.945
This struggle that
Gary's going through.

00:36:16.945 --> 00:36:18.800
Other questions?

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.546
Yes, sir.

00:36:19.546 --> 00:36:22.315
AUDIENCE: Why is Gary Gygax
famous and Dave Arneson isn't?

00:36:22.315 --> 00:36:23.940
MICHAEL WITWER: That's
a good question.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.390
And that's-- well, they're
all good questions--

00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:27.140
and you know what?

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:30.270
It's a very fair question
because Dave Arneson probably

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.124
should be as famous
as Gary Gygax.

00:36:32.124 --> 00:36:33.165
Dave Arneson, absolutely.

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:36.630
Oh, thank you.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.370
Yes.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:41.600
The question was why is Gary
Gygax famous and Dave Arneson

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.740
not?

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.970
And it's a great question
because Dave Arneson

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:48.470
is the co-creator of
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:51.910
I would say there's probably
some pretty good reasons

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:53.810
for it, whether
they're fair or not.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:56.950
Again, on record, Dave Arneson
is the co-creator of the game.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:00.494
Dave Arneson is the first guy
that, probably, put together

00:37:00.494 --> 00:37:02.160
some these disparate
pieces in something

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.640
that someone would recognize
as a role-playing game.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.650
But he did it at the table
in a very improvised way.

00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:10.360
So wasn't, per se, written down
in a very clean sort of way.

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:14.830
That's really happened when him
and Gary Gygax got together.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:17.490
What is notable is that
Dungeons and Dragons

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.740
was Gary Gygax's piece.

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:20.580
He's the one that
physically wrote it.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.500
He's the one that
physically produced it.

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.560
And, as a matter of
fact, it was his company

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:27.210
that he founded, TSR,
that produced it.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:29.150
And it was done at
great personal expense.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.610
He had basically
taken on two partners.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.240
Don Kaye, his
longtime best friend,

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:36.740
who had to take out a loan
on a life insurance policy

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.530
to be able to fund
his part of the game.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:39.790
Gary had no money.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.290
His own mother wouldn't
loan him money for the game.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:45.510
And he took on a third partner,
a guy named Brian Bloom.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:48.760
Bloom and his family
ended up being

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.650
some of the really the big--
let me put it this way.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:55.869
The Bloom brothers were a
very important part of TSR

00:37:55.869 --> 00:37:57.660
because they provided
a lot of the funding.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:01.030
These were the partners that
he ended up ousting in 1984.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.574
So things didn't go very
well with the Blooms

00:38:03.574 --> 00:38:04.240
in the long run.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.365
But they were very important
to getting the company

00:38:06.365 --> 00:38:07.030
off the ground.

00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:09.340
So the answer, I think,
to the question really

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:13.130
is that D&amp;D was a
Gary-driven product.

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.030
And I mean that as a product
because it became a product

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:18.360
and he was the one that
owned it, in a essence.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:21.190
Arneson got a royalty on.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.775
But once Gary's company
really went up and running.

00:38:24.775 --> 00:38:26.900
And then once he did Advanced
Dungeons and Dragons,

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.240
which of course, is a
major revision to Dungeons

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.690
and Dragons.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.180
That was a Gary Gygax product.

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.430
And that became, of course,
a big point of contention.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:37.080
That was the reason behind the
lawsuit, as a matter of fact.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.380
So I think the main reason
is that Gary, kind of, owned

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:39.879
the IP.

00:38:39.879 --> 00:38:42.400
He owned the company and he was
the driving force behind it.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.200
Once Arneson had
given those pieces,

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.625
he was, kind of, out of it.

00:38:45.625 --> 00:38:48.000
And kind of faded into the
shadows, doing other projects,

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.222
important projects.

00:38:49.222 --> 00:38:50.680
But I think that's
the easy answer.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:55.822
Is that Gary was the front,
the face of TSR, if you will.

00:38:55.822 --> 00:38:57.280
How are we doing
on the time, Sage?

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.690
SAGE: We're about out of time.

00:38:58.690 --> 00:38:59.593
MICHAEL WITWER:
Wow, time flies when

00:38:59.593 --> 00:39:00.730
you're having fun talking D&amp;D.

00:39:00.730 --> 00:39:02.030
SAGE: Yeah, we should leave
time for signing books.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.570
So, um--

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:02.920
MICHAEL WITWER: Oh.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.265
Thank you.

00:39:03.265 --> 00:39:05.598
SAGE: If you could give a
round of applause for Michael.

00:39:05.598 --> 00:39:06.940
And he'll be here to sign books.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.290
[APPLAUSE]
