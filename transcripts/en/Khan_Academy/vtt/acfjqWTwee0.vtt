00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:01.876
- [Teacher] Let's say that your school

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:05.560
has a population of 80 students in it.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.460
Maybe it's not your whole school.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.178
Maybe it's just your grade.

00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:12.110
So there's 80 students in your population

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.018
and you wanna get an estimate
of the average height

00:00:15.018 --> 00:00:17.595
in your population and
you think it's too hard

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:20.397
for you to go and measure
the height of all 80 students

00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:22.485
so you decide to find a simple

00:00:22.485 --> 00:00:24.819
or take a simple random sample.

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:27.521
You think it's reasonable
for you to measure

00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:29.575
the heights of 30 of these students

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:33.477
and so what you wanna
do is randomly sample

00:00:33.477 --> 00:00:37.658
30 of the 80 students and
take their average height

00:00:37.658 --> 00:00:41.085
and say, well, that's probably
a pretty good estimate

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:42.805
for the population parameter

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:46.076
for the average height
of the entire population.

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:47.695
So once you decide to do this,

00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:49.857
you say, well, how do I
select those 30 students

00:00:49.857 --> 00:00:52.474
and how do I select it so that I feel good

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:54.904
that it is actually random?

00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:58.564
And there's several ways
that you could approach this.

00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:00.981
One way to do it is associate

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.770
every person in your school

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.469
with a piece of paper
and put 'em all in a bowl

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:09.593
and then pick 'em out so let's do that.

00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:12.303
So let's say this is alphabetically

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:13.327
the first person in the school.

00:01:13.327 --> 00:01:14.677
They're on a slip of paper

00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:16.887
then the next slip of
paper gets the next person

00:01:16.887 --> 00:01:18.360
and you're gonna go all the way down

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.856
so you're gonna have 80 pieces of paper.

00:01:20.856 --> 00:01:22.575
They all should be the same size

00:01:22.575 --> 00:01:24.581
and then you throw them all,

00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:28.139
you throw them all into
a bowl of some kind

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.408
and this seems like a
very basic way of doing it

00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:32.171
but it's actually a pretty effective way

00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:34.505
of getting a simple,

00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:36.505
of getting a simple random sample.

00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:38.101
So I'll try to draw a little,

00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.010
I don't know, that looks like
a fish bowl or something.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.179
Alright, so that's our bowl.

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.882
And so all the pieces of paper go in there

00:01:45.882 --> 00:01:49.237
and then you put a blindfold on someone

00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:51.746
and they can't feel what names are there

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:54.218
and so they should pick out the first 30

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:55.810
without replacing them

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.934
because you obviously
don't wanna pick the same,

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.556
you don't wanna pick
out the same name twice.

00:02:00.556 --> 00:02:02.232
And those 30 names that you pick,

00:02:02.232 --> 00:02:04.360
that would be your simple random sample

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.126
and then you could measure their heights

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.999
to estimate the average
height for the population.

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:12.565
This would be a completely
legitimate way of doing it.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.487
Other ways that you could do it,

00:02:14.487 --> 00:02:15.879
if you have a computer or a calculator,

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.719
you could use a random number generator

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.495
and the random functions on
computer programming languages

00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:23.964
on your calculator, they
tend to be something,

00:02:23.964 --> 00:02:27.402
someplace you'll see
something like a math.rand

00:02:27.402 --> 00:02:29.165
Rand's short for random.

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:32.287
You might see something like random.

00:02:32.287 --> 00:02:33.962
You might see,

00:02:33.962 --> 00:02:37.534
you might see something like random

00:02:37.534 --> 00:02:39.456
without anything passed into it.

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:43.271
It might give you a number
between zero and one

00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:45.770
or zero and 100 and you
have to be very careful

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.325
on how you use this to
make sure that you have

00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:50.742
an even chance of picking certain numbers

00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:54.121
but what you would do in this situation

00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:57.031
if you had access to some
random number generator

00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:58.700
and it could even pick out a random number

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.654
between one and 80 including one and 80

00:03:01.654 --> 00:03:03.970
is you would maybe line up

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.078
all the students' names alphabetically

00:03:06.078 --> 00:03:08.427
and so the first student alphabetically

00:03:08.427 --> 00:03:10.260
assigned the number 01

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.085
and you could just say one

00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:15.558
if you're using a random number generator

00:03:15.558 --> 00:03:17.465
but I'll use two digits for it

00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:19.254
just because it'll be
useful and consistent

00:03:19.254 --> 00:03:21.024
and in a little bit, we'll
use another technique

00:03:21.024 --> 00:03:22.527
where it's gonna be nice to be consistent

00:03:22.527 --> 00:03:23.978
with our number of digits.

00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:26.634
And so the next one, 02

00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:28.967
and you go all the way to 79

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.573
and all the way to 80

00:03:32.573 --> 00:03:34.250
and then you use your
random number generator

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.694
to keep generating numbers from one to 80

00:03:37.694 --> 00:03:40.232
and as long as you don't get repeats,

00:03:40.232 --> 00:03:44.033
you pick the first 30 to be
your actual random sample.

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:45.505
Another related technique

00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:47.017
which is a little bit more old school

00:03:47.017 --> 00:03:48.982
but is definitely the way that
it has been done in the past

00:03:48.982 --> 00:03:50.803
and even done now sometimes

00:03:50.803 --> 00:03:52.643
is to use a random digit table.

00:03:52.643 --> 00:03:55.304
You still start with
these number associations

00:03:55.304 --> 00:03:57.310
with each student in the class

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.965
and then you use a randomly
generated list of numbers

00:04:01.965 --> 00:04:03.357
and so let's say that's our

00:04:03.357 --> 00:04:04.954
randomly generated list of numbers

00:04:04.954 --> 00:04:07.371
and it keeps going well beyond this

00:04:07.371 --> 00:04:08.518
and you start at the beginning

00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:10.520
and you say, okay, we're
interested in getting,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.363
we're interested in getting
30 two digit numbers

00:04:14.363 --> 00:04:16.942
from one to 80 including one and 80.

00:04:16.942 --> 00:04:18.709
So one technique that you could use

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.945
is you start right at the
beginning and you could say,

00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:23.814
alright, this is a randomly
generated list of numbers.

00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:26.393
So the first number here is 59.

00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:28.486
Is 59 between one and 80?

00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:29.766
Sure is, as long as we,

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:31.391
if this was a 01, that would have worked.

00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.263
If this was an 80, that would have worked.

00:04:33.263 --> 00:04:35.034
If this was a 00, it wouldn't have worked.

00:04:35.034 --> 00:04:37.117
If this was an 81, it
wouldn't have worked.

00:04:37.117 --> 00:04:39.446
This would be our, this right over here,

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.801
that would be our first name that we,

00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:43.396
you could imagine the same

00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:45.034
as picking that first name out of the hat,

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:48.164
whoever's associated with number 59.

00:04:48.164 --> 00:04:49.418
Now, you would move on.

00:04:49.418 --> 00:04:51.177
You get the next two digits.

00:04:51.177 --> 00:04:53.224
The next two digits are 83.

00:04:53.224 --> 00:04:55.801
They don't follow into
our range from one to 80

00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:57.949
so we're not going to use it

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.321
then you would look at
the next two digits.

00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:02.654
So we get a five and a nine.

00:05:03.799 --> 00:05:06.687
Well, that fits in our range
but we already picked 59.

00:05:06.687 --> 00:05:07.929
We already picked person 59

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:11.730
so we're not gonna pick 59
again so we keep moving on

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.147
then we get a 37.

00:05:14.268 --> 00:05:16.590
Well, that's in our range,
we haven't picked that yet.

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.923
We do that then we get a 00.

00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:23.605
Once again, not in our range.

00:05:23.605 --> 00:05:24.915
I think you see where this is going.

00:05:24.915 --> 00:05:26.381
91.

00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:28.382
Not in our range.

00:05:28.382 --> 00:05:29.215
23.

00:05:30.307 --> 00:05:32.601
It's in our range and
we haven't picked it yet

00:05:32.601 --> 00:05:35.011
so we're gonna pick the 23.

00:05:35.011 --> 00:05:37.134
I think you see where this is going.

00:05:37.134 --> 00:05:38.879
We're gonna keep going down this list

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.526
in the way that I've just
described until we get,

00:05:42.526 --> 00:05:44.617
until we get 30 of these.

00:05:44.617 --> 00:05:45.450
We've just gotten three.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.482
We just have to keep on going

00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:49.296
and this isn't an exhaustive list

00:05:49.296 --> 00:05:52.313
of all of the different ways
that you can get random numbers

00:05:52.313 --> 00:05:55.515
but it starts to give you some
techniques in your toolkit

00:05:55.515 --> 00:05:57.440
and you might say, oh, well,
why don't I just randomly

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.197
come up with some numbers in my head?

00:05:59.197 --> 00:06:01.979
And I would really suggest
that you don't do that

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.825
because humans are famously
bad at being truly random

00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:08.236
and you might wanna do something like

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:11.440
even use something that you
think is a random process

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.402
but you realize later
that it wasn't as random

00:06:13.402 --> 00:06:14.343
as you thought.

00:06:14.343 --> 00:06:16.762
So once again, multiple techniques

00:06:16.762 --> 00:06:20.160
but these are some of the
I would say best practices

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.077
for actually generating
a simple random sample.
