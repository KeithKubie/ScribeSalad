00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.680
Okay, so we've got cyborgs coming, and we've
got robots and we've got genetically engineered

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.960
animals and we've got genetically engineered
plants...

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.130
WAIT A MINUTE I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.130
[[MUSIC PLAYING]]

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.610
Hey everybody, Trace here reporting for DNews!

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.000
BIONIC PLANTS.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
BIONIC.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
PLANTS.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.120
They're a thing, and they're coming.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.300
Plants clean and revitalize the air for us,
hold soil in place for other plants, protect

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.290
wildlife from predators and weather, produce
nutrition and SO MANY other things.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.359
But scientists at MIT looked and plants and
were like, "We can do better."

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:42.329
Their experiments with plants involved embedding
nanomaterials -- materials so small you can't

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.870
see them with the naked eye.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.569
These nanomaterials could add to plants' functions
and enhance their natural abilities..

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.749
// We totally need a Bionic Man joke...

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:57.100
These MIT researchers created a solution of
modified, negatively charged DNA wrapped nanotube

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.550
particles wrapped in polyacrylic acid.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.229
They added some of the solution to the underside
of leaves so they could enter through the

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.920
leaf's natural pores, called stomata -- remember
that from high school bio class??

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.420
Once inside the leaves, this acid allows the
material to pass through the membrane into

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.760
the chloroplast to deliver the nano-payload!

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.090
It reminds me of the Terminator, a robot surrounded
by organic material... yikes.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.890
Normally, a leaf can use about 10 percent
of the energy that hits the leaf, but with

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.530
the addition of these carbon nanotubes, the
leaf can pull in wavelengths normally out

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.159
of its reach, adding a 49-percent increase
in overall electron flow!

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.881
This is the most basic level of what they've
dubbed, "plant nanobiotics," so though the

00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:50.229
scientists CAN make plants do this, they don't
actually know what that 49-percent increase

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.759
in electron flow will do to the plant in question.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.770
But the possibilities are astounding, with
an increase in electron output we might see

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.810
plants that can detect contaminants in the
water, air or soil out in the yard or in a

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.810
forest...

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.260
You could end up with a fern that enhances
your Wi-Fi signal, or a tree that pulls in

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.299
over-the-air television.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.130
Because it's so new, the possibilities are
endless!

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.300
Funnily enough, this technology got its start
when the researchers were attempting to create

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.590
plant-based solar cells... instead, we just
made plants better.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.220
Who knows where a little science will take
you?

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.610
Think about it for a second, and tell us what
crazy plant nanobionics you'd want to create

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:26.610
if you could.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.580
