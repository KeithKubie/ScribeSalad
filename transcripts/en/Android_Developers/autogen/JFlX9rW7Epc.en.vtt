00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.250
 GARY LO: I want people to enjoy the process of finding a new home. 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:10.994
 I hope that when they are jealous 

00:00:10.994 --> 00:00:12.410
 When living in a new home 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.330
 Be able to feel happy 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.920
 I feel very honored to be involved in this process. 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.780
 Yes, this is the most important meaning for me. 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.530
 My name is Gary Lo. 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.780
 I am the head of Android development at Domain. 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:26.490
 We can be in Australia 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.030
 Buyers, investors, sellers, tenants and real estate agents 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.650
 Provide a variety of search tools and useful information 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.870
 We are a large company with more than 500 employees 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.540
 And launched a variety of products 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.415
 Our Android team has three developers 

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:39.669
 We work closely with the design team and the user experience team. 

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:40.960
 HENRIQUE MARASSI: My name is Henrique. 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.200
 I am the product manager of Domain. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.520
 We spent a very interesting time at Domain. 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.330
 Our Android app has made great progress in the past few years. 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.870
 I thought that when I was just starting out with Gary, I realized that the ideal was full and the reality was very skinny. 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.820
 a lot of navigation problems 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.340
 User feedback is also very bad 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.840
 GARY LO: In desperation, we have in-depth training for team members. 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.800
 And designed to be dedicated to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.197
 Android platform application 

00:01:03.197 --> 00:01:04.780
 HENRIQUE MARASSI: I am really lucky to want to come to us now. 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.940
 Because the company supported us very much at the time. 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.572
 And invest a lot of money to let us develop the best Android apps. 

00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:12.530
 GARY LO: After designing a very standard framework 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.696
 We really started to make the most of it. 

00:01:14.696 --> 00:01:16.140
 All the tools Google and Android offer 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.610
 We hope that users can understand 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.710
 The environment around the property 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.890
 So introduced Google Maps 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.010
 We hope that users will receive notifications in a timely manner 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.520
 And GCM's push function helps us achieve this. 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.140
 We want users to be able to explore the surrounding companies while walking around the street. 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.570
 So we used the geofencing function 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390
 Play with Play 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.320
 We can easily create these experiences for our users. 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.630
 HENRIQUE MARASSI: 2014 is a very important year for us 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.320
 Because we released a lot of powerful features such as finger search 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.280
 This feature is integrated with Google Now and designed with Material Design 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.880
 GARY LO: Material Design can provide a very useful guide 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.470
 It will guide us how to design an application 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.090
 Help us create an immersive experience for our users 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.070
 User response is very intense 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.220
 Our monthly downloads have increased by 44% 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.600
 Domain applications are also included 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.590
 Top 5 Australian lifestyle apps 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.770
 Hear the real user and praise the app. 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.340
 And we are very pleased and honored how this app helps them find new homes. 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.880
 Our rating on the Play Store 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.365
 Also jumped from 2.8 stars to 4.1 stars 

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:15.990
 HENRIQUE MARASSI: We will work harder in the future 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.910
 Continuously develop and improve this app 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.660
 Let users in the process of buying a house 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.110
 Can really enjoy its convenience 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.890
 This year is indeed a bumper year for us. 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.410
 We canâ€™t wait to see it. 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.170
 What surprise will the Android platform bring to us next?
