MICHEL DEGRAFF: My
name is Michel DeGraff,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.620
and I've been teaching
in linguistics at MIT

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.740
for the past 21 years already.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.320
And I'm the faculty
instructor for the course

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.980
on Creole languages and
Caribbean identities.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.860
So my research is about
trying to understand

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.300
how languages evolve over time.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.750
And what happens when new
languages are created.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.240
Say, for example, in the
Caribbean in my native Haiti

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.990
where Haitian Creole emerged
in the 17th, 18th century.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.780
So we try to understand
that patterns of development

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.340
of the languages we
call creole languages.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.640
And in terms of the
structure, but also I

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.830
have an applied side
to my work where

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.450
I try to understand how
best to use say, Haitian

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.130
Creole and other local
languages in education

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.130
and how that's crucial
for development

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.090
of countries like Haiti.
