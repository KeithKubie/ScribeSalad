00:00:00.278 --> 00:00:01.710
- [Instructor] In this video,

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.940
we're going to discuss income inequality,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.560
which is something that is often debated,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.200
thinking about comparing countries,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.560
thinking about whether
it's an issue or not

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.870
and how to address it.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.380
And to appreciate what
income inequality is,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.200
let's imagine two different countries.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.510
Let's imagine first, country A,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.920
and there's two people in country A.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.920
So, you have person one here,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.920
who makes $1000 a year,
that's their income,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.450
and then there's person two in country A

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.450
that makes $99,000 a year.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.416
So, what is going to be the average income

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:44.130
in country A, if these
are the only two people?

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.830
Or you could think of it as
the per capita national income.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.880
Well the average income here,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.460
average income, to figure that out,

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.210
you would just have to average
the 1000 and the 99,000.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.730
So you have a total income
of one plus 99, 100,000

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.590
divided by two folks,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.360
well you're gonna have an average income

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.980
of $50,000 per year.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.610
Now, let me construct another country

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.720
that has the same average income,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.010
but the distribution is very different.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.010
So in country B, let's say the
first citizen of country B,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.860
they make $50,000 a year,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.960
and let's say there's a
second person in country B,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.790
and they also make $50,000 per year,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.300
per year.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.163
Well, what's the average income now?

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.240
Well, this is even easier
to compute, 50 plus 50

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.760
divided by two, your average
income is $50,000 per year.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.530
So, what you see here is two countries

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.840
that if you just looked
at the average income,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.950
they seem similarly wealthy,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.423
but that doesn't give you,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.167
they seem to have similar average incomes.

00:01:59.167 --> 00:02:02.317
So you would say, oh maybe
they're similarly prosperous.

00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:05.140
But when you go a step deeper,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.160
you see that they are very different.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.530
Country A is a lot more
unequal than country B,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.960
when it comes to income.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.580
So, question is, is above
and beyond looking at things

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.130
like average income or
average GDP or per capita GDP,

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.320
how do you measure inequality?

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.550
And this is something that
this Italian statistician,

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.050
Corrado Gini, tried to address,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.720
and he comes up with something
called a Gini coefficient

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.800
to measure income inequality for a nation.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.240
And the way he approached it
is actually pretty intuitive.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.110
What he did is he sets up two axes.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.020
So, this axis right
over here is going to be

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.630
the cumulative percentage
of the population.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.050
So, you start at 0% and then
you get all the way to 100%

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.320
of the population.

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.320
So this is the cumulative
percent of the population

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.270
in a country, and then on
this axis, on this axis,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.280
you have the cumulative percentage

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.863
of the income in a country.

00:03:07.863 --> 00:03:09.970
So, this would be zero down here

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.630
and then this would be 100 up there.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.720
And so, this is cumulative percent

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.490
of income in a country,

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.323
and then he said,

00:03:20.323 --> 00:03:23.870
well what would a perfectly
equal society look like?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.090
Well in a perfectly equal society,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.700
as you add a percentage

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.650
on your cumulative
percentage of population,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.620
you should add that exact same percentage

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.780
to your cumulative percentage of income.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.780
So as you go up, you really
should just have a slope of one

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.363
going up like this.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.870
So, one way to think about it is,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.460
when you're at 0% of the population,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.940
you should have 0% of the income.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.460
If you have a total of
10% of the population,

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.460
they should have 10%
of the national income.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.160
If you were to go to
50% of the population,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.140
which looks like it's around there,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.330
if it was perfectly
distributed, the income,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.000
well then that should be
50% of the national income.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.250
But no nation is actually there,

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.668
and so then we have to then
compare that to the reality.

00:04:14.668 --> 00:04:16.810
So, let's say you look at a country,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.890
and what you do is,

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.570
when you're looking at
the cumulative percentage

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.660
of the population, you start at the left

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.780
with the lowest income,
and as you add percentages

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.890
of the population, you get to higher

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.610
and higher income folks.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.180
So, let's say we're looking at a country

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.270
that for the poorest folks,

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.730
as you add percentages to
the cumulative population,

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.413
you're not adding the same
percent to the cumulative income.

00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:42.320
And so, you might have a
curve that looks like this,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.480
and then as you add percentages
in the wealthier population,

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.310
for every 1% you add, you're adding

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.260
more than 1% of national income.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.500
And so, this curve right over here,

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.688
which you could view as
describing the reality

00:04:54.688 --> 00:04:56.560
for a certain nation,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.793
this is known as a Lorenz curve,

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.432
Lorenz curve, and what Gini said is,

00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:05.700
well the difference
between the Lorenz curve

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.360
and this line right over here,

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.200
that that would be a measure
of income inequality.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.743
And so, he would look at this area

00:05:15.743 --> 00:05:20.743
right over here, and say,
what percentage is this area

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.650
between this line and the Lorenz curve,

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.650
what percentage is this of
this total area under the line?

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.483
And this percentage is
called the Gini coefficient,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.120
and it's typically quoted as being a value

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.470
from zero to one,

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.380
or sometimes you might
see the scale as being

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.200
from zero to 100.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.352
So, what would a Gini
coefficient of zero represent?

00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:52.470
Well, if you have a Gini
coefficient of zero,

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.460
that means that this area right over here

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.180
between the Lorenz curve
and this line is zero.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.550
So that means that we are dealing

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.640
with a perfectly equal
income distribution.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.390
So at the zero end, this
is perfect equality,

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.720
perfect income equality,

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.150
and then what does one or 100 mean?

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.510
That means that the area between the line

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.510
and the Lorenz curve is 100%
of the area under this line.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.470
So that would look like
something like this,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.200
a country whose Lorenz curve
looks like something like this,

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.700
where all of these people,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.045
I keep adding more and
more and more population,

00:06:33.045 --> 00:06:36.360
but I'm not adding more and more income,

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.840
and then all of a sudden, you
get to the very last person,

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.690
and then that person
has all of the income.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.740
So, that person has all of the income.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.830
Well in that case,

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.390
the Gini coefficient would be
the percentage of this area,

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.340
which would be 100%,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.540
which we could view as a one or 100.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.113
And so, an interesting thing to do is,

00:06:55.113 --> 00:06:58.690
is look at Gini coefficients
for various countries

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.550
and compare them.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.670
And that's exactly what
we have here on this map,

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.490
and you can see that the
countries that are shaded red,

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.600
these are countries that
have high Gini coefficients.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.370
So, this is where you have
more income inequality,

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.300
and the ones that are
shaded green are the ones

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.330
where you have relatively low Gini indices

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.450
or Gini coefficients, and
so that would be indicative

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.921
of reasonably low income inequality.

00:07:25.921 --> 00:07:27.200
Now, it's important to point out,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.190
you might think that red is always bad

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.100
and green is always good,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.740
but this just tells you inequality,

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.570
it does not tell you on average
how prosperous folks are,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.880
what average income is in that country,

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.100
and so, this is an indication

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.510
that in places like Latin
America and Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.910
you definitely have very high inequality,

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:49.859
and places like Canada and Europe,

00:07:49.859 --> 00:07:52.750
you seem to have very low inequality,

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.250
but it doesn't tell you that people

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.280
for sure are better off in Canada

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.030
than say the United States.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.950
For example, you could have
a higher average income

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.590
in the United States
than you have in Canada,

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.640
and one can have a very spirited debate,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.980
which one you would rather be.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.166
Would you rather be in a country
that has higher inequality

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:11.849
and higher average income

00:08:11.849 --> 00:08:14.753
or one that has lower
income and lower inequality?
