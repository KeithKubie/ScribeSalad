00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.810
Welcome back.

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.860
And if you were covering your
eyes because you didn't want

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.250
to see calculus, I think you
can open your eyes again.

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.830
There shouldn't be any
significant displays of

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.330
calculus in this video.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.550
But just to review what we went
over, we just said, OK if

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.760
we have a spring-- and I drew it
vertically this time-- but

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.750
pretend like there's no gravity,
or maybe pretend like

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.440
we're viewing-- we're looking at
the top of a table, because

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.080
we don't want to look
at the effect of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.990
a spring and gravity.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.450
We just want to look at
a spring by itself.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.760
So this could be in deep space,
or something else.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.780
But we're not thinking
about gravity.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.670
But I drew it vertically just
so that we can get more

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.080
intuition for this curve.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.520
Well, we started off saying is
if I have a spring and 0-- x

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.740
equals 0 is kind of the natural
resting point of the

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.430
spring, if I just let this
mass-- if I didn't pull on the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.380
spring at all.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.340
But I have a mass attached to
the spring, and if I were to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.060
stretch the spring to point A,
we said, well what happens?

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.990
Well, it starts with very little
velocity, but there's a

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.100
restorative force, that's going
to be pulling it back

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.430
towards this position.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.170
So that force will accelerate
the mass, accelerate the mass,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.620
accelerate the mass, until
it gets right here.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.040
And then it'll have a lot of
velocity here, but then it'll

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.360
start decelerating.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.680
And then it'll decelerate,
decelerate, decelerate.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.560
Its velocity will stop, and
it'll come back up.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.625
And if we drew this as
a function of time,

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:12.060
this is what happens.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.010
It starts moving very
slowly, accelerates.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.300
At this point, at x equals 0,
it has its maximum speed.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.010
So the rate of change of
velocity-- or the rate of

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.230
change of position is fastest.
And we can see the slope is

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.770
very fast right here.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.240
And then, we start slowing
down again, slowing down,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.990
until we get back to
the spot of A.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.500
And then we keep going up and
down, up and down, like that.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.280
And we showed that actually,
the equation for the mass's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.320
position as a function of time
is x of t-- and we used a

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.620
little bit of differential
equations to prove it.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.310
But this equation-- not that I
recommend that you memorize

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.950
anything-- but this is a pretty

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.640
useful equation to memorize.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.390
Because you can use it to
pretty much figure out

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.210
anything-- about the position,
or of the mass at any given

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.490
time, or the frequency of this
oscillatory motion, or

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.120
anything else.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.005
Even the velocity, if you know
a little bit of calculus, you

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:13.720
can figure out the velocity
at anytime, of the object.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.030
And that's pretty neat.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.740
So what can we do now?

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.690
Well, let's try to figure
out the period of

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.220
this oscillating system.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.450
And just so you know-- I know
I put the label harmonic

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.980
motion on all of these-- this
is simple harmonic motion.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.470
Simple harmonic motion is
something that can be

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.690
described by a trigonometric
function like this.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.720
And it just oscillates back
and forth, back and forth.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.850
And so, what we're doing
is harmonic motion.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.100
And now, let's figure out
what this period is.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.670
Remember we said that after T
seconds, it gets back to its

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.210
original position, and then
after another T seconds, it

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.860
gets back to its original
position.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.540
Let's figure out
with this T is.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.320
And that's essentially
its period, right?

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.830
What's the period
of a function?

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.650
It's how long it takes to get
back to your starting point.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.560
Or how long it takes for the
whole cycle to happen once.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.140
So what is this T?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.140
So let me ask you a question.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.320
What are all the points--
that if this is a

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.950
cosine function, right?

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.290
What are all of the points at
which cosine is equal to 1?

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.470
Or this function would
be equal to A, right?

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.860
Because whenever cosine is
equal to 1, this whole

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.415
function is equal to A.

00:03:24.415 --> 00:03:25.930
And it's these points.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.450
Well cosine is equal to 1 when--
so, theta-- let's say,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.430
when is cosine of theta
equal to 1?

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.890
So, at what angles
is this true?

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.150
Well it's true at theta
is equal to 0, right?

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.200
Cosine of 0 is 1.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.430
Cosine of 2 pi is
also 1, right?

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.400
We could just keep going around
that unit circle.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.770
You should watch the unit circle
video if this makes no

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:51.260
sense to you.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.600
Or the graphing trig
functions.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.850
It's also true at 4 pi.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.790
Really, any multiple of
2 pi, this is true.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.320
Right?

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.310
Cosine of that angle
is equal to 1.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.900
So the same thing is true.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:14.400
This function, x of t, is equal
to A at what points?

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.980
x of t is equal to A whenever
this expression-- within the

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.540
cosines-- whenever this
expression is equal to 0, 2

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.990
pi, 4 pi, et cetera.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.610
And this first time that it
cycles, right, from 0 to 2

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.650
pi-- from 0 to T, that'll
be at 2 pi, right?

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.730
So this whole expression will
equal A, when k-- and that's

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:42.970
these points, right?

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.760
That's when this function
is equal to A.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.930
It'll happen again over
here someplace.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.260
When this little internal
expression is equal to 2 pi,

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.180
or really any multiple
of 2 pi.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.010
So we could say, so x of t is
equal to A when the square

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:03.460
root of k over m times
t, is equal to 2 pi.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.330
Or another way of thinking about
it, is let's multiply

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.510
both sides of this equation
times the inverse of the

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.450
square root of k over m.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:20.410
And you get, t is equal to 2 pi
times the square root-- and

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.840
it's going to be the inverse
of this, right?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.550
Of m over k.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.440
And there we have the period
of this function.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.460
This is going to be equal
to 2 pi times the square

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.860
root of m over k.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:41.475
So if someone tells you, well I
have a spring that I'm going

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:43.925
to pull from some-- I'm going to
stretch it, or compress it

00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:46.080
a little bit, then I let go--
what is the period?

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.180
How long does it take for the
spring to go back to its

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.990
original position?

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.480
It'll keep doing that, as we
have no friction, or no

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.060
gravity, or any air
resistance, or

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.790
anything like that.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.700
Air resistance really is just
a form of friction.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.940
You could immediately-- if you
memorize this formula,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.360
although you should know where
it comes from-- you could

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.840
immediately say, well I know
how long the period is.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.390
It's 2 pi times m over k.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.090
That's how long it's going to
take the spring to get back--

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.560
to complete one cycle.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.520
And then what about
the frequency?

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.320
If you wanted to know cycles per
second, well that's just

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.200
the inverse of the
period, right?

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.190
So if I wanted to know the
frequency, that equals 1 over

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.820
the period, right?

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.860
Period is given in seconds
per cycle.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:33.340
So frequency is cycles
per second, and this

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.880
is seconds per cycle.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.970
So frequency is just going
to be 1 over this.

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:44.500
Which is 1 over 2 pi times the
square root of k over m.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.180
That's the frequency.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.110
But I have always had trouble
memorizing this, and this.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:50.620
You always [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.240
k over m, and m over
k, and all of that.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.650
All you have to really
memorize is this.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.840
And even that, you might
even have an intuition

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.660
as to why it's true.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.240
You can even go to the
differential equations if you

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.680
want to reprove it
to yourself.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.020
Because if you have this, you
really can answer any question

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.990
about the position of the
mass, at any time.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.150
The velocity of the mass, at any
time, just by taking the

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.980
derivative.

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.140
Or the period, or the frequency
of the function.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:14.810
As long as you know how to take
the period and frequency

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.180
of trig functions.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.010
You can watch my videos, and
watch my trig videos, to get a

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.340
refresher on that.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.850
One thing that's pretty
interesting about this, is

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.930
notice that the frequency
and the period, right?

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.900
This is the period of the
function, that's how long it

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.470
takes do one cycle.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.090
This is how many cycles it does
in one second-- both of

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.010
them are independent of A.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:37.830
So it doesn't matter, I could
stretch it only a little bit,

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.750
like there, and it'll take the
same amount of time to go

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.560
back, and come back like
that, as it would if I

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.470
stretch it a lot.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:45.290
It would just do that.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.800
If I stretched it just a little
bit, the function would

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.450
look like this.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.340
Make sure I do this right.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.030
I'm not doing that right.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.280
Edit, undo.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.800
If I just do it a little bit,
the amplitude is going to be

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.180
less, but the function is going
to essentially do the

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:04.890
same thing.

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:08.190
It's just going to do that.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.090
So it's going to take the same
amount of time to complete the

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.450
cycle, it'll just have
a lower amplitude.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.890
So that's interesting to me,
that how much I stretch it,

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:18.000
it's not going to make it take
longer or less time to

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.850
complete one cycle.

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.500
That's interesting.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.360
And so if I just told you, that
I actually start having

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.930
objects compressed, right?

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:33.419
So in that case, let's
say my A is minus 3.

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:37.490
I have a spring constant
of-- let's say k is,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.280
I don't know, 10.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:43.830
And I have a mass of 2
kilograms. Then I could

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:47.100
immediately tell you what the
equation of the position as a

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.630
function of time at
any point is.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:53.120
It's going to be x of t will
equal-- I'm running out of

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.310
space-- so x of t would equal--
this is just basic

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:03.450
subsitution-- minus 3 cosine of
10 divided by 2, right? k

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.970
over m, is 5.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.600
So square root of 5t.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.370
I know that's hard to read,
but you get the point.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.860
I just substituted that.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.550
But the important thing to
know is this-- this is, I

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.360
think, the most important
thing-- and then if given a

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.690
trig function, you have trouble
remembering how to

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.690
figure out the period or
frequency-- although I always

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:26.120
just think about, when does
this expression equal 1?

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.952
And then you can figure out--
when does it equal 1, or when

00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:32.416
does it equal 0-- and you can
figure out its period.

00:09:32.416 --> 00:09:33.360
If you don't have it,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.170
you can memorize this formula
for period, and this formula

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.830
for frequency, but I think that
might be a waste of your

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.830
brain space.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.090
Anyway, I'll see you
in the next video.
