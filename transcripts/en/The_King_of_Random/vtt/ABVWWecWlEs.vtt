00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.480
there is a classic science experiment that you have probably tried where you mix baking soda and vinegar to make a small volcanic eruption

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.050
but I think we can make it a little

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.790
better so for this video i teamed up

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.680
with lenovo so i can use their new yoga

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.910
book to help me super size this

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.890
experiment and make it a little bit

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.349
cooler a cool feature of the yoga book

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.089
is we can slap a piece of paper over the

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.099
halo keyboard and now as we sketch out

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.140
our plans it instantly digitizes the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.240
design in real-time a typical science

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.439
fair volcanoes probably somewhere

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.320
between 6 to 14 inches tall but we're

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.810
going to make our volcano 14 feet tall

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.830
here's how we're going to engineer it

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.630
inside the volcano we're going to have

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.400
three steel discs we're gonna have a

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.920
12-foot 8-foot and forefoot steel ring

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.720
and we're gonna build some two by four

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.520
wraps off of that so that we can step up

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.050
and step down safely

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.220
once we've got those in place we're

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.050
going to use paperback chicken wire to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.850
cover the volcano and then spray it with

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.800
insulating foam we're going to cover the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.720
whole thing and stucco paint it and then

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.060
use spray adhesive to stick real moss

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.560
around the base and make it look as

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:09.670
authentic as possible

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.590
now that we got the volcano built let's

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.390
work on making the rocket fuel and I

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.250
thought for our epic volcano rather than

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.869
using baking soda and vinegar we can

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.610
make it a little more explosive by using

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.020
the same composition I used in my

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.909
pyrotechnic by the two main ingredients

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.340
of my pyrotechnics I were just sugar and

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.049
potassium nitrate mixed together in a

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.600
60-40 ratio the reason this reaction

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.120
works is because the sugar acts as the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.320
fuel to keep the reaction going to buy

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.119
products of this reaction are potassium

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.979
carbonate which is the black ash that

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.930
falls down from the sky and we also get

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.869
carbon dioxide water and nitrogen gas my

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.789
pyrotechnic pi used about 1 pound of

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:44.200
this composition which was enough to

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.450
fill about an 8 inch pie crust imagine

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.250
something like this but a hundred times

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:56.659
bigger

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.009
you know guys this thing turned out

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.679
really really good it is 14 feet tall

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.630
and it's not made out of paper mache we

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.280
built this thing out of steel and stucco

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.020
and packed full of rocket fuel

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.549
we also put three mortars in their

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.530
little shoot off sparks 20 feet high and

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.420
like the whole thing to remote igniters

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.069
with the press of a button on our halo

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.810
keyboard the whole thing will go off in

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:44.730
all its glory

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.879
the water in order to really well that

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.860
is what 35 pounds of rocket fuel looks

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.420
like shoved into a giant science

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.290
experiment

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.250
I mean if you were here you would have

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.170
felt black ash raining down from the sky

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.540
just like the real volcanic eruption

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.920
this is so freaking cool i've never seen

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.530
anything like this done before

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.580
thanks for joining me for this

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.930
experiment i'll be looking for you in

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.709
the next one

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.910
dr. Ben we've even got freakin lava I

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.360
mean look at this stuff that is not

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.080
tomato sauce
