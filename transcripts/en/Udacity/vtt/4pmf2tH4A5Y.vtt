00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.260
On the surface, creating a list of items
is simple enough.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.270
Android includes a ScrollView
into which you can place any linear layout

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.740
that in turn arranges each item
it contains into a vertical list.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.320
Note the items which have fallen off
the bottom off the linear layout,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.520
and therefore aren't
currently visible in that UI.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.860
The ScrollView, as the name suggests,
will let the user scroll through

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.090
the contents of the layout it contains.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.100
But there's a challenge
associated with that approach

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.630
on a device with limited memory,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.840
and where touch responsiveness
is critically important.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.860
If you have 50 items in a list and can
fit 10 items on screen at any given time,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.496
what's the minimum number of views
you'd need to create

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:42.222
in order to scroll through
every item on the list?

00:00:42.222 --> 00:00:44.690
The answer might not
be immediately obvious,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.955
but think about ways in which
you can be more efficient

00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:50.365
in your use of the views
used to display the entire list.
