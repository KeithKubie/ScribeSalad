00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.120
Here's a simple ACME description for a client server system.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.230
At the outermost level is the keyword system indicating that what's being

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.390
provided here is a configuration describing this particular architecture.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.230
The system has a name, in this case simple CS, and then contained within it,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.700
are some other statements describing the constituents of that particular system.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.060
In this case, there are two components. One is called client and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.760
one is called server, and there's one connector. Also there are two

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.880
attachments for plugging them together. The first component client has one port

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.080
out of which requests are sent. The second component server has one port for

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.080
receiving a request. The connector, which is called RPC, has two roles.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.690
One of which is called the caller role and one of which is called the callee

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.540
role. Then, in a natural fashion to attach these together,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.960
the client's send request port is connected to the connectors caller role.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.892
And similarly the servers receive request port is connected to the connectors

00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:18.130
callee role, hence we now plug together.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.600
The client, the server, using the connector in such a way that the ports and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.540
roles are plugged into each other. The system is thus configured in such a way

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.750
that the client can send requests using its port through the connectors so

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.620
the server receives those requests and can then act upon them.
