00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.560
Since we primarily need the generateMove
method for initializing a turn for

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.780
the computer,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.010
let's write a custom init method that
initializes a turn with a random move.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.732
We'll add that custom in that
method to the RPSTurn class.

00:00:13.732 --> 00:00:18.688
I'm going to start by copying and
pasting in the initWithMove method and

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:21.208
then I'll change the name to init.

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:25.270
And we're not going to be passing
in any parameters this time.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.071
And then we'll initialize the move
property with the value returned by

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.198
generateMove.

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:35.688
With this construction, we're sending
the message generateMove to self.

00:00:35.688 --> 00:00:40.438
And again, here self is
a pointer to the RPSTurn object.

00:00:40.438 --> 00:00:45.099
And now this line in the throwDown
method will initialize the variable

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:48.510
ComputersTurn with a value for
its move property.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.740
What if we place a break point after
computersTurn, we can run this and

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.490
then inspect the value of that variable
in the left side of the console.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:02.560
So we press Run and then we see
our variables here on the left

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.660
side of the console and
the value for move is Paper.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.270
Now let's run it again.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.330
This time it's scissors,
we'll run it again.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.390
This time it's rock.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.905
So our init method is doing a good
job of generating random moves for

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:22.715
ComputersTurn.
