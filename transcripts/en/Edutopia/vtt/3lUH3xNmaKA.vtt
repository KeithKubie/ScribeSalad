00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:10.896
&gt;&gt;Let's get it.

00:00:11.226 --> 00:00:14.396
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The members of the
Poudre High School Robotics Club are

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:18.146
spending every spare moment after
school and on the weekends working

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:20.526
on a project that would
make NASA proud.

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:26.416
&gt;&gt;Steve: Well, we got
the control board, right?

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:27.866
&gt;&gt;Yeah, right here.

00:00:29.256 --> 00:00:29.486
&gt;&gt;Steve: All right.

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:30.966
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Their mission, to design

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:34.236
and build a highly
functioning robot in six weeks.

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:38.036
Their goal, to be one of the
elite teams in a field of 500

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:42.846
at the first robotics competition, a
frenzied test of technical wizardry,

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:47.296
teamwork, and strategy that plays
out each year in Orlando, Florida.

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:50.356
&gt;&gt;Announcer: Here we go, the
national championship on the line.

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.046
Our first elimination
match from the Archimedes.

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.496
Oh, ran over there's
254, the [inaudible].

00:00:55.586 --> 00:00:57.896
&gt;&gt;This is going to
simulate it real well.

00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:00.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Thanks to
robotics club's partnership

00:01:00.356 --> 00:01:04.296
with nearby Colorado State
University, members gain access

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:06.346
to this state of the
art robotics lab.

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.626
&gt;&gt;Okay, the robot and
the rocket are to scale,

00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:11.156
but the robot should actually
be shorter for him to--

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:13.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Here they test
models and plan strategies

00:01:13.546 --> 00:01:17.116
that they hope will carry the
day at the annual robotics event.

00:01:17.486 --> 00:01:19.806
&gt;&gt;We'd have 40 points for
the robots because each robot

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:21.156
in the end zone is 10 points.

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:23.786
&gt;&gt;What if there's a robot
that balances better than us?

00:01:24.476 --> 00:01:26.096
&gt;&gt;Then they should do the balancing,

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:28.726
because as a group we
get all the same score

00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:30.276
and if they can do it
better than we can,

00:01:30.276 --> 00:01:31.436
we should go ahead
and let htem do it.

00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:35.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To score points,
a team must work cooperatively

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:38.946
with four other team robots
in a race against time.

00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:42.146
Utilizing the unique attributes
of the different robots,

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:46.786
one robot must come to rest balanced
on a ramp while others scurry

00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:48.986
about moving large
balls from one side

00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:50.396
of the playing field to the other.

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:53.116
&gt;&gt;Does it have the gyro chip in it?

00:01:53.116 --> 00:01:53.346
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:55.996
&gt;&gt;It does know that it's
balanced by the gyro chip?

00:01:56.306 --> 00:01:56.556
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:58.816
&gt;&gt;Nice. Okay, that's good technology.

00:01:58.996 --> 00:02:01.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The students also
get an opportunity to work

00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:05.136
with real-world engineers and grad
student mentors at the university.

00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:08.656
&gt;&gt;Steve: Engineers are an
essential part of the program.

00:02:08.856 --> 00:02:09.996
&gt;&gt;Nice.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:13.476
&gt;&gt;Steve: The kids should
be and are right next

00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:15.546
to those engineers while
they're making those decisions.

00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:20.686
Instead of asking what do we do next,
they're asking why did you do that?

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:22.736
&gt;&gt;Janet: To make it move you
have to push down on all kinds

00:02:22.736 --> 00:02:23.506
of different combinations.

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:25.596
Are you guys going to change that?

00:02:25.986 --> 00:02:27.716
&gt;&gt;You can get a programmable
controller

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.106
where you could program
code and see--

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:33.086
&gt;&gt;Steve: And with that, then
they're getting that explanation

00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:37.516
from a real-world engineer,
somebody who's been there,

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:39.926
somebody who knows how
the whole system works.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:40.506
&gt;&gt;This is hard.

00:02:40.576 --> 00:02:42.216
It's hard for her, is
it hard for a robot?

00:02:43.356 --> 00:02:45.806
&gt;&gt;Janet: It's the students themselves
who are designing the robot,

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:48.036
and it's the students themselves
who are fabricating the robot.

00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:50.766
And then it's the students who
actually get to see it come to life.

00:02:51.836 --> 00:02:54.406
Well it shows what
you can do yourself

00:02:54.546 --> 00:02:56.866
and how you can apply the
knowledge you've learned,

00:02:57.136 --> 00:02:59.526
but then it also shows how
much you still have to learn.

00:02:59.556 --> 00:03:01.196
&gt;&gt;Write the dates up for this Sunday.

00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:04.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Beyond engineering,
team members learn how

00:03:04.286 --> 00:03:07.956
to organize fundraisers and make
presentations to local businesses

00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:11.056
so they can raise the tens of
thousands of dollars they need

00:03:11.056 --> 00:03:13.496
to travel to the various
events each year.

00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:16.116
&gt;&gt;Steve: Yebing is going
to put together a website

00:03:16.206 --> 00:03:17.146
for us that's going to be--

00:03:17.146 --> 00:03:20.526
&gt;&gt;Steve: There's people that do
travel, there's artists that we need,

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:22.996
there's marketing,
there's documentation.

00:03:22.996 --> 00:03:26.556
You bring in this eclectic
group of kids

00:03:26.556 --> 00:03:28.186
and they get to work with each other.

00:03:28.186 --> 00:03:30.036
And that's something that a lot

00:03:30.116 --> 00:03:34.626
of extracurriculars do not
give you the opportunity to do.

00:03:34.626 --> 00:03:34.693
&gt;&gt;Steve: [Inaudible]

00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:34.760
&gt;&gt;Announcer: [Inaudible]

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:44.206
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Poudre High team
finally saw their hard work pay off

00:03:44.206 --> 00:03:47.196
at the regional competition
in San Jose, California.

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:50.136
Their robot performed
admirably and was able

00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:52.856
to lend a helping hand
to a robot in distress.

00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:56.716
&gt;&gt;Tyson: I've learned
an incredible amount.

00:03:57.186 --> 00:04:00.156
Just through working with
mentors and my peers and going

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.316
through the engineering process has
really given me kind of an experience

00:04:03.316 --> 00:04:05.216
of what engineering is actually like.

00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:11.506
&gt;&gt;Steve: It's the culmination of six
to eight weeks of intense hard work

00:04:11.506 --> 00:04:16.676
and finally it's you in the
spotlight being celebrated

00:04:16.746 --> 00:04:18.806
for what you've done.

00:04:18.806 --> 00:04:25.286
You have a passion and once you
have passion, what can stop you?

00:04:25.436 --> 00:04:25.503
&gt;&gt;Woo!

00:04:25.503 --> 00:04:26.966
&gt;&gt;Good job!

00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:28.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For more
information on what works

00:04:28.846 --> 00:04:32.786
