I'm here at Mozilla with Dave Herman a researcher at Mozilla Research

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
who also sits on the standards committee for the governing body for JavaScript.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I was wondering if you might tell us a bit about changes to the language over time

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
or what's coming down the pike. &gt;&gt;Sure.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
JavaScript was initially invented by Brendan Eich in a great rush.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
He famously invented the first version of JavaScript in 10 days.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The original goal of JavaScript was to create a little scripting language

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
where people could to little things with webpages,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and I think there were people even back then who had some visions of where it could go,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but it really did start from pretty humble beginnings.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
At this point, JavaScript really is the language of the web,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and the web has become note just a place for documents but a place for serious programs,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
for serious applications.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
As a result, the platform grows, the language grows, and the needs of the programmer grow with it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
While JavaScript started out as a simple language,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the needs of programmers aren't as simple as they used to be.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That means that there's a lot of features that other programming languages have

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and JavaScript does not have that we've had to consider standardizing on.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
A big one is that as your programs start to get bigger, you have needs around organization

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
of your programs that don't actually arise when your programs are smaller.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You may have seen as you're working with Python that Python has a module system.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It has the ability to define separate pieces of code that you put into modules,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and then you can mix and match those modules and put together larger programs

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
from smaller components.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
JavaScript doesn't have a module system at all.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It's actually not that easy to create a library, create a piece of reusable code

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that you can share with other people.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
There are various idioms that people use within the language

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to sort of simulate a module system, but they don't get any support from the language directly.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
One of the biggest features that we've been working on for the next version of JavaScript

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
is a module system in some ways similar to Python's module system,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
although JavaScript has some particular needs of its own.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The web has some particular needs of its own.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But it'll make it much easier for people to create reusable individual chunks of code

00:02:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
that they can share with each other.
