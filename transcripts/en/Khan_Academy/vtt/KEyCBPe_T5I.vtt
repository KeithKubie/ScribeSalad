00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
OK, we're on problem
number 16.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.490
Let's see, they drew
us something here.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.560
From point A to point
B, I have a line.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.930
Then I have another, B to C.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.750
Then I have another,
from here to here.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.060
OK, so what are they
telling us?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.450
They tell us, this is
a 90 degree angle.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.165
Whoops, not what I wanted
to do, edit, undo.

00:00:29.165 --> 00:00:31.000
I'm using the wrong tool.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.350
So they tell us, this is a 90
degree angle, this is 90

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.280
degree angle.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:44.140
This is A, this is B, this
is C, this is D.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.890
And they say, the figure above
shows the route of Diane's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.810
trip from her house
to her job.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.620
Diane travels 16 miles from
A to B, so this is 16.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.700
15 miles from B to
C, so this is 15.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.286
And 4 miles from C to
D, so this is 4.

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:04.019
If she were to travel from
A to D directly, how much

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.420
shorter in miles would
the trip be?

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.460
So what would be the
direct route?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm assuming, they're kind of
talking if she could fly.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.560
What would be her
direct route?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.850
So that would be this route.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.600
I thought I was using
the line tool.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.290
Edit, undo.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.150
I'll do it in a better
color anyway.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.280
So this is the direct
route, right here.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.130
This is we want to figure out,
the distance of this.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.150
So how can we figure
out the distances?

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.170
And the trick here is to just
realize that this is going to

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.390
be the hypotenuse of
a right triangle.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.330
And you might-- seem confusing,
your initial

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.780
impulse might have been to say
this is x, and this is 15

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.730
minus x, and all of
this fancy stuff.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.260
Or what you could do, is you can
say, well, this side here,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.760
we know what this
is, this length.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.002
Whoops.

00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:51.700
Let me draw it a little
bit better.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.990
That length, what
is that length?

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.020
Well, this length is going
to be the same as

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.700
this length, right?

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.820
If we assume this is
a 90 degree angle.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.110
It's going to be 15.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.770
And then what's this
length, right here?

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.699
Well it's going to same as this
length up here, right?

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.980
I just kind of extended
a rectangle.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.180
So this length right
here is 4.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.100
So what is this entire length?

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.630
It's going to be 16 plus
4, so it's 20.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.880
So now, what we're trying to
figure out, her straight line

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.200
distance, is nothing but the
hypotenuse of a rectangle-- of

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.300
a right triangle, where we
know the other two sides.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.740
So we can say, if this is her
straight line distance, x, we

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.980
could say x squared is equal to
20 squared, 20 squared plus

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.500
15 squared.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.500
x squared is equal to-- let's
see, this is 400, plus 225, is

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.590
equal to 625.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.610
And the square root of 625 is
25, so x is equal to 25.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.830
So her straight line
distance is 25.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.870
And how far was she
travelling before?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:16.220
Let's see, she was going
16 plus 15 plus 4.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.400
So that's 20-- she was going
35, what is that, miles?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.070
Right, miles.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.960
She was going 35 miles,
and if she goes

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.590
straight, she goes 25 miles.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.310
So she would save 10 miles if
she went straight, if she was

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.490
able to fly.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.690
So that's choice C.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.940
Next problem.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.510
Problem number 17.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.320
One circle has a radius of 1/2,
and another circle has a

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.750
radius of 1.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.010
What is the ratio of the area
of the larger circle to the

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.130
area of the smaller circle?

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:04.530
Let's see, so the area of circle
1, area 1, is going to

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.660
be equal to what?

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.330
It has a radius of 1/2, right?

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.380
So it's pi r squared,
is the radius.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.103
So it's pi 1/2 squared.

00:04:18.103 --> 00:04:20.740
And what's the area
of circle 2?

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:26.580
The area of circle 2, it's
pi times its radius.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.340
And its radius is 1.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.360
So 1 squared.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.920
So the ratio of the area of
the larger circle to the

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.290
smaller circle-- which one is
going to be the larger circle?

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.690
This one is, because it has
a larger radius, right?

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.310
It has a radius of 1.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.610
So the ratio of the larger
circle to the smaller circle--

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.820
and that might be where you
messed up, if you flipped the

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.135
two-- the ratio of the larger
circle to the smaller circle

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:53.030
is equal to pi times 1, right?

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.460
Well that's just pi.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.385
Over pi times 1/2 squared.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.860
Pi's cancel out, so we have,
it equals 1 over 1/4.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.650
Or what we could do is we could
multiply the numerator

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:19.440
and the denominator by
4, which equals 4/1.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.590
So the ratio is 4:1, and
that's choice D.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.390
Problem 18.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.190
Clear image.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.930
Problem 18.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.290
If the sum of the consecutive
integers from minus 22 to x

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.440
inclusive is 72, what
is the value of x?

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.670
So this is the number-- we've
actually done a problem very,

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.800
very similar to this, so it
shows you that people at the

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.510
SAT, they think of a lot of
creative problems, but every

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.690
now and then, they
have to repeat.

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.900
So they're saying the sum of the
consecutive integers from

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.670
minus 22 to x is 72.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.510
So let's think about this,
let's draw the sum.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:09.390
So it's minus 22, plus minus
21, plus minus 20, right?

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:16.050
Plus-- it keeps going, until
it gets to 0-- plus 0.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.910
And then-- and I'm going to go
this way, again, I'm doing

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.550
that for a reason.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.280
And then you can say, plus 1,
plus 2, plus-- you keep going,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:39.300
and then you'd have plus 20,
plus 21, plus 22, plus 23,

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.920
plus 24, all the way until
we get to x, right?

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.540
What you need to realize is all
the way from minus 22 to

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.370
22, the sum is 0.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.000
And why is that?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.310
Well, look at the
way I drew it.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.570
So minus 22-- we're taking the
sum of everything, right?

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.150
So minus 22 is going to cancel
out with positive 22.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.850
You add those together,
you get 0.

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:08.230
Minus 21 is going to cancel
out with positive 21.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.760
Minus 20 is going to cancel
out with positive 20.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.750
And so forth, and so on.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.500
So everything-- so the sum from
minus 22 plus, bam, bam,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:22.060
bam, bam, all the way to plus
22, that equals 0, right?

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.820
So we only get into the
positive sum once

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.810
we get to 23, right?

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:32.250
So 23 plus 24 plus something,
something,

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.060
something, is x, right?

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.520
And we have to get to 72.

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.170
And here we can just
eyeball it.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.890
23 plus 24 plus 25,
what's that?

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.070
Well their average is 24,
24 times 3 is 72.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.390
Or we can just add it up.

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:55.930
So 23 plus 24 is 47, 47
plus 25, it equals 72.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.620
So the last number that we use
in this whole range is 25.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.040
So this is x.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.520
That is x.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.750
And all we did is we said--
think about it, take the sum

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.360
from minus 22, all the
way to positive 25.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.620
Everything up to negative 22,
from minus 22 to positive 22,

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.490
all of those cancel out
with each other.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.470
So the sum is just going to
be 23 plus 24 plus 25.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:23.600
That equals 72, so
then x is 25.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.910
Next problem-- I'm running out
of time, so I'd better do it

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.400
in the next video.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.880
See you soon.
