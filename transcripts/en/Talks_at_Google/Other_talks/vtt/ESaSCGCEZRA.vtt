JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: I'm
sitting with two very talented

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.240
people, as those bios suggest.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.855
So, I know the "Eleven
Madison Park"

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:14.640
cookbook came out in 2011.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.550
Two years later we have "I Love
New York." Are you guys

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.260
really authors disguised
as restaurateurs?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.050
How did this book come
about so quickly?

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.200
WILL GUIDARA: No.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.470
When we did the "Eleven Madison
Park" book, the funny

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.660
story about that was in the very
beginning we were pretty

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.200
naive, and we didn't really
know what went into a

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.130
book of that size.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.600
And we started, it was the two
of us and our assistant, and

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.000
the idea was that we would write
the book and she would

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.500
test the recipes.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.590
And we had the whole thing
figured out and we thought it

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.230
was going to be nice and easy.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.790
And fast forward about three
weeks from there, and the

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.480
entire restaurant was kind of
collapsing on itself, because

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.810
Amy was never in the office--
she was always trying to

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.580
cook-- and we realized we needed
to figure out a more

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.420
effective approach.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.360
And so, by the time we had
really kind of engaged in the

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.380
process of "Eleven Madison
Park," there were about 10

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.090
people on a team working
on that book.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.090
And when we finished it, like
when you finish anything,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.490
there is that element of kind
of celebration that we'd

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.850
finished it, and then
sadness that we no

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.000
longer had a project.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.510
And so, we kind of just kept
going, and we just took the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.410
team, and we had been
fantasizing about this idea

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.750
for a while, and we just
got right back into it.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.210
So, it happened a lot more
quickly, I think, than either

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.330
one of us would have imagined.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.180
But as a fun book to work on.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.290
DANIEL HUMM: Also what was cool
is that it was a year of

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.210
kind of like the quiet
before the storm.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.100
It was way before
NoMad opened.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.450
But as you might know, a book
takes a good year to produce,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.980
and then it takes another
year to be published.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.910
So, really we produced the book
two years ago, and now

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.890
everyone is like wow,
how were you able to

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.410
also produce a book?

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.310
But the reality is that it
really was produced before we

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.050
opened, before we started

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.550
conceptualizing and opening NoMad.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.440
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: You're
time travelers.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.930
It's what you do, OK.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.270
And 50 of the farms, or over
50 of the farms featured in

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.290
this book are actually located
150 miles outside of New York

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.430
City or less.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.140
So do you think readers are
going to be surprised with how

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.550
agricultural the state is?

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.940
WILL GUIDARA: I mean I was
surprised as a chef, cooking

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.420
here at that time for
already five years.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.100
It's just unbelievable.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.270
We have the Atlantic Ocean,
which is some of the best

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.710
water for seafood
in the world.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.930
It's really cold water.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.500
It produces really sweet
[INAUDIBLE] fish and

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.800
incredible fish.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.510
And then we have the Hudson
Valley, which is one of the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.480
best growing regions for
root vegetables,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.130
but also stone fruits--

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.490
apples and pears.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:19.090
And you know it has so
many different types

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.550
of climate, of soil.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.310
There is a soil that, it's
around the Hudson Valley.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.500
It's pitch black, pitch black
like this floor, and it's

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.460
called the muck soil.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.080
And the carrot it produces,
it's unbelievable.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.280
We have this one guy, his name
is Alex [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.710
He's been farming
for 40 years.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.070
And he farms a couple of
things, but he's really

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.690
focused on carrots, and he grows
20 or 30 different types

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.800
of carrots.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.980
And this soil, which is also
very sandy, the carrots that

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.550
it produces is unbelievable--

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.240
how sweet it is.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.400
And then in the 25 different
carrots, it's from really

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.910
sweet carrots to carrots even
a little bit spicy, earthy.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.300
It's just unbelievable.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.235
I was blown away.

00:04:17.235 --> 00:04:20.930
I mean that's kind of how
we felt like this

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.310
story had to be told.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.470
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: And the
carrots at NoMad are famed.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.670
So is that the secret, going
to this farm and getting

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.800
those, or can anyone accomplish
that taste at home?

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.050
WILL GUIDARA: I mean
definitely.

00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:41.800
We're chefs and there is only so
much you can do as a chef.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.680
There's a whole other spectrum
that happens before the

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.220
ingredient arrives in the
kitchen, and that is all in

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.880
the farmer's hands.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.950
And since this process, since
we got really close with the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:00.150
farms, we're actually able to
affect the process even before

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.420
it comes to the kitchen.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.860
When we have a dish and we talk
to the farmer, we say we

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.870
want a carrot that's--

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:11.490
just staying with the carrot, it
could be anything-- but we

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.110
want a carrot that's a little
spicy, we want a carrot that's

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.220
this, we want a carrot--

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.410
a certain size.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.880
We can really control
a lot of--

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.360
Or we can say you know what, we
want to have 10 different

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.850
carrots that nobody
has heard before.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.170
We want to grow some really
old hair long carrots.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.450
And with these relationships,
really the sky's the limit.

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.815
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: So can you
guys start a CSA for us?

00:05:37.815 --> 00:05:39.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.200
WILL GUIDARA: I think one of
the things that a lot of

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.140
people have been asking, OK, you
can call a book I love New

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.040
York, and it works everywhere
because it's New York, right.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.250
But a lot of people have been
saying, OK, how do you use

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.000
this book if you don't
live in New York?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And I do believe that there's an
element of this that's more

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.550
just about the spirit
of the book.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.280
And I think to that point,
when you think

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.540
internationally, at the very
least, when people think about

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.330
New York, they think of
Manhattan, and people don't

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.300
even know how much just amazing
product comes from

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.890
around here.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.100
But that's also the case in a
lot of places in America where

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.900
people are so focused on this
ingredient from there and this

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:16.890
ingredient from there that they
don't take the time to

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.770
look in their backyard, and
oftentimes, what's there is

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.230
going to yield you a much better
dish and then a much

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.370
better meal than anything that
you can get from importing it

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:31.620
just because of how long it's
been out of the ground or just

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.910
the care with which it's
being produced.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.690
But it was also an exciting
story for us to tell because

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.230
we do get to travel a lot.

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.020
That's one of the benefits of
what we do is we kind of, as a

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.470
requirement, need to go and
experience some of the great

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.100
restaurants out there.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.584
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Boo-hoo.

00:06:48.584 --> 00:06:50.036
Everyone's crying for you.

00:06:50.036 --> 00:06:51.370
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah, exactly.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.170
So we've been to Rome and Tokyo
and Piedmont, Lyon, and

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.100
when you go to the great
restaurants in these places,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.340
like the three Michelin star
restaurants, there's an

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.050
amazing sense of place.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.220
You know that you're there when
you're in a perfect Hush

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.470
sushi bar in Tokyo, that meal
almost wouldn't even make

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.110
sense anywhere else
in the world.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.840
Similarly, when you're in
Piedmont during truffle season

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.860
or this or that.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.770
And yet, in New York, which we
believe is the greatest dining

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.940
city in the world, it's
not that way.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.840
And it's kind of a blessing
and a curse.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.750
It's a blessing because here we
can get everything in the

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.410
world simply by picking up the
phone or going to one of the

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:31.290
local kind of neighborhoods
that's a

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:32.870
microcosm of that place.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.520
But when you go to the great
restaurants in New York

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.910
there's a sense of place
oftentimes in Piedmont or Lyon

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.340
or Tokyo or Paris.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.390
And so it's been fun for us
to join the conversation.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:47.770
It's not just us having-- and
I think some great chefs and

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.500
restaurateurs in New York are
focusing on this now, that New

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.550
York is the greatest dining city
in the world, and it's

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:57.100
about time we find what does
New York cuisine mean.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.260
What does dining in New York
actually consist of, if it's

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.900
unique within the world, and
based on what's growing around

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.760
here, and also based on so much
of the history and the

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.100
traditions that have
taken root here.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.440
It was a really fun thing for
us to learn about, to talk

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.940
about, and then to really begin
to integrate into the

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.060
restaurants.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.390
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: And I know
in the introduction to

00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:18.640
the book you touch upon that.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.640
So it was partially created to
begin the conversation, what

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.120
is New York cuisine.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.580
So now that you've written
it, do you have

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.390
an appropriate answer?

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:27.320
WILL GUIDARA: What is
New York cuisine?

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.970
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Yeah.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.210
WILL GUIDARA: I mean you've
got to buy the book.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.155
That's the whole thing.

00:08:30.155 --> 00:08:32.059
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:32.890
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
Fair enough.

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.100
Fair enough.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.669
And I know that Eleven Madison
Park underwent a menu change

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.030
at the end of last year.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.990
So, do you both feel that the
process of writing the book

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:44.770
changed your approach to both
of your restaurants?

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:50.460
DANIEL HUMM: Writing this book
has definitely made us

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.300
re-think everything we were
doing, and it has definitely

00:08:54.300 --> 00:09:00.440
influenced the recent changes
at Eleven Madison Park.

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:04.540
But to the question before, what
is New York cuisine, I

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.800
think that is a really
open-ended question, and the

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.840
book will have some answers, but
it's not going to answer

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.380
everything.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:16.330
And I think we're just
onto something.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.680
I think we're just at the
beginning of something.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.180
You know, growing up in
Switzerland, I grew up in a

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.940
very small town of
1,000 people.

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:32.980
And the surrounding towns were
fairly small as well.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.460
And each of the towns had a
local specialty, like the town

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:43.250
I'm from has a special type of
chocolate that's stuffed with

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.140
marzipan and special--

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:53.270
like a liqueur from the
apples that we grow.

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:58.180
And the town next to it
has a famous sausage.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:05.110
Other towns have famous baked
goods, famous vegetables, a

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.350
special type of cherry
that they grow.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.880
Every small town has that.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:16.590
And so, whenever I travel,
I look for those.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.640
And when I go to a new place I
say OK, what makes this place

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.240
special in terms of food,
in terms of ingredients.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.800
And so, it was no different
coming to New York.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.310
And it's kind of hard to see
because in New York we have

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:38.146
everything, and if we don't
have it, we fly it in, and

00:10:38.146 --> 00:10:39.120
whatever you want.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:42.480
We fly in fish from Japan
and olive oil

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.365
from Italy and whatever.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.870
But when I came here I really
wanted to dig a little deeper

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:58.500
and to see what has been created
here, and what grows

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.710
here the best.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:04.470
And I think it is the two things
together that makes a

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.190
cuisine to its place.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:10.000
I think it's the agriculture
and the history as well.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:16.030
So like the egg creams, the
Bloody Marys, the black and

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:22.350
white cookies, the lobster
thermidor, or baked Alaska,

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.970
steak tartar, potato chips.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:28.870
I mean there's so many
things that--

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.590
the oysters.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:36.550
There were like 50 years of
New York where people ate

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:39.715
oysters, like a pound of oysters
per day per person.

00:11:39.715 --> 00:11:40.250
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: I wish.

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.870
DANIEL HUMM: I mean oyster
was like the thing.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:47.180
This was called the
oyster island.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:54.430
So that's what we're really
trying to define and trying to

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.450
just do more research
and dig deeper.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:02.580
And what's exciting is I think
we just scratched the surface.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.270
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: So, in
your travels throughout New

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:08.420
York, was there anything that
really surprised you?

00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:11.900
WILL GUIDARA: I think that we
had a list of farms that we

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.340
were going to go check out
that were either farms we

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.160
learned about or farms that
we're using, farms that we had

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.580
at least up until that
point, held in

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.370
very, very high esteem.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.960
The surprises came in
different ways.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.360
One, farms that we hadn't really
heard that much about

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.880
that were just unbelievable in
the care and the attention and

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:31.180
what was actually being
produced there.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.280
And then there were the farms
that we thought were

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.640
unbelievable, and then when we
got there we're like oh, my

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.710
goodness, I can't believe we've
been buying from these

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:39.790
people for this long.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.280
There's 55 in the book, but I
think we probably went to

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:45.800
about 65 or 75 before we were
able to kind of cull down the

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.860
list of this.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.420
We spent a lot of time in a car
together, and spent a lot

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.020
of nights in these random hotels
in upstate New York as

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.776
we were kind of exploring.

00:12:55.776 --> 00:13:00.240
This book is arguably more
accessible and simpler than

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.170
the "Eleven Madison Park" book,
but it took a lot more

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:06.820
work to put this one together
because it was not just a book

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.560
of recipes.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:13.110
It required getting to know each
one of the farmers and

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.150
kind of well enough we're able
to tell their story.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:19.100
Because it's cool the amount of
trust that they give you.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.370
These people, who we didn't know
very well, allowed us to

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.400
tell their story to the world.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.490
And some of the stories just
beyond the food, beyond the

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:31.380
stories of the traditions, but
the stories of these people.

00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.270
And it's amazing.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:36.180
They kind of shoot the entire
gamut in terms of where

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:37.740
they're from and how
they ended up doing

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:38.850
what they're doing.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:40.080
It was really fun.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:41.180
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: And
seems like some real

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.890
characters as well.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.280
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:48.880
Well, you have everything from
the jaded lawyers or people

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.580
that work on internet companies,
like they can't do

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.967
it anymore and they move
out to Long Island.

00:13:53.967 --> 00:13:54.464
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
What do you mean?

00:13:54.464 --> 00:13:55.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.720
WILL GUIDARA: That
was intentional.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.150
And then there were the people
that are fourth generation and

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:05.270
had always been doing one thing
and then the food craze

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.720
is taking over and they wanted
to do something better.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.150
But yeah, the pictures of some
of these, it's amazing.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:18.110
DANIEL HUMM: But also, I truly
believe that when there is a

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:22.100
connection to the product, when
you know exactly where

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.360
it's from, it just
tastes better.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:32.940
Like I remember as a child, when
we would go out and went

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.610
to forage mushrooms, or
we went to pick fresh

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.100
strawberries and then we
made a strawberry pie.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.920
All these things, it just
tastes so much better.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.770
So, I think the more people of
our team we can get to the

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:53.040
farm and get to know the
farmer, the more we can

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.720
translate that to the guests.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:01.050
The more passion there is, the
more care there is, when the

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:06.330
cooks know where it's from and
how much work it takes to get

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:07.530
to this product.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:09.780
You know, certain things at the
restaurant, we're using

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.160
all these little small
chanterelle mushrooms, for

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.450
example, or the tristar
strawberries, also very tiny.

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:24.020
And when you see what it takes
to get to that, the way you

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.160
care for it is a
lot different.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.290
And then in the dining room, if
they know the same thing,

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.590
then the way they present it
to the guests, they're much

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:38.470
more excited about it because
they know how special it is.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.110
And then in the end, I think
the guests get the benefit

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:46.030
from that, from that passion
and excitement about the

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.720
people who grow it and
about what they grow.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.150
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Have the
farmers ever come to the

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:52.450
restaurant?

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:55.680
WILL GUIDARA: We threw a big
party at this loft down in

00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.800
Tribeca when we released the
book, and we invited all 55 of

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.170
them, and I think about
33 of them came.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.090
And it was awesome.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.930
So our entire staff getting
to interact with them, and

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:13.910
definitely it was a very
cosmopolitan scene, and there

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.420
was definitely a juxtaposition
going on.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.010
But we also have classes--

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.640
we're only open for dinner four
nights of the week at

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:23.870
Eleven Madison, so we have the
entire afternoon to have

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:25.520
classes and presentations
and whatnot.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:29.450
And so, we open for dinner
service at 5:30, but all of

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.810
our team is there, at the
latest, by like 1:00 in the

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.790
afternoon, and we'll either do
wine tastings or cocktail

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.580
classes, or this or that
because that's

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.990
what we're all into.

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.920
The farmers will come down and
talk about the ingredient.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.650
I think with the dining room
staff, you have a better time

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.930
at dinner when the person
serving you is excited about

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:48.925
what they're serving you.

00:16:48.925 --> 00:16:52.060
And when they've gotten to meet
the person, it just makes

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.087
that much more fun, and you
learn a lot of stuff that you

00:16:55.087 --> 00:16:59.020
didn't even know you didn't
know, and that's what's cool.

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.755
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: I know you
guys are big music fans.

00:17:00.755 --> 00:17:04.069
So you said Eleven Madison
Park is Miles Davis.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.920
NoMad was the Rolling Stones.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:06.980
You've mentioned road trip.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.762
So what inspired this
book, musically?

00:17:11.762 --> 00:17:13.609
WILL GUIDARA: You know,
we didn't have--

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:17.410
the music is for the
restaurants, not the book.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.780
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
No road trip jam?

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:20.750
WILL GUIDARA: No, but we did
a video, and a lot of our

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.980
friends are musicians, so any
time we do a video we get one

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:30.050
of them to write some music and
the directions for kind of

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.230
an inspiration for the song that
accompanied the video for

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.680
this book was Mumford and Sons,
for what that's worth.

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.620
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: And you
also mentioned the book party.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:39.840
So, you guys are getting
somewhat

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.890
notorious for your parties.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.660
You've got the James Beard
award parties.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:45.600
I know you throw a Derby
party every year--

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.280
DANIEL HUMM: It's all him.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.590
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: --at
Eleven Madison Park.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.440
So what's the success behind
throwing a successful party?

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.250
What's the secret,
I should say.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.520
WILL GUIDARA: The secret to
throwing a successful party.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.280
DANIEL HUMM: A lot of booze.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.270
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah,
a lot of booze.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.570
WILL GUIDARA: Live music.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:03.830
I think a party without live
music, there's a problem, or a

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:04.710
really, really good DJ.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.540
We have this one woman DJ,
Bonnie, who does all of our

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.960
after hours parties.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.760
No, I mean in the same way that
a server is excited about

00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.130
the food makes you
excited of food.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.130
We love entertaining people.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:21.110
And we love doing it through
fine dining, we love doing it

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:24.360
through cocktails at NoMad, but
we get the same pleasure

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.270
out of bringing a ton of people
together and having

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.350
them have a good time.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:29.640
I mean for me--

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.840
and I'm the dining room guy,
he's the kitchen guy, and

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.510
that's why I do what I do
because I just love showing

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.130
people a good time.

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:40.750
And when we're in the dining
room, we're there

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:42.130
to only serve you.

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:44.380
When we throw a party, we're
there to party with you.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:48.280
And so, you get a different side
of our personalities a

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.380
little bit.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.163
DANIEL HUMM: Once there's no
police, the other times the

00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:53.728
police breaks it up.

00:18:53.728 --> 00:18:55.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:57.020
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Is there a
particular incident in which

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.540
the police came?

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:00.810
WILL GUIDARA: Oh, we had a
party this year after the

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.050
Beard Awards in this
loft space that

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.990
friends of ours have.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.606
And it was a really, really
good party, and--

00:19:08.606 --> 00:19:10.740
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: And all
really good parties end with

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.550
the cops coming.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.320
WILL GUIDARA: With the cops.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.550
But that DJ I was talking about,
DJ Bonnie who is kind

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.510
of a little bit of a spiritual
leader for me--

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:23.210
a, we lost the Beard award that
night, and we hadn't lost

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:24.510
a Beard award in a long time.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.430
And so, at the beginning
of the party she said--

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:31.910
and she speaks in this like
thick, maple syrupy way-- and

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.000
she's like baby doll,
don't worry.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.520
She was like if you win
every year people are

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.330
going to hate you.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.590
And so she made me feel good.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:40.840
And then on the way out, as she
was like wading her way

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.080
through the cops as she was
leaving the party, she gave me

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.900
a high five without even looking
me in the eyes, and

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.630
she goes, baby, it's bad ass
when your party gets broken up

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:49.160
by the cops.

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.840
So, DJ Bonnie made me
feel very good a

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.970
few times that night.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:54.220
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: So you've
got DJ Bonnie, you've

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.800
got Miles Davis, you've got
the Rolling Stones.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:58.580
So what do you think
the correlation is

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.160
between music and food?

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.220
WILL GUIDARA: It's not
music and food only.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.850
Its music and the experience.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:07.560
So, the whole Miles Davis
thing is because in the

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.770
beginning at Eleven Madison
Park, we get a review in the

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:12.280
"New York Observer," and at
the end she said that she

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.860
wished we had a bit more
Miles Davis in us.

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.030
And we kind of responded to that
without totally knowing

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.430
what it meant.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.390
And then a couple weeks later
it was still resonating with

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:22.900
both of us.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.010
So we read a bunch about Miles
and came up with a list of

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.800
words that were most commonly
used to describe him.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.630
And in that list were words like
endless reinvention, and

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:34.600
vibrant, and fresh, and light,
and spontaneous.

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.680
And that kind of became the
mission statement for Eleven

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.370
Madison Park.

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.560
And now in the kitchen we have
photos of Miles that the guys

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.330
at Sony Records have given us,
and it really is kind of a

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:48.230
permeating theme, where I think
in any organization

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.580
there's an incredible
power with language

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.110
to help guide you.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.780
So when we were getting ready
to open NoMad, we needed an

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:56.960
artist as well.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.790
And the thing with
the Stones are--

00:20:59.790 --> 00:21:03.370
the Stones, we wanted NoMad to
be fun, loud, loose, a bit

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.490
crazy, and I think that's
what the Stones are.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:08.770
But if you read about the
Rolling Stones, when they were

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.270
coming up, they were so
deliberate and studied and

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:14.970
intentional with everything
they did.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.070
If a new blues album came out
from the South in America,

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.810
they buy it, learn every song
note for note, break it down

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.540
and dissect it.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:24.780
In doing so, I think the Stones
revolutionized music

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.970
with like kind of R&amp;B, and
blues, and kind of weaving

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:28.610
those all together.

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.170
And so, what we want NoMad to
be is crazy and chaotic and

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:36.280
fun, but intentional.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.880
And it's just something that the
two of us have both always

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.280
related to pretty well.

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.670
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: You're
both innovators.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.820
So when it comes to cookbooks,
where do you see the

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.090
technological advances going to
kind of make things easier

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.350
for consumers?

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:53.780
Now you guys have an email
address in the introduction to

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:55.660
your book that people
can reach out.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.610
Do people use that?

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:57.850
DANIEL HUMM: No.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:01.510
The email address
gets used a lot.

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:06.890
And it was really important
for us that some of the

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:09.550
recipes are a little
less accessible.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:12.300
We didn't really want to
sacrifice, especially with the

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.720
"Eleven Madison Park" book, we
wanted to really show what we

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.260
do at the restaurant.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.850
And I think in the "I Love New
York" cookbook, it's a good

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.040
mix, but some recipes are a
little bit more challenging.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.930
So we really wanted to make sure
they're accessible in a

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:32.830
way that there's always somebody
there to talk to.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:38.100
And we do get still, for the
"Eleven Madison Park" book, we

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:42.430
get about five emails a week
with questions, and now with

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.330
this one we get a lot
more, obviously.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:49.050
But we're trying to get back to
people really quickly, in

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.770
the first day or so.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.220
But you know, it's interesting,
I ask myself a

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:02.280
lot, because at some point I was
wondering if we should be

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.230
kind of a leader with
the e-books.

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:14.410
And I collect a lot of books,
and I have them at home, and

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:19.030
it's really beautiful to
have real books still.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.510
So I'm not sure--

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:23.910
and it hasn't really taken off
as fast as I thought it would.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:28.080
So I'm not sure exactly
where it's going.

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.520
I still feel a real
book is beautiful.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:37.660
And I think it's very cool what
some websites do with the

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.920
recipes there's little videos,
and it definitely can give you

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:44.220
more in that sense.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:51.000
But as far as the spirit of a
restaurant or of a state, I

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.460
feel like the book has more
soul, and maybe it's just me

00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.290
the way I'm used to-- you know
I've been collecting cookbooks

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.420
since I'm 12 years old, so
for me there's something

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.500
special about it.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.990
So, I'm not sure how it's
going to look like.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.390
WILL GUIDARA: I feel like
cookbooks are just one of the

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.270
last things that people
actually want

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.040
in the printed form.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.330
I buy--

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:18.210
I travel with my iPad, and if
I'm buying a book I buy it

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:21.840
from an iPad, but a cookbook,
you use them.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.350
I think in the introduction to
the first one we said we want

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:28.220
this book either beautifully
presented on your coffee table

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.800
or lovingly stained
in the kitchen.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.250
But please, treat it as such.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:35.900
I'm just--

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.400
I'm happy that there's still a
book genre that is selling

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.790
well in printed form.

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.380
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Last time
you guys were here was

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.880
February, 2012, right
before NoMad opened.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:53.350
How have things changed since
then, besides the obvious

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:55.180
opening of NoMad.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.970
WILL GUIDARA: He had
a new daughter--

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.090
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
Congratulations.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.620
WILL GUIDARA: --Coco, who's my
goddaughter, and that's the

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:03.460
closest I've come to having my
own children, so that's been

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.680
exciting for me, maybe a little
bit exciting for him.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.610
DANIEL HUMM: He has a
few more gray hairs.

00:25:09.610 --> 00:25:11.660
WILL GUIDARA: I have, in
general, less hair, and then

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.780
within that hair,
more gray hair.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.080
WILL GUIDARA: No, we're busier,
but our team is

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.010
bigger, and in a way
we have more time.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:29.560
In a really bizarre way we're
doing a lot more than we ever

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.810
did before.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:37.220
But it's really great.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.950
I think this is, obviously, an
optimistic time in New York.

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:41.250
Any time you're being
interviewed at the beginning

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.390
of spring, you're always like
oh, man, life is awesome.

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:46.430
I love everything
and everyone.

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.910
And it's true.

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:53.090
But we've been very lucky in how
our team has evolved and

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:56.060
grown, and how, in spite of the
fact that, the number of

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.560
things on our to-do list have
grown exponentially, we've

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.490
maintained a similar pace and
balance and ability to juggle

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:09.400
things and handle them I think
pretty well, in spite of some

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.100
issues and road bumps
along the way.

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.150
DANIEL HUMM: You know, in the
grand scheme of things, I

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:20.330
think sometimes you get caught
up in your world and you feel

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.450
like you're ruling the world,
but in the end of the day

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:27.350
we're running two little
restaurants and they're so

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:28.590
close from each other.

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:34.290
So, when you put things in
perspective, and we have an

00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:35.150
amazing team.

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:40.283
So it's not that
big of a deal.

00:26:40.283 --> 00:26:45.080
I mean other people save lives
and we're just serving meals

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.630
to people, and luckily
there's enough

00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:50.150
people who want to come.

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.540
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
So, a very grounded

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.350
world view to have.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.680
I don't think anyone else would
say Eleven Madison Park

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.010
is small, but fair enough.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.150
So, for any of you who haven't
eaten at Eleven Madison Park,

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.480
at the end of the meal they
present you with granola, and

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.450
I'm not sure if the woman who
was here February, 2012 is

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:11.900
currently in our audience, but
she asked what's happening

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.630
with the granola.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:13.550
We all want it.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:15.190
We want to have it at home.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:16.960
What are the plans
for the business.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.210
Is it still an option?

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.730
WILL GUIDARA: I would imagine
our answer at the time was

00:27:24.730 --> 00:27:25.880
hey, we're actually thinking
about maybe--

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.420
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Yes.

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.130
You're like it's in the
works, it's happening.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:32.070
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah, it's
not happening anymore.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:37.770
No, I think that we're
both super excitable.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.720
We get really excited about
things, and one of things that

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:45.510
we're working very, very hard
to do is not get too

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.820
distracted by different
things.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.740
Maybe one day it'll happen.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.630
My dad just retired and it's
great when your dad retires.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:59.230
It's scary, also, however,
when-- and my dad was in the

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.050
restaurant business.

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:01.350
And so he's like well,
this is great.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.100
I have all this time.

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.930
I can really help you out with
your business, and then that's

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:05.770
a scary thing.

00:28:05.770 --> 00:28:06.263
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
I was going to say.

00:28:06.263 --> 00:28:06.756
Why can't he do it then?

00:28:06.756 --> 00:28:08.040
WILL GUIDARA: Well then, so then
he called the other day.

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.736
He's like what if I do
the granola thing?

00:28:09.736 --> 00:28:12.750
I was like Dad, no,
no, no, no, no.

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.221
So maybe my dad will
start selling our

00:28:15.221 --> 00:28:16.429
granola at some point.

00:28:16.429 --> 00:28:17.395
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:17.395 --> 00:28:19.330
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
Let us know.

00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:21.610
And you've been working together
at this point now for

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:24.460
seven years, so how has the
collaboration changed?

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.370
Obviously you guys
are very close.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.260
DANIEL HUMM: You know, I
think it's incredible.

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:36.630
I feel so lucky, or we feel so
lucky that we have really

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:38.350
found each other.

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:41.320
I think it's so much more
fun to have a partner.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.920
It's just something you
have to work on.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:53.740
It doesn't come just easily
all the time because your

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:59.290
personal life changes,
and work changes.

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.110
You're surrounded by
different people.

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:06.975
You have more restaurants, the
press, and all the things that

00:29:06.975 --> 00:29:07.890
are around.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:14.290
And so you constantly need to
work on it, but I think it's

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.870
stronger than it
has ever been.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:23.010
I think there was a time where
we kind of made the decision

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:27.230
to really be together and build
something together.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:31.400
And I think from that moment
on things really started to

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.370
come together for us.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:35.260
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah, I think--

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:39.210
we're very close, obviously.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.310
And not every day is a good day,
and on the bad the bad

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:44.960
days are never that bad when you
feel absolute support from

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.710
your business partner.

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.160
I think that's really,
really comforting.

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.900
I think we've had to learn
how to disagree.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.560
I think there were years where
we just agreed on everything

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.900
and it made working together
super, super easy.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:58.220
We don't always agree on
everything, and that's--

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.480
I think it's a skill.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.530
And we always talk about it
kind of half jokingly, but

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.170
sincerely it's like marriage.

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.720
And when you talk to the
people that have been

00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.740
successfully married for 50
years or something, they

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.450
always talk about just being
very intentional in your

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:18.080
pursuit of a healthy
relationship.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.570
We're friends with this family
that owns a restaurant in

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:26.210
Seattle called Canlis, and
it's a third generation

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.950
restaurant, so it was opened
by the grandfather and then

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.600
run by the parents for a long
time, and now the kids who are

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.610
very close friends of ours are
running the restaurant.

00:30:33.610 --> 00:30:38.790
And their Dad is just one of
these sage, wise men who, when

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:40.940
you're with him, everything he's
saying you know you're

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:44.240
receiving some brilliant
advice.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:47.530
Every time we're with him, he
never even tries to advise us

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:50.010
on what we're actually doing
in the restaurant.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:53.750
It's only just him kind of
speaking into our relationship

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.110
and our lives.

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.510
The thing that I think separates
Eleven Madison Park

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:02.140
and the NoMad is that they're
not chef-driven restaurants or

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:03.640
restaurateur-driven
restaurants.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.850
They're restaurants that are
founded upon the collaboration

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:10.390
between the kitchen and the
dining room, and it starts

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:14.460
with us, but it cascades through
the entire staff.

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:18.890
Our staffs are really,
really close.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:22.650
There's this old kitchen thing
where when a cook, who has

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:25.940
been at a restaurant for a long
time leaves, on their

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.910
last day they get dumped in
a big, big ice bucket.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.580
That's like a thing
that's kind of--

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.330
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
That's right.

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:33.020
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah,
it's terrible.

00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.640
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Anyone
want to work at a restaurant?

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.380
WILL GUIDARA: But that's like
every great restaurant out

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.230
there has some vestige
of that.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:39.910
And it was a very proud
day for me.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.330
It was about a year and a half
ago when I saw the cooks

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.530
dumping one of the dining room
staff into the ice bucket, and

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:48.050
we knew we'd kind of finally
arrived in that collaboration.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:51.370
But I think it's super,
super important.

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:53.430
DANIEL HUMM: How do you feel
when you get dumped in?

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:55.330
WILL GUIDARA: That's why we
bought the restaurant, so I

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.820
never le I'm good.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:00.300
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: And Danny
Meyer actually spoke

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:03.100
about traditions like that when
he was here last month

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.880
talking about "The Family
Table," his book.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.090
And so we actually asked him to
prepare of couple questions

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.850
to ask you.

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:14.590
So, the first one from Danny
Meyer is you two were born

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.470
innovating, and each innovation
has worked out

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:18.930
incredibly well.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.630
How do you respond when people
question your drive to disrupt

00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:24.800
the status quo?

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.930
And while you're thinking about
that background, in case

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:29.930
anyone doesn't know, Danny Meyer
was mentor to both of

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.340
you prior to you moving
on your own.

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.590
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:40.980
So we're both very sensitive,
and I think that that is a

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.070
requirement in doing
what we do.

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.400
If you're not sensitive, you're
not open to the needs

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.510
of the people you're
trying to serve.

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.950
And if you're not sensitive
enough, you're not going to be

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:52.230
good enough at reading the
guests and figuring out what

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.700
to give them.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.470
But the dangerous part is yeah,
when people say mean

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.840
stuff it hurts a little bit.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.390
But I think chef has actually
been really good for me in

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:07.940
this way, which is that the
further down the line you go,

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:10.400
if you're really trying to do
something new and special and

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.750
innovative, the less likely
it is that you're

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.630
going to please everybody.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.250
And so, we work very, very hard
to find balance between

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:24.770
listening to everything that's
said without being so reactive

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:27.270
that you change every time
someone says something.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.760
Because then you don't actually
have a point of view,

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.180
you're just trying to please
everyone, and in doing so,

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:38.000
watering down the message that
you're trying to convey.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.740
But, I mean those are the most
difficult times in our

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.680
relationship, too, because
sometimes I'll be like no,

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:45.470
they said they didn't like
it, we need to change it.

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.040
And he'll say no, no, no.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:48.840
We need to stay the course,
we believe in this.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.760
We've spent time preparing for
this, and one person can't

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:56.760
throw us off what we're trying
to do, and other times it

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.720
might be the other way around.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:01.980
But I think the answer is we
listen to everything, and then

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.850
at the end of the day you need
to just decide what you

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:06.760
believe is right, and I think
that that's how we've been

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.800
trying to handle those things.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.420
It's a well-articulated
question though.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.190
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
I'd expect nothing

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.300
less from him, right.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.409
WILL GUIDARA: Good job, Danny.

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:15.980
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: So the
second question that he had

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.219
for you was you two have derived
enormous inspiration

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:21.070
from Miles Davis.

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.630
Some day a restaurant is
going to put up words

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:25.219
inspired by you two.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.870
What would those words be?

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.560
WILL GUIDARA: There's no way
to answer this question

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.048
without being attacked somehow.

00:34:32.048 --> 00:34:34.288
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:34.288 --> 00:34:35.570
WILL GUIDARA: No, you know
what is really cool?

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:41.230
There's a restaurant in London
that put a sign up on their

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.679
wall in the kitchen that says,
"Would Eleven Madison Park do

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:48.900
it like that?" And we saw that
randomly on Twitter, and it

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:50.860
was the coolest thing for
our entire staff.

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.860
And now that restaurant has
actually been sending their

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:57.020
staff, two people every
single month.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:35:00.590
The guy gave them his credit
card and they come to New

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:04.270
York, and that feels
really good.

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.250
I mean

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.780
I think it's way too premature
in our careers to really think

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.930
about that, but for
our entire team--

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:16.860
there's 135 people that work at
Eleven Madison Park, and I

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.370
think one of our biggest goals
on a day-to-day basis is to

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.290
make sure that their
gas tanks are full.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:26.490
And when things like that
happen it's gold.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:27.550
It's amazing.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:31.210
DANIEL HUMM: The one word I
want to be there is fun.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.170
I think that's something that's
really important to us,

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.200
and I hope that people
will see that.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.870
And I think the other words is
for other people to decide.

00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:44.940
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: We're
going to finish our chat with

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.320
a couple of fill in the blanks,
and for those of you

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.620
in the audience that
have questions,

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.830
there are two mic stands.

00:35:49.830 --> 00:35:52.360
And I believe books being sold
in the back if you want to

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.640
purchase those as well.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.150
So if you want to start
queuing up.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.330
So, fill in the blank.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:58.460
Whatever comes to mind.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.700
WILL GUIDARA: We struggled with
the fill in the blank

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:00.960
portion of this interview
last time.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.530
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
That's OK.

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:02.910
WILL GUIDARA: So,
now I'm like--

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.435
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Second
go, a little more relaxed.

00:36:04.435 --> 00:36:06.100
WILL GUIDARA: --if my body
language is showing.

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.735
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: The most
challenging part of my job is?

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.770
WILL GUIDARA: See,
here we go again.

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:19.770
It's really hard.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:25.260
I'd say that to your point
before, the most challenging

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.690
part of my job is when
we let someone down.

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:30.610
Like we have really, really
high expectations for what

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.210
we're trying to do, and
when you disappoint

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.610
someone, it's the worst.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:39.050
DANIEL HUMM: The most
challenging part of my job is

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:45.140
to channel the ideas, because we
can't do them all, and kind

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:49.950
of prioritize what we want to be
and what we want to do, to

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.710
the point of the granola
business.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.990
That had to go away, even we
were super excited about it.

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.950
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: It'll
happen one day.

00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:57.573
DANIEL HUMM: There's
a lot of great--

00:36:57.573 --> 00:36:57.760
WILL GUIDARA: One day.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.630
DANIEL HUMM: --ideas we have,
and we have to stay focused.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.330
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
If I wasn't in this

00:37:05.330 --> 00:37:07.870
industry, I would be?

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.510
WILL GUIDARA: I'd
be a musician.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.410
I play the drums.

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:13.290
There was like a point in my
life where I had to decide

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.885
whether I wanted to try to
continue being a drummer or go

00:37:15.885 --> 00:37:19.610
into the restaurant business,
or stay in the restaurant

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:22.480
business, and I realize that I
could own restaurants and play

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:27.090
the drums, but I probably
couldn't play the drums and

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.590
try to be restaurateur
at the same time.

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:31.610
But it's one of the cool--
that's one of the reasons we

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:32.280
have these parties.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.170
We have all this live music,
because in doing what we do,

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:38.040
we get to really be connected
to music and have a lot of

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:42.020
great musicians around us.

00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:48.310
DANIEL HUMM: I think I would
probably be in cycling.

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:51.870
As a junior, I was on the
Swiss national team for

00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:53.600
mountain biking.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.700
And when I was 18 years old
I kind of had to make a

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:02.370
decision, professional
cycling or cooking.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:07.550
And with everything that went on
with the doping scandal, I

00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:08.825
think I made the right choice.

00:38:08.825 --> 00:38:09.090
[LAUGHS]

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.500
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Yeah.

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.510
WILL GUIDARA: He rode his bike
95 miles on Saturday.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.850
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
Oh, my goodness.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:15.500
WILL GUIDARA: I can't--

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:19.320
I mean just saying that out
loud, especially on a Monday

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.520
morning is--

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.350
So, I respect this man's
physical endurance much more

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:26.470
than my own.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:28.860
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
Pretty impressive.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.560
I hate it when I get asked?

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.080
WILL GUIDARA: Um, to
fill in the blanks.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:41.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:43.490
DANIEL HUMM: I hate when
I get asked what's

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:46.810
your favorite dish?

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.790
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: In my
fridge I always have?

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:51.520
WILL GUIDARA: Sriracha.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:53.010
I don't have very much
in my fridge.

00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:57.070
I have normally a six pack of
Stella, and then some sriracha

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:59.180
for whatever I end
up ordering.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.820
But we're not there
very often.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:08.320
DANIEL HUMM: In my fridge, I
always have Swiss chocolate.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:09.240
WILL GUIDARA: That's
so cliche.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.016
DANIEL HUMM: I know.

00:39:10.016 --> 00:39:11.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:12.170
WILL GUIDARA: That one--

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.510
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
Let him have it.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.170
WILL GUIDARA: --with the apple
liqueur and the marzipan.

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:15.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:16.390
DANIEL HUMM: From my home.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:17.548
WILL GUIDARA: From
your home town.

00:39:17.548 --> 00:39:19.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.290
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Gotta
bring a piece of you home with

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:22.050
you always.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:22.680
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah, sure.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.600
DANIEL HUMM: [LAUGHS]

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.290
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: The most
ridiculous thing that's

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:28.230
happened during one of the
parties we've thrown is?

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.240
WILL GUIDARA: I mean I don't--

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.000
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
Too many to count.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.060
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah, I can't--

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:40.870
I can't with--

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.710
DANIEL HUMM: No, the one time
he was like standing on the

00:39:43.710 --> 00:39:47.030
bar and he was starting taking
his clothes off.

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.340
That was insane.

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:50.540
WILL GUIDARA: That is not
even a little bit true.

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.230
I just want to make that--

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:51.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.560
WILL GUIDARA: --very,
very clear.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:39:54.972
We could move on to
the next one.

00:39:54.972 --> 00:39:55.414
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:55.414 --> 00:39:56.470
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: OK.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:57.240
Sensitive topic.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.310
Moving on.

00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:59.750
My hangover cure is?

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.290
WILL GUIDARA: You know, I
recently heard apple juice is

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:05.710
the best care for hangovers.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:06.440
I never tried it.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.140
I'm a purest.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.390
I drink coffee.

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:18.780
DANIEL HUMM: I mean there's a
lot of cures that he, over the

00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.830
years, tried to teach me.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:27.140
One has been drink
a Manhattan.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.590
The other one has been either
a Big Mac at McDonald's.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.906
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:32.906 --> 00:40:33.990
WILL GUIDARA: What are you
painting me to be right now?

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:35.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.500
WILL GUIDARA: He goes running.

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.840
WILL GUIDARA: That's
what he does.

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:39.990
I'll answer that one for you.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:42.186
DANIEL HUMM: For me, none
of them have worked out.

00:40:42.186 --> 00:40:43.042
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: OK.

00:40:43.042 --> 00:40:43.900
OK.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.160
So is it running then?

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.220
DANIEL HUMM: That is.

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.660
It's like a reset button.

00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:49.980
WILL GUIDARA: It drives
me crazy.

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:55.460
Like we'll be in Piedmont and
we'll have this huge meal with

00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.520
way too much wine and I wake
up just feeling terrible.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.470
And then he just like--

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.090
WILL GUIDARA: He like comes,
and he's oh, hey, Will.

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:07.820
Just ran 30 miles,
and I'm so Swiss.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:10.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.034
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Does he
eat a chocolate bar when he's

00:41:12.034 --> 00:41:12.230
saying that?

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:13.300
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah, exactly.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.342
With a spicy carrot
or something.

00:41:15.342 --> 00:41:18.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.450
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: And then
the last one is my greatest

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.200
food indulgence is?

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:29.110
WILL GUIDARA: I mean I guess
there's different words to

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.460
describe the word indulgent,
or-- yeah.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:35.890
DANIEL HUMM: I think being in
Piedmont and eating a lot of

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:40.980
white truffles and pasta,
that's pretty special.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.480
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah, there's
the luxuriousness.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.750
I think white truffles is
definitely the thing that

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:45.660
would top that list.

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:51.250
But I'm 33 now, and in the
last two years I finally

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:54.840
realized that I'm not going
to just be thin forever.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.090
And so now indulgence also comes
in just eating unhealthy

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.120
stuff, and I'll say what
I said last time.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.250
Like a double-double from In and
Out Burger, that's one of

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.982
my greatest indulgence.

00:42:06.982 --> 00:42:07.920
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
Fair enough.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.540
I believe we've got
a question.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.790
DANIEL HUMM: Animal style.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:12.430
WILL GUIDARA: Animal style.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.680
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Can't
forget that important detail.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.210
AUDIENCE: Congratulations with
the San Pellegrino list.

00:42:19.210 --> 00:42:20.586
WILL GUIDARA: Thank
you so much.

00:42:20.586 --> 00:42:22.690
AUDIENCE: I have a two-part
question.

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:26.280
The first is the carrot tartar,
which I think is

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:28.630
really fun and what of
the more memorable

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:30.170
parts of your menu.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.050
Did you try with other
vegetables or ingredients

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:34.490
while you were testing
that out?

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:36.740
And was there anything--

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.945
like did you ever thought about
putting just like a hunk

00:42:38.945 --> 00:42:40.650
of rib-eye in and see
what happens?

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:42.660
DANIEL HUMM: You know honestly,
that's where the

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:43.910
idea started.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:50.210
Steak tartar has such a history
in New York, and it's

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:54.410
been served for many years in
the greatest restaurants.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:57.910
And so, we kind of wanted
to do our own version.

00:42:57.910 --> 00:43:00.650
And so we were playing around
with meat, but then

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:02.280
different--

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:06.360
the stuff that goes in it to
make it different or the fact

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.920
that we were doing it
at the table we

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.040
thought it was different.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.410
But then eating it, it wasn't
quite different enough.

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:16.300
So one day I came back from that
farm and I had a whole

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:20.610
create of all these different
carrots, and they were just

00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:23.700
playing around with it, with
this old school meat grinder

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:24.990
that you've seen.

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:30.130
And somehow I just didn't like
it and I'd been thinking about

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.500
it, but then the carrots and
seeing the meat grinder, I'm

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:34.810
like let's try carrot.

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:38.120
And everyone was looking
saying, carrots?

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:39.810
And I wasn't sure either.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:42.880
But then we did it and we
worked around with the

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.110
garnishes that went into--

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:48.710
and it's pretty unbelievable.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:53.150
I think if you have your eyes
closed and somebody would feed

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.280
it to you, you would definitely
think steak tartar

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:57.690
right away.

00:43:57.690 --> 00:44:03.130
You might not even know that
there is no meat, because

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:09.110
these carrots are so
earthy and rich.

00:44:09.110 --> 00:44:11.740
And then you have these
garnishes with the acid and

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:17.710
this sour and the spicy,
and it just made sense.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:19.285
So that's how it happened.

00:44:19.285 --> 00:44:20.510
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:25.010
And also, in this book, which
recipe did you guys

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.320
resonate most with?

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.940
And also, Will, which one have
you successfully cooked?

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.760
WILL GUIDARA: Which one have
I successfully cooked?

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.840
Out of the "Eleven Madison Park"
book, I successfully

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.300
cooked the pasta dough recipe,
so that was what I

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.780
was proud of then.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:44.600
This one there's this ham and
cheese sandwich with an egg in

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:47.020
the top-- it's like an egg
in the hole sandwich.

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.970
And I have very nostalgic
memories of egg in holes

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:50.950
growing up.

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:52.420
So that's been the
dish that I've

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:53.905
accomplished at this point.

00:44:53.905 --> 00:44:57.030
And I always tell people, hey,
if you want to second guess

00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:00.040
whether or not this book is
accessible, I cooked out of

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:01.930
it, and so therefore, everyone
in this room

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:04.800
can cook out of it.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.230
Dish that resonated
most with you?

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:10.820
DANIEL HUMM: I really
liked the--

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.960
there's a couple different
salads.

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.950
But there's a strawberry
and a cherry salad.

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:20.750
They're both savory, but it's
kind of using the same

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:21.460
philosophy.

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:28.870
But it's cherries, and cheese,
and there's some guanciale,

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:30.580
and some nuts as well.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:35.448
And then with the strawberry
salad, it's kind of the same,

00:45:35.448 --> 00:45:36.640
same principle.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:46.080
It's like strawberries, red
onions, cucumbers, and as

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:50.190
well, like a sharp chedderesque
cheese.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:55.020
And I think it's a fun way,
especially during the season,

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:59.070
to present a fruit
in a savory way.

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:00.485
DANIEL HUMM: Yup.

00:46:00.485 --> 00:46:01.880
WILL GUIDARA: Thank you.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.230
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:05.060
Last summer you guys had a
collaboration with Alinea, and

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.310
I was wondering what was the
experience like for you guys,

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:10.890
and also for your
staff as well.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:11.710
WILL GUIDARA: I mean it
was unbelievable.

00:46:11.710 --> 00:46:12.450
AUDIENCE: Trade spaces.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:13.780
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah.

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:15.340
That was a ton of work.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.840
That was a big, big
undertaking.

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:23.340
But Grant and Nick are two of
our closest friends, and so in

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.390
the same way that it's fun for
us to work together, it was

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:28.980
kind of cool to, in a limited
engagement kind of thing, to

00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:32.290
get to work with two other very
good friends who are also

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:35.028
people that we have a
ton of respect for.

00:46:35.028 --> 00:46:38.450
And for our staffs, it was--

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:42.000
I mean it was the coolest thing
ever, because everyone

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.410
got to basically work in
another unbelievable

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:46.450
restaurant for a week.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.400
So they got to experience a
totally different approach to

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:53.030
doing things without ever having
to leave their home.

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.800
It was fun.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.540
It was inspiring.

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.410
Working with them was really,
really inspiring.

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:02.330
They are the kind of people who
any time they feel like

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:04.560
they've figured out how to do
something, they always say

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:07.140
again, OK, is this the
best way to do it.

00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:09.160
And I think working with people
like that, just being

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.590
alongside people with
that, it's good.

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:15.020
I think the experience was
really good for both Alinea

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.050
and Eleven Madison.

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:17.920
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:18.570
DANIEL HUMM: Yes.

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:24.920
For us, it was one of the
highlights of my career,

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:27.870
really, because at first--

00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:31.850
and Alinea was at the Eleven
Madison Park first.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:35.430
And they are some of our best
friends, and we have so much

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:36.200
respect for.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.670
But at the same time, we're
also competing with them.

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:46.270
And so the first day, we put
all of our resources fully

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:50.100
behind their team because
that was commitment.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.780
But then the first day when
everyone shows up, anyone who

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:57.880
is important of the guests, and
our team, and me, we're

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:00.380
putting everything behind
another restaurant to make

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.860
them look good.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:06.450
The first day that was kind of
a weird feeling, but then as

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:15.060
you went on, it made clear that
if you work together,

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:18.980
even at the restaurant we knew,
but even on a bigger

00:48:18.980 --> 00:48:22.910
scale, if you work together
you can do just

00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:24.630
more amazing things.

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:30.630
And at times, you have
to follow, and at

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:32.040
times you have to lead.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:36.360
And even if you get
to the very top, I

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.880
think that never changes.

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:41.890
I think to realize that
sometimes to follow can

00:48:41.890 --> 00:48:46.630
actually give you amazing
pleasure as well.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:47.020
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:47.720
Thank you.

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:48.970
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.720
And Monday morning is, I know
that's like the day when you

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.150
get to work and you need to jump
right into the week and

00:48:57.150 --> 00:49:00.150
work really hard, and I thank
you all for not doing that

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.670
this morning.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:03.620
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK:
We have one more

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:05.240
question before we wrap.

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:10.930
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to say
that whatever Danny Myers did,

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:15.210
I'm just so impressed what you
guys have done after--

00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:18.700
the fact that you're picking up
the mantle, passing on the

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:20.770
toque, whatever you
want to call it.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.750
I remember walking into
the restaurant.

00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:26.940
The hostess actually opened the
door for me, and that, to

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:29.470
me, that one gesture just blew
my mind, because it's

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.740
something that you really don't
see, because when you

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:33.450
walk into a restaurant,
you usually have to

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:35.070
open the door yourself.

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:36.960
So, that kind of already
set the tone for me

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.850
before I even sat down.

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:42.350
And again, from start to finish,
the amuse to petit

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:46.250
fours, the meal was one of the
best meals of my life.

00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:47.990
Top 10 easily.

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:49.160
It was that kind
of experience.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.440
I kind of just--

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:52.095
it's a game changer.

00:49:52.095 --> 00:49:56.590
It makes you reevaluate what a
restaurant can do in terms of

00:49:56.590 --> 00:50:00.640
setting up a different level
or just even setting up new

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.270
standards for every other
restaurant around York City

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.170
and across the country.

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.070
And I just want to applaud you
guys because it's really,

00:50:07.070 --> 00:50:07.820
really outstanding.

00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:08.360
WILL GUIDARA: Thank
you so much.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.622
AUDIENCE: So, two-part
question.

00:50:10.622 --> 00:50:13.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:19.240
AUDIENCE: So, what was it like
for you to understand that you

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:22.790
had to kind of pick up after
Kerry Heffernan?

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:26.280
And then also, for the front
of the house, a similar

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.070
related question.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:31.890
I wanted to see what was that
kind of crazy, ah-ha moment

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:36.520
where you decided you wanted to
actually take over EMP from

00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:39.720
Danny-- the Danny Meyers.

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.790
DANIEL HUMM: Well for me, I
never was concerned about

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:44.640
picking up from somebody.

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:49.310
I knew the vision we
had for the room.

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:53.610
I mean Eleven Madison it's one
of the most amazing dining

00:50:53.610 --> 00:50:57.380
rooms in the world, and it was
that when I got there.

00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.290
So that was my only concern.

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:02.370
And it took a long time.

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:06.870
I think what we do is
a endurance sport.

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.440
You can't just change
overnight.

00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:12.500
So, it took a lot of work.

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:17.320
We're now eight years into it,
and I still feel we have a lot

00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:19.130
of work to do.

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:25.530
But the one thing about Danny
Meyer is that he really was

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:32.740
there to support us and to
help us along the way.

00:51:32.740 --> 00:51:37.450
We all had the same vision, and
I think we all made a lot

00:51:37.450 --> 00:51:41.740
of sacrifice and pushed hard.

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:49.980
We really kept a course
altogether, and eventually,

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:54.570
dreams became reality.

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:58.900
WILL GUIDARA: I think when--

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:02.160
I mean I worked for Danny for a
long time, and when I would

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:04.290
go and do things like this, a
lot of the time people would

00:52:04.290 --> 00:52:06.770
ask what's it like working
for Danny Meyer.

00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:10.345
I think one of his greatest
strengths--

00:52:10.345 --> 00:52:13.760
the importance he places on
developing culture within

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.350
restaurants I think was

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:17.420
revolutionary and so inspiring.

00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:20.370
And we talk about Miles Davis
and those words and the

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:23.470
importance of language for
people to latch on to, such

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:25.780
that everyone's moving in a
consistent direction, that

00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:28.480
undeniably came from him.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.970
The other thing that he was
very, very good at was

00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:35.660
empowering people and giving
people autonomy and making it

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:38.970
everyone who led his different
restaurants feel an amazing

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:41.580
sense of ownership.

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:46.660
We felt like and operated like
owners for years before we

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:48.190
actually were owners.

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:53.610
And it was in a lot of very
comfortable conversations with

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:57.500
Danny where we were trying to
figure out what we wanted out

00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:00.160
of our lives and out of our
careers, because we do like to

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.170
think like that.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.180
That Danny is the one that
offered us to buy the

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:06.860
restaurant and it just
felt natural.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:10.620
And so it wasn't something that
we had to come around to.

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:14.800
The moment at which it was first
brought up, we already

00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:16.670
kind of knew.

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:18.620
DANIEL HUMM: Also what was
interesting, like a lot of

00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:22.470
people say, hey, how does it
feel to be an owner now?

00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:27.640
And to be really honest, it's
not that much different.

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:34.340
Because, I think, because we
cared so much before, it was

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:36.760
our restaurant before
all along.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:42.225
The first day we stepped foot
into the door, it was our

00:53:42.225 --> 00:53:43.670
restaurant in our mind.

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:48.360
And I think that's why it
was never really a big

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.070
adjustment for us.

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:51.450
WILL GUIDARA: Yeah.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:53.210
I mean and that's the culture.

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:56.360
And I think if you look at Kevin
Mahan or Mike Anthony at

00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:59.060
Gramercy tavern, that's
their restaurant.

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.390
And you can kind of go through
the different restaurants in

00:54:01.390 --> 00:54:05.020
his company, and the way he
manages to accomplish that is

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:07.390
pretty inspiring.

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:09.250
JACQUELINE WASILCZYK: Thank you
for all of your questions.

00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:11.280
And both of you, thank you
so much for coming and

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.420
being here at Google.

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:12.920
WILL GUIDARA: Thank
you guys for that.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:13.510
DANIEL HUMM: Thank you.

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:17.667
[APPLAUSE]
