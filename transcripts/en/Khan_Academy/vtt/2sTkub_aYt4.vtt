00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.310
SPEAKER 1: We continue our
Education in America series

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.640
this morning with one man
who is turning the learning

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.280
process upside down.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.520
SPEAKER 2: His series
of really simple videos

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.800
is being called revolutionary,
as CBS News correspondent John

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.810
Blackstone reports.

00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:18.410
JOHN BLACKSTONE:
It would be music

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.980
to the ears of any educator,
what 10-year-old Megan

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.330
Tsern has to say about
her favorite teacher.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.520
MEGAN TSERN: He makes
math really easy

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.317
in a really kind of
conversational way.

00:00:30.317 --> 00:00:32.150
SALMAN KHAN: It would
be on the number line.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.810
JOHN BLACKSTONE:
He is Salman Khan.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.600
SALMAN KHAN: It's negative $7.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.784
It's like saying that I owe $7.

00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:39.200
JOHN BLACKSTONE:
Khan is the voice

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.030
and the brains behind
the Khan Academy,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.770
the free educational
website that some believe

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.735
is leading a
revolution in teaching.

00:00:46.735 --> 00:00:48.110
SALMAN KHAN:
There's no nonsense.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.310
There's no defocusing
on the material.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.720
It really is what it is.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.804
JOHN BLACKSTONE: Khan's lessons
are unscripted and unadorned.

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.220
SALMAN KHAN: Let's divide both
sides of this equation by--

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.230
JOHN BLACKSTONE: His
voice over a black screen

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.520
as he writes or doodles.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.620
His style has changed little
since this all began back

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.270
in 2004 as YouTube videos
to help his young cousins.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.814
SALMAN KHAN: 9 times the 6.

00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:12.230
JOHN BLACKSTONE:
He's now recorded

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.940
more than 2,400
lessons on everything

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.960
from simple arithmetic
to college-level biology.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.614
Anyone can watch for free.

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:22.780
SALMAN KHAN: People are
more likely to say thank you

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.630
when it's free.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.290
And you know, thank
you is worth a lot.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.560
JOHN BLACKSTONE: But what
are Khan's lessons worth?

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.840
The Los Altos School District
is trying to figure that out.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.470
Last year, the district used
Khan's lessons in five classes.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.570
The students did well enough
that this year the Khan method

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.200
is in 40 classes, to be used
by every fifth and sixth grader

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.130
in the district.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.816
ALYSSA GALLAGHER: We found
that our students are really

00:01:48.816 --> 00:01:50.190
engaged in this
type of learning,

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.874
that it was a great addition
to what we were already doing.

00:01:52.874 --> 00:01:54.790
JOHN BLACKSTONE: You
might say this California

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.880
School has flipped.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.600
Students get their
lectures at home

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.780
and come to school
to do their homework,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.407
fundamentally changing
the role of the teacher.

00:02:02.407 --> 00:02:04.490
COURTNEY CADWELL: The kids
can really move through

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.533
at their own pace, and then
I can see who's struggling.

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:08.949
JOHN BLACKSTONE:
At home, students

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.009
listen to Khan's online lessons.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.290
In the classroom,
they practice what

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.100
they learned while teacher
Courtney Cadwell works

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.142
with those who need help.

00:02:17.142 --> 00:02:18.849
COURTNEY CADWELL: When
they're having fun

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.490
and they're wanting
to do math, that

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.431
tells me that this
is a good thing.

00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.180
JOHN BLACKSTONE: This
educational overhaul

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.310
comes from a man who was
working as a hedge fund analyst

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.220
until 2009.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.150
Khan has a Harvard MBA and
three degrees from MIT.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.550
You're kind of a math
geek, I guess, are you?

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.570
SALMAN KHAN: Yes, in the
best form of the word.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.986
JOHN BLACKSTONE:
In the beginning,

00:02:39.986 --> 00:02:42.930
he financed the Khan Academy
from his own savings,

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.599
until he was discovered
by some people with money.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.890
BILL GATES: Well, it's amazing.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.500
I think you've
just got a glimpse

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.300
of the future of education.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.890
Thank you.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.140
JOHN BLACKSTONE: The Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.135
and Google are among
the big donors that

00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:59.320
have allowed the Khan Academy
to add nearly a dozen software

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.640
engineers.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.980
MEGAN TSERN: It's really
smartly done on the computer,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.880
and I love being
on the computer.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.440
JOHN BLACKSTONE: With more
than two million users a month,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.410
many others seem to love
Khan's lessons, too.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.930
SALMAN KHAN: I've already
taught 70 million lessons.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.520
JOHN BLACKSTONE: And he will be
happy to teach millions more.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.549
SALMAN KHAN: Smallest
to the largest.

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.340
JOHN BLACKSTONE: John
Blackstone, CBS News.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.925
Mountain View, California.
