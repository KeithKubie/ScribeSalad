00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.020
The sections I outlined above
are things that everyone should include

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.280
in their resume.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.860
But what about those of you who
are making a career change or

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.630
are new to the field or
want to make your personality shine.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.830
If you are making a career change for
example,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.605
we recommend that you include a summary
statement below your heading section.

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:17.015
What is a summary statement?

00:00:17.015 --> 00:00:21.325
It is a two to three sentence statement
that functions as resume elevator pitch.

00:00:21.325 --> 00:00:24.155
It helps to frame your professional
resume, speaks to your passions,

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:26.075
strengths, and current career.

00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:27.725
If this sounds like your background,

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:30.365
draft a summary statement
in your master resume.

00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:33.430
You can customize this later
in your one page resume.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.580
New to the field and
have limited experience.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.150
Be sure to include all the projects and
course work you've completed at Udacity.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.880
Even if you didn't do this at a job,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.500
these examples will provide
evidence of your work.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.470
Finally, want to show your personality?

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.680
If you feel like your resume
is lacking in interest and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.010
you have ample space, include
information about any achievements,

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.760
activities, organizations,
and relevant hobbies.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.710
This helps humanize your resume, and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.260
depending on the company you're applying
to, can convey your culture fit.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.750
Before moving on to the next step,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.900
fill out this section in your
master resume spreadsheet.
