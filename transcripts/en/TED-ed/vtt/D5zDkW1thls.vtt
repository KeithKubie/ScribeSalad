00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.976
(Music)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.976
Esteemed members of the jury,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.976
I submit the following words
for immediate and violent execution

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.976
and extraction from our vocabularies,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.239
to be locked away forever,
if you would prefer.

00:00:24.263 --> 00:00:27.976
These words I present to you
are "good" and "bad."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.976
These words have served
as treacherous liars

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.976
for eternity.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.976
These two words have worked in tandem

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.976
to produce vague and bland sentences that have
crippled the creativity of humanity.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.976
These two deceptively tiny words

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.976
stifle real description
and honest communication.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.976
Look at them, just sitting
there on this page,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.976
all smug and satisfied with their work.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.976
How dare they?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.976
You serve no purpose in our world,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.096
and we must rid ourselves
of your influence.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.976
We must replace these
two words with the truth,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.976
with phrases that include
adequate and sincere adjectives.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.976
I'll offer you "radiant," "stupefying,"
"awful," "gut-wrenching."

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.976
These choices create clarity and depth.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.976
"Good" and "bad"
only provide gray vagueness.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.976
We must demand color!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.239
We should even use winding similes
and metaphors, where appropriate.

00:01:17.263 --> 00:01:20.976
We have to do whatever we can and should
to make our real sentiments known.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.976
"Good" and "bad" will no
longer be our go-to words

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.976
that we rely on when we are too afraid
or too languid to express our real thoughts.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.976
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I implore
you to deliver a verdict of guilty

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.096
and send these words
to their rightful fate.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.976
Now imagine a world
without these two words.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.976
Imagine a world where real
description is required,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.976
digging further into our vocabulary

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.976
than just a monosyllabic effort
to get away with not being honest,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.976
impactful, creative.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.976
How does my hair look?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.976
Good. What is that?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.976
A dull attempt not to be honest?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.239
Perhaps my hair looks like a hideous
mess of tangles and bald spots.

00:02:03.263 --> 00:02:06.976
Yet someone does not want to be honest,
and offers the quick fix "good,"

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.976
to try and mask the truth

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.477
and send me hurling into the evening
with a plop of disorganized tresses.

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:12.976
This will not do.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.976
Perhaps my hair looks
like an amazing glossy sculpture

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.976
that frames my face perfectly,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.976
and lends an air of magic to the night.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.976
Well, "good" just doesn't cut it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.976
I won't take any more of this
formless, lifeless description.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.976
I will not take these lies,
and neither should you.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.976
A doctor asks you how you feel.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.976
"I feel bad."

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.976
Heresy!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.976
The doctor, based on this paltry report,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.976
could conclude that you have brain
cancer or the flu or rabies.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.096
You owe it to yourself and the possible
misdiagnosis of your life

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.096
to be honest about exactly how you feel.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.976
"I feel like a herd of wombats
has taken up in my chest."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.976
A-ha! There we have it.
An accurate description.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.976
Now the doctor has some real evidence
to work with in order to assist you.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.976
We have become addicted to the numbness
that "good" and "bad" have created.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.976
We have become linguistic slobs,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.976
churning out "good" and "bad"

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.762
wherever we are too lazy to allow
our minds to communicate

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:08.976
with creativity and specification.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.976
You look good, you sound
bad, this tastes good,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.976
the weather looks bad.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.976
Lie after lie,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.976
repeating this verbal
gray, this sloshy mush,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.976
this fuzzy picture
that reflects no real truth.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.976
Replace them with grittier, exact terms

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.976
that have been buried in our Lexis,
waiting to see daylight.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.976
No longer does the weather
look good or bad,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.976
the weather looks ominous or exhilarating.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.976
Nothing tastes good or bad.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.976
It tastes like pillows of sparkles

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.976
or old shoe and dung.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.976
No more of sounding good or bad.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.976
You sound like lilting baby laughter

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.976
or ogres marching to war.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.976
Dear God, you do not look good or bad.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.976
You look like a feathery
angel or a morose faun.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.976
Today, you look at these two words,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.976
"good" and "bad,"

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.976
examine them closely.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.976
Because behind their seemingly
unassuming visages

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.976
reside two deceitful offerings
that smother the truth.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.976
These words are liars.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.976
These words must be stopped.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.976
Remove them from our language so that honesty
can return to our communication.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.976
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.238
if I say to you that you
have been a good jury,

00:04:17.262 --> 00:04:20.976
you will take the compliment, make
your decision and go on about your day.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.976
But if I say to you that you
are an honorable jury,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.976
and that I hope
your unshakeable determination

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.976
to better the vocabulary of humanity

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.239
will result in finding
"good" and "bad" guilty,

00:04:31.263 --> 00:04:33.976
you will recognize
the ingenuity of this argument

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.976
and find "good" and "bad" guilty.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
