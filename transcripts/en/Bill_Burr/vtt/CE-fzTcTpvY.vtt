11
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:41.360
It's actually a Sunday when I'm recording this. When I'm recording this,

12
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:43.720
it's Sunday. And, uh, I got the fucking

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.820
<v 2>juices flowing. Bay</v>

14
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.640
<v 1>juices are flowing,</v>

15
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.460
blood is flying through my system right now. Heart rate is fucking wonderful.

16
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.163
You know why?

17
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.450
Because I worked out the last two fucking days in a row in my brand new Jura.

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.833
Raj, fuck it.

19
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.163
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.460
<v 1>Whoa. My New fucking gym. It's finally done. I went back and I picked up my,</v>

21
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.860
uh, my truck. You know,

22
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.540
my old fucking Ford truck that I had a in storage while they finished it.

23
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:19.640
They did a phenomenal fucking job.

24
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.560
I outfitted the whole thing with a bunch of rogue fitness shit and um,

25
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.310
I never fucking show you my house. I might have to make a video.

26
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.220
I might have to show is a little fucker. Jim's a little cute. Jim,

27
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.290
I'll give you a little before and after, you know,

28
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.450
I might even wear my leg warmers for you.

29
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.020
I'll give you a quick fucking two second tour of the God damn thing.

30
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.030
I got my atomic holds up top and uh, I got to tell you all freckles,

31
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.800
old freckles lost a lot. A lot of what little he had. Holy Shit.

32
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.610
I went onto the pegboard. I, I felt like, you know, the,

33
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.520
for young first time you ever tried to do a pull up in your life, it's like,

34
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.850
it's almost like you were born without those muscles because you never use them.

35
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.540
You know what I mean? It's not like you go, oh, what's on top of the fridge?

36
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.630
You know, what do you do? You jump up and down, usually caps.

37
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.160
You don't grab the top of it and fucking pull yourself up.

38
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.580
Little stupid feet squeaking on the front of the fucking wait,

39
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.130
wait did you try to go up? Which is cheating by the way.

40
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.190
And if you ever made a video of it and you put it on Youtube,

41
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:20.450
I'm sure there would be hundreds of thousands of comments saying that it was an

42
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:25.280
epic fail refrigerator pull up. Cause people like when you fail,

43
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.970
you know why? Cause they don't like themselves. Um,

44
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.620
anyways, so it's done. And uh,

45
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.910
I'm so fucking psyched of course is a few, what little doodads we gotta do.

46
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.640
Nia wants an elliptical in there, you know,

47
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.650
which is fucking hilarious to me because she could give a rats fucking ass about

48
00:02:45.651 --> 00:02:49.520
this gym and still until it started coming together and now she loves it,

49
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.510
you know?

50
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.680
But what's great is it's the garage and everybody knows that the woman,

51
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.950
the wife, the fucking the fucking lady over there,

52
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:02.530
everybody knows that they get the house but the guy gets the garage and see the

53
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.680
women think that they win cause they got the fucking house. Right.

54
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:09.520
You don't want the house. The House is where all the responsibilities,

55
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.580
the house is, where the bills come to the houses,

56
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.880
where the fucking people knock on the door and the cops come,

57
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:20.380
they go to the fucking house. Nobody, nobody goes to the garage.

58
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.480
The garage is fucking, its, it's genius. You know,

59
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.010
you act like it's a shit hole, blah.

60
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:28.690
And we'd go out to the garage and they're like, yeah, yeah.

61
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.280
Get out of the house. They don't give a fuck.

62
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.730
You go into the garage and that's it. Yeah. Just get no fucking idea.

63
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.140
You wait till I, I get one of those little fucking kegerators out there.

64
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.540
We're doing keg stands as I do curls, right.

65
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.350
Taking in calories as I burned them off at the same time while getting shit

66
00:03:44.351 --> 00:03:47.680
faced. It's this new exercise video that I'm going to be putting out,

67
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.750
you know, I don't know what I would call it to get what you need. Alliteration,

68
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.660
right. Drunk dips or some shit like that. Right. Just to get people to buy it.

69
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.180
Alcoholic aerobics as too wordy too now. Too Wordy, too, too syllable. Lee,

70
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.090
I don't know. Whatever. I'll brainstorm on it. You know,

71
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.230
all you gotta do is just have a fucking headband on and people will buy the

72
00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:13.510
video. If you promise them you're going to help him out, right?

73
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.280
You have a fucking headband on,

74
00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.950
they spray a little fake sweat on you and then you know,

75
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.050
all you're going to get is a couple of hotties behind.

76
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.480
You're just smiling and shit, right?

77
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.430
The very least somebody can jerk off to it, right?

78
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.600
The next thing you know, they start flying off the fucking shelves.

79
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.100
And then what do you do yet? You're add onto the garage. Add on the garage.

80
00:04:36.101 --> 00:04:41.101
I've told you guys forever my dream fucking house and my dream house.

81
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.480
I don't even know what the house looks like.

82
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.430
I just know what the garage looks like.

83
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.180
The garage don't you see as my dad loved to say the garage don't you see would

84
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:58.270
be a three car garage, right? One for me,

85
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.050
one for her and the other for whatever. My old fucking truck. All right.

86
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.380
And then upstairs they all, they'd be an upstairs,

87
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.270
the upstairs,

88
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.870
whatever gym and have a drum room and a fucking cigar bar slash fucking sports

89
00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:17.440
bar. That's what it would be. Okay.

90
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.930
One door in, one door out,

91
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.810
maybe a fucking little ladder to go up onto the roof to buy you.

92
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.290
Right. And that's, I think if every fucking guy had that,

93
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:30.190
there's no fucking way.

94
00:05:30.191 --> 00:05:33.790
You couldn't be a happily married man because you just could be in the house.

95
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.290
You got your kids running around. Everybody's freaking the fuck out. You know,

96
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.130
I need a break. I want to be fucking single, you know,

97
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.620
without the whois.

98
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.690
I just want to fucking just sit a drink without you fucking people in my car.

99
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.830
What's left of my hair. That's where the upstairs come sit.

100
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.450
And then you just go up there.

101
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.560
You have a great time while you slowly kill yourself, you know?

102
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.850
And then with every cigar you smoke and every drink you have and you know that

103
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:07.520
you're one close, one step closer to death,

104
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.300
which is a great thing because it's a release, you know?

105
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.200
I don't know. It started off happy. It got a little dark there towards the end.

106
00:06:15.201 --> 00:06:17.960
You wouldn't know that I'm a happily married man, uh, by saying all that stuff,

107
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:22.910
but I also am by nature, I am a fucking loner. And,

108
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:27.020
uh, you know, I, I just, you know,

109
00:06:27.021 --> 00:06:31.040
I just need to get away from people every once in awhile and I'm a do,

110
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:35.030
that would be the fucking Shit, you know, I have a couple of cool fucking dogs.

111
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.150
Those dogs that fucking lay around and like the howl, you know,

112
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:42.410
like a fucking bloodhound, right. Just sit there watching the game,

113
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:45.560
getting hammered, you know, soundproof walls. You can't hear your family,

114
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.700
you just sitting in there every once in a while you look over your,

115
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.110
your fucking bloodhound. A rusty, rusty woo.

116
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.720
The die would join with you. Yeah. Yeah. You fucking get it.

117
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.850
You fucking get it. Right.

118
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.830
I hope you enjoyed that because that fantasy, that man, I,

119
00:07:06.831 --> 00:07:10.250
that's it right there. You know, I don't know what it is.

120
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:13.070
Some people want the White House, some people want a fucking Oscar.

121
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.930
And then some people just want,

122
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.650
would like to be able to get a Tan and have a two story fucking garage that said

123
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.490
, you know, I'm, I'm in part of that third group, part of the third group,

124
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:27.470
everybody. So anyways, um, I fucking went down there, um,

125
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:31.550
used all that rogue fitness shit that I bought and like I said, you know,

126
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.710
these guys are not paying me or anything like that.

127
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:35.630
They actually sent me those colorful weights.

128
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:39.650
Now I don't know what the fuck to do with them cause I have more weight than I

129
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:44.210
need. So I got some standup shows coming up in the La area.

130
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.540
If you're building a fucking gym, you know,

131
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.510
and um, oh, how do I go?

132
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.850
How do I make this a fair contest? I don't fucking know.

133
00:07:56.470 --> 00:08:00.140
If you build in a gym and you listen to the podcast and you want some colorful

134
00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.690
plates, some weights, uh,

135
00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.960
I got them cause I was gonna take it over to play it again.

136
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.960
Sam's have played against sports, whatever the fuck they are,

137
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:11.270
but they just so God damn and Celtic, you know what I mean?

138
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:16.370
If you think that baldheaded comment on the, uh, the pawn shop show,

139
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:20.270
how we just fucking, you go in there and go, man, you got a bar,

140
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:24.920
a gold and the guys, they gay. You know how much you want for this? You're like,

141
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.860
well, the market value is fucking whatever, you know,

142
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.060
fucking $1,200 an ounce. Why don't you give me a,

143
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.070
give me a thousand amounts? And he's like,

144
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.840
so what you really want for it? But I, I on a fucking smash it over.

145
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.920
You've got fuck yourself.

146
00:08:39.921 --> 00:08:44.921
Like what a fucking business people coming in selling their old fucking hair

147
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.580
dryers. You know their ass out, right?

148
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:49.490
And you've got to fucking take as much out of their crack as you can. I get it.

149
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:51.920
You know what? It's a business. I'm going to hard on that guy. God bless him.

150
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.730
God bless. Alright, so play it again. Sports is the same fucking way.

151
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.550
You'll come in with something with the price tag still on it now. God, yeah,

152
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:02.670
I'll give you like a dollar 50. You know what I mean? It's just like, I mean,

153
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:05.860
they make Richard Rollins look like a saint. Okay.

154
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.700
These fucking guys bust you down so bad. It's like whatever you're selling them.

155
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.070
It's like, how about I give it to you for free,

156
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:17.040
but I get to hit you over the head with it first. How about that?

157
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:18.270
Don't get me any fucking money.

158
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.380
I want to just mush it right in your fucking enough. I'm not doing that.

159
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.960
So I would rather give it to a podcast listener for free,

160
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:27.560
but I'm not shipping these fucking, yeah, thanks. Gets like a,

161
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.360
I don't know what it is. I think it's two 45 pound plates.

162
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.470
Two 30 fives. I don't know what it is.

163
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.950
They fucking big and they're heavy. That's all I know. Um,

164
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.510
whenever they're free free weights. So anyways, um,

165
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.030
went down there yesterday I did fucking chest and try today I did the, uh,

166
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.180
upper body stuff, all the body weight shit. Nia wanted this speed bag,

167
00:09:53.181 --> 00:09:55.580
which I thought was a little fucking stupid. You know what I mean?

168
00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.970
I always hated the speed bag unless you really train for a fight,

169
00:09:58.971 --> 00:10:02.960
you know what I mean? [inaudible] to two, then you go to your fucking cubicle.

170
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.630
It always seems silly.

171
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.780
It just seemed fucking disrespectful to people actually fight for a fucking

172
00:10:11.751 --> 00:10:12.501
living. Like the,

173
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:16.280
the level of respect that I have for people that do that for a fucking living.

174
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.020
Just the, the, the fucking courage it takes to do that. Um,

175
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.830
but of course now it's up there and I'm down there what it did

176
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.390
[inaudible] but what it did, data dump. Oh good.

177
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.540
Did that fuck data data that denim [inaudible] now of course,

178
00:10:32.541 --> 00:10:34.310
now I'm going to get fucking obsessed with that shit.

179
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.570
I don't know when it's going to do for me.

180
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:40.670
I'm hoping it's going to bring my freckles out, you know? Um, anyway,

181
00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:45.090
speaking of fights, did anybody watch UFC your up tree by day?

182
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.720
Not In the red corner. Did anybody see the UFC one 68, eight, eight, eight?

183
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.540
Um, it was basically, I think the USA or the world versus Brazil.

184
00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.190
And I think Brazil once again proved that they are raw. You know,

185
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.440
if you want to fucking get into a fight slash be in the missionary position with

186
00:11:05.441 --> 00:11:09.790
another person, if you think you're coming out on top of ain't happening,

187
00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:13.270
they pretty much, they pretty much dominated the fucking night. But, uh,

188
00:11:13.271 --> 00:11:14.140
except for this one guy,

189
00:11:14.141 --> 00:11:16.960
and I'm not gonna know the names and actually tweeted the guy,

190
00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:19.330
I'm still not gonna remember his name. He has a very fucking,

191
00:11:19.331 --> 00:11:22.740
a unique name and it was fucking,

192
00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:26.560
he fighting this guy and this guy's making all these silly faces when he's going

193
00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.480
and they're going like the Brazilian dude,

194
00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.170
I guess he was a champion or he is a champion. That's right. He's a champion.

195
00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.100
And then he fucking a that Jesus Christ.

196
00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:40.120
I was having a few when I was watching this, he fucking, he was fucking,

197
00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:42.640
he was a champion and he was supposed to fight. He got hurt.

198
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.490
So we wanted to make sure he's 100% so he's coming down,

199
00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:47.290
he's making all these silly faces and shit.

200
00:11:47.291 --> 00:11:49.750
And I just remember the announcers going like, look, and I was like,

201
00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:54.010
the biggest fight he's had in three years and he's making faces at the camera.

202
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.080
It's not even nervous. Right. All of this shit.

203
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.390
And then he comes to fucking white dude. He fucking, you know, old Dudley do,

204
00:12:01.391 --> 00:12:02.640
right? He's got a police officer.

205
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.670
His hair cut you like this guy could have been a state trooper and he's fucking

206
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:07.990
coming down. And I'm like, all right,

207
00:12:07.991 --> 00:12:09.910
well let's see what's going to go on here at the,

208
00:12:09.911 --> 00:12:13.820
a white dude seems to be in a little better shape. The Brazilian guy,

209
00:12:13.821 --> 00:12:16.750
surprisingly for a champion as a little bit of a dad bought,

210
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.760
you know what I mean? And a whatever. They start going at it and uh,

211
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:25.660
you know, white boys taken it a little bit, he's given it back, he's taken it,

212
00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:26.494
whatever.

213
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.850
Then all of a sudden the Brazilian guy starts just running at him and he fucking

214
00:12:30.851 --> 00:12:33.950
each one and he get in any regroups. He starts running man again.

215
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:38.230
And this fucking guy, the white too. What the fucking state trooper haircut.

216
00:12:38.231 --> 00:12:40.570
He's backing up and as he's backing up,

217
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:43.870
it gives them just a little fucking little right there, Fred,

218
00:12:43.871 --> 00:12:46.120
with the fucking a right hook, right? Well,

219
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.440
backing up and this fucking guy just, he just shut up. This guy's hard drive.

220
00:12:50.441 --> 00:12:51.970
He just fucking pip and that guy,

221
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.540
let's just write down like a controlled implosion. You know,

222
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.260
when they take down a fucking building and everybody for some reason can take

223
00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:02.770
off work to go down and watch it, you know, that's what they wasted sick day on.

224
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.320
Like, Hey, is any way I can breathe in that fucking a,

225
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.190
what do they call that shit? Not as fault. Oh Christ,

226
00:13:09.191 --> 00:13:12.820
what the fuck do you call that shit? It's best dose, right?

227
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.180
They can breathe it in anyways, he fucking just hit the guy.

228
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:19.840
I keep just caught him the right way. I mean, granted, if he hit me with that,

229
00:13:19.841 --> 00:13:24.130
I mean I would've been dead. There'd be no podcast ever again, you know? Um,

230
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.060
but he just caught the guy, I guess. Right?

231
00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:27.970
And the guy just went right there like a ton of bricks.

232
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:32.710
He fucking went down and the fucking white dude just lost it. You know,

233
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.760
he just fucking,

234
00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.060
he runs over to his corner claims those are going to get on the fence.

235
00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:40.630
He went right up and over, hugged his whole team and just kept screaming.

236
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.550
I'm a fucking world champion. It was awesome.

237
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.660
Oh, sorry. Just blew out yours. It was fucking awesome. I get this too.

238
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.280
I think it's blue on my fucking ears.

239
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.750
It was just fun to see somebody like dad excited. And uh,

240
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:58.990
then of course they said that he was from Cleveland. So I tweeted out,

241
00:13:58.991 --> 00:14:02.770
Cleveland finally won a champion championship and a,

242
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:05.710
that's why I think that's what I tweeted out or something like that. But um,

243
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.620
congratulations to that guy who I can't put, I don't,

244
00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.680
I'm not gonna butcher his fucking name. Um,

245
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.110
it was awesome to see him win a championship.

246
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.500
It's great for the city of Cleveland. Right.

247
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.940
And even though it wasn't a team sport, you know, if you're in Cleveland,

248
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:24.370
you gotta be, you know, when you won't be thinking this. Cause you guys,

249
00:14:24.371 --> 00:14:25.810
you know, you've been beaten,

250
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.310
you've been beaten down by this sports gods for so long that you guys really,

251
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.230
uh, you're afraid of having hope.

252
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:37.740
But I remember reading about Christopher Columbus when he came over to the,

253
00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:41.350
the, the Americas, which he thought was, I don't know, India.

254
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.880
I don't know what the fuck he thought. Um, before he got to land,

255
00:14:45.881 --> 00:14:49.420
there was a couple of branches before he got the land and he started either,

256
00:14:49.421 --> 00:14:50.254
you know,

257
00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.990
being nice people or chopping off people's hands because they wouldn't give them

258
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:58.730
their gold fillings. Uh, depending on what movie you believe, you know,

259
00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:01.250
I always love that new studies find, it's like, what,

260
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:03.350
where the fuck was this information? Was it,

261
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.490
was it on a cocktail Napkin and somebody finally looked at it? Huh?

262
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.900
Did you find one of those scrolls? Was it written by somebody? Hey, by the way,

263
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.190
this is what really happened.

264
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.600
And somebody just kept it for years and they just let the lie go and go and go.

265
00:15:17.601 --> 00:15:21.920
And then, or maybe maybe the people that survived what he did,

266
00:15:22.370 --> 00:15:25.190
they had this shit written down. I don't know.

267
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.850
I think I'm fucking way off track here. Where the hell am I? Oh yes. So anyways,

268
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:33.800
he's either way before he fucking got to land any that was a halfway decent guy

269
00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:37.490
or an absolute fucking war criminal, depending on what you belief.

270
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.020
Either wait till you get the day off. You know,

271
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.310
sometimes people got to die to get a fucking day off. You know,

272
00:15:43.311 --> 00:15:46.490
when you really think about it. Um, anyways,

273
00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.140
the fuck was I talking about? Yeah. You see some fucking branches and shit.

274
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:56.120
So there you go. But guy from Cleveland is a champion. All right.

275
00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.520
It starts with wants to now. You gotta be looking at the Cavaliers.

276
00:15:58.521 --> 00:16:00.530
I don't think they've lost yet. You know, it's funny.

277
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:04.970
Everybody in Cleveland right now is going, shit. All right, I'll shut up.

278
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:10.910
Just say it. Um, that's another weird city.

279
00:16:10.911 --> 00:16:14.390
Part of me wants Cleveland to win,

280
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.370
but there's just such a hilarious misery to the Cleveland Sports Fan.

281
00:16:19.371 --> 00:16:20.900
I almost want to see it keep going.

282
00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:26.750
So I guess I'm going to be happy either way. I was really surprised at okay.

283
00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:31.840
See beat, uh, beat the Spurs. Um, considering I never watched,

284
00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.610
but I just watched the Celtics, but I was hoping that, um,

285
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:39.680
I was hoping that uh, Tim Dunkin was going to get his sixth ring, you know,

286
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.800
just so I'd have yet another thing to say to fucking lake offense when they

287
00:16:42.801 --> 00:16:47.030
bring up Koby Bryant. Well, another guy during Kobe's time, he wants six.

288
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.530
He was a team player. That one, he really blew the ball.

289
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.280
Everybody involved, uh,

290
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.210
didn't need fucking 90 million free agents to come in and help 'em out every

291
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:05.960
fucking year. All right, sorry. Anyway, so let's plow ahead here. Um,

292
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.450
what am I talking about here? So, yeah, so congratulations. And um,

293
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.600
I was disappointed with the Cyborg fight. You know what I mean?

294
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.530
I would sit in there going like, yeah, I know. I want to see this shit fight.

295
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.230
I want to see that, you know, and you know,

296
00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.200
I gotta tell you the women's fights are usually better than the men's.

297
00:17:24.201 --> 00:17:27.140
I don't know why they go on it like they go on at like fucking alley cats.

298
00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.700
It's crazy. Um, I just don't understand how they can just,

299
00:17:31.701 --> 00:17:35.990
how you can just kick somebody in with the bare foot and it doesn't hurt you to,

300
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.670
you know,

301
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.990
they should fucking have just regular people like me just go in and do MMA shit

302
00:17:41.991 --> 00:17:46.220
to each other and just watch this both crumble after the first strike punch once

303
00:17:46.221 --> 00:17:50.840
with your hand at fuck, you know, you put in under your armpit. Um, anyways,

304
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.380
but she fought some chicks. She was like eight, six, and one. So I'm like,

305
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:57.440
what the fuck? She's going to destroy it.

306
00:17:57.441 --> 00:18:02.040
This is going to be over in the first round. And then Lo and behold, Jesus,

307
00:18:02.041 --> 00:18:05.190
she fucking hits hard. She fucking,

308
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.360
which is rain and punches. And the other woman was, was, you know, still pulls,

309
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:10.701
getting hurt,

310
00:18:10.701 --> 00:18:13.500
was doing way better than I would have one jab and I would've been on my back.

311
00:18:13.501 --> 00:18:16.680
But she was fucking eating them for well for a minute. And then she went down.

312
00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.350
And then there was a moment when she was always moving,

313
00:18:19.351 --> 00:18:23.340
but it looked like she was out and the guy stopped the fight. Right.

314
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.340
Which he should I think was right to stop the fight.

315
00:18:26.341 --> 00:18:29.970
So in the end when they have the official decision,

316
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.650
they cut to her right. And now, and everybody cheers. She's Brazilian.

317
00:18:34.651 --> 00:18:38.520
It's a hometown crowd. And when they cut to the other,

318
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:43.470
the woman who lost sheets, like holding back tears and she's just looking up,

319
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.370
this is why I love this fighter forever. She was just looking up at the fucking,

320
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.280
the diamond vision thing, whatever, the big screen. And she waited, she,

321
00:18:52.281 --> 00:18:55.020
she was on the scoreboard and the second she was on the scoreboard,

322
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:55.854
she just goes,

323
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:59.210
<v 3>they were fucking tax. They were fucking tapped.</v>

324
00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:00.840
<v 1>And the whole place Buddha [inaudible]</v>

325
00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.510
she was so fucking mad. Um,

326
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.030
which is understandable.

327
00:19:10.031 --> 00:19:13.960
I mean I can't imagine trained in that fucking long and that God damn hard and

328
00:19:13.961 --> 00:19:18.160
then it's just over in like three minutes. Um, it must have been brutal. But,

329
00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.490
um, I dunno. She was great. She was all hard.

330
00:19:21.491 --> 00:19:23.260
So hopefully she'll come back or whatever. I don't know.

331
00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:27.730
I was really into that last one and I, that Cleveland Guy was hilarious. He was,

332
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:30.730
he was talking to me. He was like, you know, and I know everybody here,

333
00:19:30.731 --> 00:19:35.140
you don't like me cause we're in Brazil, but you guys make the sport great.

334
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.330
You called them out on it. You know,

335
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:40.270
you're not voting for me cause I'm a fucking

336
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:45.070
cause I'm from Cleveland. He should've been. But I'm from Cleveland.

337
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.030
I'm used to this. Um, anyways,

338
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:54.820
let's see here. I don't know if I have any advertising here. Um,

339
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.900
hang on one second. In the meantime, I'll tell you a quick story.

340
00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:02.500
You guys are all well aware that the, uh, the juniors prince died.

341
00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:06.220
Did you guys see that? Did you get that in your papers? So anyways,

342
00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:11.110
out here in Beverly Hills, they're having an auction on one of his guitars.

343
00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:12.950
See Yellow one that he did.

344
00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.210
[inaudible] how many fucking times I've got to type in my fucking password.

345
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:20.400
Come on. Uh,

346
00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:23.620
maybe cause I can't fucking remember it. Like that fucked it up again.

347
00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.810
Third Time to children, Eh,

348
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.490
and have to hum what it is or I fuck it up.

349
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.660
Can you imagine being this dumb and actually fucking having your own gym?

350
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.390
It's kind of dangerous, isn't it? Alright. So e m

351
00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.010
they're auctioning off one of his guitars. It was the one that he used with the,

352
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.860
the new power generation, the cream album, I believe.

353
00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.580
And somebody bought it a few ago. I can't believe it was even for sale,

354
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:52.600
but some guitar collector admittedly doesn't play and we just collect some,

355
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.490
he paid 30 grand for this fucking thing. So he says,

356
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.690
I should read this word for fucking word. This is so fucking priceless.

357
00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:08.180
And he says like, the reason why he's selling it is because,

358
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:12.230
you know, it's become, you know, with the passing of prince,

359
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.920
it's become so valuable. Um,

360
00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:21.080
daddy's actually nervous to have it. He's nervous to own the fucking thing.

361
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.190
Right. Which is, fuck it. It's, it's like, dude,

362
00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:30.080
why don't you just say, you know what, the guy fucking just died.

363
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.970
Everybody's paying attention. This is a great time to sell this fucking guitar.

364
00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.890
I'm trying to make money off of this guy's death. Um,

365
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.990
why can't you just say that? You know, I hear it. Is Prince's guitar.

366
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.270
All right. I got to read with this guy. Said it's just the way they, well,

367
00:21:49.271 --> 00:21:52.990
there's nothing wrong with it. You want to make a buck just, you know,

368
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:57.420
the guy died and I'm trying to make fucking money off of it. All right. Um, but,

369
00:21:57.421 --> 00:22:01.090
but bubba yellow car case goes,

370
00:22:01.091 --> 00:22:04.990
I've been a prince fan since I was a little kid and that guitar always stuck out

371
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:08.740
to me because it was super cool and stylish. Said the current owner,

372
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:12.520
he paid about 30 grand for it. He said, unfortunately, as morbid as it is,

373
00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:15.070
when people pass, their items become more valuable.

374
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.850
I think something as valuable as this could be too risky to continue to have in

375
00:22:18.851 --> 00:22:23.380
my possession. He's worried about his safety. Get the fuck Outta here, man.

376
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:25.450
You're trying to make some money trying to make, give me,

377
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.770
you're trying to make some money. That's so fucking creepy.

378
00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:34.290
It's a really cool looking guitar,

379
00:22:34.291 --> 00:22:39.270
but I don't think I could own a guitar of a dead person who was way better at

380
00:22:39.271 --> 00:22:42.210
playing than I'll ever be. Um,

381
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:46.140
I feel like that should be in like the rock and roll hall of fame so people can

382
00:22:46.141 --> 00:22:49.170
just go and, and look at it. Stay in your house.

383
00:22:49.171 --> 00:22:53.000
How fucking weird would that be? Just having people over and people going.

384
00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:55.260
Is that, is it? Yeah, that's Prince's guitar.

385
00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.530
I would immediately be whispering to my wife going, this guy fucking killed.

386
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.760
Let's get outta here. Fuck. Does he have his guitar?

387
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.420
It would immediately creep me up, but that's me. You know,

388
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:11.100
I'm a paranoid son of a bitch. He wants a fucking two story garage. Sue me.

389
00:23:11.101 --> 00:23:12.930
Do I not have any fucking reads this week?

390
00:23:12.931 --> 00:23:15.360
I think I might have advertisers that, I don't know if you guys have noticed,

391
00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:20.290
but I've slowly but surely pissed all of them off. Um, no.

392
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.910
Well, well maybe, maybe. I do have some advertising. He just hasn't sent it.

393
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:29.310
Nope. I'm hitting the refresh button. I don't fucking see it now. You know what,

394
00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.550
why they still sense it. Don't they understand that if I shit on it,

395
00:23:32.551 --> 00:23:35.370
you guys actually listened to it and then maybe you'll buy it as opposed to just

396
00:23:35.371 --> 00:23:39.390
fast forwarding through all of it. That's what I tried to do. I mean I'm just,

397
00:23:39.391 --> 00:23:43.410
you know, I'm trying to help them make money right now.

398
00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:46.340
What the fuck you going to do? Well, speaking of, you know,

399
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.990
I played for about five,

400
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:51.350
six years and then I stopped over the last couple of years when the downstairs

401
00:23:51.351 --> 00:23:54.950
was being redone and then I recently got back into it. But you know,

402
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.670
this is the deal. I play drums I fuck around and guitar and um,

403
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:03.770
I've always wanted one of those lemon burst fucking uh, less pulse.

404
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:07.790
I'm trying to find one, a lefthanded one. I just think it's fucking,

405
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.050
I dunno, but you know what kills me whenever I get to get a guitar associate,

406
00:24:12.051 --> 00:24:16.190
Les Paul, I just started thinking of all the fucking great music I've,

407
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.050
I've heard coming out of that thing. And then when I pick it up it's just like,

408
00:24:21.051 --> 00:24:22.280
oh Jesus,

409
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.780
am I the asshole that just bought a fucking guitar he doesn't deserve.

410
00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:30.980
I think I am. All right,

411
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:35.060
I'm going to pause here just so I can just fucking, if I get advertising later,

412
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:39.110
I can just put it in here. Um, or maybe not.

413
00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:42.230
So maybe if they'll see, let's see what happens. All right.

414
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:45.680
Pausing here for some advertising that might be read later.

415
00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.590
All right, I'm back. Did I read anything? I Dunno.

416
00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:56.550
I guess I'll find out later. Anyway, so, um,

417
00:24:56.580 --> 00:25:00.990
it's only four 27 here, Pacific coast time and in 33 minutes,

418
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:05.280
the blues, San Jose Schatz, fucking, um,

419
00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:09.150
game starts and, um,

420
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.810
I can't tell you how fucking excited I am about this and I already know how

421
00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:15.840
they're probably gonna sell this game. That's a tale of two cities,

422
00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.930
two cities that have never gotten over the hump.

423
00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:22.770
They're fans of add more heartbreak than a fucking unbelievable bloon and

424
00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:26.910
fucking spirit through the chest. One thing for sure,

425
00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:31.980
for one city, they'll be moving on to the Stanley Cup final,

426
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.350
not finals, as I always say,

427
00:25:34.351 --> 00:25:38.190
the Stanley Cup final and for the other team,

428
00:25:38.191 --> 00:25:41.010
more misery when neither one should be ashamed.

429
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:46.470
Lave both knocked off between the two of humble to perennial giants in the west

430
00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:49.840
with the La cakes and the fucking Chicago Blackhawks, right?

431
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.060
They're going to do some shit like that.

432
00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:55.170
Somebody is going to make it to the Stanley Cup final. I hate that.

433
00:25:55.171 --> 00:25:57.800
It's the final. I like the finals and I hate when people go, Ooh,

434
00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:02.010
this is all we Wolfel [inaudible], Bootsy, NBA fair,

435
00:26:02.011 --> 00:26:06.480
but there's seven games. It's the finals, right? I'd have no problem with that,

436
00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:09.560
plural. That's a great thing. You know when people go like, yeah,

437
00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.880
all those cuts over there in Europe or around the world go,

438
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.200
why do you call it football?

439
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.173
<v 4>You know</v>

440
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.920
<v 1>ours make sense. It's football and somebody goes, all right,</v>

441
00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:19.890
if you want to be tentacle,

442
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.280
you should call it feet ball you use in both your feet.

443
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.820
Why do you call football? There you'd go, you'd dribble right back and forth

444
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:29.150
between your feet so much called feet ball, Fidi ball footsie,

445
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:33.080
which called footsie. In other words, why don't you go fuck yourself? Um,

446
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:38.270
anyways, uh, I am really excited about this and um, what I would like to do,

447
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:42.170
don't you see is I would like to have, uh,

448
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:45.120
what am I giant ice cubes with some fucking booze in it.

449
00:26:45.121 --> 00:26:50.040
Cause I booze hard on the weekends cause I fucking stare at a goddamn script all

450
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.900
week before I come home and booze heart,

451
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:54.210
who's getting to my drinking is out of control. Um,

452
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:56.520
I think this is why people have children at some point in their life.

453
00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.500
Cause if you don't, you just drink yourself to death.

454
00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:06.390
I'll tell you, it's fun. It's a funny than shit diapers. Um, anyways, I am,

455
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.650
uh, I'm nervous about this one. I'm nervous.

456
00:27:10.651 --> 00:27:13.200
I had a belief that the blues were going to get by the Blackhawks.

457
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.870
I'm not kidding. I'm a surprise. And, uh,

458
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:20.130
I had a belief that they could get by the, uh, the Dallas stars,

459
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.410
but certainly with the goaltending issues,

460
00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:27.120
which I didn't even know they fucking had. Um, that still went seven.

461
00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:29.730
So I figured this would make sense that you get to the next,

462
00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:31.500
each day you get a little blood tested.

463
00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:36.501
So I want to say whoever wins this is gonna fucking win the Stanley Cup in the

464
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.280
Stanley Cup, Stanley Cup final. Um,

465
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.700
but I was hanging out with Barnick last night and he knows more about hockey

466
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:47.380
than I know about myself. And he was saying that, uh,

467
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.670
he thinks Tampa Bay lightning know even though they goaltender went down.

468
00:27:50.670 --> 00:27:54.620
So we shall see. Um, I'm sticking with the blues. Me, me,

469
00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:59.640
St Louis, Louis, Louie, me at the fair, I'm sticking with the blues.

470
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.410
That's my team. And um, cause my real team, the Bruins didn't make it,

471
00:28:04.411 --> 00:28:06.270
but I still love him. I'm going to be there again in October,

472
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.700
and if they play the blues, I'm not going to give a fuck.

473
00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:12.810
If they beat him fucking whatever, 12 to nothing, I will give a shit. Um,

474
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.930
speaking of which somebody sent me something about, um, you know,

475
00:28:15.931 --> 00:28:19.980
people always love to make points on all the dumb shit that I say on Twitter.

476
00:28:19.981 --> 00:28:22.680
Like, I mean, how many times do I have to admit that I'm a fucking moron?

477
00:28:22.730 --> 00:28:24.300
You really don't need to correct me.

478
00:28:24.301 --> 00:28:28.070
I realize that I'm an idiot but somebody goes stick to it.

479
00:28:28.071 --> 00:28:32.310
It's not a lot of scoring and soccer and sends me like one day's worth of

480
00:28:32.311 --> 00:28:33.720
fucking scores. It's just like,

481
00:28:33.721 --> 00:28:38.520
okay well if you average it out I think I'm right. You know,

482
00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.050
you know what's funny about that fucking Lester City Championship.

483
00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:46.560
Do you know how they found out that that they wanted championship cause two

484
00:28:46.561 --> 00:28:49.350
other teams played to like a one one tie.

485
00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:53.310
There wasn't even a play off play off. There wasn't even a fucking playoff.

486
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:56.010
Like here we go. This is it.

487
00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:59.130
We're down to the final two fucking teams.

488
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.230
We're going to play for 19 hours and hopefully at some point somebody's going to

489
00:29:04.231 --> 00:29:08.250
put the fucking ball and then in the net and the goal, whatever,

490
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.660
and then it's going to be over,

491
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:13.740
except it's going to be injury time that nobody knows what it is except for the

492
00:29:13.741 --> 00:29:17.850
fucking, uh, the refs and everybody starts whistling.

493
00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:20.820
I didn't even have that.

494
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:26.070
They watched these two other teams play to a tie and then everybody went crazy.

495
00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:29.280
That seems really anticlimactic to me.

496
00:29:29.281 --> 00:29:31.470
I think he wants somebody to fucking kick the ball.

497
00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:35.190
It goes into the fucking somebody scores. Right.

498
00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:40.960
And then collectively as sports fans, you all fucking bust your nut. Ah,

499
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.920
when it goes in. Yeah,

500
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.090
just a bunch of people walking around with scarves,

501
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.220
watching somebody with wind get a fucking tie.

502
00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:52.150
And then you're excited about that. I, I don't, I, I don't get that.

503
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:53.531
You know,

504
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:57.040
you would think that a country that survived the fucking blitzkrieg like that

505
00:29:57.041 --> 00:29:59.230
level of excitement in your fucking life,

506
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:03.940
you think you think that your sports would, were, would reflect it.

507
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.350
Maybe you had and maybe your fucking grandparents had enough fucking excitement

508
00:30:08.351 --> 00:30:11.650
for one lifetime annual lifetime too. So they just started watching that.

509
00:30:11.651 --> 00:30:12.520
I don't know. Well,

510
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:15.430
maybe I don't understand enough about the game and I'm just a fucking moron.

511
00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.840
Maybe that's what it is. I don't know. I have no idea. Whatever. Go,

512
00:30:19.841 --> 00:30:23.290
go get some fucking fish and chips and go fuck yourself. All right, let's read.

513
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:26.920
Let's read some. Um, let's read some, uh,

514
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:31.030
some of this bullshit here that I got from this week. Um, oh, by the way,

515
00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:34.300
I had a great weekend down and uh, before I get to this, I got an hour to fill,

516
00:30:34.301 --> 00:30:36.070
so don't worry about it. Um,

517
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:37.830
<v 0>yeah.</v>

518
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:38.680
<v 1>Oh, I had a great weekend.</v>

519
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.820
Have I've just been in a real slump as far as writing new bits,

520
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:48.220
just because, uh, my life is ground to a halt here. It's like,

521
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:51.100
you know, I'm not going out. I'm not doing anything.

522
00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:56.020
It's like my wife went to the Beyonce concert last night at a, at the Rose Bowl,

523
00:30:56.470 --> 00:31:01.210
and I was actually thinking I should gone because there's no fucking way I

524
00:31:01.211 --> 00:31:03.410
wouldn't have got a bit out of that. I would have felt old.

525
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:05.410
That would've felt stupid. I wouldn't know what the songs,

526
00:31:05.411 --> 00:31:07.900
when she come out fucking whipping her weave around and shit.

527
00:31:07.901 --> 00:31:12.310
That'd be something I could talk about. Right. Um,

528
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:17.480
but instead I went down to the comedy store and I did a couple of shows and, um,

529
00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.900
I actually went out, let's have a comedians.

530
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:26.070
They're out there and I was just so fucking sick of doing the same shit and

531
00:31:26.151 --> 00:31:30.770
trying to make it work. I just, every once in a while, if you just go out there

532
00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:36.140
and, uh, you just not thinking anything and you just start fucking talking,

533
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:40.580
it works way better and it breathes his new life into all your jokes.

534
00:31:40.581 --> 00:31:43.940
I just kind of went out there and, um,

535
00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.130
which is a very terrifying thing to do when you,

536
00:31:46.131 --> 00:31:50.630
if you've never done that in standup because you really feel like you're, uh,

537
00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.150
you know,

538
00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:57.500
do you remember in like the Matrix when Keanu Reeves to trying to convince them

539
00:31:57.501 --> 00:32:00.770
to fucking step off that building and he's not gonna fall to his death?

540
00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.900
All he has to do is Billy isn't,

541
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.560
was it that movie or was it fucking Battlestar Galactica?

542
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.030
Moonraker I don't know what the phone of those space movies, right.

543
00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:12.260
It wasn't even space, but Scifi, um,

544
00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.760
he had to like believe it and if you believe it, then you find if you,

545
00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.220
if you don't believe it, you actually fall to your death.

546
00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:22.910
This is sort of one of those things, but of course you're not gonna die.

547
00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:23.840
You're just gonna, you know,

548
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.840
metaphorically die on stage is his basic stepping off the building is basically

549
00:32:30.531 --> 00:32:35.531
you just leaving your act behind and just fucking just talking.

550
00:32:35.991 --> 00:32:40.430
So I just went out there and I just started riffing the fact that I made a smart

551
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:44.540
move by not going to be on say, because you know,

552
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:46.580
when I went to Lady Gaga with my wife,

553
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:49.333
<v 5>um,</v>

554
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:51.460
<v 1>you know, I fucking,</v>

555
00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:56.380
I mean she was mad at me for like three fucking days after that one in defense

556
00:32:56.381 --> 00:33:01.180
of me, which there really, really is no defense. I watched the Patriots,

557
00:33:01.181 --> 00:33:04.780
we lost I think two a, the ravens in the playoffs during the day.

558
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:08.780
So I was already drinking. I already had like good six pack in me. And then, uh,

559
00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:13.900
we took a car service to fucking lady Gaga and we went on the thing and it was,

560
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:17.860
uh, it's, you know, I'm all about seeing the band.

561
00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:20.560
I want to see the drummer and all that type of shit. And she,

562
00:33:20.561 --> 00:33:24.310
on this tour for whatever reason, it's hard towards her choice,

563
00:33:24.311 --> 00:33:26.830
whatever she had them in. Like this house,

564
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:29.200
there was a fucking house and I couldn't see the drummer.

565
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.100
There was like a window. I could kind of see his hands a little bit,

566
00:33:33.101 --> 00:33:35.680
a little bit of his head. And that was it. And it was just like, fuck,

567
00:33:35.681 --> 00:33:40.390
I want to see the band. And um, I can't,

568
00:33:40.391 --> 00:33:41.710
it was so long ago, I don't remember what the fuck,

569
00:33:41.711 --> 00:33:44.290
but I just started telling that story and how I fucking pissed her off.

570
00:33:44.291 --> 00:33:48.070
And then if I went to the Beyonce thing, you know how I would, I would just,

571
00:33:48.071 --> 00:33:50.170
you know, you know,

572
00:33:50.171 --> 00:33:52.900
when they sang like that independent woman's song and everything,

573
00:33:52.901 --> 00:33:53.800
just a dirty looks,

574
00:33:53.801 --> 00:33:57.040
I'd be given most of the women there knowing that they were full of shit and

575
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.860
that they shouldn't be putting their hands up in the air. You know,

576
00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:08.910
it was just a smart move that I didn't go and my wife still has never gotten

577
00:34:09.071 --> 00:34:14.071
over my behavior at the lady Gaga concert to the point that I actually asked her

578
00:34:14.321 --> 00:34:17.980
to come on the podcast to talk about the Beyonce concert.

579
00:34:17.981 --> 00:34:22.210
And she just goes now and I try not to laugh.

580
00:34:22.211 --> 00:34:24.550
I tried to hold it together. I go, what do you mean though? She goes,

581
00:34:24.551 --> 00:34:27.160
we think I'm a fucking idiot. No, she goes,

582
00:34:27.161 --> 00:34:30.360
I'm not going on the podcast and give you, giving you a, a,

583
00:34:30.361 --> 00:34:34.570
an opportunity to start trashing Beyonce. I'm not going to trash Beyonce. Great.

584
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:42.910
I have to admit, she started showing me

585
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:44.670
<v 5>okay.</v>

586
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:49.670
<v 1>Video clips of the concert and she had it like the way she was whole,</v>

587
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:52.620
she was, we were on the couch and she snuggled up next to me.

588
00:34:52.621 --> 00:34:56.610
So she's holding the kind of low to my, you know, near my stomach.

589
00:34:56.700 --> 00:35:01.590
And like three times I started laughing, looking at the, uh,

590
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.880
looking at the clips. Um, and look, dude,

591
00:35:05.881 --> 00:35:08.600
I know she's way more talented than I could ever be out and I don't even

592
00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:10.150
remotely put on show, but this,

593
00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:15.060
this just something funny to me about when everybody dances in unison and they

594
00:35:15.061 --> 00:35:17.460
have that, you know, that angry look on their face.

595
00:35:17.461 --> 00:35:21.090
It's just the funniest for assists. Like what is your, what is the problem

596
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:26.160
coming up? They got their arms out, you know,

597
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.610
and they doing that little fucking thing with their head and their feet are

598
00:35:29.611 --> 00:35:32.370
running. Uh, it's just, I can't,

599
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:35.970
I can't even dance like the fucking nerve of me to laugh at it,

600
00:35:35.971 --> 00:35:39.810
but it always strikes. It's just,

601
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:43.260
it is absolutely ridiculous. Something, it's,

602
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:45.960
I understand why it's awesome and people appreciate it,

603
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:50.970
but it's also really fucking funny to me. I should say.

604
00:35:50.971 --> 00:35:53.580
I don't know why. Maybe I, you know what? I'm just a con. Don't listen to me,

605
00:35:53.581 --> 00:35:54.001
so whatever.

606
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:58.620
So I made a great fucking move by not going to that concert.

607
00:35:58.621 --> 00:36:03.540
Made a very smart, married a couple of years getting a wise,

608
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.610
in my old age, I just was just like, you know what? I can, that's,

609
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.100
that's the best. When you start,

610
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:11.970
you start to know somebody and yourself well enough to be like, you know what?

611
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.600
I see the fight coming. You know what I mean? It's actually,

612
00:36:15.601 --> 00:36:17.730
it's like slipping punches, which I, there's something else.

613
00:36:17.731 --> 00:36:20.610
Another reason why I suck at fighting is you could literally tell me on

614
00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:21.211
Thursday,

615
00:36:21.211 --> 00:36:26.211
I'm throwing this punch at this time and you would still not only catch me with

616
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:30.030
it, you [inaudible] your whole hand or foot or whatever, would you,

617
00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:36.150
I just can't do it. I, I, you know, whatever, I stink at it. So,

618
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.840
um, I saw this fight comment and I was just like,

619
00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.030
I was like all right now and I gave my, you know,

620
00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:45.150
my ticket away and she took one of her girlfriends.

621
00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:49.170
So I look good with the friends and all of that fucking shit. And uh,

622
00:36:49.171 --> 00:36:54.171
I avoided a major fucking fight and I just went on stage cause I was like,

623
00:36:54.301 --> 00:36:57.750
I'm sick of my jokes. That was the point of this shit. I'm sick of my jokes,

624
00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:02.580
so whenever I get into this, these, um,

625
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.720
whatever you've got writer's block, even though I don't write whatever,

626
00:37:06.721 --> 00:37:10.290
just riffing block I guess cause I just sort of wing my shit.

627
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.653
Um,

628
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:13.210
<v 0>okay.</v>

629
00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:16.270
<v 1>I just say to myself, what am I thinking right now? What am I feeling?</v>

630
00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:17.890
And I was feeling,

631
00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.890
thank God I didn't go to Beyonce because me and my wife would get into a big

632
00:37:20.891 --> 00:37:25.090
fight. So, and you know, it's funny, I didn't even make that decision.

633
00:37:25.091 --> 00:37:27.580
I kind of as I was don, I rare brought me up.

634
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:33.060
He gives the best fucking intros. He said this fucking in Troy because you know,

635
00:37:33.061 --> 00:37:37.170
this next guy come to the stage. Uh, you know, he never made me laugh.

636
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:40.260
You know, immediately people are just dying. They just fucking,

637
00:37:40.261 --> 00:37:43.440
he just does that stuff. But, you know, people seem to enjoy him. Um,

638
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.670
I dunno. I've written a lot of his stuff and just, you know,

639
00:37:47.671 --> 00:37:49.410
just making me look like a complete asshole.

640
00:37:49.411 --> 00:37:53.430
So I went out there and it wasn't until after I shook his hand that I was

641
00:37:53.431 --> 00:37:56.840
actually thinking of the first bit I was gonna do and I was just like, Oh God,

642
00:37:57.570 --> 00:38:00.270
this is gonna feel like shit coming out of my mouth. I can't even say it.

643
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:06.450
And then I just over the years have just knowing that trick. I was just like,

644
00:38:06.451 --> 00:38:08.310
what am I feeling right now? I was just feeling,

645
00:38:08.311 --> 00:38:11.430
I'm glad I fucking did go to Beyonce cause I get new three day fight with my

646
00:38:11.431 --> 00:38:16.431
wife and I just started talking about that and it just,

647
00:38:16.621 --> 00:38:17.454
it worked.

648
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:22.910
And then I had this other chunk of material and I did the last joke without even

649
00:38:23.971 --> 00:38:26.520
setting it up from the other shit. And it still worked.

650
00:38:26.521 --> 00:38:31.440
It just worked in a different way. And um, it was,

651
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:32.190
it was great.

652
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:35.680
It may be fucking love stand up again cause I was really not like I didn't,

653
00:38:35.950 --> 00:38:38.630
whenever I hate stand up, but just this whole fucking writing every day.

654
00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.533
All right.

655
00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:45.810
<v 6>Alright. And now through the magic of technology is now, uh,</v>

656
00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:52.040
10 oh one Pacific coast time and I'm watching the third period of uh,

657
00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:56.240
St Louis, San Jose. Um,

658
00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.050
I take the fucking game for greater check to go to the first two periods.

659
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.820
Who won St Louis so far? Alright,

660
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:07.190
let's shoot these fucking ads and get on with the fucking Washington,

661
00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:12.040
the sports here. All right, boy, uh,

662
00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:15.460
you need to know how to cook unless you get a broad your license.

663
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.160
She's old tools. You know what I mean?

664
00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.520
Not only do you feel like you know you were around the kitchen,

665
00:39:20.521 --> 00:39:24.570
but cooking at home means eating healthier and trading money instead of ordering

666
00:39:24.571 --> 00:39:29.040
expensive takeout all over again. But where do you start?

667
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:34.700
Who Apron as you covered for the last 10 less than $10 per meal we'll wait from

668

669
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:44.130
Jeff Ball to easy step by step instruction. Use new brass. You look really good.

670
00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.800
We should move around. When I was a single seller,

671
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.950
each meal can be prepared in 40 minutes or less.

672
00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:54.870
No overwhelming trips to the grocery store and no more sad take out and that a

673
00:39:54.871 --> 00:39:58.500
how dietary preferences, no matter your dietary preferences.

674
00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.750
We'll wait for the mix of the bleeds to discover and prepare dishes like seared

675
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:08.160
salmon with asparagus and new potato Hash and creamy AOE right in your own

676
00:40:09.661 --> 00:40:13.500
kitchen. I don't even know what half of that is. Who the

677
00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.140
fuck is they only

678
00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:24.060
cook with ingredients that you've never used before? Like watermelon, radishes,

679
00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:25.973
sterile, Farro,

680
00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:31.340
modal and purple potatoes and red puppies are between 500 and 700 calories per

681
00:40:32.731 --> 00:40:35.820
portion. Delicious and good for you right now.

682
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.380
You can get your first two meals for free, yet we wait for Dotcom.

683
00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:43.170
Flash for that blue wave for.com press for

684
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:49.470
Glasper. A better way to cook. Oh, here we go. Me On d v R and D,

685
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:53.370
no more sweaty balls. The do do me on these.

686
00:40:53.371 --> 00:40:57.480
Me On the gum drinking amigos mark, pour it down.

687
00:40:57.481 --> 00:41:02.210
The front of my fucking underwear dries up real quick and I don't care my balls

688
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:05.580
good. Drunken so am I by the fucking penny.

689
00:41:05.581 --> 00:41:10.560
Your queen is all right near knees. Whether you're wearing a suit or

690
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:14.550
whether you're wearing a suit or sweat,

691
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:19.920
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear unless you're Matthew

692
00:41:19.921 --> 00:41:21.600
mcconaughey and you're aware of this.

693
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:25.740
She is run down the beach carrying a couple of her, whatever the fuck it is,

694
00:41:25.741 --> 00:41:29.040
he goes on TV. That's amazing. Anyway,

695
00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:34.100
but instead of making a statement like superman under his everyday clothes,

696
00:41:35.031 --> 00:41:39.830
your underwear is probably boring. The undies is here to change that. Well,

697
00:41:39.831 --> 00:41:44.440
you know, it's pretty boring as it, it's just red. Yeah.

698
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.970
So you have his fucking name on it. That's when it gets interesting.

699
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.030
Please include all the volume point. Why would not, you're rolling.

700
00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:57.320
I'm going to read it. Modal is pronounced modal every pair of me.

701
00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:02.000
And these is made from sustainable mode out of press fabric twice as soft as

702
00:42:02.001 --> 00:42:06.650
cotton, allegedly. Nothing can describe the fit and the feel of the on these.

703
00:42:06.651 --> 00:42:09.680
You gotta feel it up against you, evolved to appreciate it.

704
00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.200
But once you find them on your,

705
00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:14.720
understand why they're called the world's most comfortable underwear.

706
00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.340
And if yellow on your first parently on these, there no questions asked me.

707
00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:23.900
And he says dozens of styles and limited edition prints to help you make a

708
00:42:23.901 --> 00:42:27.560
statement with your underwear. Were there any more you can see them or not?

709
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.980
Remember Superman. Um,

710
00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.270
they're really great marketing and spoke towards the comic con Crowder.

711
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:38.650
They can give a fuck about superman. Didn't he lose the Batman

712
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:43.910
shipping at three in the US and Canada and you can save up to $8.

713
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.140
Prepare with me. I'm used to get the subscription or a single pair,

00:43:52.701 --> 00:43:54.530
Legal isn't a law firm,

731
00:43:54.531 --> 00:43:57.820
so they built the network of independent attorneys available in scoring eight

732
00:43:58.270 --> 00:43:58.550
states.

733
00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:02.210
You get answers to your legal questions and they can review supplier contracts,

734
00:44:02.211 --> 00:44:06.110
employment laws, and help with most of the day to day situations that pop up.

735
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:11.420
And finally, letter B, a, B, c,

736
00:44:11.421 --> 00:44:16.340
d, e, that's the first one. Um,

737
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:21.080
when adults say they looked in the web, you don't learn another concept.

738
00:44:21.081 --> 00:44:24.710
10 Spanish lessons, not block with my dog.

739

745
00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.090

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.500
<v 1>Oh, see,</v>

747
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:56.460
<v 7>oh good.</v>

748
00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:02.890
<v 1>Um, speaking of which, how greatest song is top Jimmy, I fucking love that song.</v>

749
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:06.340
All right. SCIATICA. Uh, hey bill, love your podcast.

750
00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:11.200
I wanted to tell you about my sister's cure for s a SCIATICA lie,

751
00:45:11.201 --> 00:45:13.990
but don't worse. Joe's gay clog. Um,

752
00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.270
the providence say they at one night only shy

753
00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.830
my ass fucking, um,

754
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:28.330
she suffered from Sciatica, uh, for years. For years.

755
00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.960
Her doctor recommended she see a Pajama podiatrist.

756
00:45:31.961 --> 00:45:36.370
That's a foot doctor for all you civilians out there who filmed her from behind

757
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.770
woo fucking creep as she walked on a treadmill. Yeah. Hey Man,

758
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:43.690
what do these yoga pants, by the way,

759
00:45:43.691 --> 00:45:48.070
I don't understand why guys are fucking so obsessed with yoga pants.

760
00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:52.100
I've never been at yoga pants. I like just, you know what,

761
00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.740
I took too many yoga classes.

762
00:45:53.741 --> 00:45:56.940
I just know what the room smells like and I just feel like that's what you clam

763
00:45:56.941 --> 00:46:00.940
smells like when you wear those. And I know that's immature. I'm sorry. Um,

764
00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:05.200
he immediately saw her right foot was rolling out as she walked.

765
00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:10.800
He said this was causing her problems with Sciatica and he made custom orthotic

766
00:46:12.701 --> 00:46:15.580
shoes, inserts that she wears most of the time.

767
00:46:15.581 --> 00:46:20.581
She said this worked immediately to completely eliminate her pain from Sadeka.

768
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:25.660
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Um, she said after you start wearing the orthotics,

769
00:46:25.661 --> 00:46:30.400
you should visit a chiropractor to get everything back in alignment and you're

770
00:46:30.401 --> 00:46:35.320
good to go. Give it a try and go fuck yourself. Thank you so much for that. Um,

771
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:37.020
I don't think I have that issue, but I,

772
00:46:37.021 --> 00:46:40.020
I got the name of a good chiropractor and you know what, dammit,

773
00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.590
when I'm uploading this podcast,

774
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:46.540
I'm actually going to go see a doctor because somebody sent me this thing on,

775
00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:50.050
um, on Twitter. Go Bill, go see a doctor.

776
00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.600
Jesus did we learn nothing from so and so.

777
00:46:52.601 --> 00:46:55.180
And it was somebody who was on Letterman who was,

778
00:46:55.181 --> 00:46:57.880
she had a shortness of breath and he kept blowing it off.

779
00:46:57.881 --> 00:47:00.160
He kept talking to people who weren't doctors and they're like,

780
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:01.000
I'm sure you find,

781
00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.980
I'm sure you find that he found out it was fucking lung cancer.

782
00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:08.170
Obviously that's not what I'm looking at here. Um, all right.

783
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:14.380
Uh, so I will definitely go. Thank you for that. All right, number two, uh,

784
00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.670
Duke, where will Katelyn take a shit this week?

785
00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.340
Um, number two. Hi Bill.

786
00:47:21.341 --> 00:47:26.260
I was a wall and floor Tyler for 27 years and my to,

787
00:47:26.261 --> 00:47:31.261
for any lower back pain was a gel ice in lying on a hard floor.

788
00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:37.140
The Gel pack molds to the area that is sore and the hard floor keeps you spine

789
00:47:37.661 --> 00:47:39.490
flat. Lie on your back.

790
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:43.960
Weight lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent.

791
00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.930
Put the ice in. What does that mean?

792
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:50.410
They bend in and lift them up or just have your feet on the floor.

793
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:56.700
Um, do you put your foot down on a two? You jump up on the wound. Ah,

794
00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:59.560
sorry. Thinking about prince now. All right. Um,

795
00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.270
then we'll the ice pack and then try it way, way, way, way, way.

796
00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:05.640
I missed the whole fucking thing. Lie on your back.

797
00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:06.813
<v 0>Okay.</v>

798
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:10.060
<v 1>You know what it as he wrote a bunch of words that are all like the same.</v>

799
00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:13.780
I have some sort of fucking dyslexia because he has lie like a bunch of times in

800
00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.840
feet. Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent.

801
00:48:16.841 --> 00:48:20.350
Put the ice pack at the spot, giving you trouble. Leave it there. Oh,

802
00:48:20.351 --> 00:48:23.950
I know why he didn't have any punctuation. Leave it there for 15 minutes.

803
00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:28.810
You can watch TV doing this then moves the ice pack and then try to feel like

804
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.960
you are pressing your spine into the floor.

805
00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.680
Continue with the treatment once or twice a day until you feel better.

806
00:48:35.681 --> 00:48:36.790
I hope this works for you.

807
00:48:36.791 --> 00:48:41.200
I loved efforts for family and reminded me of my childhood and I'm a 57 year old

808
00:48:41.201 --> 00:48:44.890
Australian male. Love the specials in the podcast. Help you get better soon.

809
00:48:44.891 --> 00:48:47.770
Well that's good to know. So you're 10 years older than me.

810
00:48:47.771 --> 00:48:50.830
Well that should work because we kind of age bill a little bit older than,

811
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.260
than I was in 1973 or 74.

812
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:56.590
He's about 11 years old and which would mean he would have been,

813
00:48:56.760 --> 00:49:01.350
would have been born in 62 so that's right in your wheelhouse,

814
00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.420
right? You would probably be born in like what,

815
00:49:04.421 --> 00:49:09.010
58 59 yeah, belt. That's how the math works out. All right, cool.

816
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.380
Um, okay. Australia mailbox full.

817
00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.130
Thank you so much for watching and please tell more people down there in

818
00:49:15.131 --> 00:49:17.050
Australia if you can to check it out. Um,

819
00:49:17.051 --> 00:49:20.290
I actually heard a lot of times people say to put heat on your back ice I guess

820
00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.370
is better. Uh,

821
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:26.020
cause if you have any sort of a inflammation in the nerve or something like

822
00:49:26.021 --> 00:49:29.290
that, I dunno, I've been using a leaf and doing these stretches,

823
00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:32.860
I feel much better and I haven't been sitting down at all.

824
00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:37.270
I've actually been squatting like a Vietnamese gambler and, um,

825
00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:41.950
I don't know. I, uh, that's been working for me in these stretches.

826
00:49:41.951 --> 00:49:45.960
I still haven't quite gotten it better, but I'm going to walk,

827
00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:50.320
go to a chiropractor and get adjusted out Jesus. And you know what? I that,

828
00:49:50.321 --> 00:49:54.860
and I also need glasses finally giving into that because my, um,

829
00:49:55.780 --> 00:50:00.430
every two years when your of my advanced age, you got to go get a physical,

830
00:50:00.431 --> 00:50:03.850
physical, a Waldo again physical.

831
00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:10.270
Um, I got my pilot's license. So you got to every, you know,

832
00:50:10.271 --> 00:50:13.780
if you're a younger fella, every four lady lady, every five years you,

833
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:17.860
you got to renew your medical, um, you got to get it updated. So with me,

834
00:50:17.861 --> 00:50:20.980
it's every two fucking years and I barely made it through.

835
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:24.520
And I'm literally like, what the fuck am I doing here?

836
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:27.560
I don't want to wear glasses, just don't,

837
00:50:27.561 --> 00:50:29.750
I just don't want to have another fucking thing that I have to deal with.

838
00:50:29.751 --> 00:50:34.610
And I also have this paranoia that all glasses do is make you fucking eyes

839
00:50:34.611 --> 00:50:39.530
worse. Kinda like a chap stick. It just dries out your lips even more.

840
00:50:39.531 --> 00:50:42.020
That's like the big urban myth. And then you get addicted to it,

841
00:50:42.021 --> 00:50:46.340
then you got to use it, you know, whatever. I have dry ass lips.

842
00:50:46.341 --> 00:50:49.160
I just use a little Vaseline, works like a fucking charm.

843
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.420
And then I just started pounding waters and then you find you fucking find that

844
00:50:53.421 --> 00:50:56.930
fucking chapstick and all that shit. I don't like it.

845
00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.080
I don't like it makes me have weird dreams, you know,

846
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.690
get that chemical in there and seeps right in the fucking face.

847
00:51:02.691 --> 00:51:04.520
And it goes right to your brain. And next thing you know,

848
00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:09.440
you just run around with an ax and your drained. You may have a dream like that.

849
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:14.570
Some reason you're screaming, answer me, uh,

850
00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:19.960
I'm just making this shit up people at all. I don't,

851
00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:21.580
what the fuck you want from me? Usually the,

852
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:26.750
the advertising takes up a little bit of time and I don't have any four 48

853
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.710
another 12 minutes. And then the game stats. Oh,

854
00:51:30.711 --> 00:51:34.280
and I got another 15 minutes here. Fuck. Well thank you.

855
00:51:34.281 --> 00:51:37.880
Thank God for Teebo right. All right. Grass killing name.

856
00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:42.920
Alright. Uh, fantasy, revenge advice.

857
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.520
Hello billion. I'm a 23 year old male.

858
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:51.580
I live with my parents in the country that even Australia makes an oh wow.

859
00:51:51.981 --> 00:51:56.570
That even Australia makes fun of too from uh, Australians here. Oh, New Zealand.

860
00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:57.523
Oh Jesus.

861
00:51:57.650 --> 00:52:01.070
I live with my parents in a country that even Australia make fun of New Zealand.

862
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:03.950
I thought you meant a part of a country. I can't read people.

863
00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:07.190
I love emphasis for family and can't wait for season two. Thank you so much.

864
00:52:07.191 --> 00:52:09.890
Please tell more people in New Zealand about it if you haven't already,

865
00:52:09.891 --> 00:52:10.790
if he got the time.

866
00:52:10.791 --> 00:52:12.810
I'm not trying to put you out if you don't want to be that Douche,

867
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:17.330
don't be the Douche. But if you do, I'd appreciate it. All right, so here we go.

868
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:21.230
Fantasy, revenge. Advice sometime ago,

869
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:26.300
my father was using a lawn trimmer on the right side of the front yard,

870
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:30.500
which is only a few feet from our neighbor's driveway while trimming the edges

871
00:52:30.501 --> 00:52:32.300
of small rock in the grass,

872
00:52:32.301 --> 00:52:35.480
shot out and hit our neighbors parked car in the driveway.

873
00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.290
Our neighbor was already at the front of his house and either saw or heard the

874
00:52:39.291 --> 00:52:42.920
bang and started yelling at my dad who was apologetic.

875
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.010
The rock the rock put a small dent in the car,

876
00:52:46.130 --> 00:52:50.750
which was hard to see even close up when I, when I was told what happened,

877
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:54.260
my dad by my dad, I was a little pissed that he yelled,

878
00:52:54.261 --> 00:52:57.800
but I knew he had a right to be upset. And although it was an accident,

879
00:52:58.010 --> 00:53:03.010
my dad would happily pay for the damages because he knew he was at fault.

880
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:07.760
Um, our neighbor didn't talk to us again about a bill or anything,

881
00:53:07.761 --> 00:53:11.360
so we quickly forgot about it and moved on. A few weeks later,

882
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:15.350
I was at the front of our house that I saw that the right side of our lawn was

883
00:53:15.351 --> 00:53:18.350
completely dead, of foot inwards.

884
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:22.850
I realized this fucking con had poisoned the area of the grass that would

885
00:53:22.851 --> 00:53:27.600
usually be cut using the trimmer. Wow.

886
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:30.360
This guy's got major communication issues.

887
00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:33.290
So this incident would never happen again. The state might,

888
00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:38.190
despite my dad telling him that he would only mow the lawn when the driveway was

889
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:40.230
empty in the future. Um,

890
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:44.910
I asked my dad if he knew anything and he told me he had known for a few days,

891
00:53:44.911 --> 00:53:46.590
but didn't want to make a big deal about it.

892
00:53:46.591 --> 00:53:50.430
My Dad is a very easy going guy who doesn't get bothered much myself on the

893
00:53:50.431 --> 00:53:53.100
other hand, spent the night, uh,

894
00:53:53.101 --> 00:53:56.280
the next few nights fantasizing about revenge. Oh,

895
00:53:56.490 --> 00:54:00.750
it looks like you take after your mom. All right. Get Dad's easygoing.

896
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:06.060
He married a fucking a hot blooded woman and she, you know, she calmed her down,

897
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:09.720
right? And then you, you, you, you got her fucking DNA. All right. I like,

898
00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:13.020
I like where this is going so far, even though I'm not a big revenge guy.

899
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.600
Your Dad's easygoing. It's his house already. My Gut say,

900
00:54:16.601 --> 00:54:20.730
and your dad's easygoing. It's his fucking house. You know? Um,

901
00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.160
don't do anything to disrupt it. Um,

902
00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:26.790
you said that I thought about doing the exact same thing to his lungs,

903
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:31.710
but spelling out the words coward. Oh my God, that's fucking hilarious.

904
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:35.880
I've thought about pulling out all of his plants and dumping it on his car to

905
00:54:35.881 --> 00:54:36.870
send a message.

906
00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:40.260
It's been a few months and I still get pissed off when I think about it,

907
00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:44.130
but I decided not to stoop to his level and pull off a bitch move like that.

908
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.170
The only option would be to confront him,

909
00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:50.100
but there is no scenario in which that would end. Well, why not?

910
00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:56.160
Um, why not? Why can't you just next time you see him, just say like, dude,

911
00:54:56.161 --> 00:55:00.240
I gotta tell you something. I haven't been on this planet for a long time,

912
00:55:00.241 --> 00:55:05.130
so maybe I need to see more bitchy behavior, but that's the biggest pussy bitch.

913
00:55:05.131 --> 00:55:09.390
Fucking mad. I don't do that. It's going to, I don't know. I would just say,

914
00:55:09.391 --> 00:55:13.650
Hey, do you have any idea why this part of the lawn died? Isn't that amazing?

915
00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:16.050
And I would do that to them every fucking time.

916
00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:18.510
Just do something that drive them nuts anyways,

917
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:20.670
cause I've decided to do nothing and moved on,

918
00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:23.490
but it's been about a year and I'm still thinking about it.

919
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:27.480
What would you have done? Am I justified to be pissed? This pissed?

920
00:55:27.481 --> 00:55:31.920
And how the fuck do I stop myself from letting it get me in such a bad mood

921
00:55:31.921 --> 00:55:36.000
every time I walked past our front lawn and see the dead strip of lawn?

922
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.240
Thanks for listening, Bill. Come back to New Zealand. Um,

923
00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:42.270
your lawn is still dead. Look,

924
00:55:42.271 --> 00:55:44.760
I'm not a big on revenge,

925
00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:48.480
but the great thing that you have right now is you've waited a year.

926
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:51.703
<v 8>Um,</v>

927
00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:53.170
<v 1>so if you were to do anything,</v>

928
00:55:53.171 --> 00:55:56.850
obviously don't bring any physical harm to the person. Um,

929
00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.540
he does seem to love that car.

930
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:03.160
It's just, yeah, why would you do it?

931
00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:04.793
<v 8>Um,</v>

932
00:56:05.110 --> 00:56:08.170
<v 1>why don't you guys read, just replant the fucking grass.</v>

933
00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:12.720
That's what I would do. I would replant the grass. This is what you do.

934
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.300
Replant the grass and get all excited.

935
00:56:17.301 --> 00:56:20.840
And then without him knowing what you do is you set up a fucking video camera.

936
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:25.780
All right? And he just videotape. And you, you try to catch them doing it.

937
00:56:26.290 --> 00:56:27.910
That's the best way to do it. Right.

938
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:31.300
And then he has to fucking pay for it and then pay for the previous thing.

939
00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:35.320
The previous, he poisoned it. Like that's what I would do. You know what I mean?

940
00:56:35.350 --> 00:56:36.850
There's obvious things that you could do.

941
00:56:36.851 --> 00:56:40.780
You could go to a fucking auto zone and buy one of those little catch trays that

942
00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:45.400
captures oil, you know? And then in the night you could undo his fucking

943
00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.800
let all the oil out of his car on screwed the thing on the oil pan and you'd

944
00:56:50.801 --> 00:56:54.280
screw it back up and then he seizes the edge on his car. You can go that route.

945
00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:55.810
<v 0>Okay.</v>

946
00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:59.710
<v 1>You know, there's no oil in the fucking car. Um</v>

947
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:01.920
<v 0>Hm.</v>

948
00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.170
<v 1>The key is what you have to do is</v>

949
00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:08.440
he would still figure it out,

950
00:57:08.441 --> 00:57:12.010
see if he can't do this is all bitchy fucking moves. You know what I mean?

951
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.690
You got to have a face to face thing.

952
00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:18.720
Or what I would do is I would just repat pre plant the grass and I would set up

953
00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:23.180
a fucking video camera and maybe just say that. Just say, hey, just so you know,

954
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:25.250
if you plan on poisoning our grass,

955
00:57:25.820 --> 00:57:29.140
cause I know you're not a man and you would never say anything to my dad's on my

956
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:33.920
self's face. You know, just let you know I got the security.

957
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:36.950
You're going to be on video and we're going to catch you doing it. Okay.

958
00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:41.620
All right. It costs us a lot of money and I year I, oh my God, what a,

959
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:44.250
in a perfect world,

960
00:57:44.251 --> 00:57:47.700
could you just go over and just fucking take this answers the door and you go

961
00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:51.750
and you just boot them right in the nuts, huh? You would do.

962
00:57:51.751 --> 00:57:55.560
Then you just take a strip of the dead grassy to start fucking beating his back

963
00:57:55.561 --> 00:57:57.600
with it. That's what the fuck you wanted to. I, you know what?

964
00:57:57.601 --> 00:58:00.450
I actually want to do that right now, but you know what? You can't do it.

965
00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:05.100
You know what? Fuck him. He did it to you. He did it to you.

966
00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:12.850
Oh Dude, you know something. I think you're,

967
00:58:12.910 --> 00:58:15.430
I think what you came up with is the best.

968
00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:21.430
Why don't you just write coward? Nah.

969
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:23.950
Cause then he's going to do something else to your dad's house.

970
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.550
<v 0>Okay.</v>

971
00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:31.480
<v 1>Oh, this guy's a cunt. You know what?</v>

972
00:58:31.481 --> 00:58:33.160
He doesn't have the balls to confront your dad.

973
00:58:33.161 --> 00:58:35.950
So when I think you do yet do the little cower thing and then set up video

974
00:58:35.951 --> 00:58:37.360
cameras and catch them doing something else,

975
00:58:37.361 --> 00:58:39.700
but then you've done something to him. See it's just, it's just awful.

976
00:58:39.701 --> 00:58:43.120
It's just as bitchy tit for fucking tat thing. I don't know what you have to do,

977
00:58:43.330 --> 00:58:46.060
but I feel like something has to be said. At least

978
00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:52.960
I know what you'd do. This is what you do.

979
00:58:52.961 --> 00:58:55.180
You go down to a fucking lady shoe store.

980
00:58:55.790 --> 00:58:56.590
<v 0>Okay.</v>

981
00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:59.770
<v 1>All right. And you buy a cheap pair of fucking women's shoes.</v>

982
00:59:01.260 --> 00:59:02.093
<v 0>Okay.</v>

983
00:59:02.330 --> 00:59:06.080
<v 1>And next time you see you wrap it up like a present and you just give a two</v>

984
00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:12.500
and there's a card in there and everything and then he just,

985
00:59:12.501 --> 00:59:14.060
this is what you'd do. You do that.

986
00:59:14.090 --> 00:59:17.850
You just humiliate the guy and you just open it up and just say, hey sweetheart,

987
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:19.380
just want to you, you,

988
00:59:19.381 --> 00:59:22.460
you just write from your heart about what a fucking bitchy is.

989
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:26.660
And it just is what you do. Don't ever, don't curse in it at all.

990
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:32.120
Write it really nice and lovely. Um, but in that,

991
00:59:32.121 --> 00:59:33.140
without ever cursing,

992
00:59:33.141 --> 00:59:36.920
just let them know what an absolute fucking pussy is for doing that. They,

993
00:59:36.921 --> 00:59:39.560
you go, oh, that's I think the I, you know what? I think that's a winner.

994
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:43.310
You know what? I might have to, I might have to outsource this to my listeners.

995
00:59:43.311 --> 00:59:46.400
If you guys have better ideas on what to do there. Nobody gets hurt.

996
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:50.270
You made your point. It's fucking hilarious. And that's a funny, you know,

997
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:53.240
you tell people that this guy did it and they go, so what'd you do?

998
00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.740
He would tell my, I went out, I went to a lady's too.

999
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:57.650
She was doing bought bottom a pair of pumps.

1000
00:59:59.140 --> 00:59:59.560
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1001
00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.270
<v 1>And then you get to laugh and every time you see him just wave and just start</v>

1002
01:00:04.271 --> 01:00:06.280
calling him sweetheart, GIM a pet name.

1003
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:11.590
Maybe you give them a woman's name like Diane or something. Just, hey, Diane,

1004
01:00:11.591 --> 01:00:14.320
how'd you like the shoes? And just every fucking day,

1005
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:16.720
you can just do that forever.

1006
01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:19.693
<v 7>I don't know.</v>

1007
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:22.950
<v 1>It made me feel better about the situation. Maybe you can do that.</v>

1008
01:00:22.951 --> 01:00:25.840
Who the fuck knows? Anyways, good luck with that. Uh,

1009
01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.540
but don't do any physical harm or real property. That's the, the,

1010
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.370
the brilliance. I'm a said genius. Pat Myself on the back there.

1011
01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:34.280
Sorry about that. Um, that's,

1012
01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:39.120
that's what I like about the last plant is that you're not hurting him.

1013
01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:43.380
You write it eloquently. You're not cursing. There's nothing he can really do.

1014
01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:48.630
You just bought him a gift that you give. You give a woman, it's perfect.

1015
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:54.150
You know, I'd send them some candy on Valentine's Day. Just, Ah,

1016
01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:57.900
just torture the guy. But you just keep giving them gifts,

1017
01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.413
<v 7>you know?</v>

1018
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:03.820
<v 1>I don't know. What else? What's The f? Get them some flats.</v>

1019
01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:06.303
<v 9>Okay.</v>

1020
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:10.830
<v 1>I don't know. It's a bunch of shit like that. I don't know who the fuck knows.</v>

1021
01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:14.520
Maybe you just do it once and then that's it. And then what you do.

1022
01:01:14.521 --> 01:01:18.990
And then right after that you replant the grass and then you just let them know

1023
01:01:18.991 --> 01:01:21.930
that you know that he did it and he's going to be too much of a bitch to try to

1024
01:01:21.931 --> 01:01:23.610
do it again. And um,

1025
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:26.970
then he can tell your dad years later that that's don't tell your dad that you

1026
01:01:26.971 --> 01:01:30.210
did it and then years later you're telling me you did it when you have an a pint

1027
01:01:30.211 --> 01:01:34.020
and you guys can fucking laugh your balls off. Alright, work argument.

1028
01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.710
Um, hey bill, I work with some real morons.

1029
01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:42.360
I'm in sales so everyone is a hotheaded tool. Really.

1030
01:01:42.361 --> 01:01:44.730
I thought you guys were like funny. It always seem like the salesman,

1031
01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.340
we're always breaking balls and being funny. Um,

1032
01:01:47.341 --> 01:01:51.510
they all think they're living in a sales movie. Oh, okay. Too many Glen Gary,

1033
01:01:51.511 --> 01:01:52.740
Glen Ross. All right.

1034
01:01:52.980 --> 01:01:57.450
We have set accounts and nothing about our job requires us to generate new

1035
01:01:57.451 --> 01:02:01.170
business from cold leads, but that doesn't stop these tools.

1036
01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:05.130
So the other day they're bitching about Saturday night live and how it's not

1037
01:02:05.131 --> 01:02:07.710
funny anymore. That's not really a big deal.

1038
01:02:07.711 --> 01:02:11.520
People always bitch about SNL even when it's good. That didn't bother me,

1039
01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:16.560
but then they all started saying how they'd be funnier on the shell,

1040
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:21.240
you know, Jesus, here we go. This is like maybe watch. No,

1041
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.860
I guess it's not like that. All right, let's continue.

1042
01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:26.040
I'll just say it took me watching UFC be like, doe. Do you know what?

1043
01:02:26.041 --> 01:02:27.710
I want it done. Um,

1044
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:31.260
so this is when I chimed in and told them that it's harder than it looks and

1045
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:33.000
that they did not. They did not.

1046
01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:37.230
They did have a shot and that they did have a shot.

1047
01:02:39.810 --> 01:02:43.530
Oh, that if she left out a word there said it's harder than it looks.

1048
01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.460
And if they,

1049
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:48.160
if they did have a shot having no stage presence or x or experience,

1050
01:02:48.161 --> 01:02:51.930
they would end up freezing up. Then they'd be the guy who froze up,

1051
01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:53.520
whose face was everywhere.

1052
01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:57.240
I made the point to them that if they were offered a spot on SNL,

1053
01:02:57.450 --> 01:02:59.130
they'd be better to turn it down.

1054
01:02:59.190 --> 01:03:02.880
They'd have a happier life if they said no to SNL. Jesus,

1055
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:08.110
do you agree with this? And if you were offered SNL, would you take it? Um,

1056
01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:09.730
<v 0>okay.</v>

1057
01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:14.020
<v 1>Do I think that the people on SNL are funnier than a salesman? Yes, absolutely.</v>

1058
01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:17.290
Absolutely. Do I think that they would freeze up now? Not necessarily.

1059
01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:21.010
They would probably, you know, maybe a few would freeze up.

1060
01:03:21.011 --> 01:03:25.450
Others would get dry mouth and still plow through it. Others would ham it up,

1061
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:31.290
you know, who knows. Um, I dunno. Um,

1062
01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:32.590
<v 0>okay.</v>

1063
01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:35.760
<v 1>There, I mean, if they offered me SNL,</v>

1064
01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:37.480
I would know that they were in a lot of trouble.

1065
01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:39.940
I'm a 48 year old man next month.

1066
01:03:39.941 --> 01:03:44.310
I think that they like to try to get young talent and um,

1067
01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:46.350
I think that window was closed.

1068
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:50.710
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1069
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:53.810
<v 1>Um, having said that, I've got nothing but respect. It seems like having,</v>

1070
01:03:53.811 --> 01:03:57.080
just trying to write a fucking cartoon where we got all the fucking time in the

1071
01:03:57.081 --> 01:04:01.130
world to do this shit where they have to come out with a brand new, you know,

1072
01:04:01.190 --> 01:04:06.130
90 minutes minus fucking commercials. Um, what's that?

1073
01:04:06.131 --> 01:04:09.820
90 minus 24 to get technical eight minutes every half hour.

1074
01:04:09.821 --> 01:04:13.990
That's seven 64 fucking 66 minutes a week. Fuck you.

1075
01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:18.040
There's no way I've or I've heard nothing, but that's an absolute,

1076
01:04:18.890 --> 01:04:23.580
it takes a special personality to be able to do a, to handle that.

1077
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:24.780
And, um,

1078
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:28.860
I would actually be worried about what it would do to my standup career,

1079
01:04:28.861 --> 01:04:32.130
having that level of a commitment. Um,

1080
01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:37.340
which is why I prefer to do a role in a movie where it's just sort of like,

1081
01:04:38.121 --> 01:04:41.090
okay, we got you from here to here. So it's a finite thing.

1082
01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:45.100
Without that SNL shit is just like, I don't know when they started,

1083
01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:49.210
when they stopped, but it just seems to be a, it's a hell of a commitment. But,

1084
01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:53.710
um, yeah, so they go, did I answer your question? Um,

1085
01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.480
well if you get offered SNL, who says fucking no to that? Um,

1086
01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:05.440
I dunno. I Dunno if I get that off. Why am I fucking stressing over this?

1087
01:05:05.441 --> 01:05:06.274
It's not happening.

1088
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.640
<v 0>Okay. But</v>

1089
01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.580
<v 1>anyways, thank you for sticking up for everybody on SNL. I appreciate that.</v>

1090
01:05:11.650 --> 01:05:12.600
All right. Okay.

1091
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:17.440
Here's the last one from a lady from a fucking lady,

1092
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:23.020
a woman proposing Yo baby kegs. Billy Bird. Uh, just curious.

1093
01:05:23.021 --> 01:05:26.200
What are your thoughts? What are your, what? Oh,

1094
01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:28.940
just curious what your thoughts are. Sorry everybody, I'm bad at this.

1095
01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:33.760
Just curious what your thoughts are on women proposing love you.

1096
01:05:33.761 --> 01:05:37.540
Thanks for advocating for pitfalls. Hope to see you soon.

1097
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:40.540
Please don't use my name while they never show me your name. Um,

1098
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.680
I think that's a bad move on the woman's part.

1099
01:05:47.550 --> 01:05:50.740
Uh, I think you guys generally speaking,

1100
01:05:50.741 --> 01:05:54.880
are more gun Ho to get married than guys are.

1101
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:56.110
And um,

1102
01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:01.390
if you propose to a guy and he's too much of a pussy to say no.

1103
01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:02.383
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1104
01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:06.770
<v 1>Um, and then you, you ended up marrying the wrong person.</v>

1105
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:09.500
I think as a woman you should wait for the fucking guidance.

1106
01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:13.920
And I think there's a reason why the guy asks. Um,

1107
01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:18.600
it's because we don't want to do it. So if we are actually asking,

1108
01:06:18.601 --> 01:06:21.330
then you know, you with the [inaudible], most of them end up in divorce.

1109
01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:24.860
You know what, I don't know. Um,

1110
01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:29.630
I don't know. That could be maybe be kind of cool. Okay.

1111
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:33.850
There's something cute about it. I can tell you that, not talk it down to you,

1112
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:38.820
but, uh, I used to always fake proposed to Nia

1113
01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:44.460
and I used to always go near, I'm proposing to you right now.

1114
01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:46.410
And she would always be laughing, going,

1115
01:06:46.411 --> 01:06:51.030
I was fucking around and I would always go, I propose that we break up.

1116
01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:55.860
It was a silly joke and he used to always make her fucking laugh. Um,

1117
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:59.400
I dunno.

1118
01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:04.400
She was real cute during that time when she like wanted me to ask and uh,

1119
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:09.590
I don't know. My wife's fucking adorable. So I mean, what am,

1120
01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.210
what am I going to do? Um,

1121
01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:16.320
took a special kind of fucker woman to trick me into doing this.

1122
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.640
She didn't trick me. Anyways, that's the podcast for this week.

1123
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:26.640
I don't know if I have any advertising left anymore, but who gives a fuck?

1124
01:07:26.641 --> 01:07:28.140
I never did it for that anyways. Right.

1125
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:32.920
I'll go out and go dance for my supper tonight. I don't need your advertising,

1126
01:07:33.010 --> 01:07:37.110
the water money. Although I loved it. Oh, I love that. Advertising whore money.

1127
01:07:37.530 --> 01:07:41.910
Maybe I still have it. Who knows? Um, that's the podcast.

1128
01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:46.000
Once again. Um, I will try to take some video. Um,

1129
01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:48.800
this week I actually made a couple of ones,

1130
01:07:48.801 --> 01:07:51.620
but I made one for version and I made one for fucking Dean del Rey,

1131
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.140
so it's got their name on it. When I say,

1132
01:07:54.141 --> 01:07:55.550
maybe I'll just post those fucking things.

1133
01:07:55.551 --> 01:07:59.420
I don't have to fucking move my truck out again, do I? Um, anyways, that's it.

1134
01:07:59.421 --> 01:08:02.750
That's a podcast for this week. Thanks for listening. Go fuck yourselves.

1135
01:08:02.751 --> 01:08:06.860
And I'll check on a Thursday. Let's go blues.
