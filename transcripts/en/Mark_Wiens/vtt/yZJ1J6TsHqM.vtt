00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:00.938
- It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:03.783
I am in Saigon, Ho CHi Minh City, Vietnam.

00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:06.068
One of the most common
meals that you'll see

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:07.185
walking around the city

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:10.284
is the combination of
broken rice with pork chop,

00:00:10.284 --> 00:00:12.605
a grilled pork chop on top of it.

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:16.183
So I have just arrived
at a restaurant called

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.600
Com Tam Ba Ghien.

00:00:18.898 --> 00:00:21.115
I think, I believe that's
how you pronounce it,

00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:24.515
and this is one of the most
well-known restaurants in Saigon

00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:27.467
for the combination of broken rice

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:29.989
with a grilled pork chop on top.

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.784
I can actually smell the
pork from down the street.

00:00:33.784 --> 00:00:36.451
(eastern music)

00:00:38.693 --> 00:00:41.443
(city commotion)

00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:56.030
So they are just grilling up

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.067
a mind-blowing amount of pork.

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:01.526
It's like a giant bucket
full of pork, and they

00:01:01.526 --> 00:01:03.440
are just continuously grilling.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.878
It's not quite lunchtime,
it's just before lunch

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:08.457
so I think they are
preparing for the lunch-rush.

00:01:08.457 --> 00:01:10.574
But it looks like a lot
of people just drop by

00:01:10.574 --> 00:01:12.287
on their motorbikes for take-away,

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:16.115
as is the case with a lot of
street food here in Vietnam.

00:01:16.115 --> 00:01:17.862
But they also have a
pretty big dining room,

00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:21.695
sizable dinning room
that you can sit and eat.

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:25.196
I am just in a sauna of

00:01:25.196 --> 00:01:27.054
grilled pork smoke right now.

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:29.904
Okay, so I ordered up the works here.

00:01:29.904 --> 00:01:33.500
The giant grilled pork
chop is on the bottom here,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.750
and then I got a fried egg.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.584
These are like pickles.

00:01:39.538 --> 00:01:42.592
And then, moving, revolving
over to this side,

00:01:42.592 --> 00:01:45.189
it looks just like some other pork,

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.627
and then I think this is pork skin.

00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:51.794
And then this is some kind
of Vietnamese meatloaf.

00:01:53.407 --> 00:01:54.996
It's like meatloaf or something,

00:01:54.996 --> 00:01:56.135
and I don't know what the yellow stuff is,

00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:58.184
I have no idea.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.119
Is that it?

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.064
There might be some other things
hiding in the bottom, too,

00:02:01.064 --> 00:02:02.127
I don't even know.

00:02:02.127 --> 00:02:06.384
And then the sauce, of course,
is like a fish sauce chili.

00:02:06.384 --> 00:02:09.398
And I'm gonna set that on the side.

00:02:09.398 --> 00:02:10.907
Actually, I think I might need

00:02:10.907 --> 00:02:12.823
to wash my hands for this one.

00:02:12.823 --> 00:02:16.470
Let me grab one of
these little towelettes.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.023
At nearly every single
restaurant they serve you these,

00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:22.328
but they do cost a little bit of money,

00:02:22.328 --> 00:02:23.436
so you don't have to use them

00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:26.471
but I think I need it for this.

00:02:26.471 --> 00:02:27.304
Yeah.

00:02:27.304 --> 00:02:31.305
This definitely looks like
a meal I need a napkin for.

00:02:31.305 --> 00:02:34.660
I'm gonna go for that pork chop first.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.963
Just look at the size,

00:02:35.963 --> 00:02:38.244
just look at the size of that pork chop.

00:02:38.244 --> 00:02:40.968
That's pretty good size for sure.

00:02:40.968 --> 00:02:41.949
And the fried egg,

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.003
I'm gonna scoot the fried
egg over to the side first.

00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:46.149
I'm gonna dig straight in for

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:48.732
a piece of the pork chop first.

00:02:49.708 --> 00:02:52.232
Oh man, this looks amazing.

00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:55.315
And maybe a little bit of that sauce.

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:58.539
And all their green onions down there too,

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:02.156
the rice, all that just looks wonderful.

00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:04.656
Okay, oh that looks beautiful.

00:03:15.683 --> 00:03:16.516
Oh yes.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.618
Oh, that's good.

00:03:19.618 --> 00:03:22.285
That pork is so tender and so...

00:03:24.182 --> 00:03:25.815
It's a little bit sweet,

00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:28.051
but it's so tender,

00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:30.801
and it's so smokey, so flavorful.

00:03:32.823 --> 00:03:35.497
Broken rice is very common in Saigon,

00:03:35.497 --> 00:03:38.138
but it has really kind
of a nice texture to it.

00:03:38.138 --> 00:03:40.052
It's soft, but at the same time,

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:44.785
the grains of rice really
retain their kinda crunchiness,

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:47.984
so it's not like a fluffy
rice, but it's more of a solid,

00:03:47.984 --> 00:03:49.734
more of a dense rice,

00:03:51.404 --> 00:03:53.951
and it goes really good with meat.

00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:57.982
This plate is truly the
supreme combination.

00:03:57.982 --> 00:04:00.923
Okay, I'm gonna try some of this meatloaf,

00:04:00.923 --> 00:04:03.365
and again, add some more,

00:04:03.365 --> 00:04:06.174
drizzle some more sauce in there,

00:04:06.174 --> 00:04:07.677
and this looks like it definitely

00:04:07.677 --> 00:04:10.427
could use a chili with this bite.

00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:15.114
Luckily, there are some
chilies there as well.

00:04:17.518 --> 00:04:19.518
Get that chili on there.

00:04:29.503 --> 00:04:31.588
I don't know what that is,

00:04:31.588 --> 00:04:33.005
but it's so soft,

00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:35.767
and I think there are,

00:04:37.941 --> 00:04:39.075
among the noodles,

00:04:39.075 --> 00:04:43.242
stuff in that, that's like
a mild meatloaf sausage.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.958
It's good, and with that chili

00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.925
that gave it a beautiful
sour chili flavor as well.

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:53.823
Then I'll go in for some of the skin

00:04:53.823 --> 00:04:55.656
and all that goodness.

00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:00.402
Bit of the sauce.

00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:08.794
(restaurant employees preparing food)

00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:15.694
That is good!

00:05:15.694 --> 00:05:16.694
Really good!

00:05:21.797 --> 00:05:25.267
If things could not get
better, a fried egg...

00:05:25.267 --> 00:05:27.417
Oh! (laughs)

00:05:27.417 --> 00:05:30.015
If things could not
get better, a fried egg

00:05:30.015 --> 00:05:31.674
with a runny yoke.

00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:33.516
Oh my goodness.

00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:34.760
Wow!

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.260
This is just the ultimate, supreme, fatty,

00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:40.574
and glorious,

00:05:41.918 --> 00:05:43.864
protein combination.

00:05:43.864 --> 00:05:46.447
Look at that pool of yoke, wow!

00:05:48.055 --> 00:05:50.472
Okay, grab pork, grab pork...

00:05:51.316 --> 00:05:55.776
There's a little trough
of egg yoke in there.

00:05:55.776 --> 00:05:58.776
This is getting messy and beautiful.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.303
Chase it with a chili.

00:06:11.215 --> 00:06:12.048
Or two.

00:06:14.593 --> 00:06:16.175
That is unbelievably good.

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:17.758
This is sort of starting to look

00:06:17.758 --> 00:06:20.591
like an abstract painting of food.

00:06:22.807 --> 00:06:25.057
Let me take the bite, yeah.

00:06:26.395 --> 00:06:30.145
Looks like I gotta
hanging piece of pig skin.

00:06:38.444 --> 00:06:39.277
Oh man.

00:06:39.277 --> 00:06:40.553
I'm not sure if you're suppose to

00:06:40.553 --> 00:06:43.022
just cut it off the bone with your fork,

00:06:43.022 --> 00:06:44.979
but I see a lot of people picking it up,

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.245
and then just gnawing on it,

00:06:46.245 --> 00:06:48.912
so that is what I'm about to do.

00:06:55.781 --> 00:06:57.250
That's very tasty!

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.525
Very tasty indeed.

00:06:59.525 --> 00:07:01.023
It's sweet and salty,

00:07:01.023 --> 00:07:02.728
and tender,

00:07:02.728 --> 00:07:05.478
it has some good texture as well.

00:07:10.532 --> 00:07:12.904
That was an awesome meal.

00:07:12.904 --> 00:07:15.621
The combination of all those meats,

00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:18.378
and the grilled pork, and the rice,

00:07:18.378 --> 00:07:23.063
definitely a protein
pork-lovers dream come true.

00:07:23.063 --> 00:07:25.523
This whole restaurant is very impressive.

00:07:25.523 --> 00:07:30.485
They are grilling up some
serious quantities of pork here,

00:07:30.485 --> 00:07:33.068
and now the restaurant is full.

00:07:34.346 --> 00:07:36.459
There are plenty of people that come

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:38.704
just for take-away boxes, as well.

00:07:38.704 --> 00:07:42.440
There's smoke pouring from the
pork chop grilling station.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.433
If you could smell me, I probably smell

00:07:44.433 --> 00:07:46.870
like a giant pork chop, myself.

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.989
But that was delicious.

00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:53.476
This is a great restaurant to
come to when you're in Saigon.

00:07:53.476 --> 00:07:57.046
As we were eating, I
met up with Khan, right?

00:07:57.046 --> 00:07:58.260
- Yes, my name is Khan.

00:07:58.260 --> 00:07:59.570
- His name is Khan.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:00.757
Are you from Saigon?

00:08:00.757 --> 00:08:03.155
- Yes. I am from Saigon, District Three.

00:08:03.155 --> 00:08:04.174
- From District Three.

00:08:04.174 --> 00:08:07.913
So he's from Saigon. Are
you also eating here?

00:08:07.913 --> 00:08:08.746
- No, I'm...

00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:09.579
- Or are you just driving...

00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:10.660
- Yes I'm just walking through here.

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:12.654
- Oh, okay. Thank you, man.

00:08:12.654 --> 00:08:15.019
So he was just driving past

00:08:15.019 --> 00:08:17.397
and very cool to meet Khan.

00:08:17.397 --> 00:08:18.911
Thank you.

00:08:18.911 --> 00:08:19.803
Yes, man.

00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:20.781
- Great to meet you.

00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:21.750
- Great to meet you, man.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.130
- I love all of your videos.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:23.975
- Thank you.

00:08:23.975 --> 00:08:25.033
Thank you, man.

00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:26.256
- Hope to see you again.

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:27.760
- Thank you.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.315
Huge thank you to all of
you for recommending me

00:08:30.315 --> 00:08:33.650
this restaurant, this was
a restaurant that many of

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.118
you recommended, so thank you.

00:08:36.118 --> 00:08:39.630
Very, very cool restaurant and great food,

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.105
and lovely environment as well.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:45.355
Just an impressive amount
of pork being grilled here,

00:08:45.355 --> 00:08:48.974
so thank you for watching,
hope you enjoyed it.

00:08:48.974 --> 00:08:51.498
