1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,870
You're listening to radio on New
York public radio, public radio,W ,

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,550
N, y.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:21,680
[inaudible].

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,140
This is the sound of a what's,
what's this exact title of the piece?

5
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,860
3,580 this is the sound of 3,580

6
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,430
I'm knocking on an object that artists,

7
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,880
Terry Wilcox hopes will be here
long after we all turned to dust.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,540
It's actually fast. The
bedrock, the engineering is,

9
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,660
it will always stay on a 200 mile an
hour wind and maybe like right here,

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,850
it's like a nuclear bomb. 30 years ago,

11
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:48,620
Terry and a few cranes lifted this 40
foot stick and plunged it into this

12
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:51,180
boulder that we're standing
on, which overlooks the Hudson.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,820
The George Washington
bridge is to our right.

14
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,230
The sculpture reflects the sun like a
mirror and it's made out of two metals,

15
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,770
aluminum on the outside and magnesium.
The pieces, the concept is simple.

16
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:05,390
One day, many months from now.
These two metals will be one,

17
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,180
but phenomenon is they're mixing together.
How do you mean physically there?

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,400
The layers where the metals are touching,
they're physically intermingling,

19
00:01:13,401 --> 00:01:14,960
they're evaporating into each other.

20
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,290
It's a process called diffusion and I've
got to tell you how I heard about it.

21
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,270
Uh,

22
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:24,270
in 1968 they've opened some minor tomb
and Egypt and they find golden led bars

23
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:27,290
piled up in the corner.

24
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,970
The tomb was about 5,000 years old
and the bars had become a solid piece.

25
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,240
They think it's happening on an
atomic level, but they're not sure,

26
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,990
but something is making the
metals mix. Maybe just time,

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,000
time cracks. Foundations are
roads, borders erases anything.

28
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:48,500
Man Creates civilization. Art,
particularly art time hates art.

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,360
That's why museums have restores.

30
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,260
But here's Terry tried to
collaborate with time. In fact,

31
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:57,620
he says this piece won't be done
until time takes the aluminum in.

32
00:01:57,621 --> 00:01:59,720
The magnesium infuses them together,

33
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
which he calculates will take 1,495 years.

34
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,460
In a sense that is when
this clock will chime.

35
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,780
But until then, all you can
really do is look at it.

36
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,590
So we walk around this piece, oh,
somebody made it up, up on this side.

37
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,210
God bless you. Think they scaled
up there on the bolt. Sure.

38
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,100
Says a bill,

39
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,910
Bill number 98 or something underneath
bill 98 I got to park officials have

40
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:33,300
slapped on some antique graffiti paint
and some of those paints. The wet

41
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,100
Terry pulls out a pocket
knife and starts to chip away

42
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,330
underneath the paint. We find
more graffiti with the graffiti

43
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,490
and we find a bullet hole.
This is a bullet. Gosh,

44
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,340
somebody shot your art.
That's pretty funny.

45
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,850
Do you think it'll make it
[inaudible] d 3,500 year journey?

46
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,503
I have no idea.

47
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,090
What do you think the world will look
like when this piece is finished?

48
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,020
Do you think any of these buildings that
George Washington Bridge will be there?

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,900
These buildings? No.

50
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,160
While I tried to get Terry to philosophize
with me, a group of kids approach

51
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,980
[inaudible] how old are you
guys? 15. Nobody. [inaudible]

52
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,390
how long did it take to, to
Macon? Uh, almost two years.

53
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,410
And when he explains that it won't be
done until these kids and their kids and

54
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:37,300
72 generations yet to come are all dead
and gone. The reaction is interesting.

55
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,770
How come you guys would touch,

56
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:45,040
I mean what makes you want to touch it
and grab it, make it seem this real.

57
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,910
They begin to touch the sculpture,
put their palms flat against it.

58
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,320
A few even hug it to not cite you. See,

59
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,960
but understandable and it comes
through helps from the scene impulses.

60
00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,070
Terry's art has the graffiti of wanting
to leave something of yourself behind.

61
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,660
Send something of yourself forward
into the future as if to say,

62
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,630
I was here if only furniture

63
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,293
[inaudible].

64
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,690
I'm Chad, I've, I'm rod
and this is radio lab.

65
00:04:26,691 --> 00:04:31,691
Today on our program stories
and conversations with
people who swim upstream and

66
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:32,690
the river of time,

67
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,630
even though it's an impossible task
and speaking of the impossible,

68
00:04:35,631 --> 00:04:40,631
here's my cohost Robert Krulwich and in
this hour we will be having an argument

69
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:44,720
with time. We will talk to scientists
who say that time doesn't exist.

70
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,930
We will talk to stubborn people who
argue that, but maybe it exists,

71
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:50,870
but we're going to pretty much refuse
to notice and we'll hear from a guy who

72
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:52,850
thinks he can turn time around,

73
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,880
turn it back or defeat
it through sheer will.

74
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,620
Then to get things started. Terry Wilcox,

75
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,350
the guy we just heard from toward the
end of our conversation, I asked him,

76
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,470
what are you afraid of? A
nuclear bomb maybe coming home,

77
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:09,530
blowing everything away, your sculpture
included and this is what he said,

78
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,700
no, what scares me are the guys out at
Stonybrook. We were just at our dinner,

79
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,510
two of these physicists who
have the government funding
and are trying to create

80
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:20,780
a universe. I'm not kidding.
You know, they're called like,

81
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:23,240
you know what happened the last time a
universe is created? And he says, yeah,

82
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:26,180
they were kind of worried about
that. They may do very well

83
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:29,390
odd things. It's Stonybrook,
so it's e which is, um,

84
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,850
the location of one of the big super
colliders in the eastern United States at

85
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,430
Brookhaven is called
Robert Krulwich. Yeah.

86
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,620
And so I went on the tour with the tour
guide was named Todd. He was wearing,

87
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,360
as I remember, a Hawaiian shirt and
shorts. Now that it was a little freezing,

88
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,640
but he said, all right, let's, let's,

89
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:53,350
let me show you around so we can give
you a little tour around our rig.

90
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,850
It's two and a half miles around is
almost the size of the Indy 500 race track

91
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,710
and we drove alongside a tube.
I guess that's what it was.

92
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:08,360
It was maybe 2025 feet high, kind
of like a tunnel covered with grass,

93
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,300
just driven around the once
and it took her, I don't know,

94
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:13,970
about 10 15 minutes to
get all the way around.

95
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,050
Now imagine doing that 78,000 times
a second and you're a prototype.

96
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,350
I have never been approached on,

97
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,670
but this does sound a fast and
because this is a collider,

98
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,470
the idea here would be to have the
proton collide or bump into something

99
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,100
with such force in such violence that
for one instant it gets very hot,

100
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,590
hotter than the center of the sun,

101
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:46,160
as hot as it got near
the instant of creation.

102
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,670
And that's why this is
called the super collider.

103
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,750
The universe one day was there, right?

104
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,300
You can't get before, right.
That's mystery line and that's,

105
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:06,930
that's what physicists call a singularity.
Everything breaks down and principle.

106
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,240
Unless, unless you're God,

107
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:12,240
you can't look behind that
because time doesn't even exist.

108
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,820
Times he says to have meaning,

109
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,940
then she want a chip toe
right up to the beginning.

110
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:21,520
You can't get to the actual
beginning, but to the first instance,

111
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,930
it's the instant after
the beginning, right?

112
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,360
We have a pretty good idea of how the
universe looked up to a few seconds after

113
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,170
the Big Bang and what we're doing here
is we're getting down into thousands of a

114
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:35,940
second after the big bang.

115
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,150
We're in a huge empty room.

116
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:47,400
What roughly the size of a blimp
hanger. A blimp hanger small blimp,

117
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,730
and we are at one of the
collision points right now, right?

118
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:54,900
One of the collision points right now
has only about 45 or 50 feet that way.

119
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,340
That's the place in the collider where
they expect to see these smash ups

120
00:07:59,341 --> 00:08:04,290
between two protons and it's at these
points you should get just for an instant.

121
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,570
The heat and the debris and the chaos.

122
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:10,380
That's kind of like what the universe
was like at the very beginning of time.

123
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,710
This is the closest to the beginning
of the universe you'll ever get.

124
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,330
Give me a football and you can make
a pass into the early universe.

125
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,160
There's a kind of a funny sense like of
Eden that physicists have about the very

126
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:28,670
first instance of the universe. Um,

127
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,550
do you think that the beginning was
more beautiful than now? I mean,

128
00:08:31,551 --> 00:08:32,510
now it's pretty nice,

129
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,010
but for some reason I noticed that people
who do what you do love the beginning.

130
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,130
Well, why is that? They
love the questions.

131
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,580
We can explain in a physical sense
using our little mathematical equations.

132
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,870
Almost everything that we see now,

133
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,680
what we try and do is we try and smash
our rocks hard enough to get some glimpse

134
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:56,640
of what happened then because that's
the untold story. In the beginning,

135
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,080
there was a kind of, um, simple beauty,

136
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:01,980
very simple.

137
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,550
So one of the motivating thoughts
behind all these questions is,

138
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,780
can I see it before it got complicated?
Is that a part of this? That's,

139
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:16,050
that's a deep part of it. The
further back you go, you hope,

140
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:20,610
the simpler the explanations become,
the more beautiful. In some sense,

141
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,680
the modern world is ruled
by complexity and chaos.

142
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,730
The interactions of billions and
billions of particles ending up in this

143
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:31,620
conversation among other things.

144
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,790
And none of it is really predictable
because it's very, um, it's, it's,

145
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,710
it's complexity of its finest.

146
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,810
So we're looking for the simple
origins of things and then you get the,

147
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,530
um, uh,

148
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:48,530
in some sense being cast out of Eden by
having all of those simple things coming

149
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,230
up and creating very,
very complex situations.

150
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,050
The world we have now has so many elements
in elementary particles and rules and

151
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:02,910
forces. It's messy. That's now.

152
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,620
Then it was just nicer.

153
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:09,930
[inaudible]

154
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,830
moving right along.

155
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:16,340
Here's a story about a guy whose like
these physicists trying to move backwards

156
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,930
to a simpler time. And his trajectory
is not without its collisions too.

157
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,430
He's not a physicist though. He
thinks about physics. He's an artist.

158
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:30,690
A painter sells paintings for
thousands and thousands of dollars.

159
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:34,740
But you might say that David McDermott's
greatest work of art is himself,

160
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,120
his obsessive devotion to living
as if the president never happened.

161
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,750
It's like standing at the shore and
trying to keep the tide from coming in.

162
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:45,660
It's impossible. But if
you do it fiercely enough,

163
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:49,440
it's also a little
heroic Swedish producer.

164
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,610
Marcus Lyndon visited David McDermott
at his 19th century home in Ireland

165
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:58,600
walking into David McDermott's house.
It's like stepping into an old photo.

166
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,020
Brad [inaudible]. You're coming.

167
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,610
I can go warm. We start in front
of the fireplace. Fire Heat.

168
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,420
Get your warm, very pointed.

169
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,460
David wears a green flannel dressing gown,

170
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,120
a white knight cam and a
Fox spur around his neck.

171
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,580
He sort of looks like a small old
lady. When I sit and look into my fire,

172
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,440
I can feel all the people that
went for me and had their fires.

173
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,580
That's the same fire that the
earliest of human beings, right

174
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,463
looking at.

175
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,790
Most people do not need
to live in the present.

176
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,030
Most people don't need
to live in the present.

177
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,250
Everybody doesn't need to live in
the present. You living in the past,

178
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,460
I f I find secrets.

179
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,550
I'm to learn his secrets, great things,

180
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,840
useful, really good things. He shows
me one of them. Well, for example,

181
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:06,290
here's the chamber pot next to the
bed. Yeah, at Blue Porcelain Bedpan.

182
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:10,540
That's where the urine is.
Through peeing through the night.

183
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,590
He lifts the lid off and shows
me his Pete from last night.

184
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,650
Most people hold their urine through
the night or they break their sleep and

185
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:25,291
they have to get up and pass through
the house to get to an electrified

186
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,850
bathroom. By the time they get
back to be completely broken,

187
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:33,910
their sleep patterns, you
can get out of your bed,

188
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,340
you pee and you go back in your bed,

189
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,460
but it's still enough time
to stay in your dream.

190
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,300
He takes me to the bathroom
to empty the bed pants.

191
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:49,450
I mean here's a bit of something
new. There's very few modern things.

192
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:51,040
I mean here's something modern.

193
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,500
You're just going to plastic
this cap on the toothpaste.

194
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,310
See Cause I was going to throw
that away just to show you

195
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,120
and I'll throw that away.

196
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,630
Even though the toothpaste
will dry at the top.

197
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,750
You said that is what you've
sacrificed, dry toothpaste,

198
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,920
your the realistic fuel to get
rid of that. How do you cope?

199
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:16,660
This project seems so huge. It
goes into so, so many details.

200
00:13:16,661 --> 00:13:20,500
So small details like the
toothpaste, the cap being in plastic,

201
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,630
but in the past was not
put together by one person,

202
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,770
wasn't put together by one person and I
am in a position of having to cover all

203
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:36,170
areas. And you think it's easy to put
that 19th century world back together?

204
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,540
Well, it's not at all. It's very,

205
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:43,541
very difficult because there's no one
around any any longer who all can do

206
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:44,744
anything.

207
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,850
I'm saying the past is
so rich and so wealthy.

208
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,030
Think that every year, 19 eight
every year has some music,

209
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,440
manners, science, magic,
culture, architects.

210
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,720
Every year

211
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,760
the contemporary people
want to create more.

212
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,540
They can't even deal with what they have.
Are we going to do the kitchen? Yeah.

213
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,440
When he moved here a couple of years ago,

214
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,740
he replaced everything
new with something old.

215
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,390
So you having fun now this was a whole
modern kitchen and he ripped this out.

216
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:26,020
He even had the newly
renovated kitchen torn out

217
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,130
out because it was too modern.
There was a modern floor.

218
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:34,720
I ripped the modern floor up and I found
the old floor used to be a wall here

219
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,710
and the door was,

220
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:40,710
I made a conscious decision
when I was 13 years old and I

221
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,770
decided that I would never be able
to compete in the modern world.

222
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,640
I listened to my teachers at the school
and they explained what the modern world

223
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,860
was about and they told us that you had
to constantly keep up with the moment,

224
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,681
keep up with the moment,

225
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:00,980
keep up with the moment or you
would be destroyed by the society.

226
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,130
And I thought to myself, well,
I'll never be able to compete.

227
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:08,390
I'm still cleaning up. Oh, I'm going to
squish you some more. And so I thought,

228
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,330
well, I'll go backwards.

229
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,480
I'll talk to all the old people.

230
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:18,620
I learn everything about the
past and I'll go backwards.

231
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,300
I mean, I was already
interested in the past.

232
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:26,800
I loved history and I was very
interested in what had come before.

233
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,830
I looked at the photograph, the old
photographs of my family and I thought,

234
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:35,590
these are the same people,
but what a different world.

235
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,490
And I used to call the
past when I was younger,

236
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:42,580
I used to call it the place. Really.

237
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,230
I called it the place and I
would say I'm going to the place.

238
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,580
And to me the place was
the same as this world,

239
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,540
but everything was was good.

240
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,890
Eventually David stopped playing with
kids his own age and instead stood outside

241
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:05,080
beer halls and Harris alarms
and talked to old people.

242
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,700
Cause there was a strange feeling I had
when I was around these very old people.

243
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,580
I felt like they knew
something that I did know.

244
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,930
I should tell you something
else that is very interesting,

245
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,350
which has to do with homosexuality and
that is that I didn't see it in the world

246
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:31,231
that I grew up in and I thought that
homosexuality was something that didn't

247
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:37,120
exist anymore. I thought that it
was something from the past and it,

248
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,190
and a lot of the books were medical books.

249
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,650
It was all about treating
it like it was a disease.

250
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:46,330
So I thought it was some old
disease that I had, you know,

251
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:50,320
that was surfacing and I kept it a
secret. I kept it a secret for you.

252
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,253
Like

253
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:58,170
David opens up a closet and shows me
these old costumes and party dresses from

254
00:16:58,661 --> 00:17:01,660
his younger days in New
York. See, this is a shirt,

255
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,940
18th century and it's the exact same
shirt that I just saw in a museum that

256
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,580
belong to do or die. And
this is so old that operate.

257
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:16,180
It's just back in the 1980s
he and his partner, Peter,

258
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:20,780
were known in the art world as the time
travelers. Did you ever meet anymore?

259
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,790
I knew him. What was he
like? He was a queen,

260
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:30,270
but one point they were leading a group
of 20 artists trying to recapture life

261
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,410
in the 1920s horses in, in Brooklyn.

262
00:17:35,411 --> 00:17:37,330
We kept horses. We had carriages.

263
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,040
We were riding all upstate
on the road. These mad,

264
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,910
worst carriages. That was
something that was unbelievable.

265
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,100
Now it's only him. Hello. Hello.

266
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,700
Well, oh, it's me and I'm sorry.

267
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,470
And I'm waiting for this money to come
in. You're not desperate, are you David?

268
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,280
Someone money. Okay.

269
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,240
And paying him presents sort of a problem.

270
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,660
An unhappy coalition
between past and present.

271
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,160
Let's not talk because we'll never
get them on the buy side. Right.

272
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,560
He refuses to use credit or the Internet,

273
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,040
so he has to go to the bank to
withdraw the cash in person.

274
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,380
So we buy,

275
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,950
David has lent me an old 19th
century bike without any breaks.

276
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,460
He bikes fast through the busy traffic
streets of Dublin and I end up far behind

277
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:34,024
him.

278
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:40,410
We catch up later in the bank tellers
nine so what was the other Russian boats?

279
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,280
You have to withdraw money or, yes,

280
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:50,340
I have to come to the bank to withdraw
money when I need it because I insist on

281
00:18:53,921 --> 00:18:55,780
doing the banking old fashion.

282
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,110
But don't if you're frustrated now when
you're like right in the middle of a

283
00:18:59,111 --> 00:19:02,560
modern bank with a television going on
and all these modern things surrounding

284
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:06,430
us. No, it's just the way that
you might have a nightmare.

285
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,740
Yeah, this is, this is a nightmare.

286
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,970
Leaving David's apartment,

287
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,020
going to the bank and then
returning is a little disorienting,

288
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,780
like stepping in and
out of a time capsule,

289
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,590
safe and warm in his bedroom.

290
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,400
He puts more coal on the fire and we
sit down next to each other on the bed

291
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,600
naked. Right now you're take that walk.

292
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:38,430
So in terms of time, I do believe that

293
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,820
we can travel in time.

294
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,300
I'm not talking to you about actual time,

295
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:52,130
I'm trying to talk in terms of practical
terms that everyone can participate in

296
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,720
this, I call it time experimentation.

297
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,950
Anyone he cleans can choose their period
in history like watching a merchant

298
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,330
ivory film and then stepping in

299
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,200
water to travel in time. We have
to first except the principle.

300
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,800
The time is here,

301
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,340
has always been here
and always will be here.

302
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,650
In other words,

303
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:22,210
this moment in time that
we're experiencing has always
been here and always will

304
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:26,230
be. But this moment in time as
you're listening now on the radio,

305
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,800
on the asthma I voice
comes across a wireless.

306
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:35,250
This is a permanent fixture
of the universe that I've
always spoken on the radio

307
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,970
and I always will speak on the radio
and you will always be listening and you

308
00:20:39,971 --> 00:20:43,480
always have been listening. But,
but Jake understand that concept.

309
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:48,400
G understand the concept. I try to
explain to him that I do his idea,

310
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,810
but only in theory. To me, time is linear.

311
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,960
It just is. There is a past,

312
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,830
a present and the future and
you can't jump in between,

313
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,450
but David says that way
of thinking it's a trap.

314
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:08,530
It's basically a death
trap and you will die.

315
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,300
I love having you. You're,
I'm having so much fun.

316
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:18,840
We're in the library. The
bookshelves are full of dusty,

317
00:21:18,841 --> 00:21:19,830
yellowed books,

318
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,100
articles for documents and Scipio
photos on one of the shelves,

319
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,220
an old replica of a royal crown.

320
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,810
This is probably something Midi with a
red velvet. Then Jew was on the side.

321
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:37,290
David tries it on. I
can transform reality.

322
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,930
This house and my man are with you.

323
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,800
I am seducing you into the past.

324
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,780
What do you think? I think it's,

325
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,580
I think it's super interesting.

326
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:01,440
We could be having still much
fun in this world, you know,

327
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,170
instead of the stupid
world we're living in.

producer Marcus Lyndon.

Krulwich and I will continue in a moment.

331
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,230
Okay. You're listening to radio
lab on New York public radio,

332
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:30,320
public radio, W and y c

333
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,040
your school more to come.

334
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,590
Hello, this is Abdullah Lenay
from Los Angeles, California.

335
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:44,950
Radiolab is supported in part by the
National Science Foundation and by the

339
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,570
jet here with Rama Crow,

340
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:09,520
which today on Radiolab
stories and conversations
about people who are defining

341
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,090
time swimming upstream in the
river of time, you might say.

342
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,860
And there's an extreme group of people
who say there's no such thing as time who

343
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:21,220
deny it completely. We heard from
one such person before the break.

344
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,510
Here he is again.

345
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,920
This moment in time that
we're experiencing has always
been here and always will

346
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:30,910
be. But this moment in time, as
you're listening now on the radio,

347
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,840
this is a permanent fixture of the
universe. That is David McDermott, uh,

348
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,060
an artist, an eccentric one at that.
So he's Kinda easy to write off. Well,

349
00:23:40,061 --> 00:23:42,640
I don't know. You don't have to write
him off because let me write him back on.

350
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,070
Very prominent physicist,
Brian Green, for example,

351
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,620
professor of Mathematics at
Columbia, author of many,

352
00:23:48,621 --> 00:23:51,800
many big fat books about this kind
of stuff. He agrees with them. Well,

353
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:52,634
here's the thing.

354
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,900
Many of us who have thought about this
have come to the conclusion that indeed

355
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:02,260
the time that we seem to experience as
a continuous flow is actually not a flow

356
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,470
at all. In other words,

357
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,980
I've always spoken on the radio and
I always will speak on the radio.

358
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:14,600
Each moment just exist. And you will
always be listening eternally if you will.

359
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,040
And you always have been listening.

360
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:19,820
It's not that the moment comes to life
at one moment in time that we call the

361
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:23,750
present and then somehow
drifts away into the past.

362
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,910
Every moment is an is forever.
But understand that concept.

363
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,080
G, understand the concept. That's
too weird. It's a tough idea.

364
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,870
Let me just make it even tougher. Okay.

365
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,910
Imagine if I go and just
hold my breath that moment,

366
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:41,690
which I just thought up.

367
00:24:41,691 --> 00:24:46,640
I think that moment could last in Brian's
world forever. Have you exhaled yet?

368
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,410
No. And the exhale could last forever.

369
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,000
Somewhere you're always inhaling and
somewhere you will be forever. Exhaling.

370
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,670
A very, very strange notion,

371
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,490
but it's the notion that
some would argue was shared.

372
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,270
My a guy I like to call Albert,

373
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,030
who Dane mentioned to

374
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,540
[inaudible].

375
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,820
Well, it actually starts
when Einstein was a child.

376
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,810
Michio Kaku is professor of physics
at City College in New York.

377
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,960
We read a children's book,

378
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,620
perhaps the most important children's
book ever written in the history of the

379
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:23,710
human race. It was a book written
by a German guy, Aaron Bernstein,

380
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,330
which asked the question,

381
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:30,630
what would it be like to outrace a
telegraph message in a telegraph wire?

382
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,070
In other words, to outrace electricity.

383
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,400
This was only the beginning because in
Einstein's head he thought of a different

384
00:25:37,401 --> 00:25:40,130
question. What would it be
like to outrace a light beam?

385
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,490
What would it look like?
According to Einstein mythology,

386
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,220
while normal boys worried
about girls in jobs,

387
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,670
Albert obsessed about light. For years.

388
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,110
Then when he was 26 years old,
finally he was about to go berserk.

389
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:58,250
He told his friend best Besto that I am
going crazy thinking about this problem

390
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:00,050
for 10 years. Bern, Switzerland.

391
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,190
That's where he and Besa were living at
the time and working as patent clerk.

392
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:06,830
The story goes one day,
Einstein's riding the bus to work

393
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,620
any gazes at the giant clock in the
center of town. It's a very famous clock.

394
00:26:14,621 --> 00:26:18,880
Very pretty clock. You've probably seen
pictures. No, lots of famous clock.

395
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,870
Many people have speculated
about that clock,

396
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,170
but we found the letter a
letter again to his friend bess.

397
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,000
I found the letters saying that yes,

398
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:28,360
he was moving away from that famous
clock tower in Bern, Switzerland,

399
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,720
but putting past bicyclists,

400
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:33,490
pedestrians and away from that big burn
clock who's insistent ticking seem to

401
00:26:33,491 --> 00:26:36,220
rule the world below and
then he had a thought.

402
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,600
How would that clock look if his little
bus suddenly zoomed off at the speed of

403
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,790
light? You said, no, wait a minute.

404
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,160
If this bus is traveling
at the speed of light,

405
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,350
then light from the clock
will never reach me.

406
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,740
Meaning the light from all the subsequent
ticks on that clock would never catch

407
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:56,340
up to his eyeballs. Therefore
the clock will be at rest.

408
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,250
The clock will be stationary forever,

409
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,810
but strangely his pocket watch on his
person. If you were to look at that,

410
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,750
it would be ticking just
fine. And then he said, quote,

411
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:12,300
a storm broke in my mind,

412
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,690
these are his exact words.

413
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,140
A storm broke in my mind and the very
next day he went to his friend Besso and

414
00:27:21,481 --> 00:27:25,110
says, I have solved everything. And
what he said to his friend Beso,

415
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,380
it's very simple but radical idea.

416
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,700
Time beets at different rates,
depending upon how fast you move.

417
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:38,250
If you go fast, your time slows down.
Not just your clock but your time,

418
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:42,720
your brain, everything about you,
SLOs, and they've proven this.

419
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,140
They've put clocks and airplanes flow in
airplanes around the world had a clock

420
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,920
in the ground when the
airplane decelerated and landed
and they compared the two

421
00:27:49,921 --> 00:27:54,390
clocks. They were different, a little
different, but they were different.

422
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:54,991
Now.

423
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:59,580
Theoretically the difference could be
thousands of years depending on how fast

424
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,070
the plane was traveling,
which raises a paradox.

425
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,000
How can you have two completely
different times and both of them,

426
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,930
according to Einstein, are
equally true, very, very puzzling.

427
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,430
Because if you have a time that's true
for you, right, and I have a time,

428
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,310
it's true for me and they're different
and they're different than what,

429
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,960
what is it? What does time,
what time do we have in common?

430
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,210
[inaudible]

431
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,290
Einstein struggle with this
very question from many, many

432
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,540
years and toward the end of his
life going to miss you. Akaka,

433
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,130
he dropped a hint for how he might've
resolved it in his mind and it was at the

434
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:40,360
funeral of his best friend Besa. Well,
when vessel had died, Einstein gave half.

435
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,150
What are the most moving
eulogies? He said,

436
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,350
time is an illusion that we who know. No,

437
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:51,490
there is no distinction between the
past, the present and the future.

438
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,990
It's a very moving quote
and he essentially saying
that in some sense, Bessel,

439
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,000
we'll live forever. Ever since then.

440
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,030
We physicists have been trying to
figure out what did he mean by that?

441
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,550
Maybe Albert Einstein was mourning his
friend here and just didn't want him

442
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:11,140
dead. And this was just poetry.
Yeah. But more likely it was, um,

443
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:15,070
it was his guests about
the nature of time,

444
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:20,071
how to handle the contradiction
of two very different moments,

445
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,890
past moments present. Almost Brian
Greene deals with this in his book,

446
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:24,910
fabric of the Cosmos.

447
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:30,060
The moments are they just exist and
somehow it's the human mind in each moment

448
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,920
that makes each moment
seem real. December 31st,

449
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,520
1999 I was at a New Year's party
and to this way of thinking,

450
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,500
I'll always be at that new year's
party because that moment is,

451
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,560
it exists. It's not that
it's somehow goes away.

452
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,270
My mind seems to organize things into
moments that are gone in moments that have

453
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:59,650
yet to be, but I think that's
my mind. Organizing things.

454
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,480
I don't think that's how the universe
has put together the moments just are,

455
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,020
but look where that leaves us.

456
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:12,800
That leaves us with everything that
you've done in your life exists already.

457
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:18,180
Yeah. Everything. Yeah. You're
beginning your middle and your end.

458
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,930
Every moment of time is out there.
You're dead. You're dead somewhere.

459
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,870
You're almost dead somewhere.
Yes. There's no special.

460
00:30:24,871 --> 00:30:29,700
Now you are saying to me
that there is no time,

461
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,010
as I understand it, no time.

462
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,020
Every moment of your life is
already there. Eternally frozen.

463
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,000
Every moment of my life is frozen.

464
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,900
Every moment of my children's life is
frozen and every moment of my great,

465
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,040
great, great, great.

466
00:30:44,041 --> 00:30:49,041
Grandchildren's lives are already there
and frozen and so the universe is a vast

467
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:54,940
collection of nows now. That's
right. And that that particular, no,

468
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,340
that is just ridiculous. It
just seems, first of all,

469
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,630
it denies so many things.
Denies the poetry of change.

470
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,150
Don't you see what's terribly
unsatisfying about that?

471
00:31:06,151 --> 00:31:10,800
That means you don't have any
options. Yeah. Freewill is a very,

472
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:13,980
a very difficult question
to answer for a physicist.

473
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:19,950
Are you happy with this in terms
of free will? I'm very free.

474
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,100
It was a very troubling issue. Well,

475
00:31:23,101 --> 00:31:25,800
you choose tonight to go
to the movies and I say,

476
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,110
let's go to see gone with
the wind. You say, no,

477
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,090
let's go see planets and tire
of attack of the fraternity.

478
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,890
The devils of the sheet levels.
Don't you like to think that you're,

479
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,840
that you have a real choice there?

480
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,820
I've gone to one. I
would love to think it.

481
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Do I know for a fact that the thought
and the impression of freewill is really

482
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:49,380
real? No, I don't know that
in my heart. I tell you,

483
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:52,980
I don't really know that. I suspect
it's real because it feels so real,

484
00:31:52,981 --> 00:31:57,900
but there are so many things about the
universe that we thought were real until

485
00:31:57,901 --> 00:31:59,100
we learned that they weren't,

486
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,270
but what I want to know about the future
is that I'm in some control of it.

487
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,780
Yeah. I want to fall in love
because I want to fall in love.

488
00:32:06,781 --> 00:32:10,590
I want to step across the sidewalk in
front of that car because I want to commit

489
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:11,790
suicide or whatever it is I want to do,

490
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:17,150
and I don't want the have you or your
pointy headed friends telling me that it's

491
00:32:17,221 --> 00:32:20,880
already there and I'm going to
somehow move from instant, instant,

492
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:24,450
all preplanned. Well again,
the poetry disappears.

493
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,630
Then the magic disappears and
then most important of all,

494
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,200
my command of myself disappears. Let
me give you an old, the alternative

495
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,020
that reinstates some of the poetry,

496
00:32:35,021 --> 00:32:37,630
some of the freewill that you're
longing for, and I got to,

497
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:41,640
I long for the same thing and
I do. I absolutely do. And I,

498
00:32:41,641 --> 00:32:43,580
and I feel like I have free will. I have,

499
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:47,090
I feel like I have the ability
to choose my next word.

500
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,810
I feel like that can do that. Do I
really have that freedom? I don't know.

501
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,020
I think are doing. Perhaps that's
enough. Just the illusion of the freedom.

502
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:58,100
But anyway, let me paint a alternative,
but highly related scenario.

503
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,420
In quantum theory,

504
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,450
some have suggested the so-called many
worlds interpretation that the universe

505
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,240
is not a single entity.
There are many universes.

506
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,580
We call them parallel universes.

507
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,850
Each of the choices that you make
is born out in one of these copies.

508
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,320
All right, I'll give it to
you. We're in a restaurant.

509
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:23,720
I am sitting there and it's
time for dessert. The waiter
approaches and he says,

510
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,420
would you like chocolate ice cream
or vanilla? I think this over.

511
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,910
If I choose vanilla

512
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:37,850
from then on, I'm in the Vanilla
Universe, but if I choose chocolate,

513
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,070
I'm in the chocolate units, so all the
consequences that flow from my vanilla,

514
00:33:43,071 --> 00:33:47,690
I say vanilla and then somebody named
Bonilla happens to come in and I fall in

515
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:50,810
love with vanilla and I married
vanilla. We have a lovely vanilla ethos,

516
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,730
but if I choose chocolate,

517
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:56,690
I go into a Mocha thing and I suddenly
am living in the Caribbean. Right.

518
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,290
All right, so this is a real
divider for me. Don't you see that?

519
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:03,410
This is like dumb. I mean like
it's an easy, when you say dumb,

520
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:07,280
can you just be more precise? There
are many criticisms of this picture,

521
00:34:07,281 --> 00:34:09,230
but I want to know which
one you have in mind.

522
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,810
The reason I think it's done is is
because it's like a pat solution.

523
00:34:11,811 --> 00:34:15,550
Like you say, okay, since I can't
get you free will the old way.

524
00:34:15,551 --> 00:34:18,620
What I'll do is I'll give you a lot
of universes so you can have it all.

525
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,810
You can have the chocolate university,
you can have the vanilla university.

526
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:26,970
A key thing is a key thing
is this proposal which was
put forward in about 1957

527
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,880
by a guy named Hugh Everett and then
developed by many people price to whit and

528
00:34:30,881 --> 00:34:35,350
so on was not put forward in order to
restore anything to do with free will.

529
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,420
These physicists, very,

530
00:34:37,421 --> 00:34:41,920
very high powered create a physicist
were studying quantum mechanics and they

531
00:34:41,921 --> 00:34:42,940
came to a puzzle.

532
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,200
If quantum theory says
there's a 30% chance you're
going to pick the vanilla ice

533
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:52,120
cream and say a 30% chance that you're
going to pick the chocolate ice cream and

534
00:34:52,121 --> 00:34:55,180
say a 40% chance that you're
going to pick pistachio,

535
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,870
and yet when we look at the
world and we look at what you do,

536
00:34:58,871 --> 00:35:01,300
you seem to choose one or the other.

537
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,490
Where do the other possibilities that
quantum theory said could happen?

538
00:35:06,491 --> 00:35:10,960
Where do they go? Do they just
disappear? Did they disappear? Well,

539
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:15,961
that is very hard to realize in the
actual structure of quantum theory itself.

540
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,480
You mean that physicists, when they
order chocolate, do they then think,

541
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:24,370
had I chosen vanilla my whole
life could have been? No.

542
00:35:24,371 --> 00:35:26,320
They don't think that
they say to themselves,

543
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:31,150
at least the fellows that believe say,
hmm, I chose Vanilla in this world,

544
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,880
but there's another version of
me that's now eating chocolate.

545
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,680
You guys are weird.

546
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,290
Well, hello there.

547
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,613
My,

548
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,690
I've been alone

549
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:52,370
now to be fair to Brian at a quantum
restaurant at a kosher quantum restaurant.

550
00:35:52,371 --> 00:35:54,180
That's really quantum. Are
they really such things?

551
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,330
I think for the purpose of this
argument, they will be okay.

552
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,900
Waiters will deliver you closed lids
of ice cream and they won't tell you

553
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,760
whether there's chocolate even
though they both in there.

554
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:04,700
They'll say mysteriously, I'm
usually, I think I'll have chocolate.

555
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:08,300
Chocolate pops into existence
and vanilla goes away. So why?

556
00:36:08,301 --> 00:36:12,020
That's why quantum scientist wonder where
things went because there's a mystery

557
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:16,190
here, but that's another story. I'm
sure your head is spinning. Yes,

558
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,630
it is fitting. My head is spinning. D,

559
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,460
do you feel it sometimes seems that
Einstein was the point at which physics

560
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:23,990
broke away from common sense?

561
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,830
Everything you've just told
me is utterly fascinating.

562
00:36:27,831 --> 00:36:29,810
And at the same time I really confusing.

563
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,490
How do you live your
life with knowing him?

564
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:34,760
Do you compartmentalize everything
that you study in this office?

565
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,840
Well, you know, um, late at night, um,

566
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:40,480
I think about these things
and it gives you the willies.

567
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,840
I do think about the fact that
there's an alternate meal out there.

568
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:48,690
A clone of me except by chose
totally different life paths and uh,

569
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,440
yeah, I can write down the equations,

570
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,510
the equations for these alternate
universities where I exist in another

571
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:57,790
universe. Perhaps Elvis
Presley's still alive.

572
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,920
A man. And funny,

573
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,200
I could ask that question.

574
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:08,450
Is Elvis Presley alive and
what are these universities?

575
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,080
At that point I had to
stop. I have to stop.

576
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,280
If this strikes you as a little too weird
that there could be a bazillion Mishi

577
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,830
was out there in the world in various
universities doing various things all at

578
00:37:21,831 --> 00:37:23,720
once. One of them could be talking to me,

579
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,280
but one of them could be
talking simultaneously to, okay.

580
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,960
One of them might be impersonating.

581
00:37:27,961 --> 00:37:30,360
I was cause remember it an
infinite number of universities,

582
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,220
you can do an infinite number of things

583
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,250
that we should keep in mind.
This is still just speculation.

584
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,340
And as particle physicists,
Lisa Randall likes to say,

585
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,760
I mean there's a big difference
between physics and philosophy.

586
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:44,590
You let that go away, you
sort of lost. Um, the,

587
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,630
the great thing that is
there in terms of physics,

588
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:51,980
which is the ability to actually make
testable predictions about the world.

589
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,750
Oh wait, oh wait a second. If she wants
a testable prediction about the world,

590
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,980
there have been experiments and real
science experiments I can thinking of one

591
00:37:59,981 --> 00:38:04,690
that was done in 1960 and was repeated
over and over since then that examined

592
00:38:04,691 --> 00:38:08,290
freewill and time in a very
interesting way. And by the way,

593
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,660
this experiment created an uproar,

594
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,570
especially among philosophers
because it's kind of a doozy.

595
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,830
It involves finger wiggling. So can
I have a little mood music please?

596
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,310
[inaudible]

597
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,990
the scientists invited a group of people
to come to the lab and sit down and

598
00:38:23,991 --> 00:38:25,280
have their brains monitored.

599
00:38:25,281 --> 00:38:27,950
And then according to the
neurologist vs Ramachandran,

600
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,990
they turned to their
subjects and they said,

601
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,870
at any time you wish wiggle your finger.
That sounds easy enough. Remember,

602
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,190
by the way, that to wiggle

603
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,700
your finger takes two steps. First
you have to decide to wiggle.

604
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,620
Then you wiggle. So you have to think
it before you do it, which takes what?

605
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:48,400
Like a 10th of our millions of a second
or something? Yeah, very short time.

606
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,120
So you sit there and you think,
okay, now I'm going to wiggle.

607
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,720
However, when we did this experiment,

608
00:38:55,721 --> 00:38:58,480
I may look back at the graphs of all
the brains of the people who did this.

609
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,510
What they found was your sensation that
you asked your finger to your finger to

610
00:39:05,381 --> 00:39:09,700
wiggle your sensation. The will came
a second after the brain kicked in.

611
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,940
If you looked at my brain waves
when I was wiggling my finger jet,

612
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,620
here's what you'd see first. You'd
see my brain getting ready to wiggle.

613
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,454
There's a spike

614
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:18,930
[inaudible]

615
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:22,590
or a blip is Ramachandra would
say, that's my brain getting ready.

616
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,920
And then second, you'd get a
second spike showing the wiggle.

617
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:27,870
So there's a blip.

618
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:28,590
Okay.

619
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,110
For Getting Ready. Yeah. And
then there's a blip for wiggle.

620
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:36,630
Now logic would tell you the way this
should go is first I decide to wiggle,

621
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:41,460
then my brain gets ready and then my brain
wiggles. Right? But when they looked,

622
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:46,790
what actually happens is before I decide
to wiggle before my brain mysteriously

623
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,430
is already getting ready. You,

624
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,240
even though you think you're
willing the brain to do something,

625
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,830
it's your brain that's willing you
to will. It's thinking ahead of you.

626
00:39:58,831 --> 00:40:02,040
And then your so called thinking
is a postdoc. Rationalization.

627
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,410
So I don't have any free will.
You don't have any free both.

628
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,610
That was the implication that
the philosophers came by.

629
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,960
Why can't you just say
that? The brain is a,

630
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,770
does a little bit of stuff before
you aware of it. It just always does.

631
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,020
It just takes a three quarters
of a second to get going.

632
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,310
This is fine for everything except the
awareness or winning cause will by its

633
00:40:20,311 --> 00:40:25,020
very nature is a feeling
that you are doing it.

634
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,700
So imagine says Dr Ramachandran that
you could, and it hasn't happened yet,

635
00:40:29,701 --> 00:40:34,200
but you could see your brainwaves in real
time on a screen right in front of you

636
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,280
in real time. Yes. No, the question is
what's going to happen? Okay. I say,

637
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,060
look,

638
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,200
I want you to move your finger anytime
you choose in the next three minutes.

639
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:46,440
So you're sitting there thinking
about nothing in particular.

640
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,640
Mm hmm.

641
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,630
Wait, whoa. I thought the wiggle was
going to be just proceeded by the blip,

642
00:40:53,631 --> 00:40:55,730
but it was like a whole
second before that. No,

643
00:40:55,731 --> 00:40:58,310
your brain is way ahead
of you on this thing.

644
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:01,610
Let's just to listen to this
again cause it's a long pause.

645
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:04,660
[inaudible]

646
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:08,390
we go. Then you say that
blip was controlling me.

647
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,320
Why the hell is free will even a
simple thing like mowing my finger,

648
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,110
I can't do on my own without the
blood telling me ahead of time.

649
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:18,800
You either going to say
the blips controlling me or
you're going to say the blip

650
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:19,670
has ESP,

651
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,880
but this gives you an experimental
handle on something as a lose of his free

652
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:25,814
will.

653
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:29,920
[inaudible]

654
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,920
time here betrays fee will because your
brain acted I head of your decision to

655
00:41:37,011 --> 00:41:40,760
act. You have no idea who's acting.
It's just one of those weird,

656
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,980
I don't think they've
ever resolved this either.

657
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,360
Yeah, I dunno. Yeah. This,

658
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:51,760
that's me very much in control of the
pen in my hand. Beating it in the table.

659
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:54,910
I just did that. Yeah. But if I
were to put a graph in front of you,

660
00:41:54,911 --> 00:41:58,240
showing you your brain and there was
a piece of your brain that anticipated

661
00:41:58,241 --> 00:42:02,470
that, and then what would
you say? I would say that I'm

662
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,180
their wrong. I guess. I don't know

663
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,200
if me, cause we have to take a break now.

664
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,880
If we go to our fingers goodbye and we
would think that we would think that it

665
00:42:17,881 --> 00:42:19,260
was our choice to legal.

666
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,860
But the real question we should
ask is who's who he clean?

667
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,700
You're two or two. You're
the same. Two to radio lab.

668
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:36,460

674
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,020
We've been looking at the concept of
time this hour, fighting against it,

675
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,440
defining it and denying it.
Our last story, however,

676
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:10,830
Isabelle making peace with our
place in the history of time.

677
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:15,750
It comes to us from producer Ben
Adair and it unfolds in a very,

678
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:18,180
very old place. The Mojave desert.

679
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,290
These are old mining roads.

680
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:26,910
Once upon a time hopeful and men and
women looked for outcroppings of quartz

681
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,190
iron, copper and when they found them.

682
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:34,050
This is public land administered by
the bureau of land management but BLM.

683
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,530
They filed a claim and Doug follow e
p 15 and you'll see the signs for the

684
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,920
borough Schmidt tunnel between the
years 1906 and 1938 a lone minor dug and

685
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,920
blasted eight 2087 foot hole
straight through a granite mountain.

686
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:53,910
That tunnel was blocked.

687
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,800
His name is Burro Schmidt and he
first filed this claim in 1904 today.

688
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:03,420
David airs digs here. He gets
tours of Barista tunnel. He says,

689
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,760
miners still roam news hills

690
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,110
and the way he got his
name Burro, Schmidt,

691
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,160
he always had two boroughs
with them, Jack and Jenny.

692
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:17,830
And of course once they died, a burrow
didn't waste anything. So we ate them.

693
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:23,160
And borough died in
1954. They had his, uh,

694
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,520
funeral right in front of the
tunnel entrance and a 1963,

695
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,370
Tony and her husband came
up for the next 40 years.

696
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,740
She was up here and, uh,

697
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:39,950
Tony died up here on her bed inside her
house like she wanted to at the age of

698
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:44,950
95. That old woman is legendary.

699
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,620
She was scared of nothing when she
died up here. She didn't die alone.

700
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:55,000
I was by her side and our granddaughter
from Vermont was here too. And uh,

701
00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:00,070
but she never backed down from a fight.
Uh, there was once when she was 75,

702
00:45:00,071 --> 00:45:04,390
she had a fist fight with a guy right
in front of her house and she won the

703
00:45:04,391 --> 00:45:09,370
fight. She cheated, but she
wanted to fight. What'd you do?

704
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,850
She had a role and nickels
in her fist. But, uh, no,

705
00:45:12,851 --> 00:45:14,440
she never backed down from any fight.

706
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,480
How long do you think you're
going to stay up here?

707
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,780
I gotta be out the 29th of
this month. Really? Yeah.

708
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,510
The BLM is going to take
over the place and run it.

709
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:26,080
They're gonna say burrows cabin. They're
gonna Save Tony's house over there.

710
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:29,020
Everything else is going to
be bulldozed and cleared out,

711
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:33,880
which is unfortunate because they're
going to change the way history looks.

712
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:37,330
This is basically the camp
that an old woman built up.

713
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,830
It's not supposed to be Disneyland. If
you want Disneyland, that's an Anaheim.

714
00:45:41,831 --> 00:45:45,460
If you want a desert camp. This
is just a way some of them look.

715
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:51,640
So this has been going on for a
long time, this BLM stuff? Uh, yeah,

716
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,670
quite awhile. Uh, Tony, since
she lived here for so long,

717
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:58,960
they didn't bother her. Uh, they
just basically waited for her to die.

718
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,280
She expected me to save
the place and I was,

719
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:08,050
I promised her that she would die on
her bed up here like she wanted to.

720
00:46:08,051 --> 00:46:13,030
I kept that promise. The second promise
I wasn't able to keep up. You know,

721
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,450
I tried. In fact, a lot of people tried,

722
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:25,760
Jeez, I'm never going to stop missing
her. Never, you know, she was,

723
00:46:25,761 --> 00:46:26,930
there was no one else like her.

724
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,380
Mm,

725
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,290
David EHRs is gone now.
But before he left,

726
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:37,220
he looked over his ramshackle
camp and told me, don't be sad.

727
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,670
The days of the desert
rat have already passed.

728
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:43,520
What's here is just a corpse.

729
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:57,183
[inaudible]

730
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:58,703
um,

731
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:03,270
[inaudible]

732
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,660
people who spend time in then we'll have
you start thinking differently about

733
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:10,260
space. Huge stretches
of land without a house,

734
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,330
a telephone pole or high tension wire.

735
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,840
You can close your eyes while sliding
between mountain ranges at 80 or a hundred

736
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,360
miles an hour. I'd love to drive
death valley and a really fast car.

737
00:47:21,361 --> 00:47:24,420
A friend of mine said he really, really

738
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,800
fast car.

739
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,050
The valley is the best known
part of the Mojave desert.

740
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,020
Dropping down onto the
valley floor from the West.

741
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,370
You see huge salt flats below
you. Reddish Brown mountains.

742
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,560
Peak in the distance in between them.

743
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:46,840
Huge washes of boulder rubble and
sand flow into death valley like a dam

744
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:49,330
bursting in extreme slow motion.

745
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:55,250
The range is rarely in death
valley. When I was there,

746
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:59,480
a light drizzle caused a flash flood
in mosaic canyon where sculpted marble

747
00:47:59,481 --> 00:48:03,560
walls dropped down hundreds of
feet to it. Teeny tiny stream bed.

748
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,930
The string fans out here and Mosaic
Canyon is a temple of reds and whites

749
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:14,300
arguing domes and voluptuous curves
there at sinks down deep into the rock

750
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,640
making hard stone look. Supple.

751
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,310
Death valley exists in geologic time.

752
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:27,410
The oldest rocks at bad water
or 1.8 billion years old.

753
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:30,980
Standing here watching the stream flow,

754
00:48:30,981 --> 00:48:35,180
I started thinking about that Mars
rover. I thought about my girlfriend,

755
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,310
my family and politics.

756
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,020
Mosaic Canyon sinks a
tiny bit deeper each year.

757
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:48,130
100 human empires will rise and fall in
the time it takes death valley to notice

758
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:49,933
our passing.

759
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,293
Yeah.

760
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,920
[inaudible] hell one each
year can serve as a vacation.

761
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:17,790
Everybody from the
reality of another view.

762
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:23,670
[inaudible]

763
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:27,370
are we one 90 bisects death
valley used to the park.

764
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:29,530
It ends in Death Valley junction.

765
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:34,740
A former ghost town revived 36 years ago
when Marta Beckett reopened the Armour

766
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,820
Gosa Opera House. This is the second
season of her show. The masquerade

767
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:51,440
[inaudible]. Someone else

768
00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:09,163
[inaudible]

769
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:10,710
Myrna Beckett is a dancer.

770
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:15,300
She spent the first half of her life on
stage in New York in her early forties

771
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:19,170
she found this abandoned
theater. She patched the roof,

772
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,520
painted an audience on the
walls, so the curtains,

773
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:27,050
the costumes wrote the
script and choreographed the
dance. Saturday night sell

774
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:32,620
well, are there like many musicals,
if you want to call one we did before.

775
00:50:32,621 --> 00:50:36,400
This was called the doll
maker. Bought a doll shop.

776
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:39,070
You can go and buy the
perfect companion for life.

777
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:42,460
Not have to bother with a real
one is quite controversial.

778
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,490
I made a few enemies out of it,

779
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,670
like the doll maker. The masquerade
asks questions about identity,

780
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:54,050
who we want to be versus
who we actually are,

781
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:57,920
and it sort of summarizes why a lot
of people move out to the desert.

782
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,560
There's a freedom here

783
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,910
in New York. It's like trying to
paint on a canvas that's already okay

784
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,240
painted. Not out here.

785
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,413
[inaudible]

786
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:55,560
nobody really knows who was first
though. Anybody can tell you why.

787
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,090
As city real estate spiraled
out of control. Artists,

788
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:03,360
musicians and old hippies
have migrated here.

789
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:08,930
The extreme south end of the Mojave
desert tucked away around pioneer town,

790
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:14,030
Joshua tree and Yucca valley are
free spirits living off their art.

791
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:15,841
Of course,

792
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,680
the land grab is the cynics point of
view and it's easy to feel jaded around

793
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:21,660
young kids singing in old men. Drumming.

794
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:27,320
Urban sophistication is when you
refuse a strangers hug or laugh.

795
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:29,820
No questions asked,

796
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,620
but those who've dropped their cynicism
will tell you this is a place of

797
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:37,530
optimism and hope it's genuine.

798
00:52:38,430 --> 00:52:40,680
The woman cooking brought
extra burgers to share.

799
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,810
The climbers are back with their
instruments. Looking for a company man,

800
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:49,170
no experience necessary the Indians
thing because it feels good.

801
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,340
You can feel good too if
you want. It's your choice.

802
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,480
Uh, my name is sunny two feathers. I'm
27 years old and I'm from chem sac,

803
00:52:58,481 --> 00:53:00,310
Saskatchewan, Canada.

804
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:04,490
Describe for me what we're looking at
right here and tell me how you see that

805
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,200
versus maybe how other people see it.

806
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,560
Well, yeah. Right now.

807
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:13,561
What I'm looking at is a beautiful desert
paradise with folders that has symbols

808
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:20,050
of hands and symbols of people,

809
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:24,090
of animals and spirits. See You,

810
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:26,160
beautiful in front of me,

811
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,610
tall reaching for the sky,

812
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,790
reaching the pray to the Creator

813
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,560
and the it looks all
glimmering in the moonlight.

814
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,890
When people are out here,

815
00:53:40,891 --> 00:53:45,870
they all their stress and worries and
the problems go away. Their anxieties,

816
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,660
fears just totally leaves
them when they come out here,

817
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,200
but it's just so hard
with the society now.

818
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,490
We don't know how to escape this
control that they have over us,

819
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,680
but when we're here,

820
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:04,740
the moment it's just happy and
everything blows away with the wind.

821
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:09,990
Some was bad and some was good.

822
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,580
Some in the best thing could.

823
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:19,430
Some have even try Andy's
my Trump mind and a cane

824
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,423
and

825
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:29,940
they're aware of where I'm banned.

826
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,023
[inaudible] [inaudible]

827
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:47,520
[inaudible].

828
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,520
In 1989 a sculptor named Noah Purifoy
bought a ranch on the flats north of Yucca

829
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:53,580
Valley.

830
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:57,150
Periphery is probably best known for
founding the watts towers art center in

831
00:54:57,151 --> 00:55:02,151
1964 but he also made huge assemblage
sculptures from lost and found desert

832
00:55:02,461 --> 00:55:05,940
objects. Some are serious
but most are whimsical,

833
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:10,260
all are in pretty bad shape.
His first few years out here,

834
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,150
periphery fought the elements,

835
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:16,800
but later he incorporated their
effects of sculpture is never done.

836
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,690
He surmised after he built it,
the weather continued the process.

837
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:28,710
I went out to talk to periphery, but
I was a day late when I got there.

838
00:55:28,711 --> 00:55:33,030
I phoned his assistant and she told me
that he'd passed away the morning before

839
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:38,340
she was devastated. After hanging
up, I walked around his garden.

840
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,310
I wandered down a sculpture,

841
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:43,890
built like a hallway filled
with old calculators,

842
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:47,100
cash registers and boards
with rusty nails sticking out.

843
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:53,510
I stood there thinking about this man
who had just died and I started thinking

844
00:55:53,941 --> 00:55:56,520
about those old miners,
their desert way of life.

845
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:00,990
I thought about Martin Beckett singing
her operas for 36 years and I thought

846
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:01,980
about death valley.

847
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:06,870
The sense of time there that threatens
to make everything we do here absolutely

848
00:56:06,871 --> 00:56:11,800
irrelevant. Everything I've thought
about these sculptures decaying,

849
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:16,750
the minors disappearing, all the
artists dying and every last one of us,

850
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,790
the entire human race turning the dust
blowing around the Mojave desert and the

851
00:56:21,791 --> 00:56:22,624
wind

852
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:24,833
[inaudible]

853
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:28,250
Noah Purifoy once said that
after he finished his sculptures,

854
00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:33,000
they take on a life of their own. I'm
going to hope he's right about that.

855
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,120
I really need to believe it's true.

856
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:41,260
[inaudible]

857
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:45,940
Ben and Jerry's is a producer for KPCC
radio and he has his own show out in

858
00:56:45,941 --> 00:56:49,930
California called Pacific drift and we
would be very curious to hear what you

859
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:53,060
think of our show. We have
an email address, radio

860
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,510
lab@wnyc.org radio lab is one word and
anything you heard you can hear again at

861
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:01,420
radio lab. Dot Borg. Come chat out. Boom,

862
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:03,970
rod and I'm Robert Krulwich
and we are signing off.
