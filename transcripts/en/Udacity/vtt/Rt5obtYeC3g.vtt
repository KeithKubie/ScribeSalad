00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Again, we start from the SIR equations.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, we include initial conditions, namely that the initial number

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of susceptible persons should be 98,900,000.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We want to have 100,000 infectious persons at the start and 1 million recovered persons at the start.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Your task is now to model that 5 million people are vaccinated at the beginning.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Here are four options of which you have to pick the right one.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
A--change the 5 to a 4 in both equations, B--subtract 100 persons per day from the S equation,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
C-- change these initial conditions to 93,900,000 persons and 6 million persons,

00:00:44.000 --> 09:59:59.000
D--add 5 million persons per day to the R equation.
