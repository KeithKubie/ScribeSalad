00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.470
Welcome to the presentation
on the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.820
I apologize if my voice
sounds a little horsie.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.112
A little hoarse, not horsie.

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:10.070
I was singing a little
bit too much last night,

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.460
so please forgive me.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.710
Well, anyway, we
will now teach you

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.330
about the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.730
And you might have
heard of this before.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.020
As far as I know, it is the
only mathematical theorem

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.681
named after the
founder of a religion.

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.680
Pythagoras, actually, I
think his whole religion

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.790
was based on mathematics.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.040
But I'm no historian here.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.340
So I'll leave that
to the historians.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.070
But anyway, let's get started on
what the Pythagorean theorem is

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.540
all about.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.790
If I were to give
you a triangle--

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.030
let me give you a
triangle-- and I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.820
were to tell you that it's
not a normal triangle.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.150
It is a right triangle.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.060
And all a right triangle
is is a triangle

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.060
that has one side
equal to 90 degrees.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.640
And I'll leave
you to think about

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.490
whether it's ever
possible for a triangle

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.330
to have more than one
side that's 90 degrees.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.570
But anyway, just granted
that a right triangle

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.270
is a side that has
at least-- well,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.410
let me say a right
triangle is a triangle that

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.980
has only one side
that's at 90 degrees.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.740
And if you have a right
triangle, what the Pythagorean

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.160
theorem allows you to do is
if I give you a right triangle

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.960
and I give you two
of the sides, we

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.209
can figure out the third side.

00:01:25.209 --> 00:01:26.750
So before I throw
the theorem at you,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.320
let me actually give you a
couple of more definitions.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.950
Actually, just one more.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.740
So if this is the right
angle in a right triangle--

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.130
it's at 90 degrees.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.511
And we symbolize that by
drawing the angles like this,

00:01:38.511 --> 00:01:40.760
kind of like a box instead
of drawing it like a curve,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.472
like that.

00:01:41.472 --> 00:01:43.430
I hope I'm not messing
up the drawing too much.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.216
The side opposite the right
angle is called the hypotenuse.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.490
And I really should look up
where this word comes from.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.830
Because I think it's a
large and unwieldy word,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.527
and it's a little
daunting at first.

00:02:04.527 --> 00:02:06.610
My sister told me that she
had a math teacher once

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.389
who made people memorize it's
a high pot that is in use.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.200
So I don't know if
that helps you or not.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.170
But over time, you'll
use the term hypotenuse

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.170
so much that it'll seem
just like a normal word.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.003
Although when you look
at it, it really does

00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:19.300
look kind of strange.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.320
Anyway, going back
to definitions,

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.310
the hypotenuse is the side
opposite the 90-degree angle.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.400
And if you look at
any right triangle,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.800
you'll also quickly realize that
the hypotenuse is the longest

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.930
side of the right triangle.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.900
So I think we're done
now with definitions.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.760
So what does the
Pythagorean theorem tell us?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.775
Well, let's call C is equal to
the length of the hypotenuse.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.860
And let A be the
length of this side.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.000
And let B equal the
length of this side.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.540
What the Pythagorean
theorem tells

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:09.760
us is that A squared plus B
squared is equal to C squared.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.650
Now, that very
simple formula might

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.200
be one of the most powerful
formulas in mathematics.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.680
From this, you go into
Euclidean geometry.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.622
You go into trigonometry.

00:03:18.622 --> 00:03:20.205
You can do anything
with this formula,

00:03:20.205 --> 00:03:23.620
but we'll leave that
to future lectures.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.610
Let's actually
test this formula.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.370
Or not test it--
let's use the formula.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.828
Maybe in another
presentation, I'll

00:03:28.828 --> 00:03:32.750
actually do a proof or, at
minimum, a visual proof of it.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.470
I apologize ahead of time that
I'm a bit scatterbrained today.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.990
It's been a while since
I last did a video.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.050
And once again, I told you
I sang a little bit too much

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.560
last night.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.870
So my throat is sore.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.836
OK, so we have a triangle.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.446
And remember, it has
to be a right triangle.

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:52.570
So let's say that this is
a right angle right here.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.390
It's 90 degrees.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.010
And if I were to tell you
that this side is of length 4.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.490
And actually, let
me change that.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.320
This side is of length 3.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.310
This side is of length 4.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.720
And we want to figure out
the side of this length.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.650
So the first thing I do when
I look at a right triangle

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.440
is I figure out what
the hypotenuse is.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.360
Which side is the hypotenuse?

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.760
Well, there's two ways to do it.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.801
There's actually one way.

00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.380
You look at where
the right angle is.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.420
And it's the side
opposite to that.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.590
So this is the hypotenuse.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.134
This would be C in our formula,
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:28.550
We could call it
whatever we want.

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.680
But just for simplicity,
remember A squared plus B

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.490
squared is equal to C squared.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.170
So in this case, we see that the
other two sides, each of them

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.520
squared, when added together
will equal C squared.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.860
So we get 3 squared
plus 4 squared

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.390
is equal to C squared,
where C is our hypotenuse.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:57.120
So 3 squared is 9, plus
16 is equal to C squared.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.360
25 is equal to C squared.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.490
And C could be plus or minus 5.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.730
But we know that you can't have
a minus 5 length in geometry.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.690
So we know that C is equal to 5.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.310
So using the
Pythagorean theorem,

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.887
we just figured out that if we
know the sides-- if one side is

00:05:21.887 --> 00:05:23.345
3, the other side
is 4, then we can

00:05:23.345 --> 00:05:24.886
use Pythagorean
theorem to figure out

00:05:24.886 --> 00:05:30.034
that the hypotenuse of this
triangle has the length 5.

00:05:30.034 --> 00:05:31.075
Let's do another example.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:42.170
Let's say, once again,
this is the right angle.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.260
This side is of length 12.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.720
This slide is of length 6.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.610
And I want to figure
out what this side is.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.830
So let's write down the
Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.010
A squared plus B squared is
equal to C squared, where

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.602
C is that length
of the hypotenuse.

00:06:01.602 --> 00:06:04.060
So the first thing I want to
do when I look at our triangle

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.380
that I just drew is which
side is the hypotenuse.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.710
Well, this right here
is the right angle.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.615
So the hypotenuse is
this side right here.

00:06:14.615 --> 00:06:16.240
And we can also
eyeball it and say, oh,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.750
that's definitely the longest
side of this triangle.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.170
So we know that A
squared plus B squared

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.110
is equal to 12
squared, which is 144.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.960
Now we know we have
one side, but we

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.220
don't have the other side.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.636
So I've got to ask
you a question.

00:06:33.636 --> 00:06:36.210
Does it matter which side
we substitute for A or B?

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.491
Well, no, just
because A or B-- they

00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:40.240
kind of do the same
thing in this formula.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.087
So we could pick any side to
be A other than the hypotenuse.

00:06:43.087 --> 00:06:44.670
And we'll pick the
other side to be B.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.320
So let's just say
that this side is B,

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.700
and let's say that
this side is A.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:52.990
So we know what A is.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:07:00.490
So we get 6 squared plus
B squared is equal to 144.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:08.790
So we get 36 plus B
squared is equal to 144.

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:16.320
B squared is equal
to 144 minus 36.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.870
B squared is equal to 112.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.690
Now we've got to simplify what
the square root of 112 is.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.820
And what we did in
those radical modules

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.459
probably is helpful here.

00:07:27.459 --> 00:07:28.000
So let's see.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.246
B is equal to the
square root of 112.

00:07:32.246 --> 00:07:33.120
Let's think about it.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.940
How many times
does 4 go into 112?

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.780
4 goes into 120 five times,
so it'll go into it 28 times.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.420
And then 4 goes
into 28 seven times.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:48.780
So I actually think that
this is equal to 16 times 7.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:49.400
Am I right?

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.600
7 times 10 is 70,
plus 42 is 112.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.350
Right.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.770
So B equals the square
root of 16 times 7.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.190
See, I just factored
that as a product

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.239
of a perfect square
and a prime number.

00:08:01.239 --> 00:08:03.530
Or actually, it doesn't have
to be a prime number, just

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.630
a non-perfect square.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:12.680
And then I get B is equal
to 4 square roots of 7.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.120
So there we go.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:23.360
If this is 12, this is 6,
this is 4 square roots of 7.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.590
I think that's all the time I
have now for this presentation.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.590
Right after this, I'll
do one more presentation

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.460
where I give a couple of more
Pythagorean theorem problems.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.030
See you soon.
