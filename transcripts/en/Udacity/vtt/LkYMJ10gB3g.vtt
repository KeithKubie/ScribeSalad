00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.614
Say you're controlling a camera by using a position and target system. For each

00:00:03.614 --> 00:00:07.714
of these camera moves, what must change? The target or the position? Check all

00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:12.162
or none that apply. Select an attribute only if it's changing a fair bit, say

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:15.752
more that a foot for a given attribute. For example, if I said to move your

00:00:15.752 --> 00:00:19.510
camera so that it was pointing straight up. The target would have changed

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.565
considerably, while the position would have changed just a small bit. So if you

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:28.070
orbit to the right does the target or position change? Both or neither?

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.050
Similarly for turn camera to the left, zoom in, and pan to the right.
