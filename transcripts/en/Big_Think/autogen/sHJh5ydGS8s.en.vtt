00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.120
well the first one I would take is the

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
well the first one I would take is the
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.799
well the first one I would take is the
dollar I think we need to really mount a

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809
dollar I think we need to really mount a
 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.250
dollar I think we need to really mount a
major effort to reset the global

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260
major effort to reset the global
 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.390
major effort to reset the global
exchange rates the dollar needs to other

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400
exchange rates the dollar needs to other
 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.149
exchange rates the dollar needs to other
currencies need to revalue against the

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:20.159
currencies need to revalue against the
 

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:22.009
currencies need to revalue against the
dollar so the dollar would be worth

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.019
dollar so the dollar would be worth
 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.349
dollar so the dollar would be worth
relatively less and I'd like to be able

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359
relatively less and I'd like to be able
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.050
relatively less and I'd like to be able
to do that through negotiations in the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
to do that through negotiations in the
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.830
to do that through negotiations in the
international monetary fund and the g20

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840
international monetary fund and the g20
 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.080
international monetary fund and the g20
even in the World Trade Organization and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
even in the World Trade Organization and
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.599
even in the World Trade Organization and
I think we should try that if that

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609
I think we should try that if that
 

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:40.430
I think we should try that if that
doesn't work then of course we'll have

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
doesn't work then of course we'll have
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.619
doesn't work then of course we'll have
to think of other steps that we might

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
to think of other steps that we might
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.180
to think of other steps that we might
have to take but we should try to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
have to take but we should try to
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.990
have to take but we should try to
negotiate a serious resetting of

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000
negotiate a serious resetting of
 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.259
negotiate a serious resetting of
currencies I think we should lead an

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269
currencies I think we should lead an
 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.860
currencies I think we should lead an
effort to create a new global financial

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
effort to create a new global financial
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.090
effort to create a new global financial
currency system one based on a basket of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
currency system one based on a basket of
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.149
currency system one based on a basket of
currencies not just the dollar I am

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159
currencies not just the dollar I am
 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.340
currencies not just the dollar I am
maybe even eventually a single global

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
maybe even eventually a single global
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250
maybe even eventually a single global
currency we had a gold standard of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
currency we had a gold standard of
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.290
currency we had a gold standard of
course in the late 19th century and

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300
course in the late 19th century and
 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.350
course in the late 19th century and
first half the 20th century and that was

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
first half the 20th century and that was
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.830
first half the 20th century and that was
a single global currency it has is it's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
a single global currency it has is it's
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.200
a single global currency it has is it's
it has advantages and disadvantages but

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210
it has advantages and disadvantages but
 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.320
it has advantages and disadvantages but
in a globalized integrated world economy

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330
in a globalized integrated world economy
 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.210
in a globalized integrated world economy
it that's a direction in which I think

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220
it that's a direction in which I think
 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.120
it that's a direction in which I think
we should be going beyond that I think

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130
we should be going beyond that I think
 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.220
we should be going beyond that I think
it's very important for the United

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230
it's very important for the United
 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.310
it's very important for the United
States to respond to these investment

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320
States to respond to these investment
 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.050

of of productive facilities out of the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
of of productive facilities out of the
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.450
of of productive facilities out of the
US and to offshore locations so I would

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460
US and to offshore locations so I would
 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.830
US and to offshore locations so I would
have a war chest or a fund that I would

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
have a war chest or a fund that I would
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.820
have a war chest or a fund that I would
call a matching fund and so every time a

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830
call a matching fund and so every time a
 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.830
call a matching fund and so every time a
country offered to make a capital grant

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239
the u.s. I would match it to try to keep
 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.340
