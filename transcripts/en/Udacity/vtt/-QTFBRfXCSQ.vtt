00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.330
We're not quite done yet
with implementing

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.046
the tablet UIwire frames.

00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:06.072
The detail fragment 
should look like this,

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.868
but instead it 
looks more like this.

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:09.954
For the tablet UI, 
we try to optimize it

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:12.560
more for wider screens 
like tablet landscape mode.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.400
Another good place 
for this layout,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.079
is in the phone landscape view,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.710
where there's more horizontal space
than vertical space.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.196
For this quiz, figure out 
which layout folders,

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:23.762
we would need to define
the fragment-detail layout in.

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:26.160
in order to achieve this layout 
on phone portrait

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.790
and this layout
for phone landscape and tablet.
