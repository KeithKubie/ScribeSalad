00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:01.324
- [Instructor] What I'd
like to do in this video

00:00:01.324 --> 00:00:05.324
is talk about the notion
of a frame of reference

00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:08.722
and this is an introductory video.

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:11.880
In future videos, we'll
go into a lot more depth,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.224
but a frame of reference
is really the idea

00:00:14.224 --> 00:00:16.987
it's a point of view from
which you are measuring things

00:00:16.987 --> 00:00:18.929
and as we'll see, many
of the quantities that

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.155
we might measure in physics,
like velocity or displacement,

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.161
they could be different
depending on our point of view,

00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:30.250
depending on which frame of
reference we are measuring from

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.151
and to get this an intuitive grasp of it,

00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:35.638
I'm going to draw the exact same scenario

00:00:35.638 --> 00:00:38.174
from three different frames of reference.

00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:39.303
There's the first one,

00:00:39.303 --> 00:00:40.659
this is the second one,

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:42.993
and this is the third one.

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:46.504
So in this first frame of
reference, this first scenario,

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:50.681
we're gonna talk about the frame
of reference of the ground.

00:00:50.681 --> 00:00:54.904
So if you are a stationary
observer on the ground,

00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:57.108
so you could imagine this is you here

00:00:57.108 --> 00:00:59.701
and you're the person doing the measuring

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:02.431
of let's say we want
to measure velocities.

00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.195
So from your point of view,

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:06.570
since you're stationary
relative to the ground,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.165
what does the ground's velocity look like?

00:01:09.165 --> 00:01:12.862
Well, you and the ground
appear to be stationary,

00:01:12.862 --> 00:01:15.397
appear to not be moving.

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:17.374
Now, what if you take out your instruments

00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:21.147
for measuring velocity
or you see a change in,

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.905
you see what the displacement
is over a certain time

00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:25.364
for the plane and the car

00:01:25.364 --> 00:01:27.181
and you're able to see okay, look,

00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:30.348
this plane has a velocity to the right

00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:34.344
of 250 meters per second,

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.179
250 meters per second,

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.703
and let's say this car

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:42.370
that is moving quite fast by car standards

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.707
is moving to the left
at 50 meters per second.

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:49.326
So this should be 1/5 of that length.

00:01:49.326 --> 00:01:51.277
So let me draw a little bit.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:54.844
So let's say this is moving to the left

00:01:54.844 --> 00:01:57.565
at 50 meters per second.

00:01:57.565 --> 00:01:58.956
Well, none of this seems crazy.

00:01:58.956 --> 00:02:01.132
You might be able to go outside
next to the highway and see,

00:02:01.132 --> 00:02:03.396
well 50 meters per second
would be quite fast,

00:02:03.396 --> 00:02:08.163
but anyway, you could observe
this type of thing happening

00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:10.203
and it seems completely reasonably.

00:02:10.203 --> 00:02:12.565
But what if we were to change
our frame of reference,

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:15.649
change the point of view from
which we are measuring things.

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:19.243
So let's take the frame
of reference of the car.

00:02:19.243 --> 00:02:20.409
Well in this frame of reference,

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.872
let's say you're sitting in this car

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:23.924
and I don't recommend you
doing this while driving,

00:02:23.924 --> 00:02:25.270
let's say someone else is driving

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.496
or it's an autonomous vehicle of some kind

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:29.325
and you take out your physics instruments

00:02:29.325 --> 00:02:31.875
with the stopwatch and you
see what the displacement is

00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:35.639
of the ground and the
plane over, say, a second

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.225
and you are able to first
say, from your point of view,

00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:40.640
you're like well the car is stationary,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.677
the car has a velocity of zero,

00:02:43.677 --> 00:02:45.961
the car is stationary

00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:47.513
and from your point of view,

00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:50.123
you would actually measure
the ground to be moving.

00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:53.249
You would see the trees
move past you to the right,

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.909
or behind you if you're
moving to the left,

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.590
and so from your point of view

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.996
the ground would actually
look like it's moving

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:04.623
in this direction, in that direction,

00:03:04.623 --> 00:03:07.349
at 50 meters per second.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.996
It would look like it's moving behind you

00:03:09.996 --> 00:03:11.935
or in this case, the
way we're looking at it,

00:03:11.935 --> 00:03:15.112
to the right at 50 meters per second.

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:18.206
Now, what would the plane look like?

00:03:18.206 --> 00:03:20.098
Well, the plane not
only would it look like

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:24.251
it's moving to the right
at 250 meters per second,

00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:27.593
not only would it be just
that 250 meters per second,

00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:30.476
but relative to you it'd look
like it's going even faster

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.062
'cause you're going past it,

00:03:32.062 --> 00:03:35.367
you are going to the
left from the stationary,

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:38.237
from the ground's point of
view at 50 meters per second.

00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:40.175
So the plane, to you,

00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:44.342
is gonna look like it's going
250 plus 50 meters per second.

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:50.653
So the vector would look like this

00:03:50.653 --> 00:03:54.621
and so it would look like it's
going to the right at 300,

00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:57.222
let me write that in that orange color,

00:03:57.222 --> 00:03:59.305
at 300 meters per second.

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:03.677
Now, what about from the
point of view of the plane?

00:04:03.677 --> 00:04:07.179
What if we're talking about
the plane's frame of reference?

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:08.589
Why don't you pause this video

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:11.479
and think about what
the velocities would be

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:14.264
of the plane, the car, and the ground

00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:16.958
from the plane's point of view.

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:18.488
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:20.544
So now, we're sitting in the plane

00:04:20.544 --> 00:04:22.555
and once again we shouldn't
be flying the plane,

00:04:22.555 --> 00:04:23.626
we're letting someone else do that,

00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:24.917
we have our physics instruments out

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:27.362
and we're trying to measure the velocities

00:04:27.362 --> 00:04:30.656
of these other things from
my frame of reference.

00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:32.628
Well, the plane, first of all,

00:04:32.628 --> 00:04:35.303
is going to appear to be stationary

00:04:35.303 --> 00:04:37.959
and that might seem counterintuitive,

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:39.099
but if you've ever sat in a plane,

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:40.769
especially when there's no turbulence

00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:42.685
and the plane is already at altitude

00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:44.998
and it's not taking off or landing,

00:04:44.998 --> 00:04:46.523
oftentimes if you close your eyes

00:04:46.523 --> 00:04:48.627
you don't know if you are moving.

00:04:48.627 --> 00:04:50.506
In fact, if you close all of the windows,

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:53.557
it feels like you are
in a stationary object,

00:04:53.557 --> 00:04:55.850
that you might as well be in a house.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.001
So from the plane's point
of view, you feel like,

00:05:00.001 --> 00:05:01.447
or from your point of view in the plane,

00:05:01.447 --> 00:05:03.543
it feels like the plane is stationary.

00:05:03.543 --> 00:05:05.106
Now the ground, however,

00:05:05.106 --> 00:05:07.018
looks like it's moving quite quickly.

00:05:07.018 --> 00:05:09.507
It'll look like it's moving past you

00:05:09.507 --> 00:05:11.590
at 250 meters per second.

00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:16.762
Whoops, try and draw a straight line.

00:05:16.762 --> 00:05:17.595
At 200...

00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:21.779
At 250.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.196
Sometimes my tools act funny.

00:05:25.382 --> 00:05:28.799
So, at 250 meters per second to the left.

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:35.205
And the car, well it's moving
to the left even faster.

00:05:35.205 --> 00:05:36.416
It's going to be moving to the left

00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:39.584
50 meters per second
faster than the ground is.

00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:42.844
So the car is gonna look
not like it's just going

00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:44.476
50 meters per second,

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:46.652
it's gonna look like it's going 50 meters

00:05:46.652 --> 00:05:50.014
plus another 250 meters per second

00:05:50.014 --> 00:05:54.097
for a total of 300 meters
per second to the left.

00:05:59.265 --> 00:06:01.864
So this gives you an appreciation

00:06:01.864 --> 00:06:03.544
for what frames of references are.

00:06:03.544 --> 00:06:05.626
You can view it for
this introductory video

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:06.556
as a point of view

00:06:06.556 --> 00:06:08.488
from which you're making
your measurements.

00:06:08.488 --> 00:06:10.147
Now, it's tempting for
a lot of folks to say

00:06:10.147 --> 00:06:12.928
well there must be one
correct frame of reference

00:06:12.928 --> 00:06:15.064
and a lot of times in our everyday world

00:06:15.064 --> 00:06:17.077
you might say well this,
maybe this is the correct

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:18.933
frame of reference and these are just,

00:06:18.933 --> 00:06:21.860
we're just imagining this
or this is just the mistake

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.747
and the reason why we do that is because

00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:25.327
we're using the frame of reference

00:06:25.327 --> 00:06:29.020
of this big, giant thing called the earth,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.370
but it actually turns out

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.608
that none of these frames of reference

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:35.069
are more valid than the other ones,

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:36.835
that they are all equivalent,

00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:39.556
that they are all valid
frames of reference,

00:06:39.556 --> 00:06:41.516
not, I shouldn't say they're equivalent,

00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:45.863
we're obviously getting
different measurements from them,

00:06:45.863 --> 00:06:49.019
but they're all, from a
physics point of view,

00:06:49.019 --> 00:06:51.852
equally valid frames of reference.
