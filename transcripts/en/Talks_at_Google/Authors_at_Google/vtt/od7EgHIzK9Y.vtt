00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.890
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker: Hi everyone, and welcome
to another Authors at Google event up in the

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:06.950
San Francisco office.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.110
Today we’re very pleased to welcome Stephanie
Palmer to Google.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.129
Stephanie’s a former Hollywood executive,
former denizen of Los Angeles as well, who

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.714
is now, um, gone to just as sunny climates
in Santa Fe, where it may be slightly calmer.

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:26.830
Um, she used to be a Hollywood executive with
MGM, and now she’s a, uh, pitching and presentation

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.440
consultant and she wrote a book called “Good
in a Room,” which she will reference today.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.149
Um, which is how to sell yourself and your
ideas, and win over any audience.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.670
She’s been featured on the Today Show on
NBC, the Early Show on CBS, The Los Angeles

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.679
Times, National Public Radio and the Atlantic
and Incorporated magazines.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.449
Please welcome Stephanie Palmer to Google.

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.679
[Clapping]

00:00:50.679 --> 00:01:01.260
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: Have you ever had, what
you thought, was a big idea?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.820
Only when you shared it with someone else,
they didn’t really get it.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.460
Or have you made a presentation in a meeting
that fell flat?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.039
Or you have a really great idea and you share
that with your supervisor, only to have them

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.759
not pursue it?

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.000
So, let’s be honest, sometimes ideas are
not that good.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.580
But sometimes, you have a really great idea,
but it doesn’t get the financing or the

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.450
attention that it deserves.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.300
&gt;&gt;Stephanie Palmer: So why does this happen?

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.609
This happens for the same reason that Hollywood
makes so many bad movies.

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:46.899
Well, of course, there are plenty of reasons
why Hollywood makes lots of bad movies, but

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:52.020
one of the main reasons happens early in the
process when they’re deciding which projects

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.759
they want to purchase.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.450
So, Hollywood producers and executives hear
hundreds of pitches before they decide which

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.270
select few are going to be those best bets.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.370
And those best bets often aren’t the best
ideas, but they are likely to be the best

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.370
pitches.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:21.050
&gt;&gt;Stephanie Palmer: So, here’s the thing,
when ideas are initially competing for investment,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.990
mediocre ideas pitched well beat out great
ideas pitched poorly.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:38.790
Let me say that again, mediocre ideas pitched
well often beat out great ideas pitched poorly.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.720
And this is why I want to help people learn
how to pitch, because I want to level the

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.110
playing field so that the great ideas can
stand out.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:59.820
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: Uh, the, the main point
of today’s whole thing, is that basically

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:04.580
I, I believe that when the best ideas win,
we all benefit.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.230
&gt;&gt;Stephanie Palmer: Let me tell you a little
bit about my background.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.760
I started in Hollywood as an intern on the
movie “Titanic.”

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.610
And then I moved to Jerry Bruckheimer films,
where I worked on “Armageddon” and “Enemy

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.820
of the State.”

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.790
And Jerry would be very happy that I saw one
of your conference rooms here is for “The

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.790
Rock.”

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.790
[laughing]

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.650
He would be very happy, um, about that.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.930
Then I moved to MGM, where I was the director
of creative affairs.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.360
And my job was, basically, to help supervise
the development and production of films.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.690
And, part of my job was hearing pitches from
writers and directors.

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.100
And over six years, I had more than 3,000
pitch meetings.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.250
And it was in those meetings, that I really
paid attention to what was working and what

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.730
didn’t, and I discovered that the best part
of my job, was working on pitches.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:03.460
So, I decided to start my own company, focused
solely on pitching.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:11.090
Now, um, part of my business plan, as I was
starting my business, was to write a book.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.440
And I was building my client base, and I had
put together a book proposal, and I had sent

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.420
it to New York and got some interest of publishers.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.080
So, they invited me to come to New York, and
I was like, “Great!”

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.730
Ok, so I get to New York and I’m sitting
in the lobby for my first meeting at this

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:34.370
big publishing house and suddenly I started
to get a little nervous.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.470
And I went into the meeting and I was sitting
there on this nice leather couch, in this

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.960
lovely office in Manhattan, and the editor,
who I was expecting to come in with like a

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:51.780
big friendly face and, ya know, a nice handshake,
came in and said, right to my face, “I hate

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.810
Hollywood and everything that it stands for.”

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:03.100
And I was a little taken aback, and I, uh,
was like, “Oh, oh okay.”

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.810
Um, and so then I started talking to him and
he basically grilled me for the entire meeting.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.850
We never got to my part of the pitch.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.190
Um, he basically was telling me that I represented
everything that he hated about tabloid celebrity

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.380
culture and frankly, I was totally unprepared
for that.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.710
I had thought going into the meeting, “Oh,
he’s bought books that are similar to mine,

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.480
he’s, I’m prepared for the meeting, I
can, ya know, have a fine meeting.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.360
Um, but basically, I was stumbling and rambling
and it didn’t seem like I knew at all what

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.740
I was talking about.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.540
The irony was not lost on me that the book
I was pitching was called, “Good in a Room“,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.120
and I was not.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.060
So totally humbled, I had a few hours to regroup
before my next meeting.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.920
So I went back and I wrote down all the questions
that he had asked me and I developed better

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.920
answers.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.280
I practiced out loud in the hotel room, ya
know, mirror, um, and I got myself ready for

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.560
the mental stress of having to be on the spot.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.620
And my subsequent meetings went quite a bit
better.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.180
They were far from perfect, but each time
I got better.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.860
And, by the end of the week, there were five
publishers that made offers, and I sold my

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.610
book to Random House.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:23.889
So, uh, to tell you about my current clients,
as you would expect, most of the people that

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.800
I work with are still pitching TV and film
projects, but I also, over the last five years,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.800
have branched out.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:37.389
And, so, I have worked with executives at,
Merrill Lynch, Accenture, Mattel, Los Alamos

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:42.270
National Laboratories, and also a wide variety
of entrepreneurs.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.710
One of the entrepreneurs that I worked with
very recently is, uh, has invented a new kind

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.710
of airplane.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:56.180
And, now why I share this, is because I am
not an engineer, I am not an aviation expert,

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.560
but the ideas in his pitch are solely his
own, but what I did is help take his ideas

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.260
and make it so that other people could understand
them and also see their value.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.840
And currently he has secured his first round
of financing and is developing a 65 pound

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.310
prototype.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:26.210
Now, it’s true that different fields have
different criteria for evaluating ideas.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:33.360
But, there are some things that are, um, similar
across a wide varieties of situations.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.590
So, before we get started, here’s a fun
fact.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:42.500
My brother Tim, works here as a strategic
partner and development manager, so, “Hello

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.500
Tim.”

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.500
[laughter]

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.620
Um, and I know that this is an elite group.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.620
You guys have strong soft skills, because
you have made it through the rigorous and

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.199
infamous Google interviewing process.

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:58.669
I also know that there’s a wide variety
of jobs.

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.430
There’s engineers, there’s people who
work in ad sales, there’s marketing.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.620
Ya know, you have, you encounter a bunch of
different pitching scenarios.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:12.870
Um, but I think that there are some things
that hold true through a wide variety of settings.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:18.930
So, if you’re in a more formal pitch, something
like, you are pitching to a major advertiser

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.150
or partner, that’s what I consider a more
formal pitch, or you’re presenting your

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.610
ideas in the product review meeting or global
product strategy meeting.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:34.010
Or there’s plenty of more casual situations,
like, you’re building consensus in a room

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.569
of your peers.

00:08:35.569 --> 00:08:41.919
Or you’re talking to your ,uh, supervisor
about your 20% project.

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:49.630
Uh, all of these pitches basically are unique,
that’s something to know is that, there’s

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.550
not a one size fits all for how to pitch.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:58.649
But, I’m really interested in that those
specific situations, so those little things

00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:03.360
like, what, um, exactly what you say and how
to say it in a specific situation.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:08.790
It’s that fine tuning that I really like,
because it’s often those small changes that

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.279
you make, that make the big difference.

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:19.879
So, let’s talk about, um , the wide variety
of pitching situations.

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:23.570
You have the formal situations and you have
the more casual.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:29.649
And there are five techniques that I’m gonna
cover today, that apply in that wide variety.

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:38.680
And those are, start by stepping back, write
your pitch to be spoken, let the audience

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:47.820
be the judge, sell yourself as well as your
idea and embrace pitching early in the development

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.820
process.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.990
So let’s start at the beginning.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.959
Let’s define three terms.

00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:57.139
First, pitch.

00:09:57.139 --> 00:10:00.910
People talk about pitch or pitching and mean
lots of different things.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:09.379
I define pitching as verbally transferring
information in order to get someone to act.

00:10:09.379 --> 00:10:12.540
Second, decision maker.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.809
The decision maker is the person who’s listening
to that pitch.

00:10:16.809 --> 00:10:22.149
And the decision is whether or not they’re
going to support your idea in some way.

00:10:22.149 --> 00:10:26.389
The third term is good in a room.

00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:30.769
Someone who pitches well to decision makers
is good in a room.

00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:35.459
Someone, uh, this term originated in Hollywood,
I didn’t come up with it.

00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:42.059
Um, agents use it, coined it, to describe
actors who are their, their most successful

00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:46.389
and their most charismatic, those people are
referred to as being good in a room.

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:52.009
And, uh, someone who’s known for being good
in a room is the actor Kevin Spacey.

00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:57.940
And I worked with Kevin on the movie 21.Which,
as you may know, was that film about the six

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.619
MIT students who card counted at black jack
and won millions in Las Vegas.

00:11:02.619 --> 00:11:06.730
So, I was working with Kevin and talking about
how he first got his start.

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.649
And, what he did at the beginning, before
he became a famous actor, is he would partner

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:15.179
with writers, who were good writers but felt
really uncomfortable pitching.

00:11:15.179 --> 00:11:20.540
And so Kevin would go to the meeting with
the writers, he would pitch the story and

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.360
sell it and then he would take a cut of the
profits.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:29.380
So eventually, the writers who he was partnered
with learned to successfully pitch on their

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.380
own.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.949
And the point of this is that, though there
are some people who are born with a natural

00:11:35.949 --> 00:11:42.519
charisma, anybody, even shy, introverted people,
can learn to become good in a room.

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:45.970
So, let’s start at the beginning.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:53.339
The first, um, technique is basically, a key
question when you’re developing a pitch

00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:56.029
is, where do you start?

00:11:56.029 --> 00:12:02.350
And in my experience, uh, a lot of pitches,
most people start too far in and that’s

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.489
why they don’t get off to a good start.

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:08.990
So we’re gonna start by stepping back, is
my first technique.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.709
Here’s an example of what I mean.

00:12:11.709 --> 00:12:17.249
Last week I heard a movie pitch from a writer,
and he was saying to me, ya know, “Stephanie,

00:12:17.249 --> 00:12:22.139
my project is a pitch about a spy,” and
he’s going along, he’s describing the

00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:26.389
set pieces, he’s talking about, ya know,
what’s gonna happen in the plot at each

00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:27.389
point.

00:12:27.389 --> 00:12:30.220
He’s going along, and it’s just not really
adding up for me.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:37.389
So, he’s going along and then he says, “Stephanie,
why aren’t you laughing?”

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:38.389
[laughing]

00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:43.509
Well, he was intending for the spy to be someone
like Austin Powers from The Spy Who Shagged

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:47.920
Me, but the whole time I was listening, I
assumed he meant a serious operative like

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.569
Jason Bourne, from The Bourne Identity.

00:12:50.569 --> 00:12:55.170
So this could have been easily solved if he
had just started with, “my project is a

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:59.769
comedy, about, da, da, da, a spy who does
this.”

00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:04.839
So I see the same kind of thing with the entrepreneurs
that I work with.

00:13:04.839 --> 00:13:09.980
They start talking about their project, they
know all the little details, they know the

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.910
minutia, they know all these decisions that
they’ve made.

00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:18.360
But when they start talking to someone else
about their project, they don’t provide

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.440
the background that the person needs to understand.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.819
They don’t contextualize the project within,
you know, that company's goals.

00:13:26.819 --> 00:13:36.160
They don’t bring everybody in the room up
to speed and so they lose their audience.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:44.290
Now when you’re thinking about where you
should start, when you want to start, you

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.290
know, at the beginning.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:50.970
You don’t have to start, uh; it’s basically
two or three steps back from what you’re

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:51.970
thinking.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:57.369
This doesn’t mean you need to start with,
first the earth cooled, then the dinosaurs

00:13:57.369 --> 00:13:58.850
came.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:03.709
But you do want to remember that context,
that for the person listening, their hearing

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:10.790
your idea for the first time and context lives
in the mind of the listener.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:14.079
So st--, this is why you wanna start by stepping
back.

00:14:14.079 --> 00:14:16.299
Assess what’s happening.

00:14:16.299 --> 00:14:17.299
Um.

00:14:17.299 --> 00:14:20.749
What, what are the audience’s expectations.

00:14:20.749 --> 00:14:23.860
Assess their level of expertise.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.360
And then start an, with an opening statement
that makes it easy for them to understand

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.370
your idea.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:34.759
Ok, so we’ve started, we’ve covered start
by stepping back.

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:41.410
Now let’s move to the second technique,
write your pitch to be spoken.

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:47.179
What looks good on the page is very different
than what sounds good in the air.

00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:51.139
And this is because of the way that listeners
can absorb information.

00:14:51.139 --> 00:14:54.519
It’s the pace at which they can absorb information.

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:59.889
If you’re presenting something in writing
or you’re reading it, you can be very detailed.

00:14:59.889 --> 00:15:05.889
You can break up big units of information
with bullets, and headers and footnotes.

00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:08.939
Um, you can be very complex.

00:15:08.939 --> 00:15:11.079
And readers can skim.

00:15:11.079 --> 00:15:14.029
They can reread something that they are confused
about.

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:19.310
In a verbal pitch, the listener does not have
that same level of control.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:25.540
So, you want to be very, um, careful about
the level of detail that you share.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:32.480
And basically, uh, you, you, they can’t
rewind, they can’t, you know, figure out

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.720
those sections, uh, that are confusing to
them and they can’t control the pace of

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.040
the information that’s, uh, coming at them.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:46.100
So this sounds really ridiculously basic,
but, one of the best ways that you can improve

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.470
your pitch is to shorten your sentences.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:53.480
So, where you see long sentences, break them
up.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.420
If you’re looking at, you know, the pitch
that you’ve prepared and you have a lot

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.359
of commas, try periods instead.

00:15:59.359 --> 00:16:03.480
You want your s—sentences to be short, crisp
and direct.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:09.149
It’s okay if the information looks choppy
and incomplete on the page, as long as it

00:16:09.149 --> 00:16:12.290
sounds better in the air.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:18.949
Ok, so we’ve covered, start by stepping
back and write your pitch to be spoken.

00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:26.309
Now we’re gonna go onto the third technique,
which is, let the audience be the judge.

00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:28.569
So now why am I even talking about this?

00:16:28.569 --> 00:16:31.790
Of course, the audience is the judge.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.279
This is totally self-evident.

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:40.420
But what I’m going to say may surprise you,
because I’m going to recommend that you

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.459
do, that you avoid doing something that most
people do.

00:16:45.459 --> 00:16:52.519
Most people, at some point in their pitch,
tell the decision maker what to think or how

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:53.879
to feel.

00:16:53.879 --> 00:17:00.459
Now, these are four things that I’m suggesting
that you should not say.

00:17:00.459 --> 00:17:03.439
“You’re going to love this!”

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:07.260
“I have an amazing idea for you.”

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.699
“This project could be a game changer.”

00:17:09.699 --> 00:17:15.360
“This idea will revolutionize the industry.”

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.970
So now what’s the harm?

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:20.480
These things show that you’re confident,
you’re thinking big.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.319
You know, we know that decision makers like
people who are enthusiastic and who, ya know,

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:28.159
demonstrate that they are passionate about
their idea.

00:17:28.159 --> 00:17:29.870
So, what’s the problem?

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:33.250
There are two main problems with this.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:39.750
One problem is that for high level decision
makers, they are hearing lots of pitches,

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:45.340
and these phrases are so common that they
make you blend in, not stand out.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:51.210
Every dog owner thinks their pet is adorable;
every parent, including me, thinks their child

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.529
is brilliant.

00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:56.000
You are expected to be a fan of your own work.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.500
But you don’t need to say it.

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:02.720
Now the second problem is more serious.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.889
That is, that most decision makers, don’t
want to be told how to think or feel, and

00:18:07.889 --> 00:18:10.289
they resent it if you do.

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:14.570
So for example, you’re saying, “You’re
gonna love this!”

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:18.019
And in their mind, their thinking, “Oh really?

00:18:18.019 --> 00:18:24.450
You know exactly what’s going on in my head?”
or you say, you know, “I have an amazing

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.980
idea for you.”

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:35.019
And they think, “Seriously, you’ve concluded
that your own idea is amazing, I’m stunned.”

00:18:35.019 --> 00:18:40.950
So what I suggest is that you completely eliminate
these sentences from your pitch.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.480
And instead, look for third party validation.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:50.600
So, the kinds of third party validator that
you’re looking for is someone who has credibility

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.350
with that decision maker.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:56.250
And now this has a wide variety of applications.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.990
For example, I have a two year old son named
Zach.

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:03.190
And Zach was not eating his broccoli before
I came on this trip.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.940
And I was like, “Zach!

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.360
Broccoli is so delicious!”

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.779
And he’s like, “No!” and then I was
like, “But Zach, broccoli is gonna make

00:19:11.779 --> 00:19:14.639
you healthy and strong!”

00:19:14.639 --> 00:19:20.750
“NO!” and then I thought, I’m gonna
look for a third party validator, “Zach,

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.290
your friend Lucas loves broccoli.”

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:29.470
And then he tried it, and he liked it, and
he ate it.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:36.360
So here’s the point, find credible experts
and if they support your ideas, share their

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.590
opinion, not yours.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:46.929
Ok, so now we’re gonna move on to the fourth
technique, which is, sell yourself as well

00:19:46.929 --> 00:19:50.220
as your idea.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.830
Many people feel uncomfortable with the whole
idea of selling themselves.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:20:00.200
They don’t want to brag, or have to act
fake, or, um, feel like they are being, you

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.960
know, they seem self-absorbed in any way and
that’s not what I’m suggesting.

00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:12.350
First, as you know, decision makers are not
just investing in your idea, they are investing

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:18.429
in you and your ability to bring those ideas
to life.

00:20:18.429 --> 00:20:23.919
One of the most common pitfalls that I see
is a lack of emphasis on the unique qualifications

00:20:23.919 --> 00:20:27.340
of the person or the people behind the pitch.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:32.940
Because decision makers know that there are
gonna be changes, obstacles, you know, issues

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:33.940
along the way.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:40.330
And they wanna know that you are uniquely
qualified to be able to solve them.

00:20:40.330 --> 00:20:44.620
This means, in the same way that you look
your pitch, and you find the most compelling

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:50.340
aspects of the project to talk about, you
want to present yourself in the same way.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:58.830
And one of the best ways to do this is to
answer the hidden question.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:04.690
In my experience, two, decisions makers ask
two main kinds of questions when their evaluating

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:07.159
an idea or evaluating a pitch.

00:21:07.159 --> 00:21:11.210
The first kind of category is talking about
the project.

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:16.420
It’s things like, “What is this?”, “What
does it cost?”, ”Who is this for?”

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:21.480
, “What’s the time line?”, those kinds
of project related questions, are generally

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.860
easier to answer.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:28.160
You can use research or data or statistics
and you can answer them directly.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.980
But the second kind of question is more complicated
because it relates to you and your team.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:41.490
And often, what the decision maker is really
asking is hidden behind another question.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.299
Here’s an example.

00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:49.410
They’ll ask you something like, “How did
you come up with this idea?”

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:54.980
Most people answer this question with, to
describe the eureka moment, something like,

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:59.450
“I was in the shower and suddenly it came
to me.”

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:05.470
But the decision maker is not asking you for
exactly at what time on what day did you have

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:09.130
this idea and what were you doing at the time.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:15.620
How or why did you come up with this idea,
is really a way of asking you what unique

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:20.630
expertise, or experience, do you have that
allowed you to see this opportunity?

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:25.910
So, a question, a good answer, doesn’t involve
your shower.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:30.350
But rather, it’s something more like, I’ve
been obsessed with this question for nine

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.350
years.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.500
I did my grad school thesis on it and then
I invested my own money to build a model.

00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:41.190
And once I built the model my key insight
came when I discovered that it was significantly

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.570
more efficient than I thought.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.179
Dot, dot, dot.

00:22:46.179 --> 00:22:52.460
You’ll get common questions like, “What
are your goals?” or, uh, “What made you

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.820
interested in this idea in the first place?”

00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:00.870
Or, “What are some challenges that, you
know, are looking forward to?”

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:07.360
And in this case, when you hear questionslike
this, some general questions about you, pretend

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:15.080
that the decision maker has asked you, “Do
you have a story that exemplifies your expertise?”

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:22.690
or, “ How does your personal philosophy
relate to our companies goals?” or even

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.740
more directly, “Why should I trust you?”

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.990
Because that’s what the decision maker really
wants to know.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:32.169
Now, this isn’t exact.

00:23:32.169 --> 00:23:37.440
It isn’t like there’s a specific hidden
question behind every question that someone

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.019
asks, um, about you.

00:23:40.019 --> 00:23:44.750
But if someone asks you one of those questions
about you or your team, it’s an opportunity

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:49.520
for you to sell yourself and your unique expertise,
and you should use it.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:54.950
Now, here’s one way to create some great
answers for those kinds of questions.

00:23:54.950 --> 00:24:02.850
Assess how you are different from the other
people who do a similar job that you do.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:10.330
Think about some stories that you could share
that exemplify your expertise.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:16.140
In other words, figure out why you are the
best person to bring your idea to life, and

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:22.530
then you can sell yourself as well as you
sell your idea.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.100
Okay.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:29.910
So now we’re going to move onto our fifth
and final technique.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:35.049
Which is, embrace pitching early in the development
process.

00:24:35.049 --> 00:24:38.490
So most people, well, first let me define
development.

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:45.200
My definition of development is the process
by which you take an initial idea and convert

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.169
it into concrete plans that can be funded
or implemented.

00:24:49.169 --> 00:24:54.570
Now most people think of pitching as something
that you do at the end of the development

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:58.580
process, after you’ve already worked out
your idea and now you’re getting ready to

00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.580
sell it.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:04.630
And that’s a lot of why people don’t start
working on their pitch until, pretty much

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:06.559
right before their big meeting.

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:13.940
But the problem is that as soon as you start
talking about your pitch out loud, inevitably,

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.820
core problems to your main idea come out.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:21.320
But at that point it’s too late for you
to do anything about it.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.470
So, what I su--, and it’s really really
hard, at that point, to create a winning pitch,

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.340
once you know there’s some serious problems
with your idea.

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:36.889
So I suggest that you bring the pitching much
earlier up into the development of your idea.

00:25:36.889 --> 00:25:42.809
So start by cr--, any time that you have an
idea, that you think is worth considerable

00:25:42.809 --> 00:25:48.510
time and energy, I suggest that you take an
hour and write a short pitch.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:55.549
Now a short pitch for your idea is simply
a one to two sentence encapsulation of that

00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:57.059
idea.

00:25:57.059 --> 00:26:02.100
And the goal of the short pitch is to assess
whether your idea is as good as you think

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:05.909
it is and, if it needs work, where you can
improve it.

00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:12.299
So you take the short pitch and, I would test
it out on your friends or colleagues.

00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:15.850
When you shared your short pitch with someone,
here’s what you’re looking for as far

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.049
as their feedback.

00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:20.549
Where did they nod or smile?

00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:22.779
Where did they frown?

00:26:22.779 --> 00:26:25.389
What questions did they ask you?

00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:28.960
What question did they ask you first?

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:34.620
So then you get that feedback from your short
pitch, you rework it, and you try it again.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:40.840
You know that you are on the right track,
if your short pitch enables someone to act.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:45.860
Here’s what that looks like, it’s like,
you, they hear the short pitch and your friend

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:52.210
says, “I’m in, how can I help?” or they
say, “ Oh, I know just the person that I

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:56.429
want to put you in touch with, let me call
so and so on your behalf.”

00:26:56.429 --> 00:27:00.940
So this is a high bar for a short pitch that
you’re motivating someone to act.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:06.740
But actually, it’s quite a reasonable one,
because eventually what your goal is, is that

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:14.520
you share the pitch in such a way with a decision
maker that they are motivated to act.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.799
So.

00:27:16.799 --> 00:27:25.549
Um, what I would say, as far as, um, a criteria
or how you’re figuring out whether your

00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:27.340
short pitch is ready to go.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:31.639
Like whether you should take your short pitch
and then continue developing the idea, is

00:27:31.639 --> 00:27:36.899
once you have the sense that your friends
or colleagues want to support and help your

00:27:36.899 --> 00:27:41.639
idea, that then you know that you’re headed
in the right direction.

00:27:41.639 --> 00:27:46.940
So, today we’ve covered five techniques.

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.490
Start by stepping back.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:53.529
Write your pitch to be spoken.

00:27:53.529 --> 00:27:56.320
Let the audience be the judge.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.170
Sell yourself as well as your idea.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:03.470
And embrace pitching early in the development
process.

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:08.419
Now decision makers want you to succeed.

00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:12.190
They often say no, almost always say no.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.519
But they really want to say yes.

00:28:14.519 --> 00:28:17.580
They want you to come in with a great idea.

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.980
They are really hoping, really hoping that
you have the answer, that you have this compelling

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:24.070
short pitch.

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:28.470
That you have a great, um, complete pitch
that motivates them to act.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.629
They want to be thrilled by your ideas.

00:28:31.629 --> 00:28:34.960
And they want to be thrilled by you.

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:42.059
So much time could be saved and so much pain
would be avoided if people with great ideas

00:28:42.059 --> 00:28:44.010
learned how to pitch.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:47.049
I have seen this work inside and outside of
Hollywood.

00:28:47.049 --> 00:28:53.220
And my clients, who work at it, sell TV shows,
sell movies and secure financing for their

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.990
entrepreneurial ventures.

00:28:54.990 --> 00:29:01.850
Now, I hope that these five techniques have
helped you to become better in a room.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:07.070
Because when the best ideas win, we all benefit.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:10.110
Thank you.

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.630
[clapping]

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:19.749
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: So now I would love to
hear any questions that you might have, specific

00:29:19.749 --> 00:29:22.260
or in general.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:26.639
&gt;&gt;Stephanie Palmer: Yes, in the front.

00:29:26.639 --> 00:29:28.139
&gt;&gt; Male #1: [inaudible]

00:29:28.139 --> 00:29:32.179
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: I’m gonna bring the
microphone over to you if that’s okay.

00:29:32.179 --> 00:29:33.179
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Sure.

00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:36.700
So in terms of like pitching in Hollywood
and around, you know, entertainment properties,

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:42.200
it seems like the elevator pitch is like this
idea of like, a very fixed short period of

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.919
time that you have to actually pitch to people.

00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:49.899
Like, what would be your best tactics in terms
of like, getting your idea across in a really

00:29:49.899 --> 00:29:52.529
short period of time, or is that like a misconception
and you actually have like an hour to really

00:29:52.529 --> 00:29:55.490
sit down and lay out like in a very well-paced
form.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:56.679
Like what’s your idea?

00:29:56.679 --> 00:30:00.340
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: Ok, so the question was
about the elevator pitch.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:07.420
And I am, um, one I think you only do have
a short time to make someone, you know, to

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:08.600
make a positive impression.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:12.710
So I think that is still true and I think
that time period is getting shorter and shorter

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:16.200
and shorter as far as people’s attention
span and how much information is coming at

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200
them.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.850
But I am totally against the idea of an elevator
pitch, for a few reasons.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:26.799
One, the term, elevator pitch, I don’t like
because I think it gives you the sense that

00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:31.169
your actually supposed to pitch someone in
an elevator, which I totally don’t like.

00:30:31.169 --> 00:30:35.830
I don’t think that you should ever pitch
someone, um, when you just have a moment of

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.480
access with them.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.590
That access is not the time to actually share
a great idea where they could move forward

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:46.570
with it and say you’re a legitimate, um,
someone that I really want to do business

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:47.570
with.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:50.350
The elevator, that’s never gonna be the
right, um, situation.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:56.110
It also, the term, elevator pitch, makes you
think that you should just pitch to anyone,

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:57.900
who you see in an elevator.

00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:04.700
Because I believe that, especially high level
buyers, are expecting a level of customization

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:11.100
and that an effective pitch is customized
to that specific person and to that specific

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.590
situation.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:14.419
Exactly what their needs are.

00:31:14.419 --> 00:31:19.840
Exactly who that person is, and an elevator
pitch that’s one size fits all, I tell everyone

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:24.200
my elevator pitch and everyone can inherently
tell that this is the same thing that you

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:29.169
say when someone asks you, you know, what
are you doing or what are you working on.

00:31:29.169 --> 00:31:32.029
People know that it’s generic and it’s
one size fits all.

00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:33.910
And no one wants to feel that.

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:38.419
They want to feel like they’re special and
you’ve customized this solution just for

00:31:38.419 --> 00:31:39.809
that specific scenario.

00:31:39.809 --> 00:31:40.809
Other questions?

00:31:40.809 --> 00:31:41.809
Yeah.

00:31:41.809 --> 00:31:42.809
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Uh, um.

00:31:42.809 --> 00:31:46.090
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: I’m supposed to stay
over here but I’ll, I’ll respond, or you

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:47.090
can come over if you want to.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:50.190
&gt;&gt; Male #2: First, I just want to thank you
for coming today.

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:53.230
You’re great.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:32:13.100
Uh, and then secondly, as you probably know,
we worked with a ton of data.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.100
right?

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.100
And uh, I’d love to hear your thoughts about
how you recommend incorporating data into

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.100
the pitch or making a more compelling pitch,
how it should support the pitch, or perhaps

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:17.100
not.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.100
[Inaudible]

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.100
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: Ok, so the question—well
one, I’m very happy to be here, so thank

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.100
you.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.830
Um, but also, uh, the question was about data,
and how to effectively include data in your

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:23.950
pitches.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:28.899
Um, and for me, if it’s just a verbal pitch,
like if you’re just talking to someone over

00:32:28.899 --> 00:32:33.080
the phone, data is really hard to convey,
effectively.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:37.919
So I think you want to be very careful about
the amount of numbers and statistics and things

00:32:37.919 --> 00:32:38.919
that you quote.

00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:43.289
But a lot of times I know, and I know that
they do here use pitch decks.

00:32:43.289 --> 00:32:48.919
And for me a philosophy of dealing with a
pitch deck is that, you are the pitch your

00:32:48.919 --> 00:32:51.030
pitch deck is not the pitch.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:56.950
So thinking of you being the lead and then
your pitch deck is just singing back up.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:02.750
So, only using the pitch deck for ways where
there’s maybe a more visual way to convey

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.010
that information more effectively than talking.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:10.519
But when you’re there in person, people,
they can get so much more information from

00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:15.119
you, a human, who’s talking and make eye
contact and reacting to the situation and

00:33:15.119 --> 00:33:21.171
making it customized so much more than anything
statistics, numbers, um, and all the other

00:33:21.171 --> 00:33:22.879
data that you have.

00:33:22.879 --> 00:33:27.940
So I think, um, thinking one, another question
that I would ask is, if there’s only one

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:33.240
piece of data that you want them to remember,
often decision makers don’t make the decision

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.649
right there in the room, that they have to
tell someone else.

00:33:36.649 --> 00:33:39.840
So you’re not, you’re no longer there
in the pitch, but they have to re-pitch it

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.289
to someone else, so thinking, what is that
story?

00:33:43.289 --> 00:33:48.279
Or what is that one amazing statistic that
they’ll remember, that they can use to re-pitch

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:53.139
why they need to be in business with Google
or why they need to do this specific thing.

00:33:53.139 --> 00:33:56.149
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: Other questions?

00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:57.149
Yeah, Mike?

00:33:57.149 --> 00:34:04.690
&gt;&gt;Mike: So you talked in the beginning about
a lot of bad ideas making it through and being

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.440
successful, so I’d love to learn more about
pitching bad ideas, because I have a lot of

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.440
those.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.440
[laughing]

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:10.340
&gt;&gt; Mike: Um, Sorry.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:16.290
Um, what I’m really curious is like, do
you spend the time to put yourself in the

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:19.910
shoes, taking a step back is one approach,
but, thinking about your audience in a different

00:34:19.910 --> 00:34:20.910
way.

00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:22.010
Like, you know, you’re pitching to a movie
executive.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:25.510
Should you try to put your hat on and pretend
that you’re them in a way?

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:30.079
Or how do you go about, like, figuring out
how to present it to the audience appropriately.

00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:35.780
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: Ok, so how I figure out
the audience is actually, I do a lot of actually

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:38.260
putting myself in that person’s shoes.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.740
That specific person, researching them.

00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.210
What can I find out about them?

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:46.650
Because if I’m, I mean to use a Hollywood
example, if I’m pitching a romantic comedy,

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:50.800
my pitch might be different if I know that
person, the executive I’m going into, is

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:55.300
right in the midst of a divorce, versus if
that person is planning their wedding and

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.800
is really excited about it.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.140
So I might customize the, the movie pitch
in some way.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:05.950
Not, that I’m changing the, what actually
happens in the movie, but just how I’m positioning

00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:09.100
it as context in the beginning of that pitch.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:15.050
And I think that there’s a lot of ways that
you can do that, um, totally outside of Hollywood

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:19.870
of figuring out, “Ok, do I know that this
person, about what age do I guess they are?”

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.020
“Are they male or are they female?”

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:24.730
“Do I know that they’ve been at the company
a long time?”

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:29.630
If I’m putting myself in their shoes, for
that specific decision maker, because really

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:35.510
all that matters is the person who makes the
decision, can I guess from what I know about

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:40.900
them or their company, that they would benefit
from, you know, at what time of the year would

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.690
be great for them to be able to sign a huge
new client.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:49.380
Or have I provide this solution that’s gonna
make them look like a hero to their supervisor

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:53.300
so they get promoted, they get a better job,
they get a raise, they’re thrilled, they’re

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.120
happy and they’re thrilled with you and
want to keep working with you because you

00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:00.109
helped make them ,that specific person, look
good.

00:36:00.109 --> 00:36:03.530
So I do think about all those, um, specific
scenarios.

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.250
Especially when there’s a lot at stake.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:09.500
If it’s a really high stakes meeting, and
there’s a lot of money at stake that could

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:14.370
make a huge difference to your quarter, your
year, that’s where I’m really taking the

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.370
time.

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:17.930
Of course, you can’t do that with every
single phone call.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:23.330
But when there’s a lot at stake, I do spend
a lot of time putting myself in that decision

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:24.350
makers shoes.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:27.330
&gt;&gt;Stephanie Palmer: Other questions?

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:28.330
Yeah?

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:29.330
Great!

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.900
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Thank you, as well, for coming
by.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:38.440
Um, I had a question about your final point,
about uh, pitch, starting the pitch, thinking

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.040
about the pitch early in the development.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:49.050
And one thought I had, or question I have
is, um, is there, is there a problem with

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:55.770
people latching too hard on to, like, ideas
that are in the pitch and unable to sort of

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.050
de-anchor off of those ideas.

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.580
You know, have they started thinking as a
comedy, for example in the film, and they,

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.170
you know the idea isn’t gelling that way,
you know, and they drift from that, and you

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:09.560
know if we made this, you know something else,
then they realize, “ Oh!

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.560
That would work!”

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.180
But it’s hard for them to sort of break
free of those original pitch ideas.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.900
Those original sorts of elements in there.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:20.050
Is that an issue you’ve seen, and are there
ways to avoid that?

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:25.460
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: I think it is, you bring
up a really good point, it is absolutely an

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:30.960
issue that I see and I think that it’s another
reason for pitching earlier in the process.

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.550
Because it’s one thing if you’ve had an
idea and you’re working on it for three

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:36.700
weeks and then someone suggests a major change.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.720
Or if you’ve been working on that for three
years and then someone suggests a change,

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:46.340
and you’re like, “No, that is not possible
that we’re doing it this specific way.”

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.840
So I think that brings a point of pitching
earlier.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:54.230
Um, there are plenty of examples in Hollywood
where they think, studio executives and I

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.830
say this as a former studio executive, give
terrible notes.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:02.510
And that writers basically hate, um, the studio
executives for telling them how to change

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:08.540
their project, and one of my clients was pitching
to a famous producer and he was pitching a

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.790
romantic comedy to star an actress like Kate
Hudson.

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:17.120
And he’s in the meeting with this big producer,
and the producer says, “I love the story,

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:21.920
keep everything the same, but change the lead
to a male chimpanzee.”

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:22.920
[Sigh]

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:23.920
[laughter]

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:29.140
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: And he was like, “Um”
But he was good, instead of saying, “No,

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:32.870
that’s the most ridiculous horrible idea
I’ve ever seen in my entire life.”

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:36.500
He was like, “You know, let me think about
it.

00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:39.260
That’s something I hadn’t considered.”

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:44.000
And ultimately, they got to work together,
and now he has a two picture deal with that

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
producer.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.030
So, even with the most ridiculous, you know,
ideas, you can still save the relationship.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.230
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: Other questions?

00:38:53.230 --> 00:39:00.290
&gt;&gt;Stephanie Palmer: Hello VC-ers, any questions?

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:13.130
Yes, you have a question.

00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:24.470
&gt;&gt; Female #1: [Inaudible]

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:32.850
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: I think that that’s
true.

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:38.650
I think that, um, perhaps the, the question
was about whether, when you’re talking about

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:44.070
selling yourself, especially in your particular
situation, is when I talk about selling mys—selling

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:49.310
yourself, that perhaps it’s more important
to focus on how you sell Google as the solution.

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:54.160
And I think that for those ideas some will
work more for certain jobs and others, or

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:58.180
if you’re, your know, having an entrepreneurial,
you’re pitching your start up, that’s

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.240
perhaps where it’s more important.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:05.910
But I think that if you are, um, forming a
relationship with a particular partner, and

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:09.630
you’re gonna be the contact, then I think
that they do want to know that there is a

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:14.570
human face to this ginormous, famous company.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:20.270
And so the more that you demonstrate that
you are a real person, and also that you’re,

00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:27.790
you know that you’re, there not, um, you
can play with the stereotype or their expectations

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.560
of Google in a nice way.

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:30.830
Where you can say, you know.

00:40:30.830 --> 00:40:38.070
Obviously, we are the 800 pound gorilla in
this area, but I am a real person here and

00:40:38.070 --> 00:40:41.870
here’s some ways that I’ve worked with
another partner, you know, another company

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:44.810
similar to yours who had this kind of concern.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:49.560
Or share something about your personal background,
where you’re from, a story from your childhood,

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:55.120
from college of how you, you know, had a specific
way to solve this solution so they know that

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:56.990
there is a real human face.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:41:03.670
Because I think that that’s, I can imagine
that being a concern for someone on the outside.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:08.040
Other questions?

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:12.410
Anything else?

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:14.600
Alright.

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.500
Well, thank you so much.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:22.270
And I’m happy if those of you have specific
questions, or a specific situation you wanna

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:26.930
do a little gaming, I would be happy to, you
know, talk to you in more specific.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.200
Or if you want to e-mail me, I’m really
available.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.930
So, thank you so much for having me, this
has been my pleasure.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:32.930
[clapping]

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:33.140
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Palmer: Thank you.
