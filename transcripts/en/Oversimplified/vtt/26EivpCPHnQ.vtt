00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.100
This video was made possible by Total War: Three Kingdoms.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.000
The brand new strategy game from the multi-award-winning Total War series.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.620
Support my channel by using the link in the description down below to buy the game on Steam.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.500
Also,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.120
new merch available now in the store, including a mystery new character pin.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.620
I wonder who it could be?

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.680
Ancient China.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.740
The sun is shining, the birds are singing, the children are playing in the village square.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.880
"What a wonderful time to be alive!

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.480
Hey, the Yellow River flooded again and destroyed all your crops.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.040
aaand also we're being raided by nomadic tribesmen,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.900
aaaand also this period of Chinese history may be entirely mythical, meaning you may not even exist.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.760
 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.160
Well, that would certainly explain the laser eyes.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.200
Chinese civilization began around the year 2000 BC, when the (possibly mythical) Xia dynasty was formed.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.360
Throughout China's history,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.039
dynasties would usually rise up with a powerful leader who worked for the good of the people.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.600
But over time, the leaders would become more corrupt and self-serving.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.340
Someone would inevitably build a lake of alcohol and the angry populace would overthrow them, giving way for a new dynasty to rise.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.380
Following this pattern, the Xia dynasty was replaced by the Shang, who liked bronze and writing.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.320
But then the leaders got corrupt and were replaced by the Zhou, who liked the iron and philosophy.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.600
But that one sort of just fell apart and was replaced by the Qin, who liked building walls and people made out of rock.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.220
But they were pretty tyrannical from the start, and were quickly replaced by the Han,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.940
who liked creating new trade routes and getting in touch with their emotions.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.760
In line with this pattern, the Han dynasty came about under the strong and popular leadership of Emperor Gaozu.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.980
The dynasty remained firmly in place for over four centuries, and was considered a golden age in Chinese history,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.938
developing new forms of art, political thinking, technology...

00:01:34.938 --> 00:01:36.920
Oh, looks like all the leaders got corrupt.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.860
See, probably the biggest problem in ancient China's political system that allowed so much corruption to come about all the time

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.360
was a little something called Court Culture.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.260
Let me explain.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.700
Imagine for me, if you will, that you are the son of the Chinese emperor.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:50.520
Hooray!

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.990
Now apart from how weird it is that you have a ton of stepmoms and many of them would like to kill you, and also

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.220
all of your friends are middle-aged dudes with no dongs, life's pretty alright.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.100
One day your father says,

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.520
"Son, I know our relationship hasn't been the best, and I've never said this before

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.600
but I just want to let you know that I love y-

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.100
Oh no! I'm having a heart attack!"

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.000
(oof)

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.740
Look at you. Now YOU're the Emperor.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.970
I'm so proud of you.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.720
But wait!

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.080
You are but a child and have no idea how to rule over a massive empire?

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.980
Fret not! Because just about everyone in your court wants to help you out with that.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.140
"Hey, man, remember me? I'm your mom's bro.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.820
Anyway, I heard you needed someone to rule over China for you. I mean to help you rule China.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.300
So hey, here's a popsicle. I hope we can get along."

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.540
"No way m an. We've been your friends and your personal caretakers your whole life,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.440
and even though we may have no dongs, I think you should give US all the power to rule China.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.420
I mean, help you rule China."

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.300
So who will you be influenced by? Your scheming uncle, or your loyal eunuchs?

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.180
And towards the end of the Han dynasty, a string of child emperors allowed more and more power to fall into the hands of the eunuchs.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.340
Oh no! Now they're scheming too!

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.680
They began handing out government jobs for bribes, heavily taxing the poor for their own wealth,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.980
and while you're sitting there eating your popsicle, everyone in your court is

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.340
literally murdering each other to try and consolidate more power and riches for themselves,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.680
while all the peasants are outside like:

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.180
"Hey, did you guys know there's been a drought out here for two years?"

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.880
"Guys?"

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.000
Obviously, the people weren't too happy that while they were struggling to survive, they're also been heavily taxed,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.540
so that the eunuch faction could all have rocking mansions, complete with swimming pools and Alexas.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.900
So finally, when a self-proclaimed Taoist wizard came along and was like,

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.220
"You know whose fault it is that we're all out here starving?

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.220
It's the Emperor and his posse!

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.960
They've lost their mandate from heaven and the imperial family must be DESTROYED

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.320
with an UNRELENTING, FURIOUS WRATH!!!

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.200
Also check this out. Eh? Can you tell what it is yet?

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.560
Tada! It's a little kitty-cat!"

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.860
"Look at her little ears!"

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.560
The people loved his political philosophy. He promised them land reforms and his followers grew in number.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.260
They began arming themselves and wearing yellow turbans,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.780
and they also developed a really catchy slogan.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.700
In the year 184, the Yellow Turban rebellion broke out across China,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.060
with millions rising up against the Han dynasty and the imperial government in the capital city freaked out.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.660
With all their internal bickering,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.450
they were completely unprepared and unable to deal with such a huge rebellion.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.560
So they were forced to call in independent warlords from across the Empire to help them deal with this situation.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.740
Some big names took part in the fighting,

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.360
I'm talking the likes of the great Cao Cao, the tyrannical Dong Zhuo, Liu Bei, Sun Jian,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.640
and many many other Chinese names I'm definitely not pronouncing correctly.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.120
These warlords crushed the rebellion in their own respective regions,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.840
and with casualties in the millions, the Han dynasty breathed a huge sigh of relief.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:40.600
But what they didn't realize, is that by relying on all the warlords and their armies, they had essentially diminished their own central control over the empire

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.160
and many of the warlords now held the power to act almost completely independently and rule over their own local regions themselves.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.860
Back in the capital, the Emperor and his son were having a little chat.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.940
"Listen, I know we've had our ups and downs,

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.300
and I spent all of my time with your many, MANY smokin' hot stepmoms instead of you.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.620
But what say you and I finally go on a little fishing trip together this weeke-

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.220
Oh NO, I'm having a stroke-"

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.720
(oof)

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.540
and yet another child emperor was on the throne.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.820
This time, however, instead of the eunuch faction gaining even more power,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:14.940
this Child Emperor's uncle became his regent, who also just so happened to be the head of the Imperial Army, He Jin.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.840
"Man,

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.360
"Man, I hate those sneaky lying cheating eunuchs.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.680
Hey warlord, Yuan Shao. What should we do?"

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.900
"Kill them all."

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.460
[Silence]

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.000
"Right on."

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.300
"You can't kill the eunuchs! They're a vital part of this Empire's governance!

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.540
And also they paid me a lot of money to say that about them."

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.057
"Aw, c'mooon!"

00:05:33.057 --> 00:05:33.599
"No."

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.340
So He Jin and Yuan Shao decided the Empress may need more convincing,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.080
and so they called in an infamous,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.640
and so they called in an infamous, feared

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.660
and so they called in an infamous, feared, tyrannical,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.260
overweight warlord from the Northwest to help convince her.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.360
That man, was Dong Zhuo.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.420
And he set out for the capital city with his army.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.680
"Hey guys, I heard a rumor that He Jin was planning on killing us."

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.600
"Then why don't we kill him first!"

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.140
And so it was. They lured him to the palace with a forged letter from his sister and when he got there,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.320
they lobbed off his head.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.320
[Slice sounds]

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.040
[Silence]

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.340
"Kill them all."

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.640
Imperial Forces stormed the palace and the eunuchs were all massacred.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.960
The peasants, who were still suffering from drought and starvation, saw what was going on and began to riot.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.960
The Emperor and his brother were forced to flee the city, which was now in flames.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.700
And the feared, nasty, tyrannical, bloated Dong Zhuo had just arrived.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.360
He found the Emperor and his brother wandering the hills outside of the city and was understandably confused,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.200
so he scooped up the Emperor, went to the capital and was like,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.340
"Hey guys, what's up? I see the capital is on fire."

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.080
"Also, I'm here with my army and I have the Emperor with me."

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.320
"Waaaait a minute! The capital is on fire. I'm here with my army and I have the Emperor!

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.020
Screw you guys! I'M IN CHARGE!"

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.520
So now Dong Zhuo ruled over the Han dynasty as the Emperor's Regent.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.420
His first act was to say to the Emperor,

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.019
"Hey man, no hard feelings, but I like your little brother better. So I'm actually making him Emperor instead of you."

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.020
"So you're free to go do whatever you want."

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:59.660
"Actually..."

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.620
"Yeah, that feels better."

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.360
Dong Zhuo ruled with an iron fist. And he did whatever the flip he wanted.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.480
He made absolute decisions himself, showing no regard for the monarchy.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.980
He had his opponents or those who disagreed with him killed.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.600
He broke protocol, doing things like keeping his sword when approaching the Emperor,

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.480
[Gasp sounds]

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.480
wearing shoes in the court,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.220
[More gasp sounds]

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.620
sleeping in the Emperor's bed.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.300
And worst of all, he would walk in the presence of the Emperor.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.880
You were meant to TROT.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.800
The other warlords around the Empire hated him, and so they said,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.720
"Something needs to be done about this guy.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.220
What say we form a coalition and oust him?"

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.140
And it was agreed.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:41.320
Warlords from across China, their armies amounting to a hundred thousand men, allied together against the tyranny of Dong Zhuo.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.159
Yuan Shao's coalition consisted of some of the nation's most capable leaders,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.100
including his half-brother Yuan Shu, the great Cao Cao and Sun Jian.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.300
But Dong Zhuo had an ace up his sleeve.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:56.460
His protégé, and adopted son, one of the most skilled and feared warriors in all of China.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:57.580
It's Lu Bu!

00:07:57.580 --> 00:08:02.500
This guy was a beast of a man. He never lost a duel and no other warlord dared challenge him to one.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.824
He was also famous for betraying just about every warlord he ever fought for,

00:08:05.824 --> 00:08:08.100
something that Dong Zhuo didn't seem too concerned about.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.340
The coalition attacked Dong Zhuo in Luoyang,

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:14.080
and in particular, Sun Jian's forces inflicted a heavy defeat against him,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.320
and he was forced to flee to the city of Chang'an.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.940
After this initial success, however, the war entered into a stalemate.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.489
The warlords in the coalition realized it was going nowhere, and also they all secretly hated each other,

00:08:24.489 --> 00:08:25.960
so they all went home.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.260
Dong Zhuo was safe.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.240
Until...

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.460
Legend has it that a government official in Chang'an had a daughter who was hot.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.420
SUPER hot.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.720
He invited Lu Bu to his home and promised Lu Bu that someday he could marry his daughter.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.700
Then he invited Dong Zhuo to his house and did the exact same thing.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.120
Dong Zhuo was so smitten that he insisted on taking her as his concubine immediately,

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.780
and when Lu Bu heard the news, he was pretty unhappy.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.100
"Hey man, aren't you worried that you stole Lu Bu's girl, and betrayal is like his personal hobby."

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.980
"Lu Bu? Betray me?

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.020
No way, man. Never gonna happen-"

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:02.080
Aw crap.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.580
Lu Bu, along with other government officials,

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.560
assassinated the tyrannical Dong Zhuo. Then they left his body burning in the streets.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.399
Some sources say he was so fat and oily he kept on burning for days. Nice.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.540
So with Dong Zhuo dead, and the power of the Han government essentially decimated,

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:23.620
China was left with a huge power gap, and a ton of warlords who all slept soundly at night dreaming of being the one to fill it.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:30.100
Here we enter into a crazy and chaotic period of civil war all across China, with so many people, so much betrayal,

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.900
so much intricacy, it makes Game of Thrones look like a Dr. Seuss publication.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.719
But just to give you an idea of how crazy and chaotic it was, see if you're able to keep up with this.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:40.740
Are you ready? Here we go.

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.999
Here's a rough map of the warlords throughout the Han dynasty at the time.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.120
Half-brothers Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu were both in a power struggle for who had become the figurehead of their family.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.280
Yuan Shu made alliances with warlords in the north, along with Sun Jian,

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:58.430
the guy who defeated Dong Zhuo. Yuan Shao also made alliances, with Liu Biao in the south, and Cao Cao, who was an amazing

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:04.549
strategist and general. All of these warlords began fighting each other, Cao Cao began building his own strength by subjugating

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.129
nearby remnants of the Yellow Turban rebellion into his own forces. Down south, things weren't going so well for Sin

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:16.500
Jian, as he was killed in an ambush. So Sun's son, Sun Ce, took over. Then, Yuan Shao got pushed back to the river Hwai.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:22.400
So he ordered Sun Ce to take the territory of warlord Liu Kang. Then, Sin Ce went off to capture territories in the east for

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:29.480
himself. Cao Cao's family lived in this province over here. One day, they were murdered. Oh no, Cao Cao held the province's governor responsible,

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.730
and so he launched a cruel invasion, in which he pillaged cities and murdered over a hundred thousand civilians.

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:40.220
The governor sent out a call for help, and a very popular likeable warlord by the name of Liu Bei came to his aid.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:47.480
However, while Cao Cao was away fighting, a rebellion was staged against him in his home province, by none other than, it's Lu Bu. Cao Cao

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.670
rushed home and defeated Lu Bu, who fled to the east, which by now had been inherited by Liu Bei. Then Lu Bu,

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:58.129
surprise surprise, launched a rebellion against Liu Bei, who fled to Cao Cao. Cao Cao and Liu Bei

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:00.130
would go on to invade and defeat Lu Bu.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:05.360
Lu Bu offered to join Cao Cao and Cao Cao considered the offer, but his advisors were like, "No way, man

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:08.930
This guy's betrayed literally everyone he ever worked for." And so, boo hoo,

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.040
Lu Bu was executed. Next, Cao Cao convinced the Emperor to move in with him.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.049
Now he's in control of the Han government, something that made his allies very jealous. Yuan Shu, out of nowhere,

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.079
decides to declare himself emperor of the new Zhong dynasty.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.880
Nobody liked that. His allies cut ties with him, the Imperial Government ordered everyone to kill him,

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:27.680
he tried to flee to his brother Yuan Shou,

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:31.070
but died of illness on the way. Sun Ce took over his territory and then got assassinated,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:38.119
so his brother Sun Quan took over. Liu Bei turned on Cao Cao, but got obliterated and was forced to flee south Yuan Shao

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.029
finally defeated the warlord to his north, and could now focus south.

00:11:41.029 --> 00:11:46.600
He declared war on his ally Cao Cao, but was defeated at the Battle of Guandu. Cao Cao has now united the north

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.880
and he turned his attention to the south. In particular,

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.519
Liu Biao's province was becoming a powerful threat. So Cao Cao attacked him.

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:55.820
Liu Bei was now fighting for Liu Biao and he held Cao Cao off for a while,

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.559
but then Liu Biao died and his son took over and immediately surrendered to Cao Cao. Liu Bei was

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.709
horrified, and he fled southward to try and maintain control of the province.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:07.760
Cao Cao was on an absolute roll, and it looked like he would be the one to take control of China.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:11.840
He began making plans to attack both Liu Bei and Sun Quan, and the two of them

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:16.250
seeing where things were headed, met up and decided to form an alliance. Now

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.420
I know that was a lot to take in,

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:22.459
but all you really need to know at this point is that this guy is on his way to taking over everything, and he's about

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.240
to throw his full weight at the southern warlords. These two have one chance.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:33.650
One battle to prevent him from invading the south, and that battle was the famous Battle of Red Cliffs. To take the south,

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.560
Cao Cao would need to control and cross the mighty Yangtze River.

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:41.719
He had over two hundred thousand men to face against Liu Bei and Sun Quan's combined force of 50,000.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:47.690
How would they stand a chance when they were so outnumbered? Legend says most of Sun Quan's advisers pleaded with him to surrender,

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.330
but then he smashed up a table and they all backed down.

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.480
Luckily, Cao Cao's forces were ravaged by disease and exhaustion, and his northern soldiers weren't too comfortable on ships,

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.040
So when Cao Cao sailed down the river and the two sides met for an initial skirmish at Wulin, Cao Cao

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:07.009
was unable to inflict a defeat against the Allies. Then one of Sun Quan's men came up with a very sneaky plan.

00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:12.760
He sent Cao Cao a letter, pretending that he and others wanted to defect to his side, and offered to bring him some of Lui Bei

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.700
and Sun Quan's finest ships.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:20.720
Little did Cao Cao know however, that those ships were full of flammable reeds. As they approached his fleet,

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.040
they were set alight and destroyed his ships in camp. Seeing the situation as hopeless,

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:31.520
Cao Cao ordered a difficult retreat through the rain and marshlands, during which more of his men fell to illness and disease.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.180
The underdogs had won, and Cao Cao would never again have another chance to take the south.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:43.189
Following that, the three warlords took some time to finish off some smaller competitors in their own regions and by the year 214,

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.780
China looked a little bit like this. Cao Cao continued to try to penetrate the southern regions,

00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:52.249
but had no success, and even lost the Yangzhou region to Liu Bei in 217.

00:13:52.249 --> 00:13:57.400
The former allies eventually fell out over who should own this territory here, with Sun Quan coming out on top.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.000
In 220, Cao Cao died of a head disease and was replaced by his son,

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:07.999
Cao Pi. Cao Pi convinced the Emperor of Han to abdicate and then proclaimed himself the Emperor of the new state of Wei. Liu Bei

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.870
followed suit, declaring himself the true Emperor of Shu (Han), and a few years later

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:17.599
Sun Quan joined in the fun and declared himself emperor of Wu, and so now you have a number of kingdoms in China.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:23.959
How many? Count them. One, Two, Three. Three kingdoms, except actually, they weren't kingdoms.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.780
They were dynasties,

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:30.700
and when the Three Kingdoms finally formed, not a whole lot happened. For the next three decades they continued to engage in combat,

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:34.190
but it almost always ended in stalemate, and nobody really got anywhere.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:40.069
So how did it all end? Did Cao Cao's descendants eventually realize his dream of unifying China? Not quite.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:45.340
Instead the Three Kingdoms became victims of the usual problems that plagued Chinese dynasties.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:52.240
In Wu, Sun Quan's descendent became a tyrant, who is more interested in spending time with his concubines than governing. In Shu (Han),

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:59.060
a powerful, corrupt eunuch faction rose up, and by now we all know how that ends. And in Wei, a string of young emperors gave way

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.049
for a powerful family, the Sima clan to take control of the dynasty's government.

00:15:03.049 --> 00:15:09.100
This Sima clan recognized the weak state Shu and Wu had been reduced to, and so they began making plans.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:14.200
"I've just received this letter that says Wei is planning to attack us. Should we make preparations for war?" "Nah.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.840
It's probably nothing to worry about. Let's do absolutely nothing."

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.960
"Sounds good to me."

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:26.899
Wei launched a full-scale invasion into Shu which fell within a year. Then Sima Yan forced the Wei Emperor to abdicate and proclaimed himself

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.390
Emperor of the new Jin dynasty. In the year

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:37.369
279, Jin launched an invasion of Wu, and finally unified China in the year 280. The pattern of rising and falling dynasties,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:41.200
division and reunification, would continue in China

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.240
for centuries to come.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:45.840
Right now you may be asking yourself, but wait a minute,

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.300
What would have happened if Cao Cao had his way in unifying China or what if Lu Bu never assassinated Dong Zhuo

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.320
and he continued to rule over the Han dynasty?

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.400
What about if one of these smaller warlords had risen to the top? Think, what if I want to be a warlord during the

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.490
downfall of the Han dynasty!

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.990
Whoa, partner, calm down, because now you can.

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:10.250
