00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.265
- [Voiceover] The graph
of f is shown below.

00:00:03.265 --> 00:00:07.018
Let g(x) be equal to the def intergral

00:00:07.018 --> 00:00:11.133
from zero to x, of f(t)dt.

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.715
Now at first when you
see this you're like,

00:00:12.715 --> 00:00:14.588
wow this is strange, I have a function

00:00:14.588 --> 00:00:17.116
that is being defined by an integral,

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:19.941
a def integral, but one
of it's bounds are X.

00:00:19.941 --> 00:00:21.857
You should just say well this is okay,

00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:23.955
a function can be defined any which way,

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:25.878
and as we'll see, it's
actually quite straight forward

00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:27.195
to evaluate this.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:28.945
So g of negative two,

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:31.459
g of negative two,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.720
and I'll do the negative
two in a different color,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.137
g of negative two,

00:00:36.137 --> 00:00:38.416
what we do is take this
expression over here,

00:00:38.416 --> 00:00:40.406
this def integral, and
where ever we see an X,

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.968
we replace it with a negative two.

00:00:41.968 --> 00:00:44.612
So this is going to be equal to,

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:46.699
the integral from zero to X,

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.068
and I'll write X in a second, f(t)dt.

00:00:51.068 --> 00:00:55.535
Well X is now negative two,
this is now negative two.

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:58.020
So how do we figure out what this is?

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.991
Before we even look at this graph,

00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:02.501
you might say okay this
is the region under,

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:04.731
the area of the region under the graph,

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.762
y equals f(t), between
negative two and zero.

00:01:08.762 --> 00:01:11.103
But you have to be careful, notice,

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:13.452
our upper bound here is
actually a lower number

00:01:13.452 --> 00:01:15.782
than our lower bound right over here.

00:01:15.782 --> 00:01:18.871
So it will be nice to swap those bounds

00:01:18.871 --> 00:01:21.900
so we can truly view it
as the area of the region

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.067
under f(t), above the t axis,
between those two bounds.

00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:31.575
When you swap the bounds,
this is going to be equal to

00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.444
negative def integral,

00:01:33.444 --> 00:01:34.944
from negative two,

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:37.908
negative two to zero,

00:01:39.645 --> 00:01:41.895
of f(t)dt,

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:45.366
and now what we have right over here,

00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:47.325
what I'm squaring off in magenta,

00:01:47.325 --> 00:01:50.080
this is the area under the curve f,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.224
between negative two and zero.

00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:54.974
So between negative two and zero,

00:01:57.086 --> 00:01:58.897
so that is this area,

00:01:58.897 --> 00:02:02.206
right over here, that we care about.

00:02:02.206 --> 00:02:04.623
Now what is that going to be?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.368
There's a bunch of different
ways that you could do this,

00:02:07.368 --> 00:02:09.737
you could split it off
into a square and triangle.

00:02:09.737 --> 00:02:12.458
The area of this square here is four,

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:16.634
it's two by two, make
sure to look at the units,

00:02:16.634 --> 00:02:19.117
sometimes each square doesn't
represent one square unit,

00:02:19.117 --> 00:02:21.385
in this case it does, so that's four,

00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:24.184
and then up here, this is half of four.

00:02:24.184 --> 00:02:26.380
If it was all of this, that would be four,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.519
this triangle is half
of four, so this is two.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.746
Or you could view this as base
times height times one half,

00:02:33.746 --> 00:02:36.382
which is going to be two
times two times one half.

00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:40.476
So this area is six, so this part is six,

00:02:40.476 --> 00:02:42.616
but we can't forget that negative sign,

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:46.366
so this is going to be
equal to negative six.

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:51.651
So g(-2) is negative six.
