00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:45.678 size:88% position:44%
  There's no need to
  threaten people.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:46.646 size:88% position:44%
  - Okay, I'm sorry.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.081 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:50.249 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Now, you were the
 guy, in college,

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:52.251
that actually boo-ed comedians.

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:53.486
 - Yes.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:54.420 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - So then you start
 doing comedies.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:55.388
 - Yes.

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:56.689 size:84% position:42%
  - Were you every fearful,

00:00:56.722 --> 00:00:58.424 size:88% position:44%
  of running into a
  guy like yourself?

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.293 align:start size:88% position:13%
 That I like to call
 the ass(bleep).

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:01.261 size:88% position:44%
 - Yes, yes.

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.430
 - Why did you boo comedians?

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:05.865
 What would you think?

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:07.400 align:start position:0%
  - 'Cause on college
  campus, I was known to be

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:08.701 size:88% position:44%
 the funny guy, so whenever,

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.204
 I always had my same
 seat at every show.

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:13.106
 It would be like, you see how
 you got these rows right here?

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.607 size:88% position:44%
 I be right in the
 middle dead center.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.109 align:start position:0%
  Right in the middle, right
  there where my man at,

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:16.909
- So they could see you?

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:17.810
- So they could see me.

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:18.744 align:start size:75% position:25%
 - Eye contact.
 - Right.

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:20.012
- And then everybody look at me,

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.247 size:84% position:42%
  if the comedian
  ain't doing good,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.249
 everybody look at me
 like, it's that time.

00:01:23.282 --> 00:01:25.718 size:88% position:44%
 Then I would just stand up.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:26.586 size:84% position:42%
  Ahhhhhhh.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.021
 Booooooooooooooooooo

00:01:29.054 --> 00:01:30.523 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:33.292 size:88% position:44%
 Then everybody join in and
 the comedian got off stage.

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:35.461
(laughs)

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:37.396 size:88% position:44%
 - What a dick, what a dick.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.066 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.334
 - But mind you, at this time,

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.568
 I didn't know it was
 a craft and all that.

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:43.836 align:start size:88% position:13%
 This was before I was
 thinking about it.

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.204 align:start size:88% position:13%
I just like, yo every
comedian should be funny

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:46.772 align:start position:0%
  if they gon' get on stage.
  - Yeah, yeah.

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.641 size:88% position:44%
  What sparked the decision
  to pursue stand-up comedy?

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:50.943 size:84% position:42%
  - Kings of Comedy
  came out in 2000

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:52.979 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and I remember leaving
 the theater and
 couple people saying,

00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:54.480
when are you gonna get on stage?

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:56.149 size:84% position:42%
  - Really?
  - Yes.

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:58.851 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - So was there a
 weird transition for
 you when you tried

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:00.286
 to start doing comedy?

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.654 align:start position:0%
  Was there a weird
  separation from being the

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:04.257 size:88% position:44%
  the instant funny,
  within the group,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.591
 and then trying to
 be the guy on stage?

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:06.726 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - It was a transition
 regardless.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:07.994 size:88% position:44%
  It's gonna be a transition

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:09.462
 'cause you in front of
 people you don't know.

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:10.696 size:84% position:42%
  When you in front of your
  friends, they know you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.898 size:88% position:44%
  so they know you
  about to be funny.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:14.901 align:start size:88% position:13%
But when people pay,
and they don't know you,

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:15.701
 you got to be funny.

00:02:15.734 --> 00:02:16.669 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:17.937
It was definitely a transition.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.472 size:88% position:44%
 It was definitely a
 transition though.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.040 size:88% position:44%
  - I've seen you grown and
  develop from the comedian,

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:23.609 size:88% position:44%
  that at one point had the
  three to five minute sets.

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:26.445 size:88% position:44%
  And those five minute sets
  grew to 10 minutes sets.

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:27.947
 So take this stage and
 do what you do best.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.315 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'm proud of you man,
 I'm happy for you.

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:30.283 size:88% position:44%
 Next level brother.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.250 size:88% position:44%
  Go do what you do.

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:32.118 size:88% position:44%
 (audience applause)
