00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.880
I'm going to help you get going with your code. And, the first

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.980
thing you're going to need to do, is set up your development environment.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.710
Actually, that's the second thing you need to do. The first thing

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.100
I'm going to have you do is download the code that you're going to

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.880
be using in this course. So to get the code, all you

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.950
have to do is click this Download ZIP button here in the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.670
bottom right corner. When you do that, it's going to download the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.490
ZIP of all the code in this repository to your computer. When you've

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.640
downloaded it, expand the ZIP and you'll see all the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.200
folders for each of the lessons. Here's Lesson 2, Lesson

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.970
3, Lesson 4, and so on. Right now, go ahead

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.860
and download the ZIP for all the code for the course
