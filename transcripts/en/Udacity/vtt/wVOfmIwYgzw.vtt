00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.590
So let's see if we understood the difference between

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.224
the disks and the tape. If we want to read

00:00:05.224 --> 00:00:08.584
a gigabyte file from start to end it is okay

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:11.368
to use disk or tape, or is it okay to

00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:16.321
use both as far as performance is concerned? But

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.016
if we want to read just the first and just the

00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:21.942
last byte of a one gigabyte file that will work

00:00:21.942 --> 00:00:25.561
reasonably well with a disk, with a tape, with neither

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:29.000
of them, or with both of them. And if we want to make a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.890
cat happy, we would give it a hard drive or a reel of magnetic tape.
