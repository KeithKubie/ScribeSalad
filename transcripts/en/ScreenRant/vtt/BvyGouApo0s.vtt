00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.800
Typically, movies are made to be watched more
than once. Often times, there’s so much

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.160
happening on the screen that multiple viewings
are the only way to take it all in. Filmmakers

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.390
are very much aware of this, and some of them
like to put in a few extra details that make

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.790
revisits all the worthwhile. Be warned, there
are spoilers in this video! Here are Screen

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:33.290
rant’s 10 Amazing Details Hidden In Popular
Movies.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.760
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.089
Fans of J.J. Abrams’ filmography know that
he likes to honor his grandfather Harry Kelvin

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:44.699
in his movies. George Kirk’s ship in the
first Star Trek was called the U.S.S. Kelvin

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.270
and Star Trek Into Darkness featured the Kelvin
Memorial Archive. When Abrams made the jump

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.910
to a galaxy far, far away to make The Force
Awakens, he continued the tradition. After

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.790
saving BB-8 from his captivity, Rey points
him in the direction of Kelvin Ridge on the

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.890
planet Jakku so the droid can get back to
civilization. It’s one of the ways Abrams

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.580
put a personal stamp on the project and tipped
his hat to his beloved family member.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.540
Jurassic World

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.580
This fourth installment pays homage to the
seminal 1993 original on several occasions,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.710
but some are not so obvious as others. Main
character Claire Dearing is the park’s operations

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.460
manager, essentially putting her in charge
of the whole operation. You may not notice

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.390
at first that she’s wearing all white throughout
the film, similar to John Hammond’s wardrobe

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.180
in the first movie. It’s a subtle way to
pay respect to what came before and symbolize

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.850
Claire being the director of the park, much
like Hammond was. Maybe it’s a Jurassic

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.960
dress code policy the overseers have to wear
white.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.210
Straight Outta Compton

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.150
Director F. Gary Gray worked with the real
Ice Cube on the cult comedy&nbsp;Friday, so it's

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.560
no surprise his NWA biopic is filled with
references to that film. Ice Cube is shown

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.790
working on the screenplay for the movie in
one scene, and there's even homage in the&nbsp;Straight

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.880
Outta Compton&nbsp;dialogue. When the group kicks
a woman out of a hotel party, Cube says, "Bye

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.670
Felicia," a reference to the famous line in&nbsp;Friday.
Perhaps this was the inspiration? After all,

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.979
they say write what you know

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.730
Ant-Man

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.290
Each project in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
is known for making references to other films

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.599
in the franchise, showing moviegoers how it’s
all connected. Ant-Man is no different, ironically

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.180
paying homage to one of the MCU’s greatest
giants. In some of the San Francisco-set scenes,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.590
there are posters visible advertising the
soda company Pingo Doce. This soft drink was

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.739
featured in 2008’s The Incredible Hulk.
Bruce Banner worked at one of their factories

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.730
in Brazil, and the Stan Lee cameo saw the
comics icon taking a sip of the product. Incredible

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.989
Hulk is a shortchanged film in the series,
so it’s nice to see it be recognized.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.079
Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:55.421
The Mission: Impossible franchise is not one
known for continuity, as each installment

00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:59.900
operates as its own self-contained story.
At the ending of 2011’s Ghost Protocol,

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.079
Ethan Hunt gives his team a new assignment
to track down a group called the Syndicate.

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:13.139
Fans didn’t think much of it, but when we
rejoin the IMF in 2015, they’re still pursuing

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:18.480
the Syndicate, establishing some connective
tissue between the two films. Nowadays, blockbusters

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.709
can’t resist teasing their next installment,
and M:I had to join in on all the fun. It

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.909
was cool to see the fifth film pick up where
the fourth one left off, but nobody knows

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.519
why Paula Patton is missing for this adventure.

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.249
The Martian

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:37.819
Directors like to make little references to
their earlier works in modern films, and Ridley

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.079
Scott paid respects to his classic sci-fi
history while making The Martian. There’s

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.870
a moment in the film where astronaut Beck
has to make a dangerous trip outside the Hermes

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.559
spacecraft. While he’s preparing for his
task, Beth tells him that he has to be careful,

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:58.430
because “In space…”. The unfinished
quote is a tip of the hat to Scott’s Alien,

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.209
known by its tremendous tagline, “in space,
no one can hear you scream.” The Martian

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.760
has a few pop culture nods, so it only makes
sense Ellen Ripley would be one of them.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.309
Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:18.210
As it turns out, you don’t even need to
be a part of the MCU in order to get a nod

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:22.860
in a Marvel movie. When Tony Stark is looking
to pick a new A.I. system, one of the chips

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.880
he has available is labeled “Tadashi”.
This is a reference to the maker the loveable

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.530
robot Baymax, Tadashi Hamada, in Big Hero
Six. That Disney animated film is based on

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.020
the Marvel comic of the same name, suggesting
that the two movies could be part of the same

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.760
universe. Avengers: Infinity War is going
to have a loaded roster, but there wouldn’t

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.090
be too many against a Baymax cameo. After
all, the groundwork’s been laid out.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.730
Inside Out

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.010
The five emotions of Pixar’s film received
pitch-perfect casting, but that wasn’t the

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.340
only way for fans to tell them apart. According
to director Pete Doctor, each character is

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.790
based on a shape that represents their personality.
Joy is a star, Sadness is a teardrop, Anger

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:09.080
is a firebrick, Fear is a frayed nerve, and
Disgust is a piece of broccoli. It was a nice

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.100
touch that made each emotion unique and memorable,
even if they all don’t have the same amount

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.260
of screen time. It’s that kind of attention
to detail that made Inside Out a favorite

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.510
with moviegoers.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.880
Mad Max: Fury Road

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.620
Fury Road is very much a Mad Max reboot, setting
the foundation for a new future with Tom Hardy

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.500
as the Road Warrior. But that didn’t mean
George Miller wiped the slate clean entirely.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.210
He found a spot to pay homage to the original
Mad Max films, giving Hardy’s version a

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.580
replica of Mel Gibson’s jacket from the
final two installments of the first trilogy.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.750
Longtime fans may be disappointed Gibson’s
days of playing the character are done, but

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.870
this was a cool Easter egg for them to enjoy,
showing that Miller respects the franchise’s

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.520
roots.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.750
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.710
The seventh episode of the saga makes a few
references to the galaxy’s rich history,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.470
and nowhere is that more apparent than Maz’
castle on Takodana. When Han takes Rey, Finn,

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.591
and BB-8 in to see Maz, a shot of the building
features numerous flags hanging outside. One

00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:16.831
of them clearly features the Mandalorian symbol,
a nod to famed bounty hunter Boba Fett. Some

00:06:16.831 --> 00:06:21.460
of them may even be replicas of the podracing
flags from Episode I, illustrating Abrams

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.550
wasn’t so averse to referencing the maligned
prequel as he may have led on.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.080
Those are our picks for some amazing little
details hidden in 2015’s biggest films.
