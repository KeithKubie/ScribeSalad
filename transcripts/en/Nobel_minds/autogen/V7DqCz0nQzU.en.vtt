energy ratchet mechanism and so this is

00:16:14.379 --> 00:16:14.389
energy ratchet mechanism and so this is
 

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:18.429
energy ratchet mechanism and so this is
where we need to have a situation where

00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:18.439
where we need to have a situation where
 

00:16:18.439 --> 00:16:20.979
where we need to have a situation where
we can get unidirectional motion to

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:20.989
we can get unidirectional motion to
 

00:16:20.989 --> 00:16:23.649
we can get unidirectional motion to
begin with in a situation and I'll use

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:23.659
begin with in a situation and I'll use
 

00:16:23.659 --> 00:16:25.960

00:16:27.609 --> 00:16:27.619
cyclo fin you're already familiar with
 

00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:30.549
cyclo fin you're already familiar with
and we want to be able to bring it on to

00:16:30.549 --> 00:16:30.559
and we want to be able to bring it on to
 

00:16:30.559 --> 00:16:32.859
and we want to be able to bring it on to
this dumbbell such that it comes over

00:16:32.859 --> 00:16:32.869
this dumbbell such that it comes over
 

00:16:32.869 --> 00:16:36.549
this dumbbell such that it comes over
the neutral end and after having done

00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:36.559
the neutral end and after having done
 

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:38.289
the neutral end and after having done
that because of the recognition between

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:38.299
that because of the recognition between
 

00:16:38.299 --> 00:16:41.919
that because of the recognition between
the nap saline and the ring system to

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:41.929
the nap saline and the ring system to
 

00:16:41.929 --> 00:16:44.110
the nap saline and the ring system to
eject it by the right hand side

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.120
eject it by the right hand side
 

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:46.930
eject it by the right hand side
it over the charged end and this is

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:46.940
it over the charged end and this is
 

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:50.230
it over the charged end and this is
achieved by juggling around of energy

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240
achieved by juggling around of energy
 

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.910
achieved by juggling around of energy
barriers so here is the lower energy

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920
barriers so here is the lower energy
 

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.980
barriers so here is the lower energy
barrier comes over the neutral one and

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:53.990
barrier comes over the neutral one and
 

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:59.079
barrier comes over the neutral one and
then by changing the oxidation state a

00:16:59.079 --> 00:16:59.089
then by changing the oxidation state a
 

00:16:59.089 --> 00:17:01.240
then by changing the oxidation state a
reduction state of the Ring and taking

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:01.250
reduction state of the Ring and taking
 

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.910
reduction state of the Ring and taking
it to a base radical cation we reduced

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920
it to a base radical cation we reduced
 

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.740
it to a base radical cation we reduced
the positive charge and it comes off the

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:05.750
the positive charge and it comes off the
 

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.720
the positive charge and it comes off the
right-hand side so this is a way by

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:07.730
right-hand side so this is a way by
 

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:10.449
right-hand side so this is a way by
which you can get one of the necessary

00:17:10.449 --> 00:17:10.459
which you can get one of the necessary
 

00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:12.790
which you can get one of the necessary
things to be able to build a molecular

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:12.800
things to be able to build a molecular
 

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.370
things to be able to build a molecular
machine that is getting unidirectional

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:15.380
machine that is getting unidirectional
 

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.840
machine that is getting unidirectional
motion okay so again we are inspired by

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:19.850
motion okay so again we are inspired by
 

00:17:19.850 --> 00:17:22.020
motion okay so again we are inspired by
nature I just want to point out that

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:22.030
nature I just want to point out that
 

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.250
nature I just want to point out that
bacteria rhodopsin uses the same

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:24.260

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.890
bacteria rhodopsin uses the same
principle to pump protons across from

principle to pump protons across from
 

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.919
principle to pump protons across from
outside to inside the cell here is a

00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:29.929
outside to inside the cell here is a
 

00:17:29.929 --> 00:17:31.780
outside to inside the cell here is a
chemical constitution of the dumbbell

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:31.790
chemical constitution of the dumbbell
 

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.510
chemical constitution of the dumbbell
that you've been looking at and you've

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520
that you've been looking at and you've
 

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.700
that you've been looking at and you've
seen the cycle of thing before

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:36.710
seen the cycle of thing before
 

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:42.160
seen the cycle of thing before
and again this principle can be used to

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:42.170
and again this principle can be used to
 

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.140
and again this principle can be used to
make what we've called a molecular pump

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.150
make what we've called a molecular pump
 

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:47.620
make what we've called a molecular pump
so this is the prototype that allows us

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:47.630
so this is the prototype that allows us
 

00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:49.480
so this is the prototype that allows us
to take the ring on from the right-hand

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:49.490
to take the ring on from the right-hand
 

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.130
to take the ring on from the right-hand
side and leave it from the left-hand

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:51.140

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:55.870

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:02.500
were driving force in this particular
system and we were able to change that

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:02.510

so it's interesting that pumping one

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:33.090
so it's interesting that pumping one
 

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.610
so it's interesting that pumping one
followed by two rings is possible and in

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:37.620
followed by two rings is possible and in

interesting was that we could carry out

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:46.230
interesting was that we could carry out
 

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.789
interesting was that we could carry out

now is to use the same type of approach

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:16.410
now is to use the same type of approach
 

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:21.640
now is to use the same type of approach
