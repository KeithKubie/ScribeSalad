00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.430
I want to think about
all of the different ways

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:10.230
we can represent value
in the number 21.3.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.750
So one is to just look straight
up at the place values.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.960
This 2 is in the tens place, so
it literally represents 2 tens.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.680
So this is equal
to 20, 2 times 10.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.500
This 1 is literally equal to 1.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.600
It's 1 one.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.010
And then this 3 is
3/10, so plus 3/10.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.320
But now I want to
rearrange or regroup

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.400
the value in these places.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.000
So, for example, I could
take 1 from the ones place

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.070
and give it to the tenths place.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.990
So let's see how
that would work.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.490
So we're going to take 1
away from the ones place,

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.280
and so it's going to become a 0.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.400
And we're going to give
it to the tenths place.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.149
And what we're going
to see is that that's

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.250
going to make the
tenths place into 13/10.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.870
Now, does that actually make
sense that I took 1 from here

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.000
and it essentially added
10 to the tenths place?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.470
Well, let's rewrite
what this represents.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.670
So we still have 2 tens.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.310
So this is still
going to be 2 tens.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.440
Now we have plus 0 ones.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.150
And we essentially wanted to
write that 1 that we took away

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.050
from the ones place
in terms of tenths.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.190
So if we were to write
this in terms of tenths,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.060
it would be 10/10 plus the
3/10 that were already there.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.872
And so this is going
to be equal to 13/10.

00:01:30.872 --> 00:01:31.830
Let me write that down.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.460
So this is equal to 20.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.760
That's the color you can't see.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.480
This is equal to 20 plus 0
ones, so 2 tens plus 0 ones

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.255
plus 13 tens.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.790
Let's do another example
with this exact same number.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:57.520
So once again, 21.3.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.150
And I'll write it out again.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.785
This is equal to 20 plus 1.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.090
We'll do that in
the purple color.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.270
Plus 1 plus 3/10,
plus 3 over 10.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.210
Now, I could take 1
from the tens place

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.390
so that this becomes just 1.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.040
Now what do I do with that 10?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:29.010
Well, let's say with that 10 I
give 9 of it to the ones place.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.010
So I give 9 of it to the ones
place so that this becomes 10.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.730
And I still have 1 left
over, and I give it

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.653
to the tenths place, so
that's going to become 13/10.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.320
So what did I just do?

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.900
Well, I could rewrite this.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.180
Let me be clear what I did.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:55.170
This is the same
thing as 1 plus 9.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.870
Actually, let me
write it this way.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.010
1 plus 9 plus 1.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.280
That's obviously
the same thing-- 10

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.470
plus 9 plus 1 is the
same thing as 20.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.100
And of course, we have what
we have in our ones place,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.340
plus 1 plus 3/10.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.690
And what I want to do is I want
to take this 9, the 9 that I

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.660
took from the tens place
and give to the ones place.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.260
And I'm going to take this 1
that I took from the tens place

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.850
and give it to the tenths place.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.130
So 1 is the same thing as 10/10.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.320
And so when you
regroup this value,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.830
you get this as being equal
to 10 plus-- 9 plus 1 is 10,

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.130
and then 10/10
plus 3/10 is 13/10.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.610
So that's all that
happened here.

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.580
I changed the value
in the places.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.840
I took 1 ten away.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.750
I had 2 tens.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.630
Now I'm only left with 1 ten.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.510
And that extra 10 of
value, I regrouped it.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.540
I gave 9 to the ones place.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.390
So 1 plus 9 is 10.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.470
And then I gave 1
to the tenths place.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.390
So 1 plus 3/10 is the
same thing as 13/10.
