00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.180
The Medicare and
Medicaid Incentive Payments

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.030
are based on achieving the stages
of Meaningful Use, shown here.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.630
The amount providers can earn is tied

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.080
to the number of Medicare
patients in their practice.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.780
For the Medicaid program, 30% of
a practice is necessary to qualify,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.420
except for pediatricians
where the threshold is 20%.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.610
The details for
Medicare are shown here, and

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.280
you can review them
if you're interested.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.420
Basically the earlier provider starts,
the more they can earn.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.710
Not shown here are the reductions
in Medicare Payments for

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.860
providers that haven't achieved
meaningful use by 2015.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.410
But there are no penalties
under the Medicaid program.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.550
Why do you think there are no
penalties under the Medicaid Incentive

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.019
payments program?
