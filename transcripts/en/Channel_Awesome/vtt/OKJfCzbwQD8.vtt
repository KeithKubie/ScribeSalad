00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.160
Rita: Ah, it's the nicest weather the moon has ever had!

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.820
It's time to conquer Earth!

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.960
Zordon: Crisis! Rita has escaped!

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.040
Recruit a whiny Internet celebrity with attitude!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.500
NC: Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it-

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.600
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.300
Theme Song: ♫ Go, Nostalgia Critic! ♫

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.800
NC: STOP IT!

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.900
What's going on here? Why am I in the 60's version of the Batcave?

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.240
Oh, God.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.240
Zordon: Greetings, I am Zordon, the big, weird head.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.220
NC: Uh, I think your Skype connection needs a little work there, buddy. You're coming in all blurry.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.060
Lemme fiddle with these knobs.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.160
Oz: I am Oz!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.500
Emperor Palpatine: There is a great disturbance in the Force.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.060
Vigo: I, Vigo, the Scourge of Carpathia-

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.020
Zordon: STOP IT!

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.580
I have brought you here because Rita, our oldest and most embarrassing enemy, has returned.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.200
She wishes to foil the Power Rangers' 20th anniversary.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.460
NC: What? Why?

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.940
Zordon: Because she's the most pathetic villain we've ever had and resents the show, for she wants to see everything connected to the Power Rangers destroyed.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.700
NC: Well, what you need me for? I'm just a critic comedian.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.940
A critician.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.620
Zordon: That's precisely why we need you.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.440
Rita has taken over every screen in the world and is showing one of the Power Rangers' most despised projects.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.100
NC: You don't mean?!

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.960
Zordon: Yes.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.860
Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.460
NC: You want me to review the sequel to the first Power Rangers film?

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.820
I didn't even like the show growing up. I was too old for it.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.160
I thought it was a silly exercise in combining Saved By The Bell with Godzilla stock footage.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.280
Zordon: Exactly. The more you can tear this movie apart, the more it will lose its power.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.760
NC: I don't know, I feel a little strange ripping into something that's been around for 20 years.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.200
Rita: C'mon, Nostalgia Critic!

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.160
Are you afraid? You should be!

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.200
Even the fans don't like this movie!

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.960
And once they're reminded of how stupid it all was, they'll remember how stupid the show was, too!

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.460
The Rangers will be destroyed, and I will be the greatest villain forever!

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.380
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.520
Alright, you poorly dubbed vixen, I'm not afraid of any film!

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.900
Bring it on!

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.420
This is Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.340
So, yeah, to start off, why is it called that anyway?

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.040
I get the Turbo part, oddly enough. It was the word of the week.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.260
But doesn't some of the epicness get bluffed when you refer to it as just A Power Rangers movie?

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.140
Doesn't that make it sound a little bit more run-of-the-mill?

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.200
Like the writers were asking, "What kind of big, massive story should we tell?"

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.320
and the producers were like, "I don't care, just make A Power Rangers movie!

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.420
Throw in a boring, long-winded Star Wars crawl for all I care!"

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.300
Oh, boy, this is gonna be a slow movie, isn't it?

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.060
Look at that, the narrator is waiting for the text to come up so he can read it.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.560
Nothing like starting off a movie named Turbo with some slow, monotonous, awkwardly paced text.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.540
We see on Planet Moldy Cookie that there's a group of soldiers chasing after-

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.920
Oh, Jesus.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.580
A Warwick Davis Pail Kid.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.440
This terrifying concoction is actually a wizard named Lerigot,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.760
and an evil pirate named Divatox

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.500
(yeah, I know, it sounds like a butt injection)

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.960
is after him because she can use his magic to unleash an evil demon that she wants to use to conquer the universe.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.260
But let's face it, you're not listening to a thing I'm saying right now because you're still so focused on how amazingly bad that puppet is.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.880
Yeah, he only seems to have one expression throughout the entire film.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.660
He's like the Daniel Craig of Muppet Ewoks.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.540
But he uses his magic wand to escape to Earth,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.640
where we see the Power Ranger girls are spending their time emotionally connecting and developing children's minds at a nearby shelter,

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.320
and the boys are just kicking shit.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.720
Unh, yeah! That's what we do! Unh!

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.700
Fuck the community, we can hit shit! Unh!

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.660
Trainer: No, now look, you're trying too hard!

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:28.220
NC: It turns out they're training for a tournament, but Power Ranger Rocky, the others feel, is simply trying too hard.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.520
Adam: Hey, Rocky, maybe we are trying too hard.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.860
Rocky: Or maybe we're not trying hard enough.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.320
NC: What? How do you throw yourself out of a ring? That's a little tougher than it sounds, guys.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.260
I mean, look at that, he clears right over the rope backwards from a jump spin kick. Is that even doable?

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.540
Coach Jim: Alright, Critic, let's see your jump kick.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.580
NC: YAAAAA-HOO-HOO-HOOEY!

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.260
Coach Jim: Alright, take 5, Critic.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.540
NC: So Rocky is put into a hospital as a boy from the shelter sneaks in to say hello.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.240
But when he hears Rocky's friends coming, he hides under the bed because...

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.720
kids do that?

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.060
Thus, he sees that they're being called to their Power Ranger duties.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.980
Rocky: Justin, did you just hear all that?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.780
Justin: You guys are the Power Rangers?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.440
NC: They beam to their headquarters where-

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.600
Oh, Christ.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.900
Zordon: Lerigot has taken great pains to hide his exact location.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.040
What?

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.980
NC: You know, Zordon, in the last movie, they at least gave you an upgrade.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.920
We could make you out better, you looked more three-dimensional, and your lips actually matched what you were saying.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.620
Why have you gone back to being a half-focused Magic Eye picture?

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.300
Zordon: You don't understand. Our entire budget went into Divatox's cleavage and Johnny Yong Bosch's haircut.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.560
It was a sacrifice that needed to be made.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.560
NC: Was it really worth it?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.020
Zordon: Look at the cleavage, Critic.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.520
NC: OK, they are pretty nice.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.240
Zordon: Thank you!

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.800
Kimberly: This is so lame.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.400
You know, we'd come back to surprise everybody and help out with the shelter.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:16.620
NC: Surprise everybody? How are you gonna surprise everybody by scuba diving in the middle of nowhere?

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.760
I mean, granted, nobody would've seen that coming, but I think you would've had to wait a while before you were discovered.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.780
If ever.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.380
Zordon: Rangers, after all these years, I have finally located Kimberly and Jason.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.560
Alpha 5: Aiyiyi! Show them on the screen!

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.420
Oh my God.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:29.320
NC: By the way, have you noticed anything missing from this Power Rangers movie-

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.820
HELLO?! THE FUCKING POWER RANGERS!
