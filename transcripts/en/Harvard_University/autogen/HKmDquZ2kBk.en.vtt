shareholders and it it was the first
 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:21.890
shareholders and it it was the first
stage that we that we have now in terms

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.600
interesting because it's aware of more
of the civic responsibilities of a

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680
it could be a compliance a focus as well
 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.460
it could be a compliance a focus as well
but it takes us to the next stage which

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470
but it takes us to the next stage which
 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.660
but it takes us to the next stage which

again this is interesting because here
 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.590
again this is interesting because here
companies have realized that there are

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:49.600
companies have realized that there are
 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.610

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:22.810
devolves from more of a reactive
 

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.110
devolves from more of a reactive
approach it's more of a proactive

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120
approach it's more of a proactive
 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.700
approach it's more of a proactive
approach and when you pair it with

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:28.710
approach and when you pair it with
 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.960
approach and when you pair it with
organizational ethical quality which is

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:30.970
organizational ethical quality which is
 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.960
organizational ethical quality which is
the vertical scale we have different

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970
the vertical scale we have different
 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.810
the vertical scale we have different
levels of moral corporate social

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:36.820
levels of moral corporate social
 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.670
levels of moral corporate social
responsibility that can be that can be

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:38.680
responsibility that can be that can be
 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.990
responsibility that can be that can be
and discussed so let's talk about some

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000
and discussed so let's talk about some
 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.520
and discussed so let's talk about some
examples I think it's important to

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530
examples I think it's important to
 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.290
examples I think it's important to
realize that a company can situate

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:46.300
realize that a company can situate
 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.990
realize that a company can situate
itself in many different places along

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000
itself in many different places along
 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.620
itself in many different places along
such a scale the first example would be

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:52.630
such a scale the first example would be
 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:56.070
such a scale the first example would be
a company that you could say doesn't

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080
a company that you could say doesn't
 

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.230
a company that you could say doesn't
have ethical criteria in place they

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240
have ethical criteria in place they
 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.070
have ethical criteria in place they
don't abide by ethical criteria and they

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080
don't abide by ethical criteria and they
 

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.350
don't abide by ethical criteria and they
have a more reactive approach when it

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:04.360
have a more reactive approach when it
 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.510
have a more reactive approach when it
comes to corporate social responsibility

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520
comes to corporate social responsibility
 

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.320
comes to corporate social responsibility
these would be examples once again of of

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.330
these would be examples once again of of
 

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.250
these would be examples once again of of
companies that that unfortunately make

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:14.260
companies that that unfortunately make
 

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.830
companies that that unfortunately make
headlines in both national and

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840
headlines in both national and
 

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.820
headlines in both national and
international news and I think another

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:20.830
international news and I think another
 

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.620
international news and I think another
interesting example would be that of an

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:22.630
interesting example would be that of an
 

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.020
interesting example would be that of an
ethically virtuous company but with a

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:25.030
ethically virtuous company but with a
 

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.360
ethically virtuous company but with a
more reactive approach to corporate

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:27.370
more reactive approach to corporate
 

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.760
more reactive approach to corporate
social responsibility it's a curious

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:29.770
social responsibility it's a curious
 

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.210
social responsibility it's a curious
example because I'm I think of a company

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.220
example because I'm I think of a company
 

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:36.330
example because I'm I think of a company
that produces very good shoes while

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:36.340
that produces very good shoes while
 

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.270
that produces very good shoes while
they're providing value to society

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:39.280
they're providing value to society
 

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.960
they're providing value to society
they're also instilling virtue in their

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:42.970
they're also instilling virtue in their
 

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.450
they're also instilling virtue in their
workers and in everyone with whom the

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:45.460
workers and in everyone with whom the
 

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.420
workers and in everyone with whom the
company comes in contact now maybe they

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:48.430
company comes in contact now maybe they
 

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.120
company comes in contact now maybe they
don't participate in financing NGOs

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.130
don't participate in financing NGOs
 

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.720
don't participate in financing NGOs
maybe they don't have as many programs

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:54.730
maybe they don't have as many programs
 

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:56.710
maybe they don't have as many programs
that would be

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720
that would be
 

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.620
that would be
socially more inlined with some of the

00:08:59.620 --> 00:08:59.630
socially more inlined with some of the
 

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.020
socially more inlined with some of the
latest trends in csr however they're

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.030
latest trends in csr however they're
 

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.540
latest trends in csr however they're
enriching the lives of those with whom

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:04.550
enriching the lives of those with whom
 

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:09.280
enriching the lives of those with whom
