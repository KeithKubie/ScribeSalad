00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.400
You sort of feel like someone is gonna
tap you on your shoulder and say

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.560
"Uh. We made a mistake."

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.040
I was afraid to speak out. 
I was afraid that whatever I said

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.320
wouldn't be smart enough

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.680
At times I thought of
leaving that first semester that maybe I

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.480
just--   really the first day I almost
turned around and left.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.660
You're not sure you fit in.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.380
You're not confident you can make it
because you're the first one to do it

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.320
There's people around you with
better vocabularies

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.060
and knowledge backgrounds that I was lacking

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.600
and that's difficult

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.080
I'm the daughter of mom and dad who are
immigrants from Mexico

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.560
My father worked for Frito Lay 
he delivered chips

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.440
Neither had finished high school so they weren't

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.240
exactly sure what this meant

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.080
Each of my parents were farm kids 
and each were very poor

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.400
They grew up in a war-torn country
where colleges and universities are a luxury

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.240
I wanted the opportunity to get outside of my neighborhood

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.080
I knew I wasn't going to go
back without a college degree

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.040
I realize that it matters that I'm here and that 
for certain people my presence and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.280
what I bring to this job makes a huge
difference

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.520
It's important that we help first-gen students feel more comfortable because

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.280
a lot of first-gen students are from underrepresented groups

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.400
and those students should not be underrepresented

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.720
It makes it so much easier to fully
participate and contribute

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.760
when you feel that you belong

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.180
I'm grateful that I didn't have parents
who had PhDs

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.240
and this was all laid out for me 
so that I could figure things out myself.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.120
And I like that better.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.240
So what I would say to a first-gen student:
"Congratulations because you made it and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.240
you should be so proud of yourself
that you're here."

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.960
I've had a wonderful career and a great life and I would like to make sure that other capable

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.480
young people who come from first-gen
families have the support they need

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.120
We do want to show them how far they can go

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.880
I'm very happy to be that person who can

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.200
accompany one of the students on their
way to graduation

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.160
Now I have students who are professors

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.200
That's crazy!

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.560
I want students to be able to look around the room

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.280
and see other people like them 
But more important than that

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.240
I want them to be able to look at the front of the room
and see somebody who looks like them
