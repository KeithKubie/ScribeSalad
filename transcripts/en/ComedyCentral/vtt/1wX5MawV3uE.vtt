00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.970
Mike Webb is running
for congress

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.171
in Virginia's eighth district.

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:05.372
He recently posted a screenshot

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:07.140
of his desktop
to his Facebook page.

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.309
Oh, look,
he's got a lot of tabs open.

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:11.311
Clearly, he's a busy guy.

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:13.780
Quick poll-- anyone
<i>not</i> know where this is going?

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:17.551
Uh, Jack,
activate thermal porn scan.

00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:20.087
-Beep.
-(alarm sounding)

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.922
-Oh, no.
-FEMALE VOICE: Porn detected.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.524
-Oh, no!
-Porn detected. Porn detected.

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:25.058
-(Hardwick whimpering)
-Porn detected.

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.060
-Porn detected.
-(yelling)

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:29.162
(applause and cheering)

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:33.367
We have porn tabs!

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.369
So...

00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:41.041
in addition to a Yahoo search
and his AT&amp;T bill right here,

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.510
Mr. Webb was also
very interested in,

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:47.514
"Layla Rivera Tight Booty"
and "Ivone Sexy Amateur."

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:50.350
So he's into fitness and
entrepreneurs. That's fantastic.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:53.353
-(applause and cheering)
-Now...

00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:58.425
He's a politician.

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.127
Naturally,
he had a great explanation

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.895
for the screen grab faux pas.

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.498
He was just testing for viruses!

00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:06.166
(laughter)

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.734
Is what he was doing.

00:01:07.768 --> 00:01:11.738
He had the porn sites open
so he could scan for viruses!

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:14.641
(laughter, whooping,
clapping)

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:17.711
Maybe he was jerking it
to his AT&amp;T bill. I don't know.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.013
"Oh, overages, yeah.
Roll-over minutes."

00:01:20.047 --> 00:01:21.548
-I don't know.
-(laughter)

00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:23.750
I personally would ra...

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.220
I'm, like, why...? Why in this
day and age do we feel like

00:01:26.253 --> 00:01:27.754
we need to hide this
from people? Like, why...?

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:29.189
You know what? Why doesn't
he just come out and go,

00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:31.191
"Yeah, I was cranking it
to porn, you know?

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:32.693
"I want to do
a little genetic re...

00:01:32.726 --> 00:01:34.528
"I want to do a little
genetic redistricting.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.996
What's the problem?"

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.933
-(applause) -Do you think anyone
would fault him for that?

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:41.401
No one would fault him for that.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.736
I mean,
these are not insane categories.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.606
It's not crazy.
So I don't understand...

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.207
Look, any candidate
who embraces his love

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:48.976
of the pornographic arts
would thrive

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.978
in today's political landscape.

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:53.480
They'd be like, "Wow.
What a breath of fresh air,"

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:53.580
based on what's going on
in the election.
