00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:15.379
The Greatest Practical Joke of the 19th Century

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.020
The year was 1809.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.010
Famed English author, Theodore Hook, made
a bet with one of his close friends, the noted

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.080
architect and writer, Samuel Beazley, that
within one week, he could make any house in

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.710
London the most talked about place in the
city.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.550
The house he ended up choosing was the home
of the widow Mrs. Tottenham on 54 Berners

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.370
Street, London, which was the same street
that Earl Stanhope and the Bishop of Carlisle

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.840
and of Chester, among other wealthy and well-to-do
individuals, lived on at that time.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.180
It isn’t known why Hook chose Mrs. Tottenham’s
home as no connection between the two is known

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.030
and Hook himself never explained his selection.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.380
It’s entirely possible that it just happened
to be a location where the home across the

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.530
street could be rented and was also in a fairly
well-to-do part of town which would help assure

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.910
Hook’s plan would work.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.040
Whatever the case, the event began on November
27th.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.180
Hook and Beazley positioned themselves in
the home across the street and around 5:00

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.550
am, the fun began.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.680
First, a chimney sweep arrived.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.290
The problem was that Mrs. Tottenham hadn’t
requested the services of a sweep.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.290
Within a few minutes, 12 more sweeps arrived;
they too were also turned away.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.730
Next, coal delivery workers began showing
up with several large carts packed with coal

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.570
to be delivered to Mrs. Tottenham; they were
turned away.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.540
Following this, a cart-load of furniture arrived;
then workers showed up bearing a coffin for

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:35.620
Mrs. Tottenham.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.610
Next came several cake makers attempting to
deliver very large custom made weddings cakes;

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.090
then several other chefs arrived attempting
to deliver a total of around 2,500 raspberry

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.090
tarts.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.150
After that, several doctors, lawyers, gardeners,
fishmongers, dentists, grocers, priests, couch

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.470
makers, carpet-manufacturers, wig-makers,
coach-makers, curiosity dealers, opticians,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.880
brewers, and shoemakers, among others, arrived.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.640
They all came offering their services or bringing
very large orders of their wares that were

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.310
to be delivered to Mrs. Tottenham’s address
at various times throughout that day.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.080
At one point, over one dozen pianos were delivered
to her door step.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.900
After that, six men carrying a huge chamber
organ showed up.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.260
Eventually the dignitaries arrived, including:
the Governor of the Bank of England; the Duke

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.959
of York; the Archbishop of Canterbury; the
Mayor of the London; the Lord Chief Justice;

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.069
several cabinet ministers; and the Chairman
of the East India Company.

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.640
Throughout the entire day, various parties
and delivery people crowded the area outside

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.530
of 54 Berners Street.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.709
By mid-day, the streets in that area of London
became so crowded that the roads were jammed

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.579
for several blocks in every direction with
delivery people and on-lookers.

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.689
All the while, Hook and Beazley sat and watched
the chaos from across the street.

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:58.580
Hook’s part in the madness, that did indeed
become the talk of London, was not known until

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.310
much later when he eventually confessed it.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.069
He did it all by sending around 4,000 letters
out to various entities in London, ordering

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.250
various items from the simple to outlandish.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.870
He also wrote several notable individuals
like the Mayor of London and the like, creating

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.260
tales sufficient to get those people to come
and call on Mrs. Tottenham on that day.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.849
What was written in most of the letters to
convince these people to come isn’t known.

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.620
One of the few that is known is the letter
to the Mayor of London.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.940
Once he realized that everyone there was the
victim of an elaborate practical joke, he

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.069
went to the police station.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.849
At the police station, the Mayor stated that
he had received a letter supposedly from Mrs.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.439
Tottenham explaining that she was at death’s
door and she requested that the Mayor call

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:46.180
upon her home to bear witness to a deposition
she would give under oath.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.022
After the hoax was revealed, the Mayor sent
officers out to attempt to instill some order

00:03:49.022 --> 00:03:53.430
in the chaos in the streets, including attempting
to calm the crowds who were reportedly on

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.280
the brink of rioting with the streets jammed
with angry travelers and hundreds of merchants

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.290
who were infuriated that Mrs. Tottenham would
not pay for the often massive orders of their

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.120
wares they had come to deliver; some of these
products were also completely destroyed by

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.579
the crowds in the attempted delivery.

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.629
Along with the damaged goods, several fights
broke out throughout the day within the pressing

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:14.629
masses.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.669
Once the crowds dissipated late in the evening,
Hook and Beazley emerged from the house across

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.720
the street and went home.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.320
For successfully making the home the talk
of London within a week of the bet, Hook reportedly

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:46.330
received a guinea from Beazley.
