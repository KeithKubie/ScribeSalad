00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.750
PROFESSOR: All right. lecture
14 was about two main topics,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.250
I guess.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.550
We had slender adorned chains,
the sort of fatter linkages,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.760
and then hinged dissection.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.220
Most of our time was actually
spent with the slender

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.850
adornments and proving
that that works.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.350
But most of our questions today
are about hinged dissections

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.850
because that's kind
of the most fun,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.950
and there's a lot more
to say about them.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.460
So first question is,
is there any software

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.960
for hinged dissections?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.020
And the short answer
is no, surprisingly.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.730
So this would definitely be
a cool project possibility.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.190
There are a bunch
of examples-- let

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.860
me switch to these on the web--
just sort of random examples,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.300
cool dissections people
thought were so neat

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.650
that they wanted
to animate them.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.990
And so they
basically constructed

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.460
where the coordinates were over
time in Mathematica, and then

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.560
put it on the web as a
illustration of that.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.280
So this is a
equilateral triangle

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.990
to a hexagon-- a
regular hexagon.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.230
It's a hinged dissection
by Greg Frederickson,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.270
and then is drawn
by have Rick Mabry.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.360
Here's another one for
an equilateral triangle

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.180
to a pentagon.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.830
Pretty cool.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.830
And they're hinged in
a tree-like fashion

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.460
even, which is kind of unusual.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.940
Greg Frederickson is one of the
masters of hinged dissections,

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.280
and dissections in general.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.400
He's probably the master
of dissections in general.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.700
And he has three books of
different kinds of dissections.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.470
This is actually hinged the
section on the cover here.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.640
The purple and pink
pieces hinge like this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.290
into a smaller star from
the outline of a big star

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.390
to the interior
of a smaller star.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.020
And then this star
fits nicely inside.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.500
This is another
hinged dissection.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.960
This book is entirely
about hinged dissections,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.220
although not just
the kinds we've seen.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.990
Another kind called
twist hinging,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.870
which I think this
is a twist hinge.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.650
The piece flips
around the other side.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.900
And then there's the third
book about a different kind

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.079
of hinged dissection that's more
of a surface hinged dissection

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:13.870
where you've got two--
you've got the front

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.790
and back of this surface
and you fold them

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.591
with like piano hinges
with hinges in the plane.

00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:23.590
All are very cool books.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.650
You should check
them out if you want

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.941
to know more about dissections.

00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:30.377
They're more about here are
cool examples, some design

00:02:30.377 --> 00:02:31.710
techniques for how to make them.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.380
I'll show you one such design
technique later on today.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.280
but not a ton of theory here, in
particular because there wasn't

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.100
a ton of theory when
these books were written.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.295
So that's some
hinged dissections.

00:02:45.295 --> 00:02:46.890
And as I said,
cool project would

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.010
be to make a general tool for
animating hinged dissections.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.190
There's only a
handful out there.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.136
Greg has digital files of lots
of his hinged dissections.

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:56.760
He'd probably be
willing to share them,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.250
though I haven't
talked to him about it.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.300
If there was a good
engine for animating them

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.590
I think it would be cool.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.990
Even cooler would
be to implement

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.152
the slender adorn
chain business.

00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:07.360
Take one of these hinged
dissections, maybe they just

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.460
hinge but sometimes
there's collisions.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.520
But we already
know if you refine

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.590
these guys to be
slender, which you

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.947
can do-- if they are
triangulated you can do it

00:03:17.947 --> 00:03:20.405
with only losing a factor of
three in the number of pieces.

00:03:20.405 --> 00:03:21.863
It would be cool
to implement that.

00:03:21.863 --> 00:03:24.500
And then you can do the
slender adorned folding

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.105
via CDR, which I have
an implementation of,

00:03:28.105 --> 00:03:33.090
or it's not that hard to build
one if you have a LP solver.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.210
So various project
possibilities.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.080
Another cool project
would be to just design

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.620
more hinged dissections.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.440
There's still
interesting questions.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.820
Either use fewer pieces or
just make elegant designs.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.590
Related to the implementation
idea, a particular family

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.810
of hinged dissections that
could be fun to implement

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.300
are embodied by this alphabet.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.645
I showed this in lecture.

00:03:53.645 --> 00:03:56.020
You can take the letter six
and convert it into a square,

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.394
and convert it into an eight,
and convert it into a four,

00:03:58.394 --> 00:04:03.060
and convert it into a
nine via these 128 pieces.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.120
I didn't talk much about
this theorem though,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.240
so I thought I'd give you
a little sketch of how

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.740
this works.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.660
It's actually very simple to
construct the folded states

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.399
of these hinged
dissections, and it

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:14.190
could be an interesting
thing to implement.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.481
And it's also just kind of fun.

00:04:15.481 --> 00:04:17.569
This is way earlier,
1999, way before

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.110
we knew that everything
was possible.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.630
We could at least do all
polyominoes of a given size.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.630
So let's just think about
polyominoes, about polyhexes,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.920
polyiamonds, where you
have equilateral triangles.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.620
And these are called
polyabolos for silly reasons,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.600
basically, by analogy
to a diablo, which

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.220
is a juggling device.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.140
You can hinge dissect
any of them here.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.380
You take each square and you
cut it into two half-squares,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.285
and then you hinge them
together like this.

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.090
This Is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.815
So this will make any
four-square object,

00:04:49.815 --> 00:04:51.322
any tetris piece.

00:04:51.322 --> 00:04:52.905
And generally, you
take two end pieces

00:04:52.905 --> 00:04:55.920
and you can make any anomina.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.182
And the way you prove
that that is universal,

00:04:58.182 --> 00:04:59.890
that it can fold into
anything-- it's not

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.650
so clear from this picture,
but it's actually really easy

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.030
to prove by induction.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.980
So the first thing to do
in this inductive proof

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.891
is to check that you can
do it for n equals 1.

00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:13.390
OK.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.310
That may sound trivial
but this is actually core.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.410
The key property you need
in a hinged dissection

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.640
of a single square into
your general family

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:28.490
is that there's a hinge visible
on every edge of the object.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.555
So here, this hinge kind
of covers this edge,

00:05:31.555 --> 00:05:32.540
it covers that edge.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.170
So both of these edges
have hinges on them,

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.340
and the other two edges
have a hinge on them.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.050
They happen to be shared
hinges but that's OK.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.752
And each of these, that's true.

00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:44.460
The triangle, it's a
little more awkward.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.450
You actually need two hinges
to cover the three sides.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.937
But you only need
these two pieces.

00:05:50.937 --> 00:05:52.020
One of them is non-convex.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.320
It may be hard to
fold continuously

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.590
but you'd refine
it if you wanted

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.190
to do slender adornments.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.350
So let's not worry about
continuous motion yet.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.110
So that's the base
case of the induction.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.650
How do I do it for n equals 1?

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.000
Now inductively, if
I have some shape

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.510
I want to build I'll
take what I call

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.500
the dual graph of that shape.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.390
So make a vertex
for every square,

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.560
connect them together
if they share

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.920
an edge-- the squares
share an edge--

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.480
and then look at a spanning
tree of that shape.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.580
So just cut some of
these edges until you

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.010
have tree connectivity
among those squares.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.290
Every tree has at least two
leaves, except in the fall,

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.030
but every mathematical tree
has at least two leaves.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.720
Like this is a leaf, if I cut
here this would also be a leaf.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.935
Leaf is a degree one vertex.

00:06:43.935 --> 00:06:45.810
So that's a square that
only shares one side.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.400
So pluck off that leaf,
remove that square.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.500
The resulting n minus 1
square is, by assumption,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.540
can be made by this hinged
dissection with two times

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.020
n minus 1 pieces.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.770
So now we just have
to attach this guy on.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.190
And here's a figure for
that down at the bottom.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.650
This is the same
thing for triangles,

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:08.270
and polyabolos are
in the upper right.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.170
So you have some existing
hinged dissection,

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.180
you don't really
know what it's like,

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.800
and you want to add
this leaf back on so it

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.260
shares one edge with one guy.

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.455
Now this guy could
be oriented this way,

00:07:18.455 --> 00:07:19.830
or it could be
oriented this way,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.740
but it's the same by reflection.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.670
So let's say it's
oriented this way.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.180
We know the square is made up by
two half-squares, by induction,

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.240
and so we know that
there's a hinge here.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.040
Now this hinge connects to
some things, in this case,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.390
to some t prime.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.310
It could be here,
it could be up here.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.010
And all we do is
stick s on here.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.610
Now s can rotate.

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.670
We have our solution
for one guy,

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.177
and there's two different
orientations for him.

00:07:50.177 --> 00:07:51.760
We're going to choose
this orientation

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.330
because it puts this
hinge right there.

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:59.070
And so once we do that,
normally this would be a cycle,

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.300
and this thing would be
a cycle through here,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.560
but we just redo
the hinges in here

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.800
so that the cycle gets bigger.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.430
And the important
thing to verify

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:10.630
is that the orientations
to the triangles

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.140
are the same, just like the
hinged dissection picture

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.000
I showed.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.930
We always go from the base
edge to the next base edge,

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.990
to the next base edge of these
right isosceles triangles,

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.130
and all the triangles are
on the outside of the cycle.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.380
So we actually construct a
cyclic hinged dissection.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:29.540
Then at the end you could
break it and make it a path.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.280
And this one is even slender.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:34.799
Remember, right triangles
are slender, barely.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.750
You can look at all
the inward normals.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.860
They hit the base edge.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.094
So this will even
move continuously

00:08:42.094 --> 00:08:43.010
if it's an open chain.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:45.150
For closed chains we don't know.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.320
So that's polyominoes.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.826
Polyaimonds are similar.

00:08:51.826 --> 00:08:52.950
Pretty much the same thing.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.590
You just-- in this
case, you might

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.820
have hinges on both sides, but
you rotate this thing so one

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.954
of the hinges lines up, and
you just reconnect the hinges.

00:09:00.954 --> 00:09:02.620
And it's not hard to
show you can always

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.630
do that, the hinges
will never cross.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:07.630
And this proves that
these folded states exist,

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.709
and then we use the slender
stuff to do continuous motions.

00:09:10.709 --> 00:09:12.250
Actually, when this
paper was written

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.800
we didn't have slender
adornments back in '99,

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.010
even in 2005 when the
journal version appeared.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.795
So it's only now that we know
that motions are possible by,

00:09:21.795 --> 00:09:26.440
in this case directly, in this
case with some refinement.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.840
So I thought that would
just be fun to see.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.370
You can do some
other crazy things.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:37.100
So this is a hinged dissection
from any four-iamond.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.420
So this is four equilateral
triangles joined together

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.080
to any four amino.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.130
This is a tetris piece.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.600
It's essentially a
superposition of this idea

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.760
with-- you see in here,
these four lines make

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.550
the hinged dissection
of Dudeney,

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.870
from 1902, from an equilateral
triangle to a square.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.350
And with some extra
stuff added in-- this

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.860
is maybe a foreshadowing
of the idea of refinement,

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.139
although we didn't really
realize it at the time.

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:09.680
We want to add some
hinges so that we

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.680
have hinges on the midpoints
of the edges instead

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.370
of the corners.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.310
That turns out to be a bit
more efficient in this case.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.240
So we add some hinging,
still hingeable individually,

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.050
but now we have
hinges at the corners

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.770
and so-- at the
midpoints, and we'll

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.260
have the same
property over here.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:29.810
And it allows you to
hinge these together.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.140
Actually, here it looks like
some of them are at the corners

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:33.960
not the midpoints.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.460
So it's a bit messy.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:39.510
In general, we can prove
if you have any shape

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.846
and you want to make
poly that shape-- so

00:10:41.846 --> 00:10:43.220
let's call this
shape x, you want

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:49.025
to make polyexes-- you can do it
as long as the copies of the x

00:10:49.025 --> 00:10:54.310
are only rotated and they're
joined at corresponding edges.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.350
So if you check, this guy's
just been rotated 180 degrees.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.290
In general you can join
these things together

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:01.980
at matching edges.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.237
And the basic technique
is just subdivide

00:11:04.237 --> 00:11:06.820
the thing, triangulate, draw in
the dual of the triangulation,

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.610
and then connect to the
midpoints of the edges.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:11.960
And you can show,
basically, instead

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.530
of the hinged
dissection going around

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.090
like this you can just
make it go around like this

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:17.460
and come back this way.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.850
And if you check the sequence
of pieces they could visit,

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.250
it's identical if you
go around this way

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.360
or if you go around this way.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:30.484
And that's enough to show
that any folded state is valid

00:11:30.484 --> 00:11:31.900
With the triangles
and the squares

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.316
we're essentially exploiting
the symmetry of these pieces.

00:11:34.316 --> 00:11:36.507
So you can rotate them
to make them compatible.

00:11:36.507 --> 00:11:38.840
Here they're forced to be
compatible by assuming we only

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.360
join matching edges.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.082
So that was the
2D polyform paper.

00:11:46.082 --> 00:11:49.680
You can see Frederickson
was one of the authors.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.159
In 3D, here's easy way
to generalize that.

00:11:54.159 --> 00:11:55.825
If you take, for
example, a tetrahedron,

00:11:55.825 --> 00:12:01.120
a regular tetrahedron, you take
the centroid and cut everything

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.999
to the centroid.

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:03.665
And you end up cutting
your tetrahedron,

00:12:03.665 --> 00:12:10.050
it has four sides, into four of
these more slender tetrahedra.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.770
And then you take four of
them and join them together

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:13.556
in this way.

00:12:13.556 --> 00:12:15.055
You do have to be
careful in the way

00:12:15.055 --> 00:12:16.471
that you join them
because, again,

00:12:16.471 --> 00:12:20.510
on every face we want to
have an incident hinge.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.700
So we've got to
take care in the way

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.720
that you hinge together to make
sure that that is the case.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.110
But it's also cyclically hinged.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.490
This gets joined to that.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.100
And basically, the same
inductive proof works.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:35.370
You just pluck off a leaf, show
that you can turn the thing so

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.980
that one of the hinges
aligns with the inductive

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.460
construction, and then
just join the hinges

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.830
across instead of
within the cycles.

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:44.920
So pretty easy.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:49.360
What are we talking about?

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.120
Hinged dissections
software, I guess.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.960
Those would be fun
things to implement.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.070
They've never been
implemented, and especially,

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:55.904
to see them folding.

00:12:55.904 --> 00:12:57.361
I thought I'd show
you a little bit

00:12:57.361 --> 00:12:59.100
about hinged
dissection hardware,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.780
different ways you could
make them physically real.

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.610
This is kind of
mesoscale I'd call it.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.230
This is at one centimeter
bar, so not super tiny,

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.410
but I think this could
scale down quite a bit.

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:13.495
We have a Petri dish here
with some liquid in it,

00:13:13.495 --> 00:13:15.460
if you could read up there.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.510
Maybe this is the
coolest example.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:20.780
We have a square made
up of four pieces,

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.780
and you add a little bit
of salt to that liquid

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.840
and it pops into the equilateral
triangle configuration.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:31.470
So it's sort of spontaneously
folding, hinging.

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.890
Essentially these pieces
are slanted a little bit

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.260
and they prefer-- one weighting
causes them to fold one way

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.900
but when you add the salt they
end up flopping the other way.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.460
You could see they're a little
bit inexact because of that,

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.490
but pretty awesome the
kinds of hinged dissections.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:48.470
You can get them all to
actuate even without much room

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.520
to do so.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:57.387
This is done at Harvard, George
Whiteside's group, chemistry.

00:13:57.387 --> 00:13:59.595
Kind of related, it's not
exactly hinged dissections,

00:13:59.595 --> 00:14:01.700
but I feel like it's
the same spirit,

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.910
is this idea of DNA
origami, it's called,

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.740
where you take one
big strand of DNA

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.600
and you force it to fold
into a particular shape.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.340
Here we're folding
it into a happy face.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.310
The way that's done
is you add in a bunch

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.140
of little pieces of DNA.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:20.200
So this string, basically,
has a-- this DNA strand

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.780
has a random string
written on it basically,

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.850
and you identify, oh, I want
these guys to glue together.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.890
So you take this piece
of the random string,

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:28.690
and this piece of
the random string,

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.023
and you construct a piece of
DNA that has both of those,

00:14:31.023 --> 00:14:33.600
like a little zipper to
cause those to zip up.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.940
You do that all over the place.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.550
And there's now automatic
tools to do this,

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.091
it's really easy to
make DNA origami.

00:14:38.091 --> 00:14:39.962
It, basically, always works.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:41.670
There's a limit to
how big this thing can

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:46.060
be because the main strand
here is a single piece of DNA,

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.350
and those are hard to make
super big, at least currently.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.440
But you get some really
nice happy faces and mass

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.620
produce them.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.332
Hundred-nanometer scale.

00:14:54.332 --> 00:14:55.790
It's kind of like
hinged dissection

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.780
because that strand
of DNA is moving,

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:00.440
it's actually more
like a fixed angle

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.060
chain, kind of like
a hinged dissection.

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.760
And we're essentially
using here universality

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.210
of hinged dissections
of something

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.400
like polyominoes,
though the shapes

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.800
are a little bit more awkward.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.410
And they've made a
maps of the world.

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:16.480
You could do two-color patterns,
make snowflakes, the word DNA,

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.750
and crazy stuff.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:22.190
So it was started by Paul
Rothman, though a lot of people

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:23.820
do DNA origami these days.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.350
Cool.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:34.510
Next paper I wanted to show
you-- this is fairly recent--

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:38.890
and it's about getting
continuous motions,

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.000
in particular, in 3D, of
hinged dissection-like things.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.510
So here we have
a chain of balls.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.387
These are more like
ball and socket joints.

00:15:46.387 --> 00:15:47.970
So you can maybe see
them better here.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:51.830
There's a member going
in from the green guy

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.100
into the center of the red
guy, and there's a slot,

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:58.030
and the red guy can fold
around the-- or the blue guy

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:00.420
can fold around the red guy.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.366
And the question is,
OK, this is great.

00:16:03.366 --> 00:16:05.490
You can prove universality,
you can make any shape.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.250
You just subdivide your
dog, or whatever, into two

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.149
by two by two
squarelets and then

00:16:10.149 --> 00:16:11.690
we know how to
connect those together

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.940
to make a nice Hamiltonian
cycle that visits everything.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:18.150
But can you actually fold
a chain of balls like this

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.530
into that dog?

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.830
And the answer is always yes.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:28.310
Essentially, you feed a
big string of these balls

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.990
into-- that's actually what's
happening in this animation

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.520
here, although it's a little
hard to tell-- you're feeding

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.060
in, say, at one of the legs,
one of the extreme points

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:40.170
in some direction,
this chain of balls.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:43.619
And as they go in they just
start tracking along the path.

00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:46.160
And you just need to check that
you can track along the path.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.410
As this guy goes into
a corner, for example,

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.241
you can actually navigate the
corner while, at all times,

00:16:51.241 --> 00:16:52.240
staying within the tube.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.890
If you can stay
within the tube you

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:55.931
know you won't collide
with the rest of the chain

00:16:55.931 --> 00:16:58.740
because this tube is
non self-intersecting.

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:00.980
And so the 2D version
is fairly easy.

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:03.607
This is just circles.

00:17:03.607 --> 00:17:05.940
A little trickier to check
that it actually is possible,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:09.422
with just one turn, with a
U-turn, and with a kind of-- I

00:17:09.422 --> 00:17:11.470
don't know what you call
this, not a U-turn--

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.089
where you change
in two directions--

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:14.609
two dimensions all at once.

00:17:14.609 --> 00:17:17.514
All of these are possible with
this particular mechanism,

00:17:17.514 --> 00:17:18.680
whatever mechanism you have.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.369
If it can do this then
you can make anything.

00:17:21.369 --> 00:17:23.880
So that's another
way to prove motions

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.950
exist for this kind of
polyform special case.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.069
Why do we care about this?

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:29.950
For building robots.

00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.160
So these are somewhat
different mechanisms,

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.020
but I have two
examples built here

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.950
at the MIT Center
for Bits and Atoms

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.780
over in the Media Lab
with Neil Gershenfeld

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.750
and many, many people.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.540
So you get some idea--
this is a fairly small guy.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.907
I mean, the actual
size is about this big.

00:17:51.907 --> 00:17:53.365
You see some feet
in the background

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:56.380
to give you some sense of scale.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:59.696
It's not very many pieces, but
if you made a really long chain

00:17:59.696 --> 00:18:01.570
it would really be able
to fold into anything

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.640
you want, just servos
to make the turns here.

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.590
This is a much larger one.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.200
The right version is folding.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.280
And you get some
idea of scale here,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.460
this is, when it's
fully extended,

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:21.560
144-- should that
be feet or inches?

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.250
It's really big.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:26.770
So a little bit
slower, of course,

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:28.240
because it has to
move a lot more,

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.700
and it's also
quite a bit longer.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:35.970
This is built, in particular,
by Skylar Tibbits here.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.340
So that's the idea of robots.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.757
In general, we
like to make robots

00:18:39.757 --> 00:18:40.923
that can change their shape.

00:18:40.923 --> 00:18:42.730
We've seen sheet folding
robots, but these

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:47.170
are more chain folding robots
inspired by proteins, and DNA,

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:50.652
and things like that, sort of
big versions of DNA origami.

00:18:50.652 --> 00:18:52.110
What's cool about
them is that they

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.040
stay connected
throughout the motion.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:57.750
You can keep your wiring, and
you can keep your batteries,

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:00.930
and whatnot, and your
communication channels

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.200
connected in this
kind of scenario.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:06.370
This is, by contrast, to
more common approaches

00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:08.210
to reconfigurable robots.

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.422
You have individual
units and they can attach

00:19:10.422 --> 00:19:11.630
and detached from each other.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.937
You could see like these
guys picking up blocks,

00:19:13.937 --> 00:19:14.770
moving stuff around.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.649
It's definitely cool,
but in practice it's

00:19:17.649 --> 00:19:19.440
a lot harder to build
these kinds of robots

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.752
because the attach
detach mechanism,

00:19:21.752 --> 00:19:23.460
it's hard to get them
to align perfectly,

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.640
it's hard to get the
electrical connectivity.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.400
Every piece has to
have a battery instead

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.740
of like every 10th
piece, or one battery

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.450
to drive everything, or
tethering, or whatever.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:36.634
You can do some very cool things
and there's a lot of algorithms

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:37.550
around for doing this.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.540
Daniella Rus, here at
MIT, built this robot,

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.600
and a bunch of others.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.660
There's also a very
cool theory about these.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:44.760
I've worked on them.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:49.670
You can prove, for example,
that all of these models

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.020
can simulate each other up
to constant factors in scale.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.190
So you can take your
favorite robot in a molecube

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:59.469
and simulate a crystalline
robot, or vice versa.

00:19:59.469 --> 00:20:01.010
And then there's
efficient algorithms

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.970
to-- these crystalline
robots, they

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.500
can just expand and contract
and detection and attach.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.720
And you can prove that
given two configurations

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.180
you can change it from one
to the other up to some scale

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:14.770
factor.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.790
You can even do it
extremely fast in log n time

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.079
if all the robots are
actuating all at once.

00:20:20.079 --> 00:20:22.370
Anyway, there's cool stuff
about reconfigurable robots,

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.420
but the hinged dissections
offers an alternative

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:28.540
where everything stays
connected at all times,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:30.890
but closely related.

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:34.730
I think that was
the hardware story.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:38.720
So we go back to our proof
of hinged dissections

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.060
and why it works.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.530
And one of the-- I was kind of
surprised I didn't show this

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:50.640
in lecture, but I don't
remember why I didn't.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.200
One missing piece
with-- how do you

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.180
go from a rectangle of one
size to a rectangle of another?

00:20:55.180 --> 00:21:02.030
You may recall,
we had a triangle,

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:04.660
we triangulated our
polygons so we ended up

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.380
with some arbitrary triangles.

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:10.432
Then we cut parallel
to the base halfway up.

00:21:10.432 --> 00:21:12.390
You can put this over
here, put this over here,

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.750
you get a rectangle of
some unknown height.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:19.200
And then to make it universal
we wanted to convert everything

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.200
into a rectangle
of height epsilon

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.280
so that then we could just
string them together--

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.219
obviously, the area has
to be preserved here.

00:21:26.219 --> 00:21:28.510
If we string together all
the epsilon height rectangles

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:33.500
we've got one super long
epsilon height rectangle.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.410
And then we overlay
the two dissections.

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.870
This is how we did dissections.

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:43.220
But how do you do this step
from one rectangle to another?

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.560
This is a very old
dissection, at least 1778.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.980
It wasn't published
by Montucla but he's

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.640
credited in this
publication, and this

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.450
is Frederickson's diagram of it.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.330
So you take the fatter
rectangle and then

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:02.750
you take the longer rectangle
and you-- first, you

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:06.840
make multiple copies of the fat
rectangle, just sort of tile

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.420
strip of the plane to the right.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:13.625
And then you angle the
thin rectangle, slightly.

00:22:13.625 --> 00:22:15.250
First of all, you
line up these corners

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:17.300
so the top left corners
line up, and then we

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.040
want the top right corner
of the thin rectangle

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.550
to lie on this bottom line.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.300
Turns out this always works.

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.430
It's not totally obvious but,
essentially, these copies

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.474
of the rectangle you can
kind of fold them up.

00:22:31.474 --> 00:22:33.140
And when you go off
the right edge here,

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.990
you're essentially coming
back on the left edge here.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:39.480
And then you're going this
way, and you're going this way,

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.460
and this little piece is exactly
the same as this little piece.

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.320
And from that you
get a dissection.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:54.050
It's not hinged, but you can
see that this big rectangle has

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.420
the tiny piece here, which
conveniently fits right

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:56.920
over there.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.820
It's like a wrap around
in the other direction.

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:04.749
And then this piece-- well,
everything matches up here.

00:23:04.749 --> 00:23:06.540
The only other weird
thing is this bottom--

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:11.390
when you go below the bottom
you also wrap around to the top.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.360
And just check all
the pieces match up,

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.956
and you've got your dissection.

00:23:15.956 --> 00:23:16.850
It's kind of crazy.

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:21.570
You have to check this works
for all parameters, but it does.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:24.070
And in general, of course, if
you have a very long rectangle

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.760
you need many pieces,
relative to the fat one,

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.640
but that's essentially optimal.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.540
OK.

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.200
For fun-- this is
a general technique

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.300
called the piece lie
technique, or superposing

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:41.450
two tessellation of your shape.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.400
You can use that same
technique, for example,

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.930
to get the hinged dissection
from a regular square

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.060
to the equilateral triangle.

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.840
You just angle it right
so that, for example,

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.400
this midpoint hits
this midpoint,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.140
and various other
alignments happen,

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.380
like this midpoint
falls on that edge.

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.420
And if you look at it
right these cuts give you

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:07.190
the four pieces for the square
to-- I guess you can see it

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.200
right here, here are the
four pieces of the square.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.130
And if you check,
everything matches up.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.807
You can also make
equilateral triangle.

00:24:13.807 --> 00:24:15.390
In this case, it
happens to be hinged.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.210
That doesn't always happen.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.270
It's a little tricky
to tell, maybe,

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:22.420
but with practice
you can see it.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.690
I mentioned, at some point, that
you could take this and turn it

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:31.580
into a table that either has
four sides or has three sides.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.480
One of the annoying
things about the table

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:36.015
is that you need legs
on each of the pieces.

00:24:36.015 --> 00:24:38.140
So Frederickson was playing
around with this fairly

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.920
recently, in 2008,
and he came up

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:43.660
with this alternative way of--
essentially the same technique,

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.240
but you end up
with one big piece

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.460
and lots of smaller pieces.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.490
So the idea is you just have
a big leg, or a bunch of legs,

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.740
under one piece of the table.

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.390
And so this is what the
dissection looks like.

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.440
Unfortunately,
it's not hingeable.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.300
But if you add in
a couple pieces

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.060
you can make it hingeable.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.631
So at this point, the
universality result

00:25:06.631 --> 00:25:07.380
was probably none.

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.570
This is actually a lot
easier than the way we do it,

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.560
specialized to this
kind of scenario.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.930
This hinges, I think, something
like this-- maybe even

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:16.730
an animation of it?

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:17.920
Yeah.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.627
Drawn by Frederickson.

00:25:20.627 --> 00:25:22.710
So you could see a careful
orchestration here just

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:26.870
to make sure that, indeed,
you can avoid collision.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.030
And so that's the
proposed table.

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:29.940
No one has built it.

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.590
Another project would be to
build some hinged dissections,

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.685
for example this one,
as real furniture.

00:25:34.685 --> 00:25:36.670
It would be pretty neat.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:41.490
I have a couple examples
here of real furniture built.

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.139
This is the Dudeney dissection,
a four-piece kind of a cabinet.

00:25:45.139 --> 00:25:46.180
It's got lots of shelves.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.580
It looks really practical.

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.060
And I don't know the bottom.

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:52.220
It looks like there's a
bunch of wheels down there.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.720
Definitely, you
have to have a bunch

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.639
of table legs in this case.

00:25:55.639 --> 00:25:57.180
But you can really
reconfiguration it

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.360
in all sorts of ways.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:00.160
The close up.

00:26:02.962 --> 00:26:03.920
That looks pretty cool.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.030
It's made by D Haus Company.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:11.190
Any German speakers?

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.900
Anyone know what "haus" means?

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.420
Same in English, house.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.160
So they actually built a house.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.240
And I can't tell whether this
is a real building or a very

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.655
good computer rendering.

00:26:22.655 --> 00:26:23.720
It may be real.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:25.540
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:26.420
AUDIENCE: It looks
like a rendering.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.380
PROFESSOR: It looks
like a rendering.

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:27.710
Yeah.

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:29.710
At some point later they
have people walking by,

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.190
but it could be a composition.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:34.380
Anyway, it's an idea of
having a house for any season.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:38.300
You can reconfigure it
dynamically with these tracks.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.680
It's a pretty cool idea.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.090
It would be neat
to experiment with.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:50.090
Anyway, hinged
dissections in practice.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:51.557
It's funny to take
a 2D dissection,

00:26:51.557 --> 00:26:53.140
but, I think, in
architectural setting

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:54.670
you can't change
where the floor is.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:57.430
So probably, 2D
dissection makes sense.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.940
There's the real,
maybe real version?

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.230
I don't know.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:06.210
So that was
rectangular rectangle.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.500
OK.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:09.742
I'm cheating a little bit.

00:27:09.742 --> 00:27:10.450
Another question.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:12.140
This is a very
specific question,

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.300
but for step three,
which is where

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.610
we did all the action of
rehinging stuff, I said,

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:20.030
number of pieces
roughly doubles.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:23.544
I meant to say at
least roughly doubles.

00:27:23.544 --> 00:27:24.960
So in the worst
case, the point is

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.610
that can be at
least exponential.

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.220
It definitely can be more
because, in general-- remember,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:32.425
it looks something
like this-- The point

00:27:32.425 --> 00:27:34.940
is, you need at least
two triangles per edge

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.100
here because they
need to fit together

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:41.200
to make these little kites.

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.364
So you at least double, for
every edge that you visit.

00:27:44.364 --> 00:27:46.030
In the worst case,
you visit the whole--

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:48.290
all the edges of the polygon.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:52.210
So you end up
doubling everything.

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.002
But it can be worse
because sometimes,

00:27:54.002 --> 00:27:55.960
if you don't have a lot
of room in this corner,

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.256
you've got to divide into
lots of very tiny triangles.

00:27:58.256 --> 00:28:00.630
I think that probably only
happens towards the beginning.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.650
After you've cut
them small, you won't

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:04.990
have to cut them
even, even smaller.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:07.280
But I don't know for sure.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.800
The point is, it's
at least exponential.

00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:13.060
And this is the more
complicated diagram.

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:17.640
But I claim that you could
get a pseudopolynomial bound.

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:18.470
How do you do that?

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.290
This is a little
[? trickable, ?]

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:24.510
and still have time though.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:29.330
So let me go over the rough
idea, also what the claim is.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.710
So pseudopolynomial bound.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.170
I'm not going to claim this
for arbitrary polygons,

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.700
although I think
it's probably true.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:47.155
What we argue in the paper
is that if the vertices

00:28:47.155 --> 00:28:51.360
of the polygon lie on
our grid, then we're OK.

00:28:55.581 --> 00:28:57.705
It's just a little hard to
keep track of otherwise.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:09.200
I will scale things to
make this the integer grid.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:15.910
And then the claim is
the number of pieces

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:21.335
is polynomial in the number
of vertices, n and r--

00:29:21.335 --> 00:29:22.944
r is usually some
ratio of the longest

00:29:22.944 --> 00:29:24.360
distance to the
smallest distance.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:28.680
In this case r is the grid
size, like an r by r grid.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.470
That's like the size of
the overall grid divided

00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:33.060
by the size of a grid cell.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.350
So, basically, the same thing.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:40.570
So, how do we prove this?

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:49.000
The general idea-- so we have
these messy constructions,

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.460
and essentially,
we're inducting.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.905
We're moving one hinge, and
then moving the next hinge,

00:29:52.905 --> 00:29:54.000
and moving the next hinge.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.740
And essentially, all
of those inductions

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.230
are nested inside each other.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:00.300
You completely refine
to do one thing then

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.020
you have to refine to do
the next one in the existing

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:03.520
refinement.

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.050
So we have a very
deep recursion.

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.820
It's one way to think of it.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:13.010
Order n depth recursion, so we
end up with exponential in n.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:20.220
But instead, what we can do is
only recurse to constant depth.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:25.967
And if you're just more careful
in the overall construction

00:30:25.967 --> 00:30:26.675
this is possible.

00:30:30.161 --> 00:30:30.660
How?

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:34.895
Let me give you
some of the steps.

00:30:38.324 --> 00:30:42.444
You need more gadgets and you
need to follow-- So before,

00:30:42.444 --> 00:30:44.360
I said, oh, there's some
dissection out there,

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.840
it's known.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:49.310
You triangulate, you convert
triangle to square, triangle

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:53.112
to rectangle, rectangle to
rectangle, then superpose.

00:30:53.112 --> 00:30:55.320
It does the dissection, then
we hinge it arbitrarily,

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.861
then we fix the
hinges one at a time.

00:30:56.861 --> 00:30:59.340
Here, I want to actually
follow those steps

00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:02.613
and keep it hinged dissection
as much as possible.

00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:07.800
So we're going to triangulate
the polygons, but in this case,

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:11.170
we're going to subdivide
further and also triangulated

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:14.050
with all the grid
points as vertices.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:24.700
It's little hard to
draw, but here's a grid.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.960
Let's draw a polygon.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:32.530
Hard to make a very exciting
polygon, so few vertices,

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:36.721
but maybe something like that.

00:31:36.721 --> 00:31:37.220
OK.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:42.439
If I triangulate this thing
and all the interior points--

00:31:42.439 --> 00:31:44.730
there aren't very many interior
points in this example.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.438
Maybe I'll make a
slightly different one.

00:31:50.984 --> 00:31:52.150
There's two interior points.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:53.525
I want to triangulate,
with those

00:31:53.525 --> 00:31:54.750
as vertices of the triangle.

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:57.370
So maybe I'll do
something like this.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:06.070
A couple different
shapes of triangles here,

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:08.410
but they all have the same area.

00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:11.290
This is called Pick's theorem,
special case of Pick's theorem.

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.840
So here, they're
all a half-square.

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.570
Even though this one
spans a weird shape,

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:18.450
it's one-half square of area.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:20.530
So the nice thing is if
I do this in polygon a

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.320
and in polygon be
the triangles--

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:25.577
there's equal number of
triangles of the same size

00:32:25.577 --> 00:32:27.410
because they have
matching areas originally.

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.559
There's probably a way to do
this for general polygons.

00:32:39.559 --> 00:32:41.600
I think this is the only
step that requires grids

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.610
except it's also a lot easier to
analyze, this bound with grids.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.792
So it's, I guess, an
open problem to work out

00:32:49.792 --> 00:32:50.375
without grids.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:53.230
OK.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.563
The next thing is we'd really
like a chain of triangles.

00:32:55.563 --> 00:32:59.010
Right now we just have
a blob of triangles.

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:06.060
And we can chainify
the triangles.

00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:08.790
This is a step
that was-- I don't

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:12.100
know if I showed the
figure last time.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.430
This is what we do to
slenderfy everything.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:17.157
We have some general
hinged dissection.

00:33:17.157 --> 00:33:18.490
I don't know what it looks like.

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:19.948
We just take each
of the triangles,

00:33:19.948 --> 00:33:22.650
subdivide at their
in center, cut,

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.420
and then you hinge
around the outside.

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.340
And you'll get
one-- in this case,

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.150
one cycle of slender triangles.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:34.012
In this case, all we care
about is that it's a chain.

00:33:34.012 --> 00:33:35.470
So we have some
general thing here.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:38.500
We subdivide each
of them like this,

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:39.770
and then you hinge around.

00:33:39.770 --> 00:33:42.892
And so now I've got a hinged
collection of triangles for a,

00:33:42.892 --> 00:33:44.850
and I've got his collection
of triangles for b.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:46.520
I'm just going to
do a to b here.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:48.620
I should probably say that.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:49.495
Two shapes.

00:33:53.056 --> 00:33:54.430
And conveniently,
these triangles

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:56.540
will still have matching areas.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:00.490
They're all now 1/6,
if we do it right.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:11.040
So we get a chain of
area 1/6 triangles.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.420
And I have the same
number for a and for b.

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.300
So this kind of cool.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.570
Of course, the triangles
could be different shapes,

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:21.639
but I basically have a
chain of various triangles.

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:25.920
They're all the same area-- a
little hard to draw-- for a.

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.360
I have a similar chain for b.

00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:32.310
And I just need to
convert, basically,

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.699
triangle per
triangle from a to b.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.230
So now my problem
is a lot easier.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.104
I have these hinges
which I need to preserve.

00:34:38.104 --> 00:34:39.889
That's a little trickier.

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:43.340
This is actually an idea
suggested by Epstein

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:44.889
before the universality result.

00:34:44.889 --> 00:34:46.880
It's like, all we need
to do is do triangle

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.940
to triangle while
preserving two hinges.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.030
Then we could do
anything to anything.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:53.139
So we're following that plan.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:56.387
And now we're going to use
all the fancy gadgets we have

00:34:56.387 --> 00:34:58.720
to do triangle to triangle
while preserving these hinges

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.152
and not blowing up the
number of pieces too much.

00:35:03.152 --> 00:35:04.110
But definitely simpler.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:06.420
We're down to
triangle to triangle.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.170
Next step.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:10.430
OK.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.110
Next problem Yeah.

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.590
This is slightly annoying.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.150
I said, oh great, these
triangles are matching up.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.810
But I'm not going to be able
to do triangle to triangle

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.307
and get exactly the hinges
I want where I want them,

00:35:24.307 --> 00:35:26.140
so I'm going to have
to end up, for example,

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.690
moving this hinge
to another corner.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:32.540
So we're going to use
a new gadget, actually,

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:44.390
for fixing which vertices
connect to which triangles.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.770
This is, maybe, not obvious yet
that we need this, but we will.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.970
And we're going to use a
slightly, a somewhat more

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:54.830
efficient version of,
essentially, the same idea.

00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:57.400
So we've got a hinge
here, in the middle.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.909
And basically, can't control
where the hinge goes, but it's

00:35:59.909 --> 00:36:01.450
supposed to go to
one of the corners.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:04.180
So we're going to
reconfigure in this way.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.960
So we assume we have
some way of doing it.

00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:11.400
And here's the thing, we assume
that maybe this has already

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.630
happened to a.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.710
We don't want to recurse
into a because then we

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:18.550
get exponential blow up.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.220
I'm going to have to do this
for every single triangle here.

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:21.720
There's n of them.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.330
That's a lot.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:23.850
I don't want to
get deep recursion,

00:36:23.850 --> 00:36:26.775
I don't want to get
depth n recursion.

00:36:26.775 --> 00:36:31.975
But if I cut up in this way, in
fact, I only need to cut up b.

00:36:31.975 --> 00:36:34.860
And if b hasn't been
touched yet this is OK.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:36.340
And then I'll do
it the next way,

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.120
and the next triangle,
next triangle,

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.480
and they won't interact.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.760
That's the good news.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.790
So how do we do it?

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:48.830
Well, we cut up a little, oh,
what do we call it, kite fan,

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:50.130
I believe, here.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.040
Here there's two kites,
and we get these triangles

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:55.360
to match these two, these
triangles to match these two.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.610
We cut up this little
piece along the side.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.220
And either the green
stays in here-- green

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:04.140
is attached to the
pink or magenta.

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.470
So if we keep the green in
here, the triangle stays there.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.220
If we pull everything out--
and there's a little hole

00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:12.340
made here to make
that more plausible.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:17.230
But in reality, we have to
subdivide to get slender.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:20.780
So if we instead reconfigure
the green to lie along the edge,

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.047
and the blue can turn
around here and fit inside

00:37:25.047 --> 00:37:26.630
because it has exactly
the same shape,

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:30.150
these two chains are identical,
it can also fit in here.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.920
And then we've moved the
magenta over to that side.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.950
So that's cool.

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:37.560
That works, and it
doesn't touch a.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.150
So it's a slight variation
of what we had before.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.810
And it's good.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:46.966
So, that's psudeopolynomial,
and they don't interact.

00:37:46.966 --> 00:37:48.590
And so we can move
these things however

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:52.726
we need to according to what
step four produces for us.

00:37:52.726 --> 00:37:54.557
So this maybe
slightly out of order.

00:37:54.557 --> 00:37:56.890
I could have called that step
four, and this step three.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.145
Get to the more exciting part.

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:03.740
Finally, we do
triangle to triangle.

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:12.030
This a little crazy.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:16.010
I'm going to give you
three constructions that

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:17.432
give us what we want.

00:38:17.432 --> 00:38:19.390
And then I'm going to
claim I can overlay them.

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:21.680
This is what we can't do
with hinged dissections,

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.970
but I'm going to do it anyway.

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:24.370
So bear with me.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:28.110
The final gadget will
say how to overlay them.

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.160
But let's start with the
relatively simple goal

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.740
of triangle to rectangle.

00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.590
This I already showed you.

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:37.870
And the nice thing about
triangle to rectangle,

00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:40.910
this three-piece dissection, is
you can hinge it here and here

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:42.160
and it works just fine.

00:38:46.337 --> 00:38:47.920
So that's already a
hinged dissection.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.850
That's the easy step.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.920
Then we want to
take that rectangle

00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:01.340
and convert it into a tiny--
or not tiny, same area,

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.264
but an epsilon-height rectangle.

00:39:04.264 --> 00:39:05.930
Because remember, we
have two triangles,

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.130
they're different shapes so
they have different heights.

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:09.921
This one will end up
being half the height,

00:39:09.921 --> 00:39:12.130
but it won't match what
we'd get for this triangle.

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.670
So I'm going to do steps a and
b for each of the triangles.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:19.990
And then I have two
epsilon-height rectangles.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.870
And then the challenge is to
convert one into the other.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:26.830
This is a challenge because
they have hinges on them.

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:30.600
So with dissections you just
overlay these two cut ups.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.410
But hinged dissections, there's
hinges you have to preserve,

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:35.220
we can't do that.

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:35.720
OK.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:46.630
First part is step b,
which I showed you already,

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.380
going from one
rectangle to another.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:49.820
Here's another diagram of it.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:52.940
It turns out it's almost hinged.

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.910
You can, essentially,
just flop back and forth

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:58.120
and back and forth,
except at the end

00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:00.460
you might be in trouble.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.410
So there's one step here,
and depending on parity

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:07.210
exactly this piece of the
rectangle is hinged here.

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:09.170
But I really want
to be hinged here,

00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:11.020
so I'm just going to
move it over here.

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:12.882
I have tools for
moving hinges around.

00:40:12.882 --> 00:40:15.090
So it turns out, you have
to check that this is safe.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:20.000
But you just do one hinge
moving, and then you're OK.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.250
So in this case-- this should
actually go a little bit

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:25.310
deeper-- the bottom
figure shows when

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.340
you go too deep you can
cut, cut-- and this is just

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:31.250
like the previous diagram
of triangle to rectangle.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.500
You do that at the
bottom you'll be fine.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.750
There's a couple different
cases in exactly the parity

00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.030
and how you end up.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.174
Three cases I guess.

00:40:39.174 --> 00:40:40.840
But in all cases the
rest can be hinged.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:48.054
You just need this one step
in the middle to fix it.

00:40:48.054 --> 00:40:49.970
So most of it is just
swinging back and forth.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:51.780
So it's almost hinged,
which is good news

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.320
because we have tools to make
almost hinged things actually

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.360
hinged.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.350
So that's cool.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:03.460
So basically, we've covered
a and b at this point.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:07.540
But the last part
is c, or how do

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.030
we superpose all these things?

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:14.980
And this is using another
gadget called pseudocuts.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:19.600
And essentially, you have some
nice hinged dissection already,

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:22.280
and you want to add
a cut and a hinge.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.370
So just imagine cutting
all the way through here

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:29.280
and adding a hinge, I guess,
on the yellow side here.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:31.360
And somehow, I want
this thing to fold

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.250
in all the ways it used
to be able to fold.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:34.880
So it could fold into a.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.170
But then I also want it to be
able to fold at this hinge,

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.930
and eventually fold into b.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:44.370
And it's complicated,
but again, the same idea.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:49.090
So we've got these yellow guys,
which normally live in here,

00:41:49.090 --> 00:41:52.560
and so yellows is yellow.

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:53.860
These are triangles.

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.470
These are triangles
minus triangles,

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.330
so they're like little quads.

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:59.680
They have holes just the
right size for the yellow.

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:02.330
These guys have holes
just the right side--

00:42:02.330 --> 00:42:05.720
I'm sorry, how does it go?

00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:06.220
OK.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:06.720
I see.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.496
It's purple, then blue,
then yellow, I believe.

00:42:11.496 --> 00:42:13.860
So the yellow fits
into the blue-- anyway.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:16.870
Whatever works.

00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:18.370
These guys nest together.

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.970
And when they nest together
they fill these little holes.

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:24.830
And then there's matching
patterns out here.

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:27.670
So they all fit.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:28.360
How does it go?

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.380
Actually, sorry, I think
they're all triangles.

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.830
This just looks multicolored.

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:34.590
So it looks like
purple here is going

00:42:34.590 --> 00:42:37.530
into the cyan one
at the next level.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:40.381
The yellow guys are
going into the purple.

00:42:40.381 --> 00:42:40.880
I see.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.130
So there's a triangle
and a quad here.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.610
Lovely.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:47.785
And then these guys
stretch across.

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:54.110
Definitely a little
more complicated.

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:56.890
And you lose a factor
of two, or whatever,

00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:03.687
but if you apply these
pseudocuts in the right order--

00:43:03.687 --> 00:43:06.020
and these are fairly simple
cuttings that we have to do.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:10.550
We know that these cuts
are mostly a striping.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:14.405
So if you just apply them in
order you don't get blow up.

00:43:14.405 --> 00:43:16.603
I'll just wave my hands at that.

00:43:16.603 --> 00:43:19.750
It's a little hard to draw
the picture, obviously,

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.605
but that's how it goes.

00:43:21.605 --> 00:43:24.522
And that's pseudopolynomial
hinged dissection.

00:43:24.522 --> 00:43:26.605
This is why-- it was
intentional I didn't cover it

00:43:26.605 --> 00:43:30.110
in lecture because it's
pretty complicated.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.302
There wasn't time.

00:43:32.302 --> 00:43:32.885
Any questions?

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:40.190
Last topic is higher dimensions.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:45.140
Can we get a brief
overview of 3D dissections?

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.307
So this is more a dissection
question than a hinging

00:43:47.307 --> 00:43:49.139
question, although, of
course you could ask,

00:43:49.139 --> 00:43:51.110
does all this work for
hinged dissections?

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:54.480
Pseudopolynomial, we
don't necessarily know.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.930
For straight up proving that
hinged dissections exist,

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:02.640
the claim is-- it hasn't been
written up formally yet--

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.880
the same techniques work.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.280
You can take any
dissection and convert it

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.130
into a hinged dissection.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.880
But in 3D, it turns out,
dissections, by themselves,

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:15.710
are not so simple, as
a lot of open problems.

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.590
Some nice things are known.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:23.580
So let me tell you
about 3D dissection.

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.300
If I want to convert
one polyhedron

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:30.300
p into another polyhedron
q, obviously, the volumes

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:41.290
must be the same assuming we're
doing a reasonable cutting

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:44.350
and not some crazy
axiom of choice thing.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:47.737
So volumes have to match, just
like for polygons the areas

00:44:47.737 --> 00:44:48.320
have to match.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.590
But that turns out
to be not enough.

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:54.170
And this goes back
to a Hilbert problem.

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:56.510
So you may have heard
of David Hilbert.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:45:01.510
He wrote this paper of like
23 open problems at the turn

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:04.630
the previous century, 1900.

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:05.735
This is problem three.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:11.520
It wasn't directly about
hinged dissections,

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.010
or about dissections rather.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.600
A little bit convoluted--
it's about some certain axioms

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.230
and proving certain things.

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:19.850
But in particular,
he was asking,

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:23.490
are there two tetrahedra
of equal base and altitude,

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:25.510
so equal volume,
which can in no way

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:27.640
be split up into
congruent tetrahedra?

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.380
So there's no way to
dissect one into the other.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.340
If that's true it would
show the certain axioms

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.710
are necessary and
certain proofs.

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:35.900
And it turns out it is true.

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:39.060
There are tetrahedral of equal
volume where you cannot do

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:40.600
this.

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.400
And that-- I don't
have a slide for it--

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:47.650
but this was proved
by a guy named Dehn.

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:50.460
And he came up with something
called the-- well, that we now

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.540
call the Dehn invariant.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.270
He didn't call it that himself.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:56.810
And these things
must also match.

00:45:56.810 --> 00:45:58.810
It's called invariant
meaning that no matter how

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:01.530
you cut the things up and
reassemble the Dehn invariant

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:02.770
doesn't change.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.140
And so if you have any
hope of going from p to q,

00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:07.130
those two things must match.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:14.480
And then, Sidler--
so this was 1901,

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.160
Dehn proved that this was
a necessary condition.

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:20.200
So like a year
after that appeared.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.760
In 1965, a little
bit later, Sidler

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.400
proved that this is
all that's necessary.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.060
So these are
sufficient conditions.

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.770
If p and q have the same volume
and the same Dehn invariant,

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:32.874
then there is
actually a dissection.

00:46:32.874 --> 00:46:34.540
And he proved it
somewhat algebraically,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.730
somewhat constructively,
I'm not sure exactly.

00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:41.360
There's a simpler proof
by [? Jephson ?] in 1968.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.100
And he proved that, actually,
in 4D the same is true.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:45.750
In 4D you need the
volumes to match

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.940
and the Dehn invariants to
match, and that's enough.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:52.680
In 5D and higher no one knows
what it takes for a dissection.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.800
Pretty weird.

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:57.480
It could be interesting to
study these more carefully.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.760
Let me tell you briefly
about Dehn invariants.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:04.430
A little awkward unless you're
familiar with tensor product

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:05.200
space.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.910
How many people know about
tensor product space?

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:08.410
A few.

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:08.710
OK.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.210
If you've done quantum stuff,
I guess, it's more common.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:16.040
I'm not familiar with tensor
product space, but here we go.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:19.800
Tensor product space.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:29.040
But I can read Wikipedia
with the best of them.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:31.190
It's a fairly simple
notion, it just

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.490
has somewhat weird notation.

00:47:32.490 --> 00:47:34.880
You can do things
like take something x

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.630
and write tensor product with y.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.660
And what this means
is, basically,

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.960
don't mess with this product.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.810
OK.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:42.900
It's a product.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.370
Really, this is two
things, x and y.

00:47:45.370 --> 00:47:46.870
They're not
interchangeable, they're

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.490
in completely different worlds,
different units, whatever.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:51.190
You can't like multiply them.

00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:52.800
They just hang out side by side.

00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:54.320
You also can't flip them around.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.020
It's not commutative.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:57.430
OK.

00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:58.690
Fine.

00:47:58.690 --> 00:47:59.930
But some things hold.

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:05.250
Like if you take, I don't know,
z and add it to this product,

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.310
you do have
distributivity, so you

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:13.370
can get x-- is this-- no, this
doesn't look very correct.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:17.060
If I have this then you
can multiply that out.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:24.330
So you get x tensored
with y plus x tensored z.

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.860
So that holds.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.360
It also holds on the left.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.850
And the other thing is
that constants come out.

00:48:31.850 --> 00:48:37.190
So if we have c times
x tensored with y,

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:44.350
this is the same thing as
c times x tensored with y.

00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:46.860
So in the end I'm
going to have a bunch

00:48:46.860 --> 00:48:48.640
of these pairs,
these tensor pairs.

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.540
And I'm also able to
add them together.

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:52.130
And nothing happens when
you add them together,

00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:52.930
they just hang out.

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:55.221
So in general-- you could
also have a constant factor--

00:48:55.221 --> 00:48:59.225
so you have a linear
combination of pairs, basically.

00:48:59.225 --> 00:49:00.740
Why am I doing this?

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.440
Because here's the
Dehn invariant.

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.450
Dehn invariant says,
look, with polyhedra

00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:09.100
you've got two things-- it's
going to be the x and the y

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:11.140
over there-- you've
got edge links

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.410
and you've got dihedral angles.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:15.660
So look at every edge.

00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:20.390
Here's an edge of
my polyhedron here.

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:25.020
It has some length,
which I'll call l of e.

00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:29.250
And there's some angle here,
which I'll call theta of e.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:30.800
Add those up over every edge.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.300
So the Dehn invariant
is going to be

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:40.148
the sum over all edges of the
length tensored with the angle.

00:49:40.148 --> 00:49:44.530
AUDIENCE: Isn't an angle a
function of two [? of these? ?]

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:47.500
PROFESSOR: Angle is the angle
between these two planes.

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.540
So that's a dihedral angle.

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:50.660
Yep.

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.857
So for every edge there's
one dihedral angle.

00:49:53.857 --> 00:49:55.690
Just sort of the interiors
of all that angle

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:58.860
there at the edge.

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.980
So this is kind of
what's going on.

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:02.480
And these things have to match.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:04.690
Now it's a little
more complicated.

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:09.410
Sorry, it's not
really just the angle.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:12.300
Essentially, if you add
rational multiples of pi nothing

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:13.100
happens.

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:20.180
So you actually take this weird
group, all rationals times

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:22.210
pi-- All this means
is if you have

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:25.320
two angles and their difference,
that you subtract them

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.410
and you get a rational
multiple of pi,

00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:29.715
then those two angles
are considered the same.

00:50:29.715 --> 00:50:31.340
So what this is really
saying is I only

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:34.020
care about the irrational
part of pi, roughly.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:36.920
You add pi over 2, that
doesn't change anything.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:38.260
Why this thing?

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.330
Well if I take an edge,
and for example, I

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.680
cut it in half
anywhere, I could cut it

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.220
at an irrational
fraction, or whatever,

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:46.920
I will get two
lengths but they'll

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.280
be tensored with the same angle.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:49.630
I didn't change the angle.

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:53.460
And so by
distributivity-- once you

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.330
get things inside
the same place.

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:58.770
So in this case, we'll get
two lengths that add up.

00:50:58.770 --> 00:50:59.890
They match.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:00.390
OK.

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:02.500
So as long as you
have matching angles

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.330
you can add the
lengths together.

00:51:04.330 --> 00:51:05.940
That's what
distributivity tells you.

00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.240
Similarly, if I tried to cut
this angle in some piece,

00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:12.910
it could be an irrational
ratio between the two pieces,

00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:15.129
they will have the
same edge length.

00:51:15.129 --> 00:51:16.670
And when I have
matching edge lengths

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:19.630
I can use distributivity and
add the angles back together.

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:24.270
So basically, when you dissect,
this thing will not change.

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:27.104
It's a little more
awkward when I cut here

00:51:27.104 --> 00:51:28.520
because this was
originally a pie,

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.978
and then I cut it
into some pieces.

00:51:29.978 --> 00:51:32.300
And this is where you need
the rational multiples of pi

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.710
not mattering.

00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:36.460
But eventually you can prove
Dehn invariant is invariant.

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:39.170
The harder proof, you can
prove that it's also sufficient

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:41.250
if you have the
matching volumes.

00:51:41.250 --> 00:51:44.750
As recently proved
like a few years ago,

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:49.280
2008, that whether the Dehn
invariant of one polyhedron

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.150
and another match is decidable.

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:54.710
So there is an algorithm to
tell whether two polyhedron have

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:57.090
the same this thing.

00:51:57.090 --> 00:51:58.711
Decidable is a pretty
weak statement.

00:51:58.711 --> 00:52:00.085
Natural open
problem is, is there

00:52:00.085 --> 00:52:01.520
a good algorithm to do it?

00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:02.470
We don't know.

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:04.310
If it does match, is
there a good algorithm

00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:06.110
to find the dissection?

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:07.180
We don't know.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.970
These may be easy if you really
understand the proofs deeply.

00:52:09.970 --> 00:52:12.410
But at the time no one
cared about algorithms.

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:15.830
At this point, we need to go
back and really understand

00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:18.350
how to actually do 3D
dissections so that we could

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:20.040
then do a 3D hinged dissections.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.190
That's it.

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:29.350
Don't forget, orgami
convention is on Saturday.

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:31.200
Should be fun.
