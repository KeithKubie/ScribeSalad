00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.970
&gt;&gt; Okay Michael, what have we learned.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.270
&gt;&gt; Well, we learned the definition for feature selection,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.280
which was getting a subset of the features to feed

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.090
to some, I think we also talked about supervised training

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.990
algorithms, or learning algorithms after the selection has taken place.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.740
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:26.456
&gt;&gt; We made a distinction between [NOISE] rapping and filtering.

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:30.670
&gt;&gt; Was that supposed to be filtering?

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.409
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I didn't know how the filtering sounds.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:33.725
&gt;&gt; It sounded more like slurping.

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:36.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm not sure that my raping actually sounded like rapping either.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.050
&gt;&gt; It didn't, but I wasn't going to say anything. So what else

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.330
did we learn? Besides, you like sound effects. So we learned about feature

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.870
selection, we defined that. We discussed

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.580
the difference between filtering methods for feature

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.750
selection and wrapping methods for feature

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.150
selection. What did we learn about them?

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.860
&gt;&gt; That wrapping is slow, but actually

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.030
seems like it solves the problem that matters.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So let's call that slow but useful.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.532
&gt;&gt; Is that useful in the sense that you defined it?

00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:04.700
&gt;&gt; Yes. Mm Hm.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.900
&gt;&gt; Boy these can be useful words. Filtering

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.710
is simpler, possibly faster, but maybe misses the point.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.670
&gt;&gt; Probably faster, yeah, but ignores bias. Okay, so what else? Is that it?

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.030
&gt;&gt; Well so

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.040
we, and we specifically learned about the distinction

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.020
between features being useful versus them being relevant.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.990
&gt;&gt; That's right. so, relevant things are things that give

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.350
you information about the classification problem, or the regression problem

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.260
that you care about. But useful, features are things that

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.840
help you to actually do the learning, given some specific algorithm.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.890
&gt;&gt; Right. And you reminded what a Bayes optimal classifier

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.040
was. [LAUGH]. Which I guess I should have known already.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.365
But somehow, I did not understand how it fit into this context.

00:01:53.365 --> 00:01:55.310
&gt;&gt; The, the main power Bayes optimal classifiers is

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.450
that it is sort of the gold standard, it

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.190
is the ultimate that you could do if you

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.010
had everything and all the time in the world.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.690
&gt;&gt; Could I say that relevance is

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.600
usefulness with regard to the Bayes optimal classifier?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.610
&gt;&gt; Yes, actually you could, I like that. It is a special case [UNKNOWN].

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.690
&gt;&gt; Oh wait,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.540
there's something else that you talk, that you talked about.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.670
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Which was, strong and weak relevance.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.478
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:16.478 --> 00:02:19.150
&gt;&gt; And in a sense that relevant features

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.690
have a kind of kryptonite, in the sense

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.450
that you can make them not strong just

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.200
by putting a copy of them into this space.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.250
&gt;&gt; Right. I like that, the kryptonite is copy. Well done.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.820
That's because you're no longer indispensable. If I have a copy you.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.600
&gt;&gt; That's right, you and now your

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.320
evil twin now resides in your parallel universe.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.940
&gt;&gt; So what

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.165
do you think that means for us? Are

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:43.829
we, strongly relevant, weakly relevant or useless? [Laughs]

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.430
&gt;&gt; And those are your choices. [Laughs]. I am,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.520
I'm going to say I am weakly relevant because I

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.050
think I correlate with truth, assuming the subset of

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.980
other people in the world is the empty set.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.480
&gt;&gt; Hm. . Fair enough, fair enough. So then

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.780
by that definition, do I get to be weakly relevant?

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.409
&gt;&gt; You are atleast weakly relevant.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.040
&gt;&gt; Very good.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.620
Very good. But are we useful.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.110
&gt;&gt; We're going to say yes. As far as our students know.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.510
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well I guess that's the way we will

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.960
find out ultimately is how well they do on the course.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.580
&gt;&gt; It's true. It's in some sense completely in their hands.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.430
&gt;&gt; Right. So in fact, this course is a

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.040
wrapper method over features and this is the first iteration.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.300
&gt;&gt; Interesting.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.990
&gt;&gt; Wow, that was deep. I feel like we should end on that.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.430
&gt;&gt; I

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.920
do too.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, well then I will see you

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.890
next time when we will talk about feature transformation.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.630
&gt;&gt; Transformation.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.480
&gt;&gt; Well done. Bye.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.010
&gt;&gt; Bye.
