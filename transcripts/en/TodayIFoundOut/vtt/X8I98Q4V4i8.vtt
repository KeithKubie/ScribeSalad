00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.860
Just like when we told you, Sherlock Holmes
never said, “Elementary, my dear Watson“,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.150
today we’re going to blow your mind by telling
that nowhere, in the entirety of the original

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.170
Star Trek, were the words, “Beam me up,
Scotty” ever uttered.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.750
They did come close several times, such as
in the 1969 episode of the original series,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.310
The Savage Curtain, Kirk says, “Scotty,
beam us up, fast!“.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.400
Likewise, in the 1968 episode, The Gamesters
of Triskelion, Kirk simply says, “Beam us

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400
up“.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.960
Kirk came closer still in the 1967 episode,
This Side of Paradise, in which he says “beam

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.960
me up“.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.281
And finally, the closest Kirk ever came to
saying that phrase was in Star Trek IV: The

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:47.300
Journey Home, in which he says, “Scotty,
beam me up“.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.410
The only place you’ll find the line in somewhat
official cannon is in The Ashes of Eden (1996),

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.089
a novel co-written by William Shatner as part
of the so-called, “Shatnerverse” of the

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.140
Star Trek- none of which are we making up.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.540
Even then, the novels Shatner wrote are disputed
in terms of how “canon” they are; so there’s

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.540
that.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.870
In popular culture, of course, the line is
universally and intrinsically linked with

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.870
the show.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.890
How did this start, you ask?

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.189
Nobody really knows.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.820
There is a theory that these types of movie/TV
misquotations, of which there are many, are

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.799
often remembered that way simply because they
sound smoother than the actual quote.

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.729
For example, “Beam me up, Scotty” flows
better than “Beam us up, Mr Scott“.

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.770
Factor this in with many years of proliferation
and eventually a misquotation can become so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.110
popular, William Shatner will put it into
one of his novels.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.110
Interestingly, this quote almost never was.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.789
This may surprise you considering the quality
of Shatner’s hairline, but the original

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.729
Star Trek series didn’t have a very big
budget- which if we’re being honest goes

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.000
a long way towards explaining why everyone
wore the exact same outfit all the time…

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.030
The budget was so low, in fact, that there
was no room in it for showing a giant spaceship

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.780
landing (originally they planned on having
the whole Enterprise land on alien planets).

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.880
After presumably double checking Shatner’s
food budget, the crew realised they’d have

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.730
to come up with a way of getting the cast
onto an alien planet without breaking the

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.160
bank, which is where the Transporter came
in.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.970
Along with looking “science as hell” and
reducing the cost of each episode a good amount,

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.520
the transporter also streamlined the show
considerably, adding time which could better

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.250
be used for fleshing out the story.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.180
It also introduced a plot element that would
remain a series, and indeed a genre, mainstay

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.180
for decades.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.260
In other words, if Star Trek had a better
budget when it first aired, we’d have no

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.120
idea how awesome being able to transport our
matter thousands of miles in an instant would

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.319
be and the Enterprise taking off and landing
would have become as annoying as Team Rocket’s

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.830
opening speech every single episode.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.849
As for how the effect itself was realised,
that too is a fairly ingenious act of cost-cutting.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.439
The crew recorded flecks of aluminum perchlorate
powder hitting a piece of black cardboard

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.630
with a bright light shining on the flecks,
giving the distinctive twinkling effect seen

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.630
on the show.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.250
In post production, this effect was super-imposed
over the crew and using a simple fade out,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.310
the effect of the crew disappearing was achieved.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.560
The process was reversed for rematerialization.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.410
As noted in the book, Teleportation: The Impossible
Leap, as the series and technology went on,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.150
this home-brew effect was phased out… in
lieu of a computer generated one.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.530
However, as a nod to the past, the twinkling
effect was kept in with most transporter technologies

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.540
depicted in the various Star Trek shows.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.560
Funny enough, Scotty, or more accurately,
James Doohan titled his autobiography, “Beam

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:53.590
me up, Scotty” after this common misquotation.
