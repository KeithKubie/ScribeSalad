00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:06.630
For the non-homogeneous system of equations,
which means that for your Right Hand Side,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:15.040
at least one of b1, b2, … bn is non-zero,
let’s see how to solve this:

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.920
The general matrix representation is AX equals
B

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:29.539
Pre-multiply it by A inverse: so A inverse
times A times X equals A inverse times B

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.280
(You have to do the operation on both sides
of the equation, to keep the relation the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.530
same)
And provided A inverse exists, then you will

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.540
recognize this part: A inverse times A as
the Identity matrix of Order n [times X] equals

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.940
A inverse times B.
Any matrix multiplied by Identity is just

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:03.760
itself, so that gives us the solution:
X equals A inverse times B, provided A inverse

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.200
exists,
i.e.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:16.860
[X equals] adjoint(A) over det(A) times B
So this is the method to find the solution

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.999
to a set of linear equations in n unknowns.

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:28.060
Now there are some special cases:
This thing [X = adj(A) over det(A) times B]

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:37.140
works fine if the det(A) is non-zero
What happens if the determinant of A is zero?

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:47.729
Special case: if det(A) is zero, look at the
numerator of this expression [X = adj(A) over

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.229
det(A) times B]:
If [adj(A) times B], i.e. if this product

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:10.380
is not zero, the system of equations [AX = B]
is Inconsistent, and it has NO SOLUTIONS.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:22.300
But if the numerator [adj(A) times B] is also
zero (in addition to the denominator being

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:35.129
zero), then the system is Consistent, and
it has an INFINITE NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:50.720
Ok… so this is one way, using Matrix Operations,
to solve a system of simultaneous linear equations.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:03:10.730
A second way, is using Determinants, or what
is known as “Cramer’s Rule”:

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.450
For the same system of equations [AX = B],
the solution for each unknown variable is

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:31.780
given as:
xi equals 1 over det(A) times this determinant:

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.110
so
a11, a21, … an1

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.069
a21, a22, … an2
and then observe this carefully:

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:56.049
find the ith column of the determinant: so
a1i: replace it by b1

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:06.889
a2i: replace it by b2
 so this is a substitution operation:

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:11.370
you don’t keep the original term a1i, a2i,
…

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:18.250
And so on… keep replacing this [column]
by the elements of the Right Hand Side … bn

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:31.419
And then the rest of the determinant stays
the same: all the way up to a1n, a2n, ann

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:42.400
So this whole operation: we can write it in
short-hand as: [xi equals] det(Ai) over det(A),

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.220
where the det(Ai) basically means that you
are substituting the ith column of the determinant

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.880
det(A) by the Right Hand Side, i.e. the elements
of matrix B.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:02.180
This is known as Cramer’s Rule.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.090
In reality: these two (methods to solve a
system of linear equations) are identical.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.099
If you care to write this [X = adj(A) over
det(A) times B] whole thing down symbolically,

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.770
you can show that this works out to be [xi
equals] det(Ai) over det(A) exactly.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:25.979
i.e. each element of X [xi] will work out
to be adj(A) over det(A) times matrix B, which

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:33.659
will work out to be this [det(Ai) over det(A)]
Now again, what happens if the denominator

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.889
is zero?

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:44.419
Special case: if det(A) equals zero, well
again – look at the numerator:

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:55.460
If any of the numerators det(Ai) is also zero:
Inconsistent set of equations (i.e. there

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.120
is NO SOLUTION).

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.750
I’m sorry – if any of the determinants
in the numerator is non-zero: it is Inconsistent

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.720
(NO SOLUTION).

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:19.580
If all det(Ai) determinants are zero for all
i: the system is Consistent, and it has an

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:27.199
INFINITE NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:34.159
So we’ve looked at 2 methods of how to solve
a system of simultaneous linear equations

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:39.930
in n unknowns, for the “Non-homogeneous
case”, which means at least one of the elements

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.600
of your Right Hand Side (the B matrix) is
non-zero.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:07:01.530
Now the only thing to look at that is remaining,
is the “Homogeneous” system: which means

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:12.680
that every single one of the Right Hand Side
(b1, b2, … bn) is zero.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.159
Again, we can look at it using this method
[i.e.

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:26.460
Cramer’s Rule]:
If the determinant det(A) is non-zero: there

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:36.530
is only a TRIVIAL SOLUTION, which means every
single variable x1, x2, … all the way to

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:39.370
xn is zero.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:49.380
But if the determinant det(A) is zero: then
there is an INFINITE NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:08:02.439
So these are the 2 general methods to find
out the values of the unknown variables x1,

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:04.689
x2, … all the way through xn.

00:08:04.689 --> 00:08:11.490
Let’s take a Solved Example to better understand
how to work these methods.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:30.140
Example: Let’s say
Solve this system of equations:

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:48.700
x + 7y – 3z = 11
25y + z = –3

00:08:48.700 --> 00:09:01.060
And 3x – 6y + 2z = 0
Now as soon as you have a set of equations

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:07.090
given to you, there are a few things to check:
So first of all, how many unknowns?

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:14.340
x, y and z: 3 unknowns, and you have 3 equations
(in 3 unknowns): so the number of equations

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.420
is equal to the number of unknowns.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:24.350
Now the Right Hand part of this set of equations:
11, –3, 0: so clearly it is NOT a Homogeneous

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:30.350
system, because you have these non-zero elements
{11, –3} on the Right Hand Side.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:34.610
The next thing to check: would be this determinant

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:41.170
det(A):  this part: AX equals
B: let us first write it in that form:

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:52.060
So A would be 1, 7, –3
 it’s 0 times x so 0, 25, 1

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:57.640
And 3, –6, 2
This is your A matrix

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:03.560
Times the variable matrix: in this case x
y z

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:13.100
Equals B, which is 11, – 3, 0
So after writing it in this form AX equals

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.640
B, the next thing to check is whether 
determinant, det(A) is zero or not.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.100
Check this calculation: so [determinant of]
1, 7, –3

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:29.340
0, 25, 1
3, –6, 2

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:36.440
Works out to be:
1 times 56

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.400
I’m expanding by this [first] column
NOTE that: if any column or row of a determinant

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:47.680
has one or more zero elements, it is always
easier to expand by that row or column

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:51.710
So that’s why I’m choosing to expand by
this [first] column (instead of by any other

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:58.820
row or column)
1 times (50 plus 6), so 56, minus 0 times

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:06.820
(something) (the cofactor of this element,
which we don’t care about), plus 3 times

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:16.190
(7 minus –75), so 82
So the value of the determinant, det(A) works

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:29.240
out to be 302, which is not zero.
Which means: we can find out these unknown

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:35.700
values [x, y and z]
Because we’re taking this as a Worked Out

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:39.360
example, I want to demonstrate this by both
methods.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:46.750
Let’s first try to find out the values of
x, y and z by the Matrix Method.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:56.070
Using the Matrix Method: well, x, y and z:
you need to find out as A inverse times B

00:11:56.070 --> 00:12:00.610
using this definition [X equals A inverse
times B]

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:12.890
And to do that: you first need to find out
A inverse, so that is adj(A) times B over

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:20.860
det(A)
For calculating the adjoint: you need to find

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:29.890
out the Co-Factors of each element of A.
Let’s take an example. To recall: C11 is

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:40.290
(–1) to the power of (i + j), so (1 + 1),
and then ,

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:48.230
i.e. mentally block off the ith row and jth
column and calculate the determinant of the

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:54.340
Minor of aij: so 50 minus –6, which equals
(–1)2(56) equals 56

00:12:54.340 --> 00:13:00.510
And so on… I’ll leave it as an exercise
for the reader to calculate each Cofactor

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:09.000
And what you can show, is:
Adj(A) is basically the transpose of the Co-factors

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:16.830
of all the elements of A, which works out
to be this:

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:28.830
56, 4, 82
3, –7, –1

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:42.030
– 75, 27, 25
So A inverse is simply the adjoint adj(A)

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:54.400
divided by the determinant det(A), so 1 over
302 times &lt;this whole big matrix: I’m not

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.590
gonna write it again&gt;
And then, once you have A inverse: you get

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:09.440
your unknown variables x, y, z is [equal to]
A inverse times B

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:26.571
Well… I’ll write it here:
1 over 302 times

00:14:26.571 --> 00:14:32.490
56, 4, 82
3, –7, –1

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:37.450
– 75, 27, 25
times

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:41.460
your Right Hand Side matrix, which is 11,
–3, 0

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:48.250
And you can do this calculation; it works
out to be:

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:55.940
Let’s still keep this {302} outside: 1 over
302 times (first do the multiplication here

00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:02.180
and you can show that this works out to be)

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.660
–906

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.170
Which finally gives you
x is 2

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:16.390
y is 0
and z is –3

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:20.850
So this is one way to find out the values
of x, y and z
