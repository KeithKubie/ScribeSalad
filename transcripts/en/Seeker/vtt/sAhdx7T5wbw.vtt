00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.500
Ever thought about what you’re going to
do with your body after you’re done with

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:03.500
it?

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.250
Have you considered covering it in cow manure?

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.960
Hey meatbags, Julian here for DNews at YouTube
Space LA.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.830
I know that intro is a little macabre, but
it’s true, one day your body isn’t going

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.690
to really have you in it anymore.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.480
At that point there are a few options for
what you can do with it.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.310
You can preserve it and bury it in a box,
entomb it in stone, or burn it to ash and

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.210
let your family keep you over their mantle.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.520
But as the Lion King teaches us, there is
a circle of life and all of these options

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.870
kind of take you out of it.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.360
According to the New York Times, that’s
why Katrina Spade is hoping to make the first

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.300
ever human composting facility in Seattle,
because of course it would be in Seattle.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.570
Composting is basically turbocharging nature’s
decomposition process.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.530
By adding moisture and carbon rich material
to carrion in stages, the microbes that break

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.030
down organic material can reach a fever pitch.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.550
Literally, they’ll work so hard and fast
they’ll heat up the compost pile up to a

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.380
170 degrees (77C).

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.570
As a bonus, that’s hot enough to kill a
lot of pathogens in the pile.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.440
The end result is called humus, which is a
nutrient rich dark brown soil, and though

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.400
spelled similarly, it has nothing to do with
the delicious chickpea paste that goes great

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.540
on pita chips.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.500
In places like a forest floor, decomposition
to humus will happen naturally to all carcasses,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.100
it doesn’t matter if it’s human or another
animal.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.820
The nutrients in the humus are then used by
plants to grow, the plants use the sunlight

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.380
to make food for animals, the animals eventually
die and decompose and become food for plants.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.700
It’s an elegant cycle of life and death
and for hundreds of thousands of years, humans

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.970
were part of it.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.600
But starting in the early days of human civilization,
we began removing ourselves from the process.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.810
Sometimes we did it for the dead’s sake:
the Egyptians believed they would need things

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.100
they had in life for the journey afterwards,
so it was important to them their bodies were

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.120
preserved.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.050
Sometimes we do it for our own sake: we’re
respectful to the bodies of our dead as a

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.210
way of honoring their memory and easing our
own emotional pain.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.880
That’s the biggest problem Spade faces in
her goal to build a human composting facility.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.190
There doesn’t need to be a major scientific
breakthrough to do it, many farms already

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.799
compost dead livestock.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.310
But say the words “Human Composting” and
suddenly everyone pictures someone’s leg

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.190
sticking out of a green bin with coffee grounds
and banana peels on top of it.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.869
Spade’s compromise is to have the best of
both worlds: a respectful ceremony and procession

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.140
for the mourners who deliver their loved one’s
body to the top of a three story tall composting

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.420
vault with up to 30 other deceased.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.480
Slowly the body will work its way down and
eventually out the bottom comes humus.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.090
Spade estimates each body will make about
a cubic meter’s worth of nutrient-rich soil!

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:28.360
Yes, it’s not lost on me that a woman named
Spade is trying to turn bodies into dirt.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.880
Right now because of our perceptions on how
the dead should be treated, it’s not exactly…

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.880
legal.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.900
But maybe perceptions will change.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.510
Nobody gets wrapped in gauze with their organs
stuffed in jars like the egyptians used to.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.960
Even cremation wasn’t common 50 years ago,
but is considered totally normal today.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.560
There’s even a company that sells biodegradable
urns with seeds in them to turn cremated bodies

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.670
into trees.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.340
The difference between that and composting,
is human ash isn’t as nutrient rich, but

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.459
the composting process is a lot more… icky.

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.840
In my opinion, I’m all for it.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.820
I think it’s a nice way to return a body
to nature and in an elegant way, let them

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.820
live on.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.220
Just so long as we don’t turn their bodies
directly into food: I draw the line at Soylent

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.220
Green.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.460
I kind of glossed over the specifics on what
happens to your decomposing, rotting flesh

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.890
after you're done with it…

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.530
Luckily for you, Trace explains all that down
here.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.950
What are your thoughts on human composting?

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.080
Would you do it?

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.640
I know I would, if I didn’t already have
plans to shoot myself into space.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.590
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
