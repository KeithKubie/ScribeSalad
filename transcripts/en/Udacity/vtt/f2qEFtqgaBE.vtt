00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.807
In addition to specifically looking at conformity, social psychologists also

00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:08.530
look at social factors that pressure us to act in certain ways. And here we're

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.830
talking about social norms. Now social norms are rules of acceptable behavior

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.315
that are imposed on us by our culture. And norms actually vary by culture. For

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:22.750
example, maybe you can think of a social norm that's specific to your culture.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.812
For example, when I was younger, I was living and working in Tokyo. And I was

00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:30.666
very unfamiliar with the Japanese culture. But there was one social norm that I

00:00:30.666 --> 00:00:34.680
noticed right away, that was different from the way I grew up. And that was

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.460
that the Japanese kept their shoes outside their door. Perhaps you can think of

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.001
some social norms and talk about those on the forum. Now what I realized later

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:45.922
is that the Japanese kept their shoes outside of their house. Not only for

00:00:45.922 --> 00:00:49.135
practical purpose, such as keeping the house clean, but also for spiritual

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:53.052
purposes. But now let's go back to Lauren and look a little bit more

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.800
specifically at conformity.
