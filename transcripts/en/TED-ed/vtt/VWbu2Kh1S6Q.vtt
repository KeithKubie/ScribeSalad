00:00:06.524 --> 00:00:08.860
Mysteries of vernacular:

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.283
Odd,

00:00:10.283 --> 00:00:13.498
different from what is usual or expected.

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.538
Though the modern word odd has many meanings,

00:00:16.538 --> 00:00:18.450
mathematical or not,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.780
they can all be traced back

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.263
to the Indo-European root uzdho,

00:00:23.263 --> 00:00:26.218
meaning pointing upwards.

00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:27.880
Inspired by the idea

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.192
of a vertical-pointed object,

00:00:30.192 --> 00:00:33.198
speakers of Old Norse modified this root

00:00:33.198 --> 00:00:35.972
into a new word, oddi,

00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:38.639
which was used to refer to a triangle,

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.815
the simplest pointed object

00:00:40.815 --> 00:00:43.195
geometrically speaking.

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:45.531
A triangle with a long point,

00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:46.944
like an arrow head

00:00:46.944 --> 00:00:49.868
or a piece of land jutting out into the sea,

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:53.046
was recognized to have two paired angles

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:55.943
and a third that stood alone.

00:00:55.943 --> 00:00:59.333
And over time, oddi began to refer

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.527
to something that wasn't matched or paired.

00:01:02.527 --> 00:01:05.596
In Old Norse, oddi also came to mean

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:08.683
any number indivisible by two.

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:11.697
And odda mathr, the odd man,

00:01:11.697 --> 00:01:14.143
was used to describe the unpaired man

00:01:14.143 --> 00:01:17.241
whose vote could break a tie.

00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:20.444
Though the English never called a triangle odd,

00:01:20.444 --> 00:01:23.314
they did borrow the odd number

00:01:23.314 --> 00:01:25.135
and the odd man.

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:27.864
And finally, in the 16th century,

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:30.448
the notion of the odd man out

00:01:30.448 --> 00:01:33.781
gave rise to our modern meaning peculiar.
