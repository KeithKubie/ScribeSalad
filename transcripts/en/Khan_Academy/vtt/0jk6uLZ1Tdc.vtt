00:00:00.474 --> 00:00:02.936
Male voiceover: Let's say that the
current market settlement price

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:06.742
for a Futures Contract
that specifies the delivery

00:00:06.742 --> 00:00:10.869
of a thousand pounds of
apples on October 20th

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.852
and just for the simplicity
of the math in this example,

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:16.672
let's assume that that is one year away

00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:19.687
and the current settlement
price, the current market price

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:24.813
on the future exchange for
delivery on that date is $300.

00:00:24.813 --> 00:00:28.076
Let's also assume that
the current market price,

00:00:28.076 --> 00:00:31.470
if you were to buy or sell
apples today not on October 20th,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.336
which is a year away
but today, let's assume

00:00:34.336 --> 00:00:37.067
that the current market price is $200.

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:40.954
Let's also assume that if you
were to take out a $200 loan

00:00:40.954 --> 00:00:43.673
that you would have to pay 10% interest.

00:00:43.673 --> 00:00:45.545
If you were to borrow $200 today,

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.804
you would essentially have
to pay back $220 in a year.

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:52.556
Now, given all of the
parameters that I've set up,

00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:55.201
is there a way to make risk-free profits?

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:58.780
Is there way to kind of
arbitrage this situation?

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.268
And as you can imagine, there is

00:01:01.268 --> 00:01:05.207
and what we can do is, we can borrow $200,

00:01:05.207 --> 00:01:06.291
Let me list it all out.

00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:13.376
We can borrow $200 and then use that $200

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:18.302
to buy 1,000 pounds of apples.

00:01:18.302 --> 00:01:22.703
Then we buy 1,000 pounds of apples.

00:01:22.703 --> 00:01:26.606
We keep them in our garage
or some place like that

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:32.412
and then we also sell
or I guess we could say,

00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:35.064
we become the seller on
this Futures Contract

00:01:35.064 --> 00:01:37.122
or we sell the Futures short,

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:38.976
I guess is another way to think about it.

00:01:38.976 --> 00:01:49.620
We also become the seller
on the Futures Contract.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.703
Essentially, we are agreeing
to sell 1,000 pounds of apples

00:01:53.703 --> 00:01:59.030
on October 20th, a year from now for $300.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.495
So I wanna show you is
if we set it up this way,

00:02:01.495 --> 00:02:04.229
we are guaranteed to make money no matter

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.440
what happens to the price of apples

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.376
and that's why we're
calling it an arbitrage

00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:10.298
because if you fast forward one year,

00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:13.741
so let's fast forward one year.

00:02:13.741 --> 00:02:17.407
In one year, we definitely
have 1,000 pounds of apples

00:02:17.407 --> 00:02:19.370
and just for the sake of simplicity,

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.976
let's assume that apples don't get bad

00:02:21.976 --> 00:02:24.603
that I've somehow freeze-dried
them or I don't know.

00:02:24.956 --> 00:02:27.919
These are apples that never spoil.

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.281
(chuckles) Let's say a year from now,

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:31.719
I have the thousand pounds of apples

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.007
so I give the apples to
settle the Futures Contract.

00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:42.940
Give apples to settle the contract

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.542
and then of course, I have my loan.

00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:47.764
I have my loan of $200 but guess what?

00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:50.119
When I settled the contract,

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:53.605
when I settled the Futures
Contract, I got $300.

00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:58.207
So, I get 300 dollars and what do I owe?

00:02:58.207 --> 00:03:01.206
Well, I owe $220 on my loan.

00:03:01.206 --> 00:03:03.103
Let me subtract that out.

00:03:03.103 --> 00:03:09.397
I owe $220 and so I made
a guaranteed risk-free $80

00:03:09.397 --> 00:03:12.669
of profit in one year
and we're not thinking

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.321
about how much money I might
have had to set aside for margin

00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:17.497
but this essentially, just free money

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:20.215
and if you think about it,

00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:22.519
if this settlement price is anything,

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.162
if the settlement price
is anything above the $220

00:03:26.162 --> 00:03:29.369
then I'm going to make a risk-free profit.

00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:32.365
One way to think about
Futures pricing is even

00:03:32.365 --> 00:03:34.371
if you think there's
going to be a cold snap

00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:36.007
and apples are going to disappear

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:37.643
and there's going to be
the shortage of apples

00:03:37.643 --> 00:03:39.628
and so you might say, "Hey,
maybe the apple prices

00:03:39.628 --> 00:03:41.752
"will go up." a year ago,

00:03:41.752 --> 00:03:43.676
there's always going to be a way

00:03:43.676 --> 00:03:46.001
to arbitrage it if the settlement price,

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:50.231
if the growth in price
is more than the cost

00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:52.207
of borrowing the same amount of money,

00:03:52.207 --> 00:03:55.035
the cost of borrowing $200.

00:03:55.035 --> 00:03:58.079
In this situation, the
cost of borrowing is $20.

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.387
The settlement price really shouldn't be,

00:04:00.387 --> 00:04:02.826
if we assume that there's
no arbitrage opportunities,

00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:06.826
it really shouldn't be more than $220.
