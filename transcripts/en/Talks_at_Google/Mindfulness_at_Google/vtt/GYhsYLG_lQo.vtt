00:00:01.586 --> 00:00:02.960
MALE SPEAKER: My
friends, I am so

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.270
happy to have our
friends here, Dr. Ari

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:07.660
and Walter-- Walter Link.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.780
Dr. Ari is the
founder Sarvodaya.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.550
Sarvodaya is Sri Lanka's
largest social movement.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.560
Dr. Ari is widely known as
the Gandhi of Sri Lanka.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.530
And in my opinion, Dr. Ari can
be described in just two words,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.220
and the two words
are living saint.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.900
He's a humble
English teacher who

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.770
through the sheer
force of his goodness

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.330
created the largest social
movement in Sri Lanka involving

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.270
15,000 villages,
millions of people,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.510
building thousand of schools,
health centers, libraries,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.320
roads, and village
banks, and so on.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.790
Dr. Ari demonstrates that you
can integrate deep in the work

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.380
with transforming every aspect
of human life and the world.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.610
Walter here is a close friend
of Dr. Ari and his family.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.282
He chairs--

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:09.990
DR. WALTER LINK:
Sarvodaya International.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.060
MALE SPEAKER: Sarvodaya
international.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.710
And as Senior Strategy
Advisor and a leadership coach

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.340
and associate investment
banker to the organization,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.960
Walter is involved in
the same kind of work.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.190
His work is integration of
personal personal practice

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.029
into the broader world.

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:32.570
My friends, please give a warm
welcome to Dr. Ari and Walter.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.830
Let's begin, since
we have a saint here,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.280
let's begin with
some saintly sitting.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.000
I'm going to invite
Dr. Ari to guide us

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.870
in a few minutes
of mindful sitting,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.480
and then I'll have
Walter guide us

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.979
a few minutes of
relationship practice.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.270
DR. A.T. ARIYARATNE: Thank you.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.100
I'm extremely delighted that I'm
able to receive Google again.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:14.410
Google I remembered because
of this jolly good fellow who

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.620
cannot be erased from my
mind from the day I met him.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.200
What we need is human
beings on this planet who

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:36.420
can live all the time
in I call joy of living.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.645
He's one such person.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:51.290
I'm very humbled to be
back with you and Google,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:58.360
and I'm looking forward to
greater universal service

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.020
on the part of the institution
as well as all of you.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.210
To anything in the
world, mind is supreme.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.020
Therefore, for a
moment, let us try

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.122
to develop some
mindfulness by undergoing

00:03:16.122 --> 00:03:19.062
a few minutes of meditation.

00:03:19.062 --> 00:03:23.635
Please close your
eyes very lightly.

00:03:23.635 --> 00:03:26.155
Keep your feet on the ground.

00:03:29.386 --> 00:03:40.200
Keep the back erect so that the
nose, the chin, and the chest,

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.456
fall in one line.

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:45.420
Keep the right hand
on the left hand.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.550
Just look at your own body.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.690
Head to foot.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:10.885
Normally, we do not look
at our body with our mind.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:20.529
Now let us look at
our body and see

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:26.570
how this body is nothing
but getting together

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.910
of all elements in nature.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.410
Hardness.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.760
Liquidity.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.360
Air or expandability
or contractability.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.750
And heat.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.100
These are the four elements
that go to make my body.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:02.620
Similarly, all of us are
made of these four elements

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.180
and everything around
us and in the world.

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:18.070
Now we slowly bring our mind
to the tip of the nostrils.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.420
I observe how the breath
enters through the nostrils.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.105
How they escape
through the nostrils.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.100
Sometimes short breaths.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.670
Sometimes long breaths.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:45.690
Sometimes through one nostril.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.010
Sometimes through both.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:06:01.020
For a moment let us observe how
this breath coming in and out

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.150
conducts itself.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:54.470
While trying to concentrate our
mind to breathing in and out,

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:00.540
we feel very relaxed in
body as well as the mind.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.650
How does the mind originate?

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:20.170
We have in this body,
living body, a pair of eyes,

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:24.640
a pair of ears, a
nose, a tongue, a body,

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.260
as well as a mind.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.650
But through images that
fall into our eyes,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.340
eye consciousness is created.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.940
Similarly, sounds create
sound consciousness.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:10.830
Smell creates olfactory,
all smell consciousness.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.183
Tongue creates
taste consciousness.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:26.146
Body creates feelings.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.120
Mind creates thoughts, memories.

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:39.413
All these six sensations,
senses, create sensations.

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:48.220
Now, while keeping the mind
in breathing in and out,

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:59.860
we try to observe how these
six sensory organs get messages

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:08.850
from outside, creating either
pleasant feelings and thoughts

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:16.160
or creating unpleasant or even
neutral thoughts and feelings.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.820
Observe the six
sensory organs and how

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:30.240
they behave while keeping
the mind always breathing

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.383
in and out at the
starting point.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:35.520
I'm trying to be
mindful to everything

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:41.563
that is happening in this body
mind combination every moment.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.770
While continuing to look
at the breathing in and out

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:36.570
and while continuing to observe
how these sensory organs

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:43.950
conduct themselves with regard
to external stimulation,

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.830
see the impermanence
in the eyes,

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:54.540
impermanence in the
objects that the eye sees.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.426
Impermanence in the
eye consciousness.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.830
Impermanence in the ears.

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.830
Impermanence of the sound.

00:12:05.830 --> 00:12:07.836
Impermanence of the
sound consciousness.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:17.920
In this manner, the impermanence
of every sensory organ,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.160
including the mind,
the thoughts we get.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:35.540
In this body or mind, I
cannot discover anything

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.065
as a permanent entity.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.925
Everything changes every moment.

00:12:52.010 --> 00:13:01.340
I shall attempt to abstain from
holding to anything material

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.485
or mental with attachment.

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:18.085
I know that attachment
brings suffering, sorrow.

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:31.420
Now with that observation
of mindfulness of the body

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:40.670
and mind-- body, sensations,
perceptions, relations,

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.420
and consciousness.

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:57.360
So these five, they
see as momentary

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:03.640
of momentary existence
and attachment

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:06.695
is not going to
be of any benefit.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.490
The same process takes
place in all of us.

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.340
For first I extend loving
kindness to my own body

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:25.140
and mind, then I extend
loving kindness to all of us

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.520
present here.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.690
Then let us extend our
loving kindness to all those

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:35.100
who are near and dear to us.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:39.450
Our parents, our spouses,
our children, our friends,

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.010
our colleagues.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.805
May all of them
be well and happy.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.900
May we now extend
the loving kindness

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.590
to everybody on this compound.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:59.720
Everybody in this area,
everybody in our country,

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.380
everybody in this world.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.400
From mindfulness of
my own body and mind

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:12.130
and realizing its impermanence
and detaching myself

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:17.580
and reducing my egoism, I
extend my loving kindness

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.820
to the entire living
world, entire universe.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:31.040
With mindfulness we
began, with loving

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.115
kindness we expanded our hearts.

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:41.780
It's going to create a critical
mass of spiritual consciousness

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:49.310
in the world without which
there is no peace possible.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.970
Without which we
can't put an end

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:55.990
to enmity, hunger, conflicts.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.750
May I be well and happy.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:05.100
May all of us be well and happy.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.120
May the entire world
be well and happy.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.460
Thank you.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.030
DR. WALTER LINK: Before
you open your eyes,

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:40.850
please notice the impact
that this practice has

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:43.940
had on your mind and your head.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:53.620
Not only the thoughts, but
also the energy, the space,

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:57.520
the quality of
experience in your head.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:13.219
And then notice also the
impact on your feelings.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.990
Internally, without
speaking them,

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:32.375
find a few words that describe
your inner state of feeling.

00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:51.320
And then notice also your
belly and the rest of your body

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.990
and the sensations
you have there.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.055
Notice that the breath
is flowing in the belly.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:17.710
Kind of anchor yourself in
this awareness of the breath

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:29.090
in the belly, and then
gently, without rushing,

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:36.260
allow your eyes to
open while remaining

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:37.710
focused in your belly.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.690
Notice that it can be quite
challenging because the eyes

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.130
bring in powerful
sensations that

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:54.730
pull us towards the sensation.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:08.140
And rather let what you
see come to you so that you

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.650
see what you see and
hear what you hear

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:17.695
and it enters the space of
you that includes your body.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.650
And you keep noticing the
impact that it has there.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:44.110
In a moment we will
go into much more

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:49.200
content for the mind, that the
mind hopefully will get curious

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.240
about and engaged
with, and we spend

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.460
a lot of time in
our head center,

00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:59.386
thinking and being inspired.

00:19:59.386 --> 00:20:06.430
And it's also good to
keep present in your belly

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.535
and in your heart center.

00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:18.310
And notice how you're impacted
as we speak in an ongoing way.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:24.290
Because often we
think that listening

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:29.140
is to pay attention to
the other and especially

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.060
to the other's words.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.190
And that's really
important also.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:42.870
But, really, our
heart and our body

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.285
is constantly also
being impacted.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:55.470
And the more awareness we have
about this impact in ourselves

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.730
by the other, the
more freedom of choice

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.750
we have how to respond.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:10.890
And so this is a way how you
can take this ancient Buddhist

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:16.470
practice into really every
moment of your life--

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:22.880
in a business meeting, in
a strategy and innovation

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.380
discussion.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:30.670
We can stay present
to ourselves and see

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.820
that there are different
parts of ourselves impacted

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:40.780
and that also the other
person is not only their words

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:46.600
but they might have certain
feelings, a certain presence

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:52.040
that's also really an
important way they communicate.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.780
So it's really a unity.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:00.330
There's you and me in this
mutual impact that we have.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.220
And when we open
that even further,

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.010
then we see that there's
a whole field here,

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.000
because we will all
impact each other.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.520
And of course there's the whole
company and the whole world.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:19.600
And we can listen, use
this mindfulness to really

00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:25.120
be aware of what's going on
on these different levels

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:31.710
and keep coming back to that
during our time together.

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:35.690
Just to practice
together and not only

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.360
talk about interesting stuff.

00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:42.954
So with that, I
pass it on to you.

00:22:42.954 --> 00:22:43.495
MALE SPEAKER:

00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:45.130
Thank you, my friends.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.950
Dr. Ari, my first
question is for you.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:51.650
So you started as an
English in college

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.570
and you ended up with
a huge social movement.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:57.299
So my first question is, how?

00:22:57.299 --> 00:22:58.590
What was the story behind this?

00:22:59.895 --> 00:23:04.000
DR. A.T. ARIYARATNE:
While I was a teacher,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:13.080
my hobby or pastime was to
visit communities, particularly

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:18.200
those that were socially and
economically very depressed

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.640
communities.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:26.550
And then one day in my class,
consisting of teenagers,

00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:29.110
I told them the
story of one village.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:32.110
I said I visited many villages.

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.720
The more I visited these
village communities,

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:41.220
the more I feel that there
are things that we as students

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:46.806
also can do without
waiting until we grow up

00:23:46.806 --> 00:23:50.290
and take various
kinds of employment.

00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:56.320
Then my students suggested, why
don't we organize ourselves,

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.640
do it in the next vacation,
go to a village live

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:05.300
with the village people, learn
from them while contributing

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:09.370
to some-- contributing
in some way

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:14.760
or other to satisfy one or
more of their basic needs,

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:20.030
That's how it all
started 56 years ago.

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:24.380
So all these students
and teachers, all of us,

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.770
settled down in the village
for a couple of weeks,

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:31.310
and we asked village people
that we will cook together

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.700
in one kitchen.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.730
We will eat together.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.070
We will sing together.

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.750
We'll meditate together.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:41.060
We'll dance together
at the same time.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.750
We will share our
labor and whatever

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:48.240
skills we have to build a
well, to build a school,

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:50.390
to build some toilets.

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:55.290
Do some agriculture
work like that.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:56.690
So we had a timetable.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:02.960
We are, during two weeks' time,
a physical acheivements of work

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:08.960
was there which anybody
could see, feel, physically.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:15.940
At the same time, we had
about four hours or more

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:21.960
of meditation, discussion,
learning from one another.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:29.180
So it began a kind of
educational extension program,

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.410
which continued
to other villages,

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:36.900
during other vacations
and weekends.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:44.930
Then we found ourselves that we
were a big village development

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:45.930
movement.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:51.650
So we have to organize ourselves
from education to development.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.230
And development
actually was a word

00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:58.292
which was meant for animals--
livestock development and all

00:25:58.292 --> 00:25:59.080
that.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.860
But I think it was one of
the American presidential--

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:07.920
gave development the connotation
that human beings should

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.460
be developed.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.140
In a way, he was right,
because we have degenerated,

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.780
most of us, into the
worst of human animals.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.550
Otherwise, these
killings can't go on.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.000
This exploitation can't
go on in the world.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.020
But we give a different
meaning to development.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.750
We said it's an
awakening process.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:34.530
We have come to this village to
awaken our human personality.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.780
And in our culture, in
the Buddhist teachings,

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:43.340
we have been told that
there are four principles,

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:48.330
very simple to remember, which
could be practised by all of us

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:52.900
at all times to awaken
our personality at work,

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.970
when we take a
bath, when we eat.

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:59.000
Whatever we do during the day.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.530
First is loving kindness.

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:07.770
So we practiced this meta
mediation, meditation

00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:14.160
on loving kindness,
trying to as much

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:22.430
as possible to make our
ego less and less prominent

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:26.340
and our universal
nature to come up

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:30.125
so that we feel a brotherhood
among all beings, not only

00:27:30.125 --> 00:27:30.625
humans.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.390
So there's a spiritual
aspect to it.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.070
And then there's a model aspect.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:41.990
While we were camping
out in a village,

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:45.320
we were very
particular that there

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.310
was no alcohol in that place.

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.950
No gambling.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.320
Not even talking unnecessarily.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.620
All this pleasant and
constructive speech,

00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:59.620
constructive activity, quality
in association and like that.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.090
So all the work we
did in the village

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.490
by way of physical
labor or teaching

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:09.590
or health care or even
doctors coming and helping

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:12.730
to have clinics for the
people without charging--

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:16.180
all of these things became
compassionate action.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.810
So human beings should develop
loving kindness, or meta,

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.280
convert that loving kindness
into compassionate action.

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:27.490
So you're seated in
Google, your office,

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.400
trying to create something.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:35.790
If your principle objective
is well-being all of humanity,

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.330
then what do you do--
creating a new product,

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:42.320
creating new something for the
company, which in turn is going

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:46.010
to help others is become
compassionate action.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:48.550
It's not a selfish
kind of action.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:53.720
And at the end of it I'm
sure, when you discovered

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:58.150
your first [INAUDIBLE]
engineering skill in Google,

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.830
you would have felt a
terrific joy of living.

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.770
It's human, not
money part of it.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.710
Money is secondary.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.470
We are not going to come
back to get anything from it.

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:09.550
But we feel so happy.

00:29:09.550 --> 00:29:12.050
That is called mudita.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:15.730
That is loving kindness,
compassion, action,

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:17.560
altruistic joy.

00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:22.040
And some people turn around
and say, look at those fools,

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:25.590
studying for their examination
and getting a first class pass.

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:27.700
They are going and
wasting their time.

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:30.240
There are some people
who will ridicule you.

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.800
Now, this is real
education in my country.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:38.370
Education at that time
thought this is nonsense.

00:29:38.370 --> 00:29:41.690
Trusting that it
interdicted me from my job.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.990
I said, thank you very
much for interdicting me.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:49.660
I will use that time to do
more work with my students

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:52.660
after school hours,
which I continued to do.

00:29:52.660 --> 00:29:54.215
But I said, I have a family.

00:29:54.215 --> 00:29:55.155
I have a wife.

00:29:55.155 --> 00:29:58.230
I have a couple of children
who [INAUDIBLE] this.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.300
So I'm going to come to
your house for my meals

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.810
and see that my salary
is not too stumped.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.050
So I'm got the salary
while I was interdicted.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:10.250
There was a human
cry in the country

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.080
and the bureaucrats
had to give in.

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.870
And the president-- the
prime minister called me.

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:20.780
She said, ask the official
who interdicted me either

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:25.540
to repeal the whole thing--
give me everything that I lost--

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.880
or for him to go home.

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.120
So they asked me what
are the challenges.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.210
From the day one,
it was challenges,

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.950
challenges, challenges.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:38.080
The [INAUDIBLE]
is very necessary.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.310
Whenever you do
something good first,

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:46.530
people will treat you
with indifference.

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.190
Then they will start
joking about you,

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:53.530
ridiculing what you are
doing-- this is not education.

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:57.240
Then they'll start
insulting you.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.180
Those days, they
said I'm going out

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.680
to villages with boys and
girls to have a nice time.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.070
So insulting you.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:09.860
Without stopping that they
try to prosecute to you,

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:15.140
to do all kinds of harm
to you and Take your--

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:21.410
make an end to your life
for all of these things.

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:23.470
Then comes the worst.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.233
People begin to respect you.

00:31:25.233 --> 00:31:29.780
Now I'm going through
that terrible experience.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.490
I know how weak I am.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:36.530
I know what weaknesses
I have, but other people

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:38.730
don't believe it.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.040
There are times
when I was smoking.

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.050
I was smoking 15 years ago.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.525
Nobody believed I smoked.

00:31:45.525 --> 00:31:47.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:49.890
Yet they see me smoking.

00:31:49.890 --> 00:31:50.890
Look at Ari!

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:52.330
He doesn't drink.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:54.250
He doesn't walk.

00:31:54.250 --> 00:31:57.570
He talks all that pleasant
language, like that.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.160
So that is a very
dangerous period.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.550
That's why you-- you
have to be careful.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:03.540
I had to be careful.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.640
All of you have to be careful.

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:11.050
If you do good, the worst comes
last when people respect you.

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.680
Then you think, I
know everything.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:16.590
So therefore,
personality awakening

00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:19.230
was our first objective.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.560
Meta, karuna, mudita, uppeka.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.870
Loving kindness.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:25.990
Compassion, action.

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:30.330
Don't say, I'm doing
a job back at Google.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:34.130
I'm engaged in compassionate
action in Google.

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:37.030
How nice to say that.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:41.730
The benefit I get is the
joy of living, creating.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:47.660
The last thing is we
accept name and blame.

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.960
Loss and gain with equanimity.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.810
Those were our first objectives.

00:32:52.810 --> 00:32:55.100
Second, third like that.

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.790
Afterword, awakening.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:01.880
These 56 years we have
built up theoretical base

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.954
also from practical work.

00:33:05.954 --> 00:33:09.080
MALE SPEAKER: I don't know if
anybody of you caught that.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:14.280
He says 56 years, so Dr. Ari has
been doing this for 56 years.

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.619
DR. A.T. ARITARATNE: 56 years.

00:33:15.619 --> 00:33:16.660
Before that as a student.

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:17.410
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.125
And he's like--
You're 84 years old?

00:33:19.125 --> 00:33:19.680
DR. A.T. ARITARATNE: Yeah.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.013
MALE SPEAKER: And he's so vital.

00:33:21.013 --> 00:33:23.450
That's one thing that-- in
common between me and Dr. Ari.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:25.680
Neither one of us
looks a day over 65.

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.349
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:26.349 --> 00:33:27.640
DR. A.T. ARIYARATNE: Thank you.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.390
MALE SPEAKER: Ari,
about equanimity.

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:36.550
There's something else about
equanimity, which fascinates me

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:41.052
about you and to me it
comes-- it appears as courage.

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:42.260
DR. A.T. ARIYARATNE: Courage.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:43.176
MALE SPEAKER: Courage.

00:33:43.176 --> 00:33:44.830
So in your case,
I know there was

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:47.710
a gun pointed at
you more than once.

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:50.370
And there was a particular story
I was particularly touched by,

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.430
and I know the last time we met,
I asked you whether it was true

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.990
and you told me it was true.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.727
And the story was that somebody
tried to assassinate you.

00:33:56.727 --> 00:33:57.810
DR. A.T. ARIYARATNE: Yeah.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:59.185
MALE SPEAKER: And
they were going

00:33:59.185 --> 00:34:01.450
to bomb a school that
Dr. Ari was visiting.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.890
And Dr. Ari found out
about that and he found out

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:05.130
who the guy was.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.230
And he went to the
guy's house, and he

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.150
says, don't bomb the school.

00:34:09.150 --> 00:34:10.969
You're just going
to hurt the kids.

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:14.900
So I'm here right now, you're
going to kill me, kill me now.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:17.469
And the guy decided
not to kill you.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:19.889
And it could have gone
either way, by the way,

00:34:19.889 --> 00:34:21.560
just so you know.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.500
So my question for you, Dr.
Ari, where does this courage

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:28.730
come from, and how is this
courage related to mindfulness?

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:34.480
DR. A.T. ARITARATNE:
You know, first,

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:41.679
try to develop loving
kindness almost to perfection.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:45.870
I'm not saying I'm perfect,
but supposing you get up

00:34:45.870 --> 00:34:49.230
in the morning-- I'm
talking practical things.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.530
As you get up, don't
think of the problem

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.389
you have been tackling here.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.820
Just extend your
loving kindness to you

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:59.330
wife, your children, anybody.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:01.600
Or even if there are
persons you that you

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:06.690
don't like in the neighborhood,
give loving kindness to them.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.720
Then you get ready
and come to office.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:14.250
On your way back, everybody
you meet-- known or unknown--

00:35:14.250 --> 00:35:18.580
sometimes in a very cold
morning, we say good morning.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:20.770
So we have that
kind of courtesy.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:24.197
But why not in your
mind tell everybody,

00:35:24.197 --> 00:35:25.280
may you be well and happy.

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:30.440
May you be-- Yesterday I was
going on the street with him

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.700
or somebody in the
evening day before.

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:38.360
A lady came, young lady,
maybe 30, 40, years.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.810
She looked so pathetic.

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:42.610
Can you give me a dollar?

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:46.460
I was surprised in America
there are people who beg.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.680
So I took out and
gave it to her.

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:52.870
And then somebody else was
with me, he also gave a dollar.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:02.700
Now, before I gave that, at
that moment we're not talking.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.830
I was extending loving
kindness to everybody.

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:10.530
So when in times of
war, on either side,

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.460
there are groups
who are fighting.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:16.080
But we are announce and say we
are now coming on a peace walk.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:21.070
When you go on a peace
walk, you go only

00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:24.220
looking at the tip of your nose.

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.020
So you don't see
anything more than that.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.610
You don't see people with guns.

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:31.200
There are people
with guns there.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.720
You extend loving
kindness to your own body

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.530
and mind then proceed.

00:36:37.530 --> 00:36:40.790
Extending that loving kindness
to people on either side.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:45.750
Believe me, they had no
guts to pull the trigger.

00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.305
So it all comes through
loving kindness.

00:36:49.305 --> 00:36:55.070
Then loving kindness-- now
when I was confronted that day

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:59.660
with that criminal,
he was a terror.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:03.760
Anybody I tell his name, I
wouldn't-- I'll tell his name

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:08.210
without looking, seeing
that there's nobody around.

00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:11.110
When I heard this,
of course, I thought

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:13.570
I'm practicing this
loving kindness.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.200
I'll practice it on this
fellow and see what happens.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:19.470
That way I didn't
know what fear was,

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:23.690
because I was engaged in
something really important.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:30.440
So I went to him and revealed
why I came and who I was.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:34.010
He just got up from his
seat and sat down here.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:40.080
What I realized all my life
is the most cowardish people

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.770
are those who take up arms.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.190
They are the first
class cowards.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:54.380
They fear people
who are fearless.

00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.780
So during the last
56 years I may

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.330
have more than 50 occasions.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.410
Fortunately, up to now,
still when go back this time

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:11.590
I don't know where I will be
because, again, politically

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.990
everything is warming up.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:17.340
And as a neutral
person, everybody's

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.720
expecting me to take
this side or that side,

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.590
but I won't take any side.

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:26.850
I will take the side of peace
and reconciliation and all

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:27.350
that.

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:32.640
So always when you do
good, you are in danger

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.490
because the world is
not that civilized yet

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:39.680
with regard to non-violence.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:45.590
Therefore, the more you
cultivate this loving kindness,

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.580
fear disappears from you.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.140
Actually, I don't
say I'm not afraid.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.880
But there have been occasions
where I should have been afraid

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:57.060
but it was this loving
kindness and nothing else

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.130
that filled me.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.540
If-- I believe even
Mahatma Gandhi,

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:08.300
if he had a chance, just
a minute or so before

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.360
that fellow shot him, he
would not have got killed.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.080
He had no time even to think.

00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:21.460
When he came and killed him.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:27.370
The victim, I believe, is always
associated with the killer.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:32.320
If victim does not cooperate,
the killer cannot kill you.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.240
So these things
come to your mind

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:39.830
if you spend hours and
hours in deep meditation.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:42.710
And so I don't want to
go into details of that

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:45.980
because now I said mindfulness.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:50.040
Mindfulness leads you to look
at everything as impermanent.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:54.250
See, I look at my wife,
children, grandchildren

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.380
as impermanent.

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.650
That doesn't mean that
I do not love them.

00:39:57.650 --> 00:40:02.400
I would sacrifice my life to
save them in case of danger.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.930
That's different.

00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:07.850
In the back of your mind, you
have to have-- I'm, he or she,

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:13.090
we, all have to have temporary
appearances on this planet.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.070
So then impermanence.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.620
Then once you realize
these two things,

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.720
you begin to
separate in your mind

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.060
I have good thoughts.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.080
I will never allow
them to escape my mind.

00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:27.360
I have some bad thoughts.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.130
I'll get rid of them
as quickly as possible.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.980
I'll bring in new good
thoughts to my mind

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.760
I'll never allow a new
bad thought to come in.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.880
That is called right different.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.985
With these three things,
now, I can see in him,

00:40:40.985 --> 00:40:43.510
now I can see in
many of my colleagues

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:47.360
when you have these three
things, you're always happy.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:51.150
Now my-- A lot of
people ask me back home,

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.740
how can be such a
responsible man?

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:56.200
Always joking, joking.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:58.950
Here there are people
killing one another.

00:40:58.950 --> 00:41:01.420
You're joking until
it's go and help them.

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:02.460
You know?

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.570
How come?

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:07.770
This is the of list of this
four things of happiness

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.860
then it become a trait.

00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:13.400
You're always happy,
not just momentarily.

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.020
The comes the sixth
thing, where you

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.970
realize these things
called samadi.

00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:23.600
Samadi is right
concentration, where

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.290
no thoughts arise in your mind.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:35.150
It's totally blank After a
blank period of the mind then

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:41.080
you come to the next stage,
pitka, day to day equanimity.

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:43.390
Then your creativity comes.

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.120
Then your thoughts come.

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:50.210
So that all these things
have to happen to together.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.490
Therefore, no time
for fear then.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:56.450
MALE SPEAKER: Speaking about
no good deeds going unpunished,

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.800
I have a question for
you, my friend, Walter.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.140
So the question is,
what's a nice guy

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.676
doing in a place like this?

00:42:03.676 --> 00:42:05.300
I'd like to know
about your involvement

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.020
in this organization.

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.280
Specifically, I'm
interested to know--

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.770
I know that your
organization is trying

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.620
to change the
economics of the world,

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:18.060
and I'd like to hear your
views on that as well.

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.900
DR. WALTER LINK: As you can
notice, Ari is very convincing,

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:26.270
so he just basically
recruited me.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:31.190
I was organizing at the
conference at Omega Institute

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:33.720
that I was on the
board on in New York,

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:39.460
and Ari came and he walked
straight to me and he said,

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.400
I need you to come
to Sri Lanka and help

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.070
us bring this organization
in the 21st century

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:47.760
because we have a
very good thing going,

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:53.020
but we need to understand
how to take the next step,

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:56.700
both in terms of the economic
and the political and social

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.400
development environment
and so forth.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:02.300
And I think what was
relevant in this,

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:06.170
we are-- I think all three
of us-- we are interested not

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:10.780
only to work on a project, even
though a project is important,

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:14.290
but we want to create movements.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:18.930
And he had read
a book that I had

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:23.850
edited about global leadership,
which was a movement that we

00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:27.780
are continuing to try to bring
into the world which really

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.820
looks at all the sectors
of society and sees

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:34.320
how can we really
bring about, you

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:39.140
could say a sustainable adjust,
but also very functional

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:42.020
innovation there.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.080
And his organization works
in all sectors of society.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.290
So it really
requires a rethinking

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:51.160
of all these different
things, and I myself

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.760
came from running a
big, traditional company

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:58.070
and then moved on to
transforming business

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:02.560
by bringing together many people
who owned and ran companies

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:06.300
to show there is really a
different way and it works.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.930
It's not some kind of ideal.

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:11.040
Because I think
that's really what

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.660
makes a real, concrete movement.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:19.460
It's not just to have an
aspiration that is inspiring

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:21.650
but then people
look at their life

00:44:21.650 --> 00:44:25.050
and the stretch seems
too big and there's

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:29.760
no guidance about how to move
from where they are to actually

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.350
implementing the changes
that are necessary to reach

00:44:34.350 --> 00:44:36.940
that inspirational place.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:42.730
And so that's where we
started to deep dialogue

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:45.560
and deep collaborations
in bringing

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.490
about these movements, not
only in Sri Lanka but also

00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:50.346
internationally.

00:44:50.346 --> 00:44:54.990
MALE SPEAKER: Dr. Ari, I
have a question for you.

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:57.270
There are so many things
about you that inspire me

00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:00.280
and one of those many things
is that what you do actually

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:01.810
works.

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:04.339
And so I compare what you
do to international aid,

00:45:04.339 --> 00:45:06.130
when rich countries
keep the poor countries

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:08.104
and the money just
disappear to corruption,

00:45:08.104 --> 00:45:09.020
but you don't do that.

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:09.780
You start doing nothing.

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.560
You're just a
schoolteacher, and what

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.320
you did was inspire people to
give the gift of labor and love

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.420
to each other and in
doing so it created

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:22.590
the whole massive movement,
like 15,000 bridges, millions

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:25.020
of dollars, schools, and
so forth, have been built.

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:29.830
And so my question
for you is, first,

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:33.470
how, what can people learn
from this thing that you did,

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:37.150
that inspired people to be
able to give to each other?

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.910
And also, I'm interested to
know about grassroot democracy,

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:42.840
and I know you've done
some thinking somewhat

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:45.620
in that field, and I want to
know what's the current state

00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:47.634
and what can we learn
from that as well?

00:45:47.634 --> 00:45:50.490
DR. A.T. ARIYARATNE:
You may remember

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.480
I started by talking about
individual personality

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.330
reasoning.

00:45:56.330 --> 00:45:58.870
Next comes family
then the community

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.930
then groups and
nations and the world.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:07.330
So awakening is something that
could be implemented, starting

00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:10.590
from the individual
to the world level.

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:14.340
But, unfortunately, most of
the modern economic, social,

00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:21.430
and political theories are
based on not naturalistical kind

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:26.640
of approach, not for
the well being of all.

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.190
Well being of the majority.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:31.880
That Mahatma Gandhi
coined word sarvodaya,

00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:36.450
which we adopted from India.

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:40.300
Because our language
also rooted in Sanskrit,

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.480
So this word was
similar to our language.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.980
So we adopted the word
sarvodaya from Mahatma Gandhi.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:56.920
So this concept
of working for all

00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.910
is something that Buddhists try
to always have. [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:07.390
May all beings be
well and happy.

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:11.940
Now if I-- if a mosquito
lights on my hand,

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.510
if I kill the mosquito, my
mother will turn to me and say,

00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:19.520
why did you kill that mosquito?

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:22.820
That mosquito also
has a right to live.

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.080
Where else can
this mosquito live?

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.020
You should have
chased him out or not

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:32.950
allowed mosquitoes to breed.

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:40.755
So respect for life is
the eye of our culture.

00:47:40.755 --> 00:47:44.200
That life is the art the
heart of every living being.

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:49.450
So we had to think of
development models, which

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:53.540
take this kind of basic
truths into consideration.

00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:57.070
So truth, nonviolence,
and self-reliance,

00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:01.590
were the three principles
on which we started.

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:05.910
We told our communities,
you are poor.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:08.580
Governments if they
have no money therefore

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.600
they can't give you a
water service scheme.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.470
Wells or irrigation
tanks or anything.

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:18.060
Why do we did?

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:24.240
In the modern economies you
talk of land, labor, capital,

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.275
and entrepreneurship,
like what you

00:48:26.275 --> 00:48:28.470
were taught in the universities.

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:33.250
But in our ancient culture
it's not land, it's nature.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:38.010
It's not labor, it's
human personality.

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:43.940
It's not money, it's not
capital, it's social wealth.

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:48.150
It's not entrepreneurship
only, it is science and wisdom.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:49.760
Ancient culture.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.220
Let us bring these five
factors of progress

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:55.840
together and see what happens.

00:48:55.840 --> 00:49:00.220
Thousands of people to join to
cut the road to the village.

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.850
Dig wells.

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:03.660
From nature itself
collect material

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:09.140
and put up houses, not big,
concrete, modern houses,

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:13.290
but livable houses with plenty
of yard and sunlight and all

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:14.540
that.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:19.950
So that kind of
creativity, they never

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:24.510
thought of after they
became independent in 1948

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:28.550
they thought of imitating
of the western world who

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:32.230
had a lot of money from
exploitation, from conquests.

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.140
We didn't have that
kind of capital.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:39.360
So we had to have
our own process

00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:43.270
and we call it an
awakening process,

00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:49.320
and then of course the problem
we have is all these things

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:57.700
are imitated by governments and
others with limited objectives.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.740
Political or
profitable objectives.

00:50:00.740 --> 00:50:04.820
But not for the [INAUDIBLE]
being of humanity

00:50:04.820 --> 00:50:12.140
but now I think there are
many institutions from around

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.140
the world come and
spend time with us

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:19.710
from universities, scholars,
World Bank, and IMF

00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:24.190
and all these organizations
come, and I am really careful.

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:26.430
We have several thousand
working in the moment.

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:28.970
full time and many
more [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:31.425
I told them to be
very, very careful

00:50:31.425 --> 00:50:33.001
of experts and consultants.

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:37.670
You know that joke
about consultants?

00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:42.330
A consultant went to the village
and asked a village woman,

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:44.780
your hen lays eggs every day?

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.030
Any problem?

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:50.560
No problem.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.660
Then this expert was
very disappointed

00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:56.750
because there was nobody
to get advice from him.

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:59.425
When he was getting
into the car,

00:50:59.425 --> 00:51:03.250
the woman ran to the expert
and said, yes, sir, I

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:05.250
have a problem.

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:08.310
Can you tell me
how to distinguish

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:10.465
between a male chick
and a female chick.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:15.970
He said, you have to
ask the chicken expert.

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:19.370
I am only some other expert.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.361
So experts come and go.

00:51:21.361 --> 00:51:22.860
I have been an
expert myself for one

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:28.260
and a half am months in Uganda.

00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:32.370
I was paid so much
I felt sick of it.

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:37.580
I got a another one recommended
to do my job and I came home.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.380
I didn't know what to
with all that money.

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.940
[INAUDIBLE] and there's
a nice meditation center.

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:47.755
All of you can
come and meditate.

00:51:47.755 --> 00:51:51.590
MALE SPEAKER: I have one last
question for both of you, which

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:55.020
is how are you going to turn
this into a global movement

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:56.710
and how do we help you do that?

00:52:00.662 --> 00:52:07.310
DR. A.T. ARIYARATNE: I think
this world needs three things

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:09.465
to happen.

00:52:09.465 --> 00:52:14.050
If we are to eliminate
conflict as well as hunger

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:19.610
and other causes for
this present situation,

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:32.360
one is, democratize the
economic and social life

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:38.090
by decentralized planning
and organization, what

00:52:38.090 --> 00:52:39.235
we call ground surround.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.020
Have governments of communities.

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:50.436
Imagine the planet with
communities of 100 families,

00:52:50.436 --> 00:52:52.980
maybe 200 families, maybe
a little less, maybe

00:52:52.980 --> 00:53:00.070
a little more, having maximum
possible freedom to decide

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:03.250
what they want to do with least
interference from the top.

00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:04.800
That is one.

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:11.640
Total devolution or
decentralization of power.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:18.480
Second thing is, unless there is
a spiritual foundation on which

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.180
these people unite,
it won't work.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:24.740
Again, demand
somebody from the top

00:53:24.740 --> 00:53:27.330
to send the army or the police
to say settle our dispute.

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:27.945
This building.

00:53:27.945 --> 00:53:34.240
So second thing is a
spiritual awakening.

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:39.535
Third thing is, while you
have that critical mass

00:53:39.535 --> 00:53:45.200
of spiritual consciousness,
keeping the people together,

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:52.820
you need the most modern
communication technology

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:58.340
going to every village, every
community, in the planet.

00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:02.650
To prepare for this we have
a section called fusion,

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:06.330
because we really don't know
how to handle IT and all that.

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:08.980
What I said what they were
doing me a good thing.

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.640
We can reach more and more
and more and more people.

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:13.720
And knowledge.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:20.530
So start training people in
this so at least a couple

00:54:20.530 --> 00:54:24.120
of people in our villages
are competent to handle

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.670
computers, the
internet, like that.

00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:32.450
Now that, we need a
lot of help from you.

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:39.490
That is, if you can get
our 15,000 village network,

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:44.915
which is now experimenting with
total decentralized banking.

00:54:47.610 --> 00:54:52.640
There are so many areas we
need help in technology.

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.500
We are a very poor organization.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.000
We don't have a tax.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.990
For his donation he
gave some time ago,

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:05.130
they did lot of work
including a good publication.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:08.410
I don't agree with the
theme of the publication.

00:55:08.410 --> 00:55:11.340
It happened to be
about a person.

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:13.330
That is myself,
which I don't like.

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:19.780
So many have helped
us in different ways.

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:28.080
Now he is giving us first class,
western, scientific knowledge

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:32.710
also combined with
eastern spirituality

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:36.100
without spending a
cent on our part.

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:40.380
So that way those who
have knowledge, money,

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:43.390
and other expertise
should share it with us,

00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:45.170
we will share with you.

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:51.900
We also have a lot of expertise
derived from ancient living

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:55.630
culture normal in our village.

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:57.001
SPEAKER: One minute.

00:55:57.001 --> 00:55:58.370
Any last words from you?

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:00.370
DR. WALTER LINK: Yes.

00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:03.520
So I think you
spoke about courage.

00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:08.010
I think one of the most
important things that everybody

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:11.540
could do is to have the
courage to really listen

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.540
to their deepest inspiration.

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:17.100
I think we are very
discouraged in doing that.

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:23.560
And then to really look at
every institution of our society

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:28.630
and really look and see like how
can that really fully represent

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:32.850
our humanity and the
sustainability that we want,

00:56:32.850 --> 00:56:37.180
and what can we
learn from Sarvodava?

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:44.450
We are working, for example,
on a big movement outreach

00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:48.830
to reinvent democracy
which, also in this country

00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:51.465
and in many countries around
the world, as we know,

00:56:51.465 --> 00:56:57.870
get stale and formal
and loses the alive,

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:01.560
dialogic, interchange where
we really get together

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:05.600
to co-create the
understanding of how

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:07.500
we want to live together.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.800
So I think that's a
very interesting project

00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:11.060
that we could talk more about.

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:15.340
Secondly, fact is
that businesses

00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:21.420
now impact society in
such a massive way,

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:28.220
that we really need to think
about how to create companies

00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:30.870
that really represent
this deepest inspiration,

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:32.730
and so what we're
doing, for example, is

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:37.600
we took a non profitable
nonprofit that

00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:43.220
was doing microfinance and
gave very good social service,

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:47.820
but wasn't really a model
for reinventing the economy

00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:51.950
because it was just another
nice social institution.

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:55.140
We are transforming that into
a fully regulated bank that

00:57:55.140 --> 00:57:58.800
presently is growing
at 100% every year

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:03.960
and that requires really a
very big cultural change also

00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:10.460
in the organization where
people that we're used to just--

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:16.320
be good, also had to integrate
being good as being really

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.030
effective, and I think
this is also what we need.

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:23.800
There is a good
challenge in business

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.970
to integrate really
this deep humanity

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:29.030
with doing it in
a way that works.

00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:32.730
And I think, for example,
when we look at innovation.

00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:36.910
Innovation isn't just doing
something new and different.

00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:40.430
It's doing something that really
serves the world, only then

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:43.820
does it really deserve
the word innovation.

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:46.680
And all of that will
only happen [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.570
aspect that I think
we can learn here.

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:56.110
Find a way for ourselves, how
we really develop our potential.

00:58:56.110 --> 00:59:00.140
Because it's not some kind
of theory, this potential,

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:03.920
it's a moment to
moment opportunity

00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.860
to be more and
more, step by step.

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:10.780
Deeper in our hearts,
deeper in our clarity.

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:14.110
Deeper in a responsibility
of interacting,

00:59:14.110 --> 00:59:17.060
and there are wonderful,
ancient methodology

00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:21.400
and modern, contemporary
methodologies

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.650
that help us to do that.

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:25.070
And we really need to
start bringing them

00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:29.110
into our day-to-day life
and see that with them we

00:59:29.110 --> 00:59:31.960
get empowered to
really be democratic.

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.890
Because we cannot be
democratic if we're stuck

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:38.840
in our judgmental minds and
cannot really feel the value

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.860
of another person
or their opinion.

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:45.300
We cannot really reinvent a
company if we can't access this

00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:51.700
creativity and cooperation
that brings about new things,

00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:57.500
and so I think the inner needs
to be understood as being

00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.710
inseparable from the outer.

00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:02.990
It's only in modernity
that we separate

01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:04.910
private life and
professional life.

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:06.680
Inner life and outer
life, they live

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.590
business and social service.

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:10.720
Spirituality and this.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.700
It's all one life, and
when we live that life

01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.370
in a unified way, then
it also brings to us

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:21.030
a unified satisfaction
and effectiveness

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:22.120
of impact in the world.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.619
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you, my friends.

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.970
And with that, Dr.
Ari and Walter.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:27.730
Thank you.
