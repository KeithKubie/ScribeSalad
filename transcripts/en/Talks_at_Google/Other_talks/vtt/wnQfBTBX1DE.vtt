00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:01.860
MALE SPEAKER: Hey.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.920
Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.420
Thank you for coming
to this talk today.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.470
My name is [? Chris. ?]

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.840
This is going to be a very
interesting talk about how we

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.220
can fix our transportation
crisis, which everybody knows

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.910
is getting worse and worse,
especially as the Bay Area

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.910
economy heats up and our G-buses
from San Francisco and

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.200
other places get slower
and slower.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.110
I'd like to start by thanking
the Google Green Team and

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.520
Talks at Google for helping to
organize and sponsor this.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.040
Without them, it wouldn't really
have been possible.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.510
And it also wouldn't have been
possible without several

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.890
people who did invaluable work
to help me promote and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.810
organize the talk and help to
bring you who are here today

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.340
to this room.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.150
So thank you very much
for all of that.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.250
Our speaker today is Stuart
Cohen, who is the executive

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.030
director of TransForm, which is
a local nonprofit based out

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.520
of Oakland that's been
there since 1997.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.800
And their mission is to help
promote and achieve better

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.100
transportation and land use
planning practices for all the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.540
communities and the government
in California through whatever

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.840
ways they can to help
achieve that.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.320
And he'll explain in this talk
a lot of the ways in which

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.770
TransForm has had some successes
in the past, what

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.180
the challenges are that remain,
and what can be done

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.580
in the future.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.790
Stuart is an amazing speaker,
as you'll see in a few

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.380
minutes, and also is proud
to be a Ashoka fellow.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.890
Ashoka is a social
entrepreneurship prize that's

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.450
offered every year that comes
with a certain amount of money

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
to help that social entrepreneur
achieve things.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.410
It started in India and now
has a lot of support,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.730
actually, from Sergey Brin and
his wife, who have a matching

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.410
gift every year.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.480
I'd like to help join you in a
round of applause for Stuart.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.080
And we'll hear about
transformation of

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.515
transportation.

00:01:58.515 --> 00:01:59.916
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:59.916 --> 00:02:01.166
STUART COHEN: Thanks.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.900
Well, thank you.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.060
And it's fabulous to be here.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.680
So I wanted to-- and this could
probably be a little

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.690
lower, I tend to scream--

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.020
I wanted to welcome you
all here today.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.700
In addition to some of the
Google staff, we do have some

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.340
elected officials who
showed up today.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.870
And I just wanted
to welcome them.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.575
We have the Mayor of Mountain
View is here, Mike Kasperzak.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.850
The Vice Mayor, Margaret
Abe-Koga is here.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.580
Tom Means and Tara
Martin-Milius, who's from

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.570
Sunnyvale, are also here.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.340
So wanted to just thank you for

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.530
welcoming us in the community.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.300
And I think they're here and
you're here, because we are in

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.200
a terrible crisis
in many ways.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.800
And it's a slow crisis.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.380
The talk was billed as a "how do
we solve the transportation

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.390
crisis," but I think, as you're
going to see, it's

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.120
about a lot more
than that, too.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.420
And I needed to get a
sub-heading for this talk, and

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.010
I think you'll see I did an AKA,
which I never do on my

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.690
presentations.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.350
But how do we create healthy,
affordable, low greenhouse gas

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.140
communities is, to me, the same
thing as, how do we solve

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.880
our transportation crisis?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.660
So just as background--

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.430
so I got into transportation
from the seat of a bicycle.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.390
I was given a bicycle.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.000
I was organizing against toxic
waste disposal in upstate New

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.410
York, given a bicycle
by my sister.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.640
I said, oh, I haven't been
on one of these in years.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.720
I just drive from community to
community in upstate New York,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.710
and then moved to New
York City for a job.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.620
And the place that should really
be the best place in

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.230
the world for commuting--

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.900
totally flat and everything's
within a few miles--

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.020
turned out to be one of the most
dangerous and harrowing

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.735
experiences, even though I did
it for three years straight,

00:04:13.735 --> 00:04:16.010
even through snowstorms.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.950
And so when I came out to
California, started

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.350
researching the problems,
working on, actually, 1994

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.080
climate issues, and going back
to grad school at Berkeley and

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.390
finishing in '97 with my dream
of thinking, how do we solve

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.910
this puzzle?

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.230
How do we change our
transportation system in a way

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.820
that actually becomes a servant
to the things we care

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.960
about, whether it's saving
the environment, helping

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.100
low-income folks get around,
creating great communities,

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.110
instead of the master that
has become of us.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.190
And so that's a little bit of
what my talk's going to be.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.950
I just wanted to get a
sense of this crowd,

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.660
though, real quickly.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.060
How many folks were able to
get here without use of a

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.810
private, single-occupant
vehicle today?

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.750
Just raise your hand if you
showed up that way.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.790
Yeah, which is right.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.250
So we've got a good cross
section of Googlers here,

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.380
because about half of the
Google community gets to

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.150
Mountain View without having
to drive alone, which is

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.610
unbelievably good for a Mountain
View campus like

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.250
this, much more similar to the
kind of rates that you would

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.060
see in downtown San Francisco.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.010
So I think there's a lot to
learn from folks at Google.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.350
But let's get going on
to the presentation.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.730
This is some of the most early
forms of transit, actually,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.240
mid-1850s and '60s.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.740
And what I'm going to do is
start with the breadth of

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.950
history and where the challenges
have taken us, go

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:55.400
into some of those solutions
that we hope to see taking

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.340
place, and then invite you to
help think through some of the

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.500
opportunities over the next one
to three years to really

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.240
have an impact on our
transportation system.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.590
This kind of transit here is
complemented by a street

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.690
system that you can see-- this
very early street system of

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.410
San Francisco--

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.420
that had everything really
close together.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.420
This is, in planner's circles,
known as a grid.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.050
This grid got kind of disrupted
as the World War II

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.610
veterans were coming back, and
they started building these

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.310
Levittowns--

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.740
first on Long Island, where I
grew up, and then, here's in

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.870
Pennsylvania--

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.530
which really separated people
from the other needs of their

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.580
life and pretty much
relied on cars.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.310
This was the first time, really,
communities were built

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.780
thinking you'd have to have
a car to get around.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:52.730
And what that ushered in was
this whole era when we thought

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.330
automobiles are going
to dominate how

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.570
people get around fully.

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.370
This was a plan for San
Francisco that was going to

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.240
crisscross it with
major freeways.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.160
And this is what it would have
looked like through much of

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.970
San Francisco.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.750
For those of you who are newer
to the region, you might enjoy

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.720
the Ferry Building with
the farmers market.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.580
And this is what it looked like
when I first came to the

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.690
Bay Area, before they
took down the

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.970
freeway after the quake.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.440
So anyway, what happened,
because of all of the land use

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.500
happening in this way that
relied on cars, is that

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.970
funding for things like public
transit declined as we needed

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.900
more money for roads.

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:35.100
And so even when we tried to
build public transit and have

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.800
people be able to get around,
it would turn out that if we

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.980
built too many of our-- either
shopping centers or, in this

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.830
case, the Cisco campus--
this way, you

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:48.690
actually can't get around.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.840
Over here, you'll see a
light rail station.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.850
Very, very few people use it,
because you get out and it's

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.380
kind of "which is my office
park" kind of feeling to it.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:07.510
And so that line, $400 million
gets about 4,000 riders a day.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.060
And so finally, they started
building homes further than

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.300
the Levittowns.

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.630
This is a sign from the Central
Valley, where some of

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:19.160
the best, prime farmland in this
world is getting plowed

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.140
under at an amazing rate for
these kind of garages for

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.140
folks to come in.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.960
Some of the impacts of this,
starting with social impacts--

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.690
we're driving, compared to 1969,
88% further just to shop

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:38.500
for the same quart of milk
and longer for errands.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.700
And I put this picture up here
because this is a new

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.770
three-screen vehicle where each
of these screens can show

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.430
different things to the
different crowds in the car.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.520
You see the little girl's almost
drooling out of the

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.500
side of her mouth as the
world goes by there.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.410
And that's how kids are growing
up these days--

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.270
totally don't know how to get
around their own town.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.050
And in the car review magazine,
they said that this

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.180
new three-screen set-up, where
they can watch cartoons in the

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.790
front but more sophisticated
movies in the back, is a boon

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.430
to parents.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:14.910
Because when you're waiting at
that drive-through, you won't

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:16.630
get those kids crying as much.

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:17.850
But here's the clicker.

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.010
They've got one of
these babies.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.910
The driver can control all three
screens at once with a

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.060
remote control, so the kids
don't have to figure that out.

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.700
Holy distracted driving,
right?

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.260
So there's real social
impacts.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:36.300
This is-- we see the obesity
epidemic following the same

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:39.950
lines as the growth
in driving.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:44.090
Diabetes, asthma from air
pollution, a lot of these are

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.890
growing tremendously, and a lot
of it related to lack of

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:49.810
physical activity, air pollution
from vehicles.

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.200
And in almost all of these
slides that you see, there is

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.100
a layer that the folks most
impacted are low-income,

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.300
typically people of color, who
have the least ability to

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:07.450
either move out of polluted
places or, for a variety of

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:10.820
other reasons, get the
worst of the impacts.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.120
So here's the thing, also, is
that we are now paying an

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.400
amazing amount of money out of
people's own pockets for

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.210
transportation.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.990
Here you can see, in this map,
the spread-out areas in dark

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:30.520
pay the most money for
transportation.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:33.490
Places along those red lines,
which is the high-transit,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:38.140
walkable communities, pay up to
60% less, because they're

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.970
able to own fewer vehicles.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.370
But again, here's a slide.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.140
The hardest hit are low-income
families.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:50.450
This is an amazing and shocking
statistic, but 31% of

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:53.790
the income in low-income
families right now, making

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:57.500
$20,000 to $30,000, go to
transportation, because so

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.050
many jobs are out of reach.

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:03.550
Around eight out of nine jobs
created during the '90s, you

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:06.690
needed a car to get to,
within half an hour.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:08.570
That's become part of it.

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.030
And here's something
that hopefully

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.990
people think about more.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.900
I know, over at Google,
is an important thing,

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.780
is the carbon impacts.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.560
38% of our global warming
emissions are now from

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.750
transportation.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:26.180
And I just got back from New
York yesterday and was able to

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.440
witness some of the devastation

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.700
from Superstorm Sandy.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:34.000
And it was really
unbelievable.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.881
And this was very much
what was predicted.

00:11:36.881 --> 00:11:40.530
The climate scientists, working
with others, had said,

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.720
get ready for these
storm surges.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.580
We don't know when they're
coming, but they're coming.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.020
You can see some of
the pictures.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.140
This is the subways flooding.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.850
This is the train tracks
being covered.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:56.140
This is my wife's hometown,
on the right,

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.750
devastated in the Rockaways.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.110
And this is some of the new
subway stations that they had

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.720
built downtown--

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.215
inundated, absolutely
inundated.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.140
And we can't blame this on
global warming, per se, but

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.850
this is one of my
favorite quotes.

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.320
It's a little bit like in
baseball, where you can't say

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.550
that any particular home run was
because of the steroids.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.000
But when somebody's hitting 20
and 30 more home runs than

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.280
they did a few years ago,
some of them are.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.300
And we're going to see the
frequency of these kind of

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.110
storms increase.

00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:36.640
Sea levels are already rising,
seven inches higher than they

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.160
were under the Golden Gate
Bridge a century ago.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.970
This is a little bit scary, but
this is going to be the

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.460
Bay Area with 16-inch
sea level rise,

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.550
which is going to happen.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:52.060
It's a matter, again, of
how quickly it happens.

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.270
This is a zooming-in.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.500
I thought folks might be
interested in what Mountain

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.250
View is going to be
looking like.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.140
And you could actually see
part of Moffett Field--

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.410
I won't go into it here--

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.870
and parts of this campus.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:09.130
The dark blue is the 55-inch sea
level rise without storm

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.380
surges' inundation.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:19.710
Going back and seeing this
happen to my wife's place that

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.880
she grew up in, where they
never thought about this,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.020
really brought home the fact
that we're going to be living

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:27.450
in a world with this.

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.640
So here is the good part,
before getting totally

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.370
depressed, is that we really
can do something about it.

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.640
Those same places that we're
paying a lot of money are also

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.660
emitting a lot of carbon
emissions.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:43.900
And so if we can grow in those
areas that are these lighter

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.650
colors, we can dramatically
reduce

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.620
the amount of emissions.

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.050
In fact, in terms of transit
use, folks that are living and

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:59.120
working near transit in the Bay
Area take it for 42% of

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.330
their work trips.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.370
Folks that live or work
more than half a mile

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.390
away take it for 4%.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.216
So there's a 10 times change if
we can grow differently and

00:14:07.216 --> 00:14:08.280
grow around transit.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.660
These are the Bay Area stats.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.100
There's a dramatic
difference in it.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:14.910
And here's the other good
news, is you're

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.700
not forced to live--

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.410
not that forcing somebody to
live in San Francisco is a bad

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.770
thing-- but you're not forced to
live in really urban areas.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:28.050
Some of these little yellow
dots that have--

00:14:28.050 --> 00:14:30.510
this is the town of Windsor.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.310
They've created this
wonderful downtown.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:36.740
It's north of Santa Rosa, in
that place where they are able

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.660
to bring together shops and
arts and crafts and now

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:42.410
they're bringing living
around it.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:44.620
They're dramatically reducing
the distance

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:46.570
people have to drive.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:50.830
So even in more rural areas, if
you grow smart, grow around

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.650
downtowns the way we used
to, we can have an

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:55.980
impact on all this.

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.260
And I wanted to put this
slide in, because

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.720
this is really important.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.210
This shows the amount of money
we are spending out of our own

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:10.300
pockets, collectively,
on transportation.

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:14.900
And if all of the neighborhoods
had the same

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.160
level of public transit access
as those ones in yellow, as

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.440
those really low ones with
good transit access--

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.920
in the Bay Area, we would be
spending $10 billion less a

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.270
year on transportation out of
our pockets and emitting 42%

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.770
less greenhouse gas emissions.

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:34.720
And so when we think of how we
can find money to fix the

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.320
system, the money's actually
in our pockets.

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:44.000
And we have to think of how we
spend money smarter to do it.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.540
I just wanted to frame that as
some of the issues and the

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:52.590
problems with transportation,
and get on to a little bit of

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:58.670
what TransForm has done, and
then get into the current day.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:06.720
So when we started in '97, we
came into a system that was

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.690
caught up in that
self-fulfilling prophecy of

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.510
sprawl that I showed.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.960
We actually projected--

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.030
these dots here are the
projections for housing units

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:19.090
in the Bay Area in 1997.

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:22.620
We thought that most of the
housing was going to be going

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.900
to those dark red areas, the
dark blue areas-- high-cost,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.310
high-emission areas.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:34.380
And we knew what that
would bring.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.880
We knew that if you put highways
to it-- and a lot of

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.290
money was going to be going
to highways to feed it--

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.500
they were going to be clogged,
costs were going to be high,

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.690
and we were going to be having
an increase in congestion of

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.400
about 800% on some of
our roads, because

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:50.910
people had no choices.

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:52.670
We said, this is lunacy.

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.790
But the transportation
agency--

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.890
MTC, it's our regional agency--
said, well, this is

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.090
what we have to do.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:00.610
This is where the growth's going
to come, and so we've

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:01.860
got to feed this growth.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.560
And so we said, what we need to
do is we need a new vision

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.569
of how this region can grow.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:14.430
But we need, all at once, to
say, how about if we put the

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.099
growth somewhere else and
then fed it with a new

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:20.680
transportation system, one that
reinvested in choices--

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.130
walking, biking, transit--

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:24.180
and were realistic.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.940
And I think this is before
we had the vision of how

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.829
technology can really help.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:30.890
Also, again, it was '97.

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:32.770
So these were three of the
main things that our

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:35.660
organization started
doing at that time.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:39.110
And we convinced our agencies
that this was lunacy to keep

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.460
planning in this way.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.060
And we did the first
regional visioning

00:17:42.060 --> 00:17:43.800
project in the country.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:46.730
And they came up with a vision
that looked like this-- that

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.250
said, OK, yeah, let's grow
around walkable downtowns,

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.800
weather it's Mountain View or
even out in the suburban and

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.870
rural areas.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.560
Let's plan to grow around
the walkable downtowns.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.160
And even though that's not where
the growth is planned

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.450
now, let's create incentives
to make that happen.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.470
Let's give money for walking and
biking in those downtowns

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:06.650
to make it attractive again.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.410
So we created consensus on a lot
of these solutions amongst

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:12.140
a lot of nonprofits.

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.270
We kind of got it
into the media.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.230
And then we put it into action
by going out into county sales

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.360
taxes or bridge tolls
and other ways.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.310
And where there was money to
be found, where they were

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:25.660
going to be raising new money,
we inserted our voices.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.580
This was a failed
measure in '98--

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.830
it was when we were just
coming on the scene--

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.160
that kind of had too
much money for

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.900
highways in Alameda County.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.960
So we put together a coalition
that would have dueling

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.730
transit plans.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:45.210
We said, if you support
a livable agenda, an

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:48.280
environmental agenda, folks
that opposed you last time

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.880
will all come on, and we will
agree to support it.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.890
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:53.910
We had a protest.

00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:55.630
We had to get outside
their doors.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.440
On this one, they locked us out,
actually-- there were so

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.630
many of us--

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.820
out of their meeting.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.080
But this is some low-income
folks from this group, BOSS,

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.250
talking with the Sierra Club
leader behind him, really

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.180
getting folks to
agree together.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:14.440
They finally agreed that if we
can work together, fight for

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.510
the same stuff, and get things
that support both equity and

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:20.360
the environment, we would
get behind it.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:22.870
When we announced our support
for it, four out of the five

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.820
county supervisors in Alameda
County said, wow, if you guys

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.560
are all supporting it, we'll
all get behind it.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.680
And the papers covered it.

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.820
And from something that failed
with 58% of the vote in '98--

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:40.640
when the voters saw consensus,
supported what to them looked

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.400
pretty similar, but saw that
all of these groups were

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.930
supporting, it got
81% in 2000.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.780
And so we did a very similar
thing on a lot of measures,

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.310
including in Santa Clara County,
to help build support

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.520
for a bridge toll increase
to fund public

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.480
transit across the bridges.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.790
And so in those years up to
2004, we got a lot of funding

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.420
for transit expansion.

00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.950
In fact, we kind of turned on
its head the old "let's spend

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:08.820
the money on roads because
there's such traffic" to say,

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.520
no, let's spend the money
on alternatives.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:14.850
And 75% of the funding during
this time went for transit

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:19.150
expansion and almost the same
time for bike ped and smart

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.320
growth, as for highways.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.440
There became this plan for
transit expansion in the area.

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.610
And then we said, wow, we better
grow smart around this.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:31.900
We can't just put old parking
lots around all this transit.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.420
So TransForm, working with
a number of foundations,

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.430
including some members here
from the Silicon Valley

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:42.200
Community Foundation, said,
let's help engage communities,

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:45.630
decide what the community should
look like as they grow.

00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:48.640
And as they change, everybody
can envision something else

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.390
they'd want, whether it's
parks or a branch

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.850
library as we grow.

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:55.280
And we helped people to
realize, through some

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.630
transformations that
you'll see, that

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:58.360
people are not the problem.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.840
If you want to bring 60 people
into your town, this is what

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:05.010
they look like.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:07.860
They don't have to
look like this.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.230
And it's when they look like
this that you want to reject

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.010
them and get them the hell out
of there, because they're

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.420
going to make parking hard,
they're going to make traffic.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.460
But if you can get them onto
transit, they look like that.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:21.820
If you get them onto bikes and
walking, they look like that.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:23.130
So people are nice.

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:24.380
People like people, generally.

00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:29.900
But it's when they come with all
of those cars-- so then,

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:31.480
how do we figure out
how to get them

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.090
there without the cars?

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:36.620
Well, one thing that we care
about is making sure that when

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.870
we do figure out how to grow
in these great places, and

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.350
they become nicer and nicer--
like we have many towns along

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.990
the peninsula are--

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.410
is that they stay available for
all folks, including the

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.990
lower-income folks who are
already there, and that we're

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.990
coming up with places and
policies that can have them

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.400
live there.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.590
Here, we're identifying infill
parcels for dedicated

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:56.410
affordable housing.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.090
And we did this in a lot of
places that we go and plan.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:04.140
And then we bring folks along
with visualizations.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.080
How can your place look
if we grow smart?

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.510
And how do you reduce traffic?

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:15.000
Who here, when you were younger,
or even now, read "A

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.840
Wrinkle In Time?"
Raise your hand.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:17.720
Come on, don't be embarrassed.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:19.070
It's a great book.

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.560
Great.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.040
At least half the
crowd, again.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.650
Not all the same folks as took
transit, though, this morning.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:28.790
So a "Wrinkle In Time," one of
my favorite books, said--

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:34.505
the shortest distance between
two lines, what is it?

00:22:34.505 --> 00:22:36.376
And the protagonist said,
well, I don't know.

00:22:36.376 --> 00:22:37.320
It's a straight line.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.640
You go a straight line,
it's the fastest.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:44.050
And the prophet said, no, it's
bringing those lines together.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:47.700
Transportation planning should
be about that, right?

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.370
So this is downtown
San Leandro.

00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.720
That's what it looks
like today.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.390
We said, how about if you bring
more of the things that

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.340
are spread out today together
so that people actually can

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.300
just walk between places?

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:03.210
And what if it starts
to look like this?

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.460
Suddenly, they say, oh, I'd
really like to come to

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.510
downtown if it looked
like that.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:07.280
I never go to downtown.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.030
I just go to the mall now.

00:23:09.030 --> 00:23:11.100
They didn't notice the
seven-story buildings that

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.860
went in, because there
are trees.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.140
And in fact, they don't care,
because it looks like a better

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.970
place to be.

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.060
And the folks that were still
skeptical said, well, what

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.210
about this affordable housing?

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:24.000
Aren't those criminals that
you're going to bring to our

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.070
town and ex-cons?

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.750
And I'm like, well actually,
it's the teachers that are

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:30.280
teaching your kid, it's the
nurse that just helped save

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.920
your life is the affordable
housing, and took them on

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.310
tours if they're rejecting.

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.400
And we did all these different
kind of tools.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:43.220
And what we found was that
folks really started to

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.000
support these plans for bringing
these downtowns to

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.020
life, saving the open space,
and bring it here.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:54.540
So real quickly now, this gets
to where I'm going to

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:57.020
hopefully engage you a little
bit in thinking about how we

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.790
can make a future that's better,
because that kind of

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:03.370
brought us up to some of
our current activities.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:05.200
So we've got lots of
transit coming in.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:08.370
We've got some great plans
for downtowns, more being

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:11.500
made all the time.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.050
And there's a new California
dream happening.

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.060
And California captures
the imagination

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:18.840
of the United States.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.440
It captures the imagination of
the world, especially with

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.560
what's happening in
Silicon Valley.

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.020
And when you look at what the
dream is, it's really not to

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:32.140
move out to my parents' house
in suburban Long Island near

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.180
the Green Acres Mall.

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:37.560
It's to be in a place where
you can get out and walk

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.540
around, get the kids in a
stroller, and be near parks.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:46.670
And in fact, 64%, in a recent
survey, said that they'd

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:50.940
prefer that kind of urban or
semi-urban to a long commute.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.660
Here's the thing.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:53.580
It's really hard to
build this infill.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:55.900
Just ask you mayor here.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.190
It's really hard to build and
get approvals for these

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:00.400
things, in part because
we're planning for too

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.630
many cars for them.

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.820
So this shows you just what the
demand is expected to be

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.410
here for transit just in the
four largest metro areas in

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:10.820
California.

00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:15.320
The demand is expected to be
almost 10 million units to

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:16.330
live near transit.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.710
It's where folks coming out of
college want to be, it's where

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:23.240
folks finishing their work lives
want to be, and a lot of

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.430
us in between.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.710
The blue bar is the supply.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:30.030
We've got to figure out how
we're going to build this red

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:33.400
bar here if we want to meet
that supply in a way that

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.880
means we can live in
affordable, low

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.360
greenhouse gas places.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.000
So how are we going to do it?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.330
Well, I'm going to start with
the story of Rosie.

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.170
And this is not how we do it.

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:46.810
So Rosie came to work
with us this year.

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.795
She helps run our Safe Routes
to Schools Program.

00:25:50.795 --> 00:25:53.540
She helps kids figure out
how to get to school.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.960
She's had to bring these bikes
into her apartment.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.330
She also has pretty damn high
rent in the Jack London Square

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.300
District of Oakland.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.810
Now, why are her bikes stuck
in her apartment in very

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.330
scarce space?

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:10.260
Well, she's got two
parking spaces--

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:14.000
came with her rent-- but
she has no cars.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.690
She started leaving them
in her parking spaces.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.530
Building said, sorry, you can't
leave your bikes here.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:20.950
This is for cars.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:24.230
And so she's paying what's the
equivalent of $80,000 in

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:28.720
construction costs, what's
equivalent to at least $100 of

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.730
her rent, and she can't even
leave her bikes there.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:36.880
And we're planning that kind of
community for a lot of our

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:37.620
downtown, still.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.740
This is recently-built
Jack London Square.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.240
Even if you wanted to build a
senior unit in a lot of these

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.630
places, you'd have to
buy two spaces.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.220
So this is pretty fascinating
stuff.

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.830
If you took an eight-acre lot
and put that zoning code--

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:56.090
see, there are these zoning
codes that each city has--

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.700
and says, you've got to build
those 2.2 spaces, even if that

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.590
person doesn't want it.

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:03.670
And 8 out of the 14 cities down
here have this kind of,

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:06.500
you have to build at least to
code, because they think that

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.180
we were importing the suburbs
into our downtowns.

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:11.880
Here are some of the stats
that you would have.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.870
You'd build to fit 800 units
on that eight acres.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.270
But really, just because you're
near transit, building

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.860
high-density, you
only need 1.1.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.460
Hell, Rosie doesn't have any.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.980
You'd still have to build a
parking structure, though,

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:28.170
that would be expensive
for that 1.1.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.630
But you'd be able to
build a lot less.

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:34.560
As you see, you'd be able to
save $12 million by building a

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.510
smaller structure, build
162 more units.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.980
But now let's say you give out
free or discount transit

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:42.560
passes with each of the units.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.910
You put CarShare in there so
people really can have just

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:46.860
one or zero cars.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.170
You unbundle the parking, so
hey, if you don't want to use

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.620
it, you don't have
to pay for it.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:54.010
And only when you need a
spot do you pay for it.

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:55.960
Your need goes down even more,
because that'll get more

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.710
people not to own cars.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:05.290
And now you can pay $6 million
for those transit passes.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:06.830
And we do this with VTA.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:09.110
We kind of, through our
GreenTRIP certification

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.400
program, folks that are doing
this and giving out the free

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:13.240
transit, we say,
this is great.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.570
They buy it for everybody
in the building.

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.690
They get a great discount.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.800
And with that saving they're
getting from such a smaller

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:21.860
parking spot, they're able
to build more units

00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:22.660
and have less parking.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:24.160
And this green that you
can see means they

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.990
have a nicer building.

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:28.470
Instead of those big parking
lots, they've got storefronts.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.160
They've got more units.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.040
So that's part of
the solution.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:34.630
So we go and we certify these
kind of buildings.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:38.880
We show the community why they
get so many reductions.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.840
We give out to the mayors and
others these certificates.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:44.310
We get applause from
the community.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.950
People understand there's low
greenhouse gas communities.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:51.150
Here's one in San Jose, another
one in Berkeley.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.960
And the impact of our pilot
project of these, we got five

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.590
of these developments built
that you give out transit

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.510
passes or have CarShare.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.770
And the impact was amazing.

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:03.300
These five buildings--

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.200
some of them are under
construction now--

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.325
instead of putting money into
parking spaces that don't get

00:29:09.325 --> 00:29:11.230
used, they're going to literally
be handing money to

00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:15.000
transit agencies saying,
provide folks with--

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.960
here's their transit passes.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.720
They're going to be driving
about 60% less, and folks are

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.520
going to be saving a huge amount
of money that they can

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.680
spend in the local community.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:28.520
They can give to this kid's
local PTA, which is what we're

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.410
doing with some of our savings
that we're doing in my family.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:33.770
How can we bring
this to scale?

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:37.510
How can we do billions for
transit agencies, millions of

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:40.020
fewer miles, and billions
of savings?

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.780
This is going to be a question
I have for you soon is, how

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:44.460
can Google folks
help with this?

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.790
One idea that we have, that
we're trying to advance, is

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:52.990
instead of having that
information be really hard to

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.760
get in technical--

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.740
Ann, do you want to stand
up for a second?

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.780
Ann Cheng goes out, works with
staff, and figures out these

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:01.230
numbers one by one.

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:05.760
How about, instead of that kind
of one-on-one consulting

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.820
that's so arduous, if we took
all the information that's in

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.330
Google Maps, Google Transit,
Walk Score, all these other

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.325
places that we can grab
information from, and automate

00:30:15.325 --> 00:30:18.900
it so that folks would know,
on a given parcel, how much

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.970
parking's really needed.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:26.300
If they can then go and say,
hey, what happens if we have

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.270
these toggles and we say, let's
give out transit passes,

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:30.630
let's do these other things.

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:31.860
And they can watch.

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.430
Developers can watch, community
members can watch.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:39.180
They can watch as the amount
of miles would go down.

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.340
As you're doing these smarter
things, providing affordable

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.450
homes, the amount of
miles goes down.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.050
So instead of fighting
affordable housing in your

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:46.880
community, you'd say, oh yeah,
this is actually a low

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.640
traffic, low greenhouse
gas strategy.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.930
Giving out transit passes--
it sounds expensive--

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:56.090
but, oh I see, I'm saving
millions on parking.

00:30:56.090 --> 00:31:00.010
So I could afford it
as a developer.

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.150
And in fact, cities could then
adopt this as a code.

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:04.520
Just say, oh, as long as they're
doing all of these

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.110
things, they can have
the reduced parking.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:07.440
We won't make them
build those 2.2.

00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:17.220
So what are some of the ideas
that you may have about how to

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.470
make this possible?

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:26.230
We think that this can
dramatically change how people

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.790
do it, and especially then if we
can figure out how to show

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.760
them these secondary benefits.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:35.260
But what does this do
to our climate?

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:39.750
What does this do to things
like transit revenue?

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.200
So anyways, that's one of the
things we'd love to have folks

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.840
think about with us,
is how to do that.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.160
But here is one that'll hit
home for many of you.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.890
We've got a lot of
Google buses.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:56.700
In fact, if you look at this
map on the right, somebody

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.870
took the liberty of mapping out
all of the Silicon Valley

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.360
private transit that happens.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.140
Guess which one is the big,
yellow, gold one?

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.180
Those are the Google buses.

00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.430
And the other ones are some
of the other companies.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.280
Does somebody want to scream
out, who's on one of these

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.740
from San Francisco, how much
longer is it taking this year

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.800
than, say, two years ago?

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.290
OK, you raised your hand for--
just, you're on it.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.420
But how much longer is
the trip sitting in

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.370
traffic these days?

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.194
AUDIENCE: I haven't
been here long.

00:32:23.194 --> 00:32:25.216
STUART COHEN: OK, who's
been here a while?

00:32:25.216 --> 00:32:27.944
AUDIENCE: So if I go home at
8:00 PM, it takes about 40

00:32:27.944 --> 00:32:28.688
minutes on the bus.

00:32:28.688 --> 00:32:31.664
This morning, coming in,
it took 70 minutes.

00:32:31.664 --> 00:32:33.020
STUART COHEN: OK.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:35.330
Half an hour of traffic delay.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:37.520
And that's getting
more typical.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.840
And that's going to grow.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.530
I hate to say it--that's
going to grow.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:42.990
It's going to make living in San
Francisco, at some point,

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.290
kind of hellish, to be honest.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:48.510
Because even with Wi-Fi on the
bus, you really don't want to

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:52.460
be spending three hours
on it every day.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:56.880
And so you're waiting there on
the corner, and this is 101.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.130
This [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:01.180
And as the economy picks up,
this is going to be happening.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.420
That's just because of
an economy pick-up.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.250
That's not even with growth.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.640
As we have growth, it's going to
be getting worse and worse.

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:10.340
There's the potential
to change this.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.110
But because of kind of
stuck-in-the-box thinking and

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:18.380
policies, we may not be able to
unless we can all harness

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:21.980
our innovation and advocacy
to make a change.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.930
Let me tell you what that
is real quickly.

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.680
There's something called carpool
lanes that have extra

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:31.520
space in them.

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:34.090
They've started to, in places,
say, you can come in here as a

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.620
solo driver with a toll.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:41.030
And you could pay your way in.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.860
So they're studying that
in the Bay Area.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.470
You could see that the purple
lines are places that had

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:50.430
carpool lanes or are
building them soon.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.290
Green is where there
aren't any.

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:55.825
And they're thinking, OK, let's
get some money to do it.

00:33:55.825 --> 00:33:57.080
This is in San Mateo County.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:01.590
And so we've got Google
around here.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:07.440
And the amazing thing is,
though, you think--

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.900
well, let me just go up one.

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.030
If this is what it's going to
look like, why can't we just

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:16.900
take a lane?

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.949
Why don't we just take
one of these lanes?

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:19.914
These all have--

00:34:19.914 --> 00:34:21.500
guess how many people
sit in each one of

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.739
these cars on average?

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:24.349
I mean, if you could divide
people into fractions.

00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:25.519
AUDIENCE: 1.57

00:34:25.519 --> 00:34:26.420
STUART COHEN: Yeah.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.510
So 1.57.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.340
Somebody really goddamn knows
their stats here.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:31.030
That was very impressive.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.590
He's a plant.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:32.290
Somebody planted him.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:34.380
AUDIENCE: That's the national
average for urban

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.060
commuting, as well.

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:36.010
STUART COHEN: Yeah.

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:39.780
And for commutes in the Bay
Area to work, it's 1.2.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:41.179
That's kind of the average,
because that includes the

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:43.239
school commutes.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:44.719
So 1.2.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:47.570
And so you've got a Google
bus and other buses--

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:51.880
40, 50 folks sitting
behind that 1.2

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.650
person in front of you.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.620
And each person gets
it much worse.

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.950
With each 10% increase, once
it's like this, of cars in the

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:01.560
road, it's a 40% increase in
delay, because they have to

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.660
slow down that much as
things get closer.

00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:10.130
So why can't we just take this
lane and just say, as long as

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:11.930
we have more efficiency
in it--

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.750
if we're carrying, on average,
10 people per car-- instead of

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:18.320
2,000 people per hour, if we're
carrying 5,000 people,

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.650
let's just take it.

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:20.980
And you know why you can't?

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:21.634
I bet you know.

00:35:21.634 --> 00:35:23.545
AUDIENCE: It's a lot
of complex reasons.

00:35:23.545 --> 00:35:25.680
STUART COHEN: A lot of complex
reasons is right!

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.600
This guy knows everything.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.070
But the most core reason is that
Caltrans had a really bad

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:35.520
experience over 30 years ago
in Los Angeles where they

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:40.360
tried to do a conversion of a
lane into a carpool lane.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.390
There wasn't enough traffic on
it, and so it caused more

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.340
traffic in the lanes
next to it.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.360
Of course, now it's different.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.030
We've got technology.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.890
We can let folks
in for a toll.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:51.340
We can fill up that lane to make
sure we don't do it and

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.300
so it doesn't congest
the ones next to it.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:56.540
And if you took 5,000 or 6,000
or 7,000 people and put it on

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.280
that lane, they'd all be
going faster, too.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.470
So in this particular situation,
you're in luck if

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:06.270
you'd like to do a little
thinking with us, because next

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.070
year this is going to
be under study.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.350
It's going to be one of the
first ones where Caltrans may

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:14.730
let us even study taking
a lane and

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:17.840
making it more efficient.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:22.250
They can't conceptualize
San Francisco.

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:25.660
So that's the next piece of
advocacy is letting them think

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:29.020
through even the concept of
letting one of these HOT lanes

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.080
in San Francisco.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:35.410
If you're interested in making
sure that that gets studied

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.840
and that we don't have to wait
to build a new lane-- because

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.020
that would be billions of
dollars and about 20 years

00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.170
away before we could actually
build a lane down this whole

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.910
section, and let alone
in San Francisco--

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:46.740
then just make sure you sign
up with us afterward.

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.290
We want to have a study group
that gets them to make sure

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.280
they have a great alternative
there.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.720
And then-- actually,
let me go back.

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.430
The other thing I want
them to re-think--

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.550
you see these little green
things on the end?

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:58.050
These tails?

00:36:58.050 --> 00:37:02.970
They want to put big highways
out to the end of our region.

00:37:02.970 --> 00:37:03.570
I guess right here.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.030
I forgot there's one
behind me, too.

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:10.160
They want to bring in-- expand
all the way down to San Benito

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:13.640
and out to San Joaquin County--
they want to expand

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.560
it so that there's eight lanes
of highway lanes coming in

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:18.810
from currently four.

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:19.880
Now, what happens?

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.410
It's kind of like this
sink is full already.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.800
Total congestion.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:25.480
This sink is full.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.240
What happens when you turn
on a new faucet?

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:31.280
Well, why would we want to
promote more housing in San

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.550
Benito for jobs here and
all of those folks

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:35.880
coming in by car?

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.770
So we would like to get the
notion across that we've got

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.500
to cap highway expansion,
especially

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.970
out to other regions.

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:44.130
But we can't do that
if people are going

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.170
to be stuck in traffic.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:47.160
And that's where another
Google project

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.170
potentially comes in.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:53.230
So this is something that's
relatively new, of course--

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.070
thinking about this at Google--
but is making pretty

00:37:55.070 --> 00:37:58.000
fast advances.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.400
I'm trying to remember--
it's not Scrabble.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:01.270
I can't figure out-- anybody
know what game that is?

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:02.740
AUDIENCE: Dominos.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:03.690
STUART COHEN: Oh, OK.

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:03.780
Good.

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.030
Thank you.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.070
So this is becoming a bit more
of a reality, right?

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:13.450
It's not quite as cheesy as
this, but this is becoming

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:14.310
more of a reality.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.530
Hundreds of thousands of miles
logged on this stuff.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:21.750
And this is Volvo testing
it out in Europe.

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:25.960
But if we had vehicles like
this, we certainly wouldn't

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.740
need the highway expansion
that's in there going all the

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.700
way to San Benito County.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:32.910
And since they don't think
they're going to have the

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.790
money for that for 20, 25
years when this kind of

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:39.640
long-term future may become
a reality, why are we

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.800
planning them out?

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:44.390
And why are we saying we have
a need for over $100 billion

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:48.960
of new highway expansion money
when our state is going broke?

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.730
So that's just a thought to
leave you with as I just go on

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:57.800
to one or two more topics
real quickly now.

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.370
What is long-distance travel?

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.900
I think some of you might know
where this is going.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:05.010
Our state is growing to
50 million pretty

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:06.840
soon from 38 million.

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:10.130
It's going to go up to 60
million at some point.

00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:12.630
And if you thought it's getting
hard to travel--

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:17.050
a lot of emissions now--
just wait until then.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:22.100
So some of you might have heard
about this fast train,

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:25.290
220 miles an hour.

00:39:25.290 --> 00:39:27.330
And it would go--

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.700
it is actually starting
construction next year on the

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.260
slow part of this train.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:34.456
I'm not going to go into
details, but happy to talk to

00:39:34.456 --> 00:39:35.670
you afterwards about it--

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.610
to start a little
segment here.

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:40.110
But by 2022, there might
be a fast train

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:41.690
connecting this segment.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.350
And by 2030, all the way--

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.830
San Francisco, Los Angeles.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.860
But we don't have the
money for it.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.650
That's probably the biggest
problem with this.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:54.060
There needs to be some better
planning for it, too.

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.090
We'll be the first
to admit it.

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:56.240
And you can go look
up our website.

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.330
We've got a long report on how
they can do it better.

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:02.800
But if we can get it right, it's
not just a fast way to

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:04.370
get to Los Angeles.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:09.520
It would connect our 24
largest city centers.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.860
And instead of these airport
economies that you see, we

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.590
would help to revitalize our
downtowns, especially in the

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:19.280
Central Valley, as we grow
to that 60 million.

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:23.100
When BART came out, and it had
120,000 people riding it,

00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:25.080
people said, this was
a waste of money.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.500
And now, as it's exploding at
the seams with 350,000 riders

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.320
and heading higher, people
are saying we

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.150
don't have enough BART.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.790
And I think it would be
the same thing here.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:37.370
This is $60 billion more
needed, less than

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:38.480
that highway proposal.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.800
So I think, in part, we're
just getting where we're

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.580
putting our money wrong.

00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.210
And we might have a place
to get some of

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.210
the money for this.

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:51.500
So here's my favorite
picture in my job

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.910
here is our old governor.

00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:00.420
An unlikely hero.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.910
He plays funny characters.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:05.710
I think he's in another movie
again playing a sheriff soon.

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:08.720
But he's an unlikely
hero for us.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.790
But actually, one of his
lasting legacies--

00:41:13.730 --> 00:41:15.830
OK, besides the plant in the
front, who knows what's

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:19.010
happening tomorrow that
is going to be pretty

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:21.440
groundbreaking, putting
California in the news again?

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:23.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:24.560
STUART COHEN: What's that?

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.472
AUDIENCE: The auction.

00:41:25.472 --> 00:41:26.045
STUART COHEN: Yeah.

00:41:26.045 --> 00:41:27.280
There's a cap-and-trade
auction.

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.610
We are going to start selling
the right to emit greenhouse

00:41:31.610 --> 00:41:35.250
gases in the state to industrial
polluters, and

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:38.480
they're going to be having some
allowances, selling off

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.170
some of those rights.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:43.930
In 2015, the gasoline
refiner is going to

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:45.310
have to do that, also.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:47.320
We're probably going to be
raising somewhere $4 billion

00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:51.610
or $5 billion a year just from
transportation fuels to give

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:54.330
those folks the right to emit.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:58.110
My organization, TransForm, has
a proposal that would help

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:01.170
to spend a lot of that
money on transit--

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.620
walk, bike, ped-- to
make some of these

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.800
features we saw a reality.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.310
Because what we saw is--

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:07.270
remember how much we saw people
can save just in the

00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:11.430
Bay Area? $10 billion a year,
$30 billion across the state

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:15.080
annually if we all have
more choices.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:19.130
If we could take some of that
money and document those

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:22.740
savings, as opposed to just
giving them to transit and not

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.680
documenting it, I think we can
build support for this program

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:28.200
before it goes under politically
and because it

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.190
ends in 2020.

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.020
That was all they had the
politics to pull off.

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:36.920
And if we can do that, Governor
Schwarzenegger really

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:39.260
may have helped to save the
planet, because a lot of

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.170
people are looking at what
California does.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:45.490
So another thing we'd love for
your innovation to help with,

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:48.920
is how we map out what is
happening with this

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.100
cap-and-trade money, with this
greenhouse gas money on the

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.240
transportation sector so
people actually see the

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.980
benefits, and we're able to
quantify the financial

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.890
benefits for it and build
that support.

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:02.430
Couple-- a few slides I'll just
show, and then we could

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:03.800
have some conversation.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:07.410
Once you get to your places on
high-speed rail, how do we

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:10.820
make our local buses quicker?

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.360
One option is for bus rapid
transit, which is to give

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:15.270
dedicated lanes to buses.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:17.280
This is on El Camino.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.760
It does squeeze down,
sometimes,

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:19.730
some of the car lanes.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:23.700
But there's lots of flexible
ways that we can have it.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.710
Buses are only getting more
expensive to operate as we get

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:30.690
more and more traffic
on our urban roads.

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:33.730
How do we get the next
generation doing this?

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:36.660
Well, this is one of my
favorite programs.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.590
It started in Marin County
12 years ago.

00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:41.290
And then we helped to start
one of the first urban

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:44.370
programs at TransForm
in Oakland.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:48.910
And we're now at 90 schools and
teach kids how to walk and

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:49.780
bike to school safely.

00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:53.390
A lot of the parents don't know
how to do this anymore.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:56.450
I put my kid through the
training, because I was scared

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:59.060
to hell of having my 10-year-old
on the street.

00:43:59.060 --> 00:44:00.690
Even though she'd go with me,
I was scared to hell to have

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:01.680
her go alone.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.300
And so I have the pros do the
training, have contests,

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.150
encouragement, make more bike
lanes to the schools.

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:11.760
We got a great program going,
convinced our regional agency,

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.920
MTC, that this should be part
of a climate program.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.310
20% of the trips in
the mornings are

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:18.320
getting kids to school.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.030
It's absurd.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.790
We're filling up our skies with
pollution and making the

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:25.320
streets more dangerous just
to get kids to school.

00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.440
We convinced them to have
it be a climate program.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.120
It's now in all nine counties
of the Bay Area, and it's

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.590
really starting to spread
across the country.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:33.620
It's a fabulous program.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.160
The other thing that's great
about it is once kids are

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:39.050
trained in how to do
this, they get to

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:40.080
do it in other areas.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.130
And I just want to close with
a really fun thing that

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:44.740
happened four days ago.

00:44:44.740 --> 00:44:47.760
I was in Washington
with my family.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:50.760
And my wife and kids
were there first.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.000
And they had taken taxis around,
the day before, from

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.140
museum to monument--

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.920
a day of taxis.

00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:57.690
Nice.

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:01.670
Supporting the local taxi
industry, but also filling the

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:03.340
skies with pollution.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.320
And passing this--

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.160
it's a bike share enabled with
innovation and technology,

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.450
because you just do it all
swiping credit cards.

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:14.380
They've got 150 stations now
where you can go and get bikes

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:16.070
throughout Washington.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:18.970
You can sign up for
a day or a year.

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.530
My kids said, dad,
can't we do this?

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:22.720
We're sick of being strapped
into taxis.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:26.620
It was our way to get
around Washington.

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:30.960
There's my little [? Shira ?]
begging, saying, come on.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.740
And I was like, ah, we
don't have helmets.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:36.010
Mostly we're going to be
biking on the mall.

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:38.550
And so sure enough, we
rented them out.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:40.350
Just swipe a little credit card,
and you just take them

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:42.030
out of the machine.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:45.590
Mostly stayed on the mall,
on these wide sidewalks.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.240
You get to your destination.

00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.630
This was to the Holocaust
Museum.

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:49.630
You just find a bike rack.

00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:52.020
You just snap it back in,
and you walk away.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.370
It knows which bike
you brought in.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:55.240
It knows how long
you had it out.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.540
As long as it's under half an
hour, there's no extra charge.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:03.990
And then I separated
from my wife.

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.650
She stayed there.

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:08.470
We went to New York and met
her back last night in

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:09.640
California.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.890
And the kids said, how was
the rest of your trip?

00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.820
And she said, great.

00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:16.680
And their first question
wasn't, how was

00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:18.030
it seeing your friends?

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:20.080
How were the other museums
that you went to?

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.600
They said, did you take
out the bikes again?

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.260
That was what they remembered
from this.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.420
They went to the White House.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.270
They went to the Washington
Monument.

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.700
This is what really inspired
them about the trip to

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.270
Washington.

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:35.380
And kids are sick of being
strapped into the backseat.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:40.080
And what they're finding now is
that in the last 10 years,

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:44.780
kids 18 to 24 are driving 25%
less, delaying getting their

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:48.950
licenses, more attached to
their smart phones than

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:50.700
identifying with a car.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:55.990
And we have this chance to
use the innovation that's

00:46:55.990 --> 00:47:01.430
happening here, to use a lot of
the technology, and to mix

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:05.230
it with some of this advocacy
to disrupt systems.

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:10.070
The same disruption that I saw
in New York with Sandy and the

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:14.060
same disruption we're seeing to
communities, We can change

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.740
it and go back, and instead of
these highway plans, go to

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.150
high-speed rail--

00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:20.440
done right, of course.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.150
We can get kids to be much
more focused on this.

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:25.680
And we're helping to
bring BikeShare--

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.620
that same climate program that
we advocated for is going to

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:32.380
bring bike sharing to Mountain
View next year.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.520
It's going to be along
the Caltrain line.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:37.950
And I think, hey, New York
is going to have it.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:40.420
It's going to be called Citi
Bike, because Citibank is

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:42.770
going to sponsor it.

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:43.950
I would love to see
Mountain View and

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:45.924
beyond have Google Bike.

00:47:45.924 --> 00:47:46.808
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:46.808 --> 00:47:49.295
STUART COHEN: Well, you guys
have it for yourself.

00:47:49.295 --> 00:47:53.250
I'm going to go grab
one of these below.

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:55.420
But how about having
it for others, too?

00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:00.200
Anyway, I do think that we are
on the cusp of really being

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.700
able to make a new one--

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.670
things like Zipcar,
RelayRides.

00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:09.660
There's just so much we can
do with technology to do a

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.460
great-- actually, just even
showing this, with car

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.830
sharing, we can have
it be all around.

00:48:14.830 --> 00:48:16.230
Just go get your
neighbor's car.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.010
There's just so many
things we can do.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:21.710
So I just wanted to
end it there.

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:26.730
I know it was a lot of
information very fast, but

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:28.890
it's really--

00:48:28.890 --> 00:48:33.850
I think if we can get some of
your folks who are already

00:48:33.850 --> 00:48:37.700
with Google Transit, having
its own disruptive and

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.650
wonderful influence on folks
there, can be a very big

00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:45.480
impact on how we grow.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:47.770
Yeah.

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:51.710
So why don't we open it
up for questions.

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:55.170
AUDIENCE: So the project
of the fast train to

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:56.560
LA is really awesome.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.110
And my friend was to China and
their trains cover Beijing to

00:49:00.110 --> 00:49:02.080
Shanghai in, like,
three hours.

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.990
But why does it take like
20, whatever years you

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:06.090
said, to build it?

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:09.610
Why China could build one
in five, right, or--

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:11.730
so what's different?

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:13.005
AUDIENCE: A lot of
complex reasons.

00:49:13.005 --> 00:49:16.550
STUART COHEN: A lot of
complex reasons.

00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:18.130
First off, there's definitely
the money.

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:20.750
High-speed rail is going to cost
$68 billion here with the

00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:22.400
current plan.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.440
And we don't have the money
in our broke state.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.430
So the money is one.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:29.380
And then environmental review
and getting it through

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:32.690
communities and doing the
planning right is the other.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:36.260
If we put our mind to it, we can
do it in faster than that.

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.550
And actually, if we wanted to
take carbon fees and put it

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:41.440
towards high-speed rail, it
could be done faster.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:44.700
But I wouldn't want it done less
than 10, because we want

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:46.340
to get the planning right and
really engage communities.

00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:47.806
Real quickly.

00:49:47.806 --> 00:49:49.960
AUDIENCE: This is sort of
a specific question.

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:54.660
But I live in Menlo Park, and
they are looking at sites for

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.490
lower-income, higher-density
housing.

00:49:56.490 --> 00:49:57.820
And they have maps
very similar to

00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:59.440
some you showed there.

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:05.020
And there are people who, sort
of like you alluded to a

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.730
little bit in your talk, were
concerned about more people

00:50:08.730 --> 00:50:11.010
and more density bringing
in more traffic.

00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:17.800
And you made a joke about
bank robbers and stuff.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.070
How do you plan to address those
kinds of objections from

00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:22.895
people who are uncomfortable?

00:50:22.895 --> 00:50:25.725
Because there's a lot of people
in the community who

00:50:25.725 --> 00:50:29.100
tend to just immediately jump
on things like that.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:31.160
And it's hard to educate them.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:34.210
And I don't know what facts
you have to really back up

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:34.490
your statement.

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:37.210
STUART COHEN: So we have great
facts as part of our great

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:39.030
communities collaborative--

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:41.550
we've got a communities
collaborative website.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:45.970
There's kind of everything from
fliers that you give out

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:47.530
showing who these folks are.

00:50:47.530 --> 00:50:50.780
People should introduce
themselves, and they could

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:54.260
even, in the Menlo Park
meetings, ask for who is

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.320
making that much money.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.450
But we also take people on tours
of affordable housing.

00:50:57.450 --> 00:50:59.070
We have them meet the people
that are in them.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:01.470
But I think there's nothing
like that one-on-one

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:04.620
experience of actually seeing
it in other places.

00:51:04.620 --> 00:51:08.220
A lot of the affordable housing
is now LEED certified,

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.740
energy efficient, good
looking, with

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:10.930
great people in it.

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:12.250
And it's a matter of, actually,
I think that

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:15.250
experience of-- we take
city-elected officials and

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:16.910
planners to actually
go to other

00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:17.860
affordable housing sites.

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:20.100
AUDIENCE: Can you demonstrate
that the people who would be

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:23.340
in these housing units would
not be driving as much?

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.010
STUART COHEN: On average.

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:26.840
That's one of the things that
we do, is we bring in the

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:30.750
averages and show how they'll
have, depending on where,

00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:33.396
about half a vehicle per
household, depending on the

00:51:33.396 --> 00:51:34.320
sizes and everything.

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.545
There's a couple of
other questions.

00:51:37.545 --> 00:51:37.970
Last one?

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:41.530
AUDIENCE: I also find a lot of
these timelines really kind of

00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:43.510
disconcerting in terms
of, like, 20 years,

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.570
30 years, et cetera.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:49.860
And it sounds like part
of this is financial.

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:53.790
It might also be because of the
scale of the projects, but

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:57.980
are there efforts underway for
having the private sector

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.760
supplement a bit of
these projects?

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.970
And then also, maybe having
more, like you were saying,

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:06.850
test segments so that the
timelines don't seem so

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:08.420
enormous and we can
see benefits?

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:09.210
STUART COHEN: Yes.

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:12.800
We need innovation and then
replication to be part of the

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.420
DNA of our government sector.

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.540
And then we definitely need
private sector support, both

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.880
developers, companies
like Google.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.440
So absolutely.

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.550
And we can talk afterwards
about it.

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:23.940
We have to end now.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:24.700
Yeah.

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:25.820
MALE SPEAKER: OK, let's
thank Stuart.

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:26.760
Thank you very much
for a great talk.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:27.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:28.310
STUART COHEN: Appreciate it.
