00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.720
Let's see if we can extend the
path counting brain teaser to

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.330
three dimensions.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.310
So let's say that I had
a three by three cube.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.280
I'll keep it at three by
three to keep the math

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.905
from getting too hairy.

00:00:12.905 --> 00:00:14.320
So let me draw it like that.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.130
I won't use a line tool just
because-- well, maybe I should

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.610
have. So let's see.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.080
The front of the cube looks
something like that.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.910
That's the front of the cube.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.400
And the cube goes backwards
like that.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.570
Comes down.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.230
Goes like that.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.640
It's a three by three,
like a Rubik's Cube.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.430
I could have drawn this little
bit better, but I think this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.000
will meet our needs.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.430
OK.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.990
There you go.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.050
Three by three cube.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.820
And so our goal is to get from
this back left cube.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.430
This top corner back
left cube.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.840
And get to this front,
bottom right cube.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.820
So this is our goal.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.690
I'll do it in this yellow.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.640
This is our goal right there.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.220
And we're allowed to
either go forward.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.120
From any cube, these are our
three operations or our three

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.590
movements we can do.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.200
We can go forward, or I guess
towards the front.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.665
We could go down.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.240
Or we can go to the right.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.790
So I can draw it here.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.720
We can go from that
cube to that cube.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.330
So just like the two dimensional
problem, you're

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.200
only allowed to make
forward progress.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.170
You're not allowed to
come down here, and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.540
then go to over here.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.280
You're allowed to go down here,
then here, but then

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.630
you're not allowed to go up.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.180
So every step you're getting a
little bit closer, from this

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.800
back left top cube, to this
front bottom, right cube.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.790
And so the same question
applies, how many different

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.730
ways are there to get
from there to there?

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.480
And you can pause it now and try
it yourself, because I'm

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.540
about to explain how to do it.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.480
And the first thing, when you
tried to do it yourself, is to

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.410
realize, boy this is
hard to visualize.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.830
Even if I had to draw this
out, I'd have to

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.280
go in and then out.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.180
I mean, how do I even visualize
a three dimensional

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.949
cube like this?

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.360
And the best way to do is to
separately visualize each of

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.310
the separate layers.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.930
So let's do that.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.550
Let's make this the magenta
layer up here.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.050
We'll call that layer one.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.340
So this is the magenta
layer up here.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.540
And you'll see what I'm
doing in a second.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.570
This is the mauve layer
right there.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.650
And then finally I'll
do the orange layer.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.060
The orange layer is that
one right there.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.180
What we can do is separately
draw each of these layers.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.930
So first, let's do the
magenta layer.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.580
So the magenta layer will
look like this.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.610
And now I'll use things that
help-- nope, not like that.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.190
I want to use the other tool.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.270
The magenta layer.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.974
Let me draw some squares
in here.

00:03:07.974 --> 00:03:14.670
It's like that, and like that,
and like that, and like that.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.075
And then, the middle one
was the mauve layer.

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:19.740
We'll draw that.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.320
The mauve layer looks
something like that.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.350
And you can imagine I'm slicing
it, and just looking

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.280
at it from above.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.300
That's the idea here.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.500
And it's going to help us
visualize this problem.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.850
So the mauve layer looks
something like that.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.350
And then finally the
orange layer.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.490
Looks like this.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:47.960
And we're almost ready
to actually

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.210
start doing the problem.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.500
Good enough.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.430
So just to make sure we
understand our visualization,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.030
this layer up here-- we
call that layer one.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.400
We could but this as box one.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.130
This layer is layer two.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.100
So I'll put a little two here.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.980
And I don't want to get these
confused with the paths and

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.920
all that, so I'm writing
it really small.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.065
And this is layer three,
or level three.

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:15.500
And that's right there.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.130
And just to make sure you
understand, this corner right

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.150
there, this is our
start point.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.500
And that's right there.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.770
Right?

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.030
Because this is a whole top.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.380
So this is the back
left of the top.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.410
And are finish point, the bottom
right, is right here.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.140
So, essentially, our problem
goes from, how many ways to

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.930
get from there to there, to
how many ways to get from

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.940
there to there?

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.150
So let's just stay
within a layer.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.020
So how many ways can I get
to this point right here?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.990
Well I can only go from this
point, and go straight in the

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.765
layer like that.

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:48.260
So there's only one
way to get there.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.110
That movement is the
exact same movement

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.650
as this right here.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.360
Going from this box
to this box.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.330
So there's one way
to get there.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.470
That's the same thing
as there.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.610
And similarly, I
could go there.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:57.860
And I can just go
one more step.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.360
So there's only one
way to get there.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.230
And that's like going there
and then there.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.580
And by the same logic, I could
go one to the right here.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.160
That's the only way
to get there.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.555
Or I could go two to
the right there.

00:05:07.555 --> 00:05:09.820
And that's the only
way to get there.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.900
And now if you watched the two
dimensional path counting

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.590
brain teaser, you know that
there's two ways to get here.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.600
And the logic is, well you
could draw it out.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.670
You could go like that.

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.780
One, two.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.615
And that's the same thing
as saying, one, two.

00:05:27.615 --> 00:05:29.750
Though it's easier to
visualize here.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.060
But the general logic was, well,
to know how many ways to

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.520
get to any square, think about
the squares that lead to it,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.090
and how many ways can I get
to those two squares?

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.240
And then sum them up.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.810
And by the same logic-- so
there's two ways to get here.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.020
That's that cell.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.720
Three ways to get here, right?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.240
Two plus one is three.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.430
One plus two is three.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.770
And three plus three is six.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.930
So there were six ways to
get to this cube right

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.610
there, from that one.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.690
So this isn't too different
from the two dimensional

00:05:58.690 --> 00:05:59.520
problem so far.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.610
But now it gets interesting.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.245
So how many ways-- I did this
in yellow, but I should have

00:06:05.245 --> 00:06:06.810
done it in the color
of that layer.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.810
How many ways are there to get
to this cell right here?

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.170
This cell is that
one right there.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.660
Well, I start here.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.490
And I can just go
straight down.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:17.560
There's only one way
to be there.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.510
But I go straight down.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.170
So there's only one
way to get there.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.030
Actually let's extend.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.740
There's only one way
to get here, if I'm

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.050
going straight down.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.190
And so there's only one way
to get to this cell too.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.100
I'd have to go straight
down again.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.910
So there's only one
way to get there.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.650
Hopefully you understand the
way we're visualizing it.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.050
This is the bottom row.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.220
And there's only one way.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.010
You go from here, straight
down to there,

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.790
straight down to there.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.710
And that's the only
way to get there.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:43.750
Fair enough.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.260
Now this is where it
gets interesting.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.700
How many ways are there
to get to this cell?

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.460
Well in our old example, there
was only one way in two

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.900
dimensions to go
from this cell.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.380
But now we can go from
this cell, and we

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.500
could come from above.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.450
And where's above?

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.380
Above is right there.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.490
So now we add this cell
to that cell.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.090
So one plus one is, there are
two ways to get there.

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.120
How many ways to get to this?

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.803
You can't even see it.

00:07:09.803 --> 00:07:12.760
This is kind of in the back
middle of this cube.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.640
How many ways to get there?

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.690
Well, there's two ways to come
from this direction.

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:18.450
And I can also come from
above right there.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:21.570
So two plus one is three.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.730
How many ways to get here?

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.900
Well, one from behind.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.470
And then one from above.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:27.270
So that's two.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.900
And you see a little
bit of symmetry.

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.520
And how many ways
to come here.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.860
Well there's two here.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.360
From going straight forward.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.840
Two ways to go that way.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.340
And then one way to
come from above.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:46.650
This is two, and we're
on this cell.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.380
So if we wanted to know how many
ways to get to this cell?

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.780
There's two ways to
go from there.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.235
And then one way from above.

00:07:52.235 --> 00:07:53.990
So that's three.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:57.660
And now, right here, how many
ways to get to this cell?

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.370
There's three ways.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:04.360
I could come from here, from
here, or from above.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.870
So I have the two plus
two plus two is six.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.290
Likewise, here, I can come from
six plus three is nine.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:15.190
But I can also come
from above.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.260
From here.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:19.620
So there's 12 ways
to get there.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.160
And you can do the same logic.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.020
How many ways to get here?

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.000
Well, within the same row
there are nine ways.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.370
Six plus three is nine.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.170
And then you could come
from above as well.

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:30.710
That's 12.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.230
And finally, how many ways to
get to this cell right here,

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:35.210
which is this one right there?

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.260
Well, there's 12 ways
to get here.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:39.740
So I could go all
of those ways.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.159
12 ways to come from behind
it, so that's 24.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:45.520
And then six ways to
come from above.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.740
So 12 plus 12 is 24
plus six is 30.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.690
I think you're seeing
the pattern.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:52.530
So how many ways to get here?

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.830
Well it's one plus two,
which is three.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.460
How many ways to get here?

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.410
Well it's three plus three,
which is six.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:02.560
How many ways to get here?

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.920
It's one way here, and
two from above.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.370
So it's three.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.940
How many ways to get here?

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.010
Well, three from behind
and three from above.

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:12.380
That's six.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.490
Here, it's three plus
three is six.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.970
But you could also
come from above.

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.520
So six again.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.670
So that is 12.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.740
How many ways to get here?

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.280
12 plus six is 18.

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.940
But there's 12 ways to come
from above as well.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.150
So 18 plus 12 is 30.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.550
And by the same logic, there's
18 ways to get here

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:32.380
from these two cells.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.830
But I could also come
from above.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.890
So that is 30.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:38.900
So how many ways to get
to this last cell?

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.040
Well there's 30 from
this direction.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.690
30 ways from there.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.000
30 ways from behind it.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.820
That's 60.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.810
And then there's another 30
ways to come from above.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.040
So there are 90 ways.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.490
I could write that there,
but you can't see it.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:58.170
90 ways to get from that
cell over there to

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.530
this cell over here.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.560
And then the last video, I
made the analogy to the

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.880
binomial theorem.

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.060
And I'll leave you to think
about what the three

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:07.240
dimensional analogy is.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.910
And I'll throw out a word
which is never really

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.690
mentioned in math class, because
it's normally too

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:12.690
hairy to deal with.

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:16.540
Think about formulating a
trinomial theorem, to help you

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:22.110
multiply things like x plus
y plus z to nth power.

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:24.150
And think about how this cube,
or an extension of it.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.460
This is a three by three
by three cube.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.010
But imagine if it was, you know,
an n by n by n cube.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.160
Then you can start taking things
to arbitrary powers.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.520
So I'll leave you to
think about this.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.250
But I just thought this was a
neat visualization problem,

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.870
which is really not any more
difficult than the last one.

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:46.680
Actually, before I leave you
I'll leave you with just a

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.560
general principle.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.150
And this is actually really
useful for some standardized

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:52.500
tests, or just logic games.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.125
If I'm trying to get
to this cell.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.160
And let's say there's a bunch
of ways to get here.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.240
And it has to have direction.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:10.160
So I won't go into a whole
graph theory thing.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.820
But it has to have direction.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:13.330
And you can't have cycles.

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.090
Because then you can have
infinite ways to get to a

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.060
certain point.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.020
And let's say that there are
x ways to get there.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.640
Y ways to get there. z
ways to get there.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.660
And a ways to get there.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.880
I'll cycle through
the alphabet.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.560
And this is just a subset
of the larger graph.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.860
This graph could have a
bunch of connections.

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.850
This is just where we are.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:35.950
These are all of the nodes
that connect to this.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.040
The general rule that we've
learned in the last two brain

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.530
teasers is, you say, OK, how
can I get to this node?

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.700
Well I can go from here,
here, here, or here.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.100
And I just have to add up.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.240
So if I can get from here,
there's x ways to

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.600
come via this node.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.590
Y ways to come via that note.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:53.460
z ways to come via that node.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.970
a ways to come via that node.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:58.780
So the total ways to get
to that node is x plus

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:01.320
y plus z plus a.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.580
And actually, you'll see
problems like this if you ever

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:05.430
plan on becoming a lawyer.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:07.720
They actually do have problems
like this on the LSAT, that

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.790
aren't maybe as complicated
as what we did here.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.610
But you need understand
this principle.

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:15.060
Anyway hope you enjoyed that.
