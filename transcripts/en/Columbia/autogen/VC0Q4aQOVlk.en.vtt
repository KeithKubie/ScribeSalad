kind of work the only way you could

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:28.980
kind of work the only way you could
 

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.799
kind of work the only way you could
really look at that River mixing was to

00:31:30.799 --> 00:31:30.809
really look at that River mixing was to
 

00:31:30.809 --> 00:31:32.299
really look at that River mixing was to
have a bunch of graduate students in a

00:31:32.299 --> 00:31:32.309
have a bunch of graduate students in a
 

00:31:32.309 --> 00:31:34.750
have a bunch of graduate students in a
canoe with buckets and a stopwatch okay

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:34.760
canoe with buckets and a stopwatch okay
 

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.250
canoe with buckets and a stopwatch okay
so it's really pretty amazing but the

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260
so it's really pretty amazing but the
 

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.019
so it's really pretty amazing but the
new kinds of data that they were able to

00:31:39.019 --> 00:31:39.029
new kinds of data that they were able to
 

00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:44.029
new kinds of data that they were able to
get with this this is just one of the

00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039
get with this this is just one of the
 

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:45.919
get with this this is just one of the
the number of studies that we've done in

00:31:45.919 --> 00:31:45.929
the number of studies that we've done in
 

00:31:45.929 --> 00:31:48.950
the number of studies that we've done in
this area or an NSF Center we're

00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960
this area or an NSF Center we're
 

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.529
this area or an NSF Center we're
supposed to share data so we're asking

00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:51.539
supposed to share data so we're asking
 

00:31:51.539 --> 00:31:53.630
supposed to share data so we're asking
when I ask you naive questions like well

00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.640
when I ask you naive questions like well
 

00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.029
when I ask you naive questions like well
what are the data and who might you be

00:31:56.029 --> 00:31:56.039
what are the data and who might you be
 

00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:58.180
what are the data and who might you be
willing to share them with under what

00:31:58.180 --> 00:31:58.190
willing to share them with under what
 

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:00.560
willing to share them with under what
circumstances and what do we need to

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:00.570
circumstances and what do we need to
 

00:32:00.570 --> 00:32:02.409
circumstances and what do we need to
know about the data and how do

00:32:02.409 --> 00:32:02.419
know about the data and how do
 

00:32:02.419 --> 00:32:05.979
know about the data and how do
metadata around it and there's a lot of

00:32:05.979 --> 00:32:05.989
metadata around it and there's a lot of
 

00:32:05.989 --> 00:32:08.789
metadata around it and there's a lot of
implications about the architecture of

00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799
implications about the architecture of
 

00:32:08.799 --> 00:32:11.139
implications about the architecture of
pulling these things together and then

00:32:11.139 --> 00:32:11.149
pulling these things together and then
 

00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:12.789
pulling these things together and then
leveraging these resources in different

you ask a biologist you get things like

00:32:48.099 --> 00:32:48.109
you ask a biologist you get things like
 

00:32:48.109 --> 00:32:52.389
you ask a biologist you get things like
this you get there's a hundred ways to

00:32:52.389 --> 00:32:52.399
this you get there's a hundred ways to
 

00:32:52.399 --> 00:32:54.310
this you get there's a hundred ways to
measure temperature you get the

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320
measure temperature you get the
 

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.200
measure temperature you get the
biologists who don't trust what the

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:56.210
biologists who don't trust what the
 

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:58.450

engineers are doing and have set up

00:32:58.450 --> 00:32:58.460
engineers are doing and have set up
 

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.359
engineers are doing and have set up
three different temperature sensors next

00:33:01.359 --> 00:33:01.369
three different temperature sensors next
 

00:33:01.369 --> 00:33:03.999
three different temperature sensors next
to each other at 5,000 feet and the

00:33:03.999 --> 00:33:04.009
to each other at 5,000 feet and the
 

00:33:04.009 --> 00:33:06.099
to each other at 5,000 feet and the
James reserve and until those have run

00:33:06.099 --> 00:33:06.109
James reserve and until those have run
 

00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:08.590
James reserve and until those have run
for 365 days straight they're not going

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:08.600
for 365 days straight they're not going
 

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:14.830
for 365 days straight they're not going
to trust the calibration on okay so in

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840
to trust the calibration on okay so in
 

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.810
to trust the calibration on okay so in
terms of designing our systems we need

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:16.820
terms of designing our systems we need
 

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.609

to know who cares about what kinds of

00:33:18.609 --> 00:33:18.619
to know who cares about what kinds of
 

00:33:18.619 --> 00:33:21.669
to know who cares about what kinds of
data this is another one of my favorite

00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679
data this is another one of my favorite
 

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:23.289
data this is another one of my favorite
ones that came out of this and it's

00:33:23.289 --> 00:33:23.299
ones that came out of this and it's
 

00:33:23.299 --> 00:33:27.129
ones that came out of this and it's
worth spending a minute on we were able

00:33:27.129 --> 00:33:27.139
worth spending a minute on we were able
 

00:33:27.139 --> 00:33:29.169
worth spending a minute on we were able
to categorize these different varieties

00:33:29.169 --> 00:33:29.179
to categorize these different varieties
 

00:33:29.179 --> 00:33:30.639
to categorize these different varieties
of data when people say what are the

00:33:30.639 --> 00:33:30.649
of data when people say what are the
 

00:33:30.649 --> 00:33:31.960

data coming off the networks it's

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:31.970
data coming off the networks it's
 

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:33.249
data coming off the networks it's
usually the stuff in the middle that

00:33:33.249 --> 00:33:33.259
usually the stuff in the middle that
 

00:33:33.259 --> 00:33:35.470
usually the stuff in the middle that
they're they're thinking about it's the

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:35.480
they're they're thinking about it's the
 

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.960
they're they're thinking about it's the
humidity it's the water it's the flow

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:37.970

actually what's really coming off of
 

00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:43.779
actually what's really coming off of
these is microvolts and you've got to

00:33:43.779 --> 00:33:43.789
these is microvolts and you've got to
 

00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:45.549
these is microvolts and you've got to
take the microvolt through some kind of

00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:45.559
take the microvolt through some kind of
 

00:33:45.559 --> 00:33:47.799
take the microvolt through some kind of
model before you know if it's ammonia or

00:33:47.799 --> 00:33:47.809

technology was stable enough so you

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:46.220
technology was stable enough so you
 

00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.020
technology was stable enough so you
really had something looking like

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:47.030
really had something looking like
 

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.329
really had something looking like
scientific data and then then people

00:34:49.329 --> 00:34:49.339
scientific data and then then people
 

00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:50.500
scientific data and then then people
start getting worried about bitter rot

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:50.510
start getting worried about bitter rot
 

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:52.629
start getting worried about bitter rot
but not until they got the point they

00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639
but not until they got the point they
 

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.569
but not until they got the point they
have stable battery life here now these

00:34:55.569 --> 00:34:55.579
have stable battery life here now these

us then to share the expertise because
 

00:57:36.169 --> 00:57:38.349

with 26 different systems you had 26
 

00:57:38.359 --> 00:57:42.219
with 26 different systems you had 26
different staff and you know so you

00:57:42.219 --> 00:57:42.229
different staff and you know so you
 

00:57:42.229 --> 00:57:43.509
different staff and you know so you
didn't have people you couldn't have a

even working on governance models you're

00:57:51.579 --> 00:57:51.589
even working on governance models you're
 

00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:53.229
even working on governance models you're
working on business models and we're

00:57:53.229 --> 00:57:53.239
working on business models and we're
 

00:57:53.239 --> 00:57:54.939

making some progress in that environment
 

00:57:54.949 --> 00:57:57.759
making some progress in that environment
but it's it's one of many uphill areas

to do it so that those the kinds of

things are going to get fought out in a

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:27.490
things are going to get fought out in a
 

01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:29.190
things are going to get fought out in a
lot of different ways so there's I think

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:29.200
lot of different ways so there's I think
 

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.980
lot of different ways so there's I think
it's been part of what I'm hoping to do

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:31.990
it's been part of what I'm hoping to do
 

01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:33.540
it's been part of what I'm hoping to do
with the book and seems to be happening

01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:33.550
with the book and seems to be happening
 

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:36.780
with the book and seems to be happening
and is to provoke a conversation because

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:36.790
and is to provoke a conversation because
 

01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:38.220
and is to provoke a conversation because
the Provost has been having

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:38.230
the Provost has been having
 

01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:41.040
the Provost has been having
conversations the librarians have the

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:41.050
conversations the librarians have the
 

01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:43.320

have the funding agencies have and we're
 

01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:48.620
have the funding agencies have and we're
finally having that cross-cutting

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:48.630
finally having that cross-cutting
 

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.520
finally having that cross-cutting

conversation to say this affects
 

01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:53.160
conversation to say this affects
everybody and very different and often

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:53.170
everybody and very different and often
 

01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:54.720
everybody and very different and often
unforeseen ways and if we're really

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:54.730
unforeseen ways and if we're really
 

01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:56.730
unforeseen ways and if we're really
going to to capitalize on it move

01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:56.740
going to to capitalize on it move
 

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.140
going to to capitalize on it move
forward we've got to have a new kind of

01:12:58.140 --> 01:12:58.150
forward we've got to have a new kind of
 

01:12:58.150 --> 01:13:00.060
forward we've got to have a new kind of
conversation so yeah back here in the

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:00.070
conversation so yeah back here in the
 

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:10.200

always striking such events where I
 

01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:14.380
always striking such events where I
learned an enormous amount with the

learned an enormous amount with the
 

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:16.030
learned an enormous amount with the
conversation and the research and that

01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040

01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:18.440
the funding to investigate the issue
 

01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:21.130
the funding to investigate the issue
seems to come very early on of the

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:21.140
seems to come very early on of the
 

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.900
seems to come very early on of the
science community the conversation about

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:22.910
science community the conversation about
 

01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:25.030
science community the conversation about
open access is driven by the problems

01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040

it's it's very confusing part because

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:34.730
it's it's very confusing part because
 

01:13:34.730 --> 01:13:37.150
it's it's very confusing part because
the solutions don't seem to address the

real problem
 

01:13:38.160 --> 01:14:19.239

waise research in the humanities get

01:14:19.239 --> 01:14:19.249
 
 

01:14:19.249 --> 01:14:22.189
 
okay so again trying to trying to repeat

01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199
okay so again trying to trying to repeat
 

01:14:22.199 --> 01:14:25.279
okay so again trying to trying to repeat
that is that so much of this the cyber

01:14:25.279 --> 01:14:25.289
that is that so much of this the cyber
 

01:14:25.289 --> 01:14:27.109
that is that so much of this the cyber
infrastructure movement it has been

01:14:27.109 --> 01:14:27.119
infrastructure movement it has been
 

01:14:27.119 --> 01:14:31.009
infrastructure movement it has been
driven by by the sciences and the needs

01:14:31.009 --> 01:14:31.019
driven by by the sciences and the needs
 

01:14:31.019 --> 01:14:33.649
driven by by the sciences and the needs
of the humanities and arts are without a

01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659
of the humanities and arts are without a
 

01:14:33.659 --> 01:14:35.060
of the humanities and arts are without a
doubt considerably considerably

01:14:35.060 --> 01:14:35.070
doubt considerably considerably
 

01:14:35.070 --> 01:14:38.149

different and and how well they how will

01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159
different and and how well they how will
 

01:14:38.159 --> 01:14:40.219
different and and how well they how will
they get met in this environment a fair

01:14:40.219 --> 01:14:40.229
they get met in this environment a fair
 

01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:44.119
they get met in this environment a fair
summary okay on the one hand I mean

01:14:44.119 --> 01:14:44.129
summary okay on the one hand I mean
 

01:14:44.129 --> 01:14:45.469
summary okay on the one hand I mean
you're absolutely right but that but

01:14:45.469 --> 01:14:45.479
you're absolutely right but that but
 

01:14:45.479 --> 01:14:48.020
you're absolutely right but that but
that's not unusual I mean if you go back

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:48.030
that's not unusual I mean if you go back
 

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:51.049
that's not unusual I mean if you go back
to the 1960s changes in scholarly

01:14:51.049 --> 01:14:51.059
to the 1960s changes in scholarly
 

01:14:51.059 --> 01:14:53.270
to the 1960s changes in scholarly
publishing that was also very driven by

01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280
publishing that was also very driven by
 

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.069
publishing that was also very driven by
the sciences and and you know the

01:14:55.069 --> 01:14:55.079
the sciences and and you know the
 

01:14:55.079 --> 01:14:58.719
the sciences and and you know the
humanities kind of trickled up the rear

01:14:58.719 --> 01:14:58.729
humanities kind of trickled up the rear
 

01:14:58.729 --> 01:15:02.060
humanities kind of trickled up the rear
similarly I'm part of what's happened is

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:02.070
similarly I'm part of what's happened is
 

01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:05.000
similarly I'm part of what's happened is
old debates are bubbling more up to the

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:05.010
old debates are bubbling more up to the
 

01:15:05.010 --> 01:15:08.659
old debates are bubbling more up to the
surface the library the library budget

01:15:08.659 --> 01:15:08.669
surface the library the library budget
 

01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:10.969
surface the library the library budget
was always skewed way toward the

01:15:10.969 --> 01:15:10.979
was always skewed way toward the
 

01:15:10.979 --> 01:15:14.989
was always skewed way toward the
sciences and as the as scientific

01:15:14.989 --> 01:15:14.999
sciences and as the as scientific
 

01:15:14.999 --> 01:15:16.369
sciences and as the as scientific
journals have gotten more and more

01:15:16.369 --> 01:15:16.379
journals have gotten more and more
 

01:15:16.379 --> 01:15:19.779
journals have gotten more and more
expensive the cuts have been to the

01:15:19.779 --> 01:15:19.789
expensive the cuts have been to the
 

01:15:19.789 --> 01:15:22.489
expensive the cuts have been to the
journals in other areas and and they've

01:15:22.489 --> 01:15:22.499
journals in other areas and and they've
 

01:15:22.499 --> 01:15:24.139
journals in other areas and and they've
been cuts to the monographs and so the

01:15:24.139 --> 01:15:24.149
been cuts to the monographs and so the
 

01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:25.609
been cuts to the monographs and so the
arts and humanities been have been hurt

01:15:25.609 --> 01:15:25.619
arts and humanities been have been hurt
 

01:15:25.619 --> 01:15:27.469
arts and humanities been have been hurt
even more in this environment but

01:15:27.469 --> 01:15:27.479
even more in this environment but
 

01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:29.149
even more in this environment but
because it's more obvious what's

01:15:29.149 --> 01:15:29.159
because it's more obvious what's
 

01:15:29.159 --> 01:15:30.859
because it's more obvious what's
happening I think again a different kind

01:15:30.859 --> 01:15:30.869
happening I think again a different kind
 

01:15:30.869 --> 01:15:35.119
happening I think again a different kind
of conversation is going on the I've got

some slides that I didn't use today but

some slides that I didn't use today but
 

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:38.839
some slides that I didn't use today but
there's a long discussion and in the the

there's a long discussion and in the the
 

01:15:38.849 --> 01:15:41.209
there's a long discussion and in the the
chapter 8 I think it is undisciplined

01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219
chapter 8 I think it is undisciplined
 

01:15:41.219 --> 01:15:42.889
chapter 8 I think it is undisciplined
documents and data where it really

compared that what's happening in in the
different areas to note that the

Amazon and Netflix model and get that

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:29.730
Amazon and Netflix model and get that
 

01:16:29.730 --> 01:16:34.400
Amazon and Netflix model and get that
longtail back up and available because

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:34.410
longtail back up and available because
 

01:16:34.410 --> 01:16:35.630
longtail back up and available because
because because that's where the

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:35.640
because because that's where the
 

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.830
because because that's where the
humanities and arts are really going to

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:36.840
humanities and arts are really going to

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:38.690
benefit and these mass digitization
 

01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:41.000
benefit and these mass digitization
projects are doing exactly that they're

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:41.010
projects are doing exactly that they're
 

01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:43.790
projects are doing exactly that they're
getting much more the longtail up and

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:43.800
getting much more the longtail up and
 

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:46.190
getting much more the longtail up and
available so so potentially that's the

01:16:46.190 --> 01:16:46.200
available so so potentially that's the
 

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.590
available so so potentially that's the
punchline is that the massive book

01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600
punchline is that the massive book
 

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.290
punchline is that the massive book
digitization projects will shift that

01:16:51.290 --> 01:16:51.300
digitization projects will shift that
 

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:54.680
digitization projects will shift that
and make much more data available and if

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:54.690
and make much more data available and if
 

01:16:54.690 --> 01:16:56.750

01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:04.580
you do with the million books yeah it's
just it's a nice little punchy pieces

ways so I think that balance may be

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:21.450
ways so I think that balance may be
 

01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:23.390
ways so I think that balance may be
shifting but against it's another kind

01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400
shifting but against it's another kind
 

01:17:23.400 --> 01:18:36.750

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.750
 
I mean it image is a great example like

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760
I mean it image is a great example like
 

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.729

or not you're not not in an easy place

01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:47.630
or not you're not not in an easy place
 

01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:49.750
or not you're not not in an easy place
right now with this that's a

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760
right now with this that's a
 

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.310
right now with this that's a
conversation I think that's probably

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320
conversation I think that's probably
 

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:53.229
conversation I think that's probably
taking place more within the disciplines

monographs and it kind of went and kind
 

01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:15.669
monographs and it kind of went and kind
of went nowhere right so yes it's the

01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679
of went nowhere right so yes it's the
 

01:19:15.679 --> 01:19:17.919
of went nowhere right so yes it's the
market right so it's the market push so

market right so it's the market push so
 

01:19:17.929 --> 01:19:19.750
market right so it's the market push so
it's a different kind of pressure from

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760
it's a different kind of pressure from
 

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.750
it's a different kind of pressure from
the outside and from the inside of what

I don't envy you so the concise question
 

01:20:43.079 --> 01:20:45.439
I don't envy you so the concise question
is is how do I see librarians roles

01:20:45.439 --> 01:20:45.449
is is how do I see librarians roles

that's not one with a concise answer of

that's not one with a concise answer of
 

01:20:49.079 --> 01:20:55.970
that's not one with a concise answer of
course one is that we need librarians

01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980
course one is that we need librarians
 

01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:58.120

I see like I see librarians working at a

01:21:10.370 --> 01:21:10.380
I see like I see librarians working at a
 

01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:13.430
I see like I see librarians working at a
much wider range of roles through the
