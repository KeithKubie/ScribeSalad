00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.769
- Let's see what this excuse is.

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:04.170 align:start position:0%
- Doop, doop, doop, doop,
there they go. Hey.

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:06.539 align:end position:100%
- Where you been, man?
We been here for a hour.

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:08.141
- Had to make a stop.
- What is that?

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.209 align:start position:0%
- What is that? This is
my business, is what it is.

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:12.779
- Show us. Come on.
- I'm not showing you nothing.

00:00:12.812 --> 00:00:14.447 align:start position:0%
Do you understand
what's going on today, guys?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.648
- Tell us.
- I am going

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.884 align:start position:0%
into the legendary
Ben's Chili Bowl.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:19.552 align:start position:0%
You want to know who else
has been here?

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:22.555
A bunch of black leaders, okay?
- Like who?

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.857 align:start position:0%
- Malcolm X,
Doctor Martin Luther King.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.726
- That's two.
- What's the guy with the--

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.029 align:start position:0%
the jeans that got
the jacket to match him?

00:00:30.062 --> 00:00:31.764 align:start position:0%
Barack. Barack Obama.

00:00:31.797 --> 00:00:33.232 align:start size:72% position:28%
- He never wears jeans.

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:34.634 align:start position:0%
- Well, then you don't know him
like I know him.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.035 align:start position:0%
I've seen him in jeans
several times.

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:38.704 align:start position:0%
The bottom line,
these are all black men

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:39.972 size:88% position:44%
that are changing the world.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:41.607 align:start position:0%
Looks to me like another
black leader

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.242 align:start position:0%
is walking in this place
that needs to be recognized.

00:00:43.275 --> 00:00:45.678 align:end position:100%
- You do standup.
You're not a black leader.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
- This man not a black leader,
Harry?

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:49.348
- Don't do this.
- Huh?

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.117
Telling me that, right there?
- He got a picture of himself.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.152
- Don't do this.
- I got--what I got is history.

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:55.154 align:start position:0%
Okay? And there's a place
for me in here.

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:57.824 size:81% position:41%
You know, Barack Obama is
on his way out the office.

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.026 size:84% position:42%
Sounds to me like a space
on the wall just opened up.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.427 align:end position:100%
- Kev, you're not
gonna go in here

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.829 align:end position:100%
and ask them to put you
on the wall.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.397
- Damn if I won't.
- Did they ask you

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.065
to bring your picture?
- It ain't about what they ask.

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:07.800
It's about what you want.
- Don't do this.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.068
- I'm doing it.
- Don't do it.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.837
- Doing it.
- I can't believe--

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.803
- Don't do this. Don't.
- Kev, don't do this.
