[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:07.640
TOMOMI MATSUOKA: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.973
LUKASZ KRAWCZYK: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.973 --> 00:00:10.895
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:11.520
Good afternoon.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.620
TOMOMI MATSUOKA: Thank you for
coming to this Talks at event.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.550
My name is Tomomi.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.016
I am program manager of
Google Earth Outreach.

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:20.540
Google Earth Outreach
is to introduce

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.900
our Geo tools, Google's
Geo tools, to NPOs,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.730
and educators, and
then the researchers,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.430
and the scientists.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.720
And one of Geo tools
is Earth Engine.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.500
Earth Engine is petabyte
planetary-scale analysis

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.820
platform.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.340
You can access to
40 years satellite

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.710
imagery and more
than 200 observation

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.100
data and the computation power.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.800
And then through Earth
Engine initiatives,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.630
I got to know the company,
this start-up, Axelspace.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.580
And then I get so excited
to know about this exciting

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.629
start-up, so I cannot help
inviting them to provide

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.780
a talk.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.650
So they will explain about their
mission and then a little bit

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.640
engineering stuff.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.020
I mean, the coding stuff--

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.650
maybe?

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.150
No coding.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.540
Yeah.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.240
LUKASZ KRAWCZYK: Coding, OK.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.935
Next time.

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:19.310
TOMOMI MATSUOKA:
And then-- yeah.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.982
So please welcome
Lukasz from Axelspace.

00:01:25.982 --> 00:01:26.895
LUKASZ KRAWCZYK: Yes.

00:01:26.895 --> 00:01:27.395
Thank you.

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.360
Thank you very much
for introduction.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.580
My name is Lukasz.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.640
And today, I'm going to talk
how we can protect forests

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.640
from space.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.700
First, let me introduce myself.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.050
So I came to Japan
several years ago.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.410
I've been working
mainly in start-ups.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.050
And I graduated from
Jagiellonian University

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.400
in Poland, in Krakow.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.380
And now I'm working as a
space business intelligence

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.020
engineer at Axelspace.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.190
And I have several hobbies.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.710
One of them is open source.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.610
Hand craft-- mainly wood
and [INAUDIBLE] instruments.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.910
So a few words about
my company, Axelspace--

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.500
have you ever heard?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.440
Has any one of you heard
about Axelspace before?

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.110
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.880
Whoa.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.400
Oh.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.200
That's a lot, which is
really good, obviously.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.070
So Axelspace is, in my
opinion, an amazing company.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.410
So we are a team of
approximately 60 people,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.000
most of them hardware
and software engineers.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.120
And we have two offices
in Tokyo, in Nihonbashi.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.320
And what makes us different
from other hardware and software

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.930
start-ups is that we are making
satellites in our office.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.850
So actually, to
be more specific,

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.280
these are microsatellites.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.170
To give you idea of
what's the difference

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.740
between microsatellite
and normal satellite,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.220
please have a look
at this photo.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.430
Here on the right side, we
have a normal satellite, NASA

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.210
or ESA satellite.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.070
It's basically a few tons.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.020
And here on the
photo on the left,

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.440
you can see one of our
smallest microsatellite, which

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.850
is just a few--

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.740
10 centimeters.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.090
So the main difference is size.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.810
And the other difference
is, obviously, price.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.920
So we are building those
satellites in our office.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.430
We are testing them.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.440
And we are launching
them to low earth orbit.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.100
Yeah, this is Soyuz rocket.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.750
So during the last
few years, we've

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.660
developed-- we've launched
several microsatellites

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.090
to orbit.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.900
These were really
successful missions.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.180
And at the moment,
we are working

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.210
on a constellation of
satellites and also

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.770
in parallel on quite a
big project for JAXA.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.624
So today's topic is how we can--

00:04:20.624 --> 00:04:23.430
sorry-- how can we protect
forests from space?

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.810
So maybe first let
me briefly explain

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.510
what's the relation between
forest and human, what

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.510
are the economical and
control links between them.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.610
Approximately 30% of Earth land
area is occupied by forests.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.670
So these are these blue,
green areas here mainly.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.730
And there are basically
three types of forests.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.240
First one is boreal
forest, mainly

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.470
on the Northern Hemisphere
near polar regions,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.800
where temperatures are
really, really low.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.740
Second one is temperate
forests, warm regions

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.270
mainly in the Northern
Hemisphere, also in Japan.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.060
Moderate temperature
and rainfalls.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.870
And the third one
is tropical forest

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.280
near the equator, where
temperatures are really high,

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.180
high humidity, and very,
very heavy rainfalls.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.080
So what makes-- what's
special about rainforest,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.850
about tropical
forest, is that it's

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.260
a home for hundreds of
thousands of living species.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.867
And sadly, 50% of tropical
forest is already destroyed.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:03.880
So what are the main human
activities related to forests?

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.350
What do you think?

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.600
What are the main activities,
except logging, except cutting?

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.060
Some ideas?

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.076
Camping maybe, trekking.

00:06:15.076 --> 00:06:18.260
AUDIENCE: They burn the forest
to gain crop [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.510
LUKASZ KRAWCZYK: Exactly, yes.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.470
So forest conversion
into agriculture.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.286
So this is also one of activity.

00:06:28.286 --> 00:06:29.660
In fact, there
are a lot of them.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.460
When you think about it,
urban planning, cleaning land

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.890
for mines and solar panel--

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.200
solar power plants, access
to natural resources,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.340
disaster prevention,
agriculture,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.220
academic research-- there are
a lot of different activities.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.270
In fact, we are very strongly
connected with forest.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.780
The problem is that we are
doing some of these things

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.750
too much in an
uncontrollable way sometimes.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:07.230
So especially it
becomes clear when

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:11.970
you look at the Earth from
different perspective,

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.422
from higher perspective,
directly, actually, from space.

00:07:16.422 --> 00:07:22.380
The size of
deforestation is amazing.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.090
This is the photo taken by
one of our satellite in New

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.140
Zealand.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.990
It's the southern
part of New Zealand.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.960
And it's really shocking.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:43.160
So to put it into numbers,
13.7 million hectares a year

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.300
are cut down.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.690
So I don't know if you are
interested in football,

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.990
but probably you
have some impression

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.570
of how big a football pitch is.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:08:00.440
So this is basically 19 million
football pitches every year.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.220
It's hard to imagine.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:06.280
But it's unfortunately true.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:16.090
And the problem is that only
50% of this forest is replanted.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:19.000
So what are the
influenced areas?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.170
Mainly, basically, whole world.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:28.390
Climate change, loss of
natural habitat, soil erosion,

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.340
flooding, greenhouse
emissions-- those things

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:37.299
have very negative effect on
different commercial activities

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.659
and then the human health.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:48.090
If we look at it by region, then
you can see that during last, I

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:53.040
think, 20, 30 years, Brazil
lost approximately 15%

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.370
of forest coverage.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:56.826
Ethiopia, up to 90%.

00:08:56.826 --> 00:08:58.260
Madagascar, 90%.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.470
Nigeria, 80% within
last 15 years only.

00:09:05.696 --> 00:09:07.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.230
And then Asia-- minus 40%.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.220
These are really bad examples.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.950
However, there are
also good examples,

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:19.190
like China and Europe, also
Canada and United States.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.740
So some of you might think, why?

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.060
What's the difference?

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:25.460
Why we have such a
huge deforestation

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:27.920
in this region but we have--

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.560
the situation's actually
opposite and different?

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.050
So this is a very
interesting thing,

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.280
and a lot of researchers,
a lot of organizations

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.390
are investigating this topic.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.700
And there are several ideas.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:45.510
One of them is called
Kuznets curve effect.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.460
Basically, we are observing
increased deforestation

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.270
in tropical regions and
decreased deforestation

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.430
in highly developed areas.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:58.080
There might be a lot of
reasons for that situation.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.160
One of them is definitely
demand for wood

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.380
has changed during
the last few years,

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.170
especially in highly
developed countries.

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.530
But probably the biggest
problem is that we

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:11.275
are outsourcing deforestation.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.940
But it's really hard to say.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:22.970
There is no clear idea what
is the biggest reason, how

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.030
to change that trend,
because simply, we

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.710
don't have enough data.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.960
Data is not accessible enough.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:38.610
So there are a lot of ideas,
solutions how to improve,

00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:42.260
how to fight this
kind of problem.

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.060
Definitely, increased
awareness of this problem

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:49.620
has led to a lot of big
changes in regional law,

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.460
in international agreements.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.530
A lot of countries are
creating protected areas

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.750
to protect forest.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.750
There are a lot of amazing
organizations which

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:08.970
are monitoring and gathering
data, like from Africa,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.020
and different
analysis companies.

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:17.320
So how to improve
this situation?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:21.340
At Axelspace, we think
that one of the solution

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:27.200
is to improve planet-scale
monitoring through fast access

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:31.790
to data, affordable access
to data, high quality

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:36.020
analysis-ready data,
and tools to analyze it,

00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.240
as well as communication
and knowledge sharing.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.000
Our solution is
called AxelGlobe.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.070
And it's a constellation
of satellites

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:54.080
which will help us to photograph
entire world every day

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.880
at 2.5 meter resolution.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.810
To better understand how we
can use this constellation,

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:05.730
let's have a look
at a short video.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:06.726
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:10.212
[ROCKET ENGINE ROARING]

00:12:22.662 --> 00:12:26.148
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:14:11.724 --> 00:14:12.969
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:12.969 --> 00:14:14.712
Mm-hmm.

00:14:14.712 --> 00:14:15.708
Thank you.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:24.240
OK, so we are going to
use our constellation

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:30.100
to monitor whole Earth
daily, accumulate the data,

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.340
analyze it, and deliver it
to various organizations,

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:40.170
companies, and governments
to be able to analyze data,

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:45.060
to see how we can
change this situation.

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:52.170
So AxelGlobe solves several
of the problems, several

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.570
of needs I mentioned before.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:57.390
First of all, fast
access to data.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:01.030
Web platform and API--
we are building it now--

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:04.920
will help basically
anyone to access data

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:08.730
from entire world every day
for really a cheap price.

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.951
It's approximately few dollars
per one square kilometer.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.930
And our constellation
will provide high quality

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.660
analysis-ready data with
high temporal, spatial,

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.340
and spectral resolution
in a standardized way.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:31.070
All data will be processed
and analyzed, so ready to use.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.190
And so probably this
is most important slide

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:41.730
here-- how AxelGlobe will
help protecting forest land.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:46.230
First of all, by lowering
cost of monitoring.

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:50.820
Imagine-- well, let's go back
to the previous picture here.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:58.950
Imagine how long it will take to
monitor this real forest using

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:04.040
drones, using
helicopters or airplanes,

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.770
how expensive it would be.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:08.830
However, with satellites,
satellites is always in orbit.

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:12.370
So you can take
the photo anyway--

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:15.050
anytime you want.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:19.510
So definitely it will
help to reduce the cost

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:26.745
and basically lower
the barrier for entry

00:16:26.745 --> 00:16:28.930
to improve monitoring.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.566
And the insights will
be much more accessible.

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:39.490
Second point is
forest health analysis

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.520
through land cover
classification and then plant

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.960
health analysis.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.150
To better understand
this topic, let

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:52.720
me briefly explain what
electromagnetic spectrum is.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.920
I think most of you
here are engineers.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:03.640
So our satellites will
focus on a specific part

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.910
of electromagnetic
spectrum, which

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:11.414
is between 400 nanometers
and 900 nanometers, which

00:17:11.414 --> 00:17:16.819
is basically visible light
plus infrared spectrum,

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:19.089
near-infrared spectrum.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:23.020
Fortunately for us,
this part of spectrum

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.800
is visible through
atmosphere, which

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.600
is not that obvious
because there

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:34.600
are some other areas of the
spectrum which atmosphere

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.270
is not [INAUDIBLE] to.

00:17:43.019 --> 00:17:44.440
Yep.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.590
So by using machine learning
and especially deep learning,

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.580
we are able to categorize,
to classify terrain

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:57.760
to measure the area covered by
forest, by fields, by cities

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:05.170
and to understand how that area
is changing over time, which is

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.870
very important for monitoring.

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.720
We can therefore
detect also logging,

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:12.950
especially illegal logging.

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:16.670
Here is another example.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:19.480
Also, one of very
interesting characteristics

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.390
of this electromagnetic
spectrum we are focusing on

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:28.554
is that plants are
reflecting two parts

00:18:28.554 --> 00:18:29.720
of electromagnetic spectrum.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.630
One is green light, what we
see in our eyes as green light.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.820
Another is infrared.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:42.400
Unfortunately, we can't see it,
but we can sense it from space.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.980
And also, one more important
thing, interesting thing

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.600
here is that the more
plant is healthy,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.710
the stronger it reflects
infrared-- near-infrared part

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:58.330
of the spectrum, as you
can see here on the graph.

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:02.680
So by monitoring this
thing from space,

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.555
we can very easily say whether--

00:19:06.555 --> 00:19:09.820
as here, on this example,
whether a plant is healthy

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.465
or not.

00:19:10.465 --> 00:19:16.900
This is really small scale, but
if we look at a bigger scale,

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.420
there is-- yeah, there is
some small forest in town.

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.090
And here, you can see that
this part on the right-hand

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:27.550
is probably affected
by some kind of disease

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.770
or some kind of insect.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.740
So just by taking
one photo from space,

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.650
we can understand that
something is happening,

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:39.730
and we should probably
send in drones or a human

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:40.824
for an inspection.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:46.930
And this is on
even larger scale.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:51.760
And again, how long it will
take to monitor this area using

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.178
even a helicopter?

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.710
And a third point is alerting.

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.312
So coverage measurements I
mentioned before and object

00:20:00.312 --> 00:20:01.270
and activity detection.

00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:05.240
This is also what
we are focusing on.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.615
Basically, this is the example
from Kumamoto earthquake.

00:20:08.615 --> 00:20:11.600
It was last year, as
far as I remember.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:17.120
And by analyzing the difference
between subsequent photos

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.840
from the same area, you can
easily detect changes, like,

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.550
in this case, landslides.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.540
So even if a certain area
doesn't have infrastructures

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:31.110
to go to investigate
what's happening,

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.110
we can always take
photo from space.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:39.470
So it helps to act faster.

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:47.534
Yeah, so this brings me to
the end of this presentation.

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.880
So as I mentioned
in the beginning,

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.990
there is a deep connection
between forest and human.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:21:02.880
And deforestation is
really a huge problem.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:04.540
However, we have the technology.

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:07.560
We have ideas how to
solve this problem,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.570
how to at least
improve the situation.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.050
So we strongly
believe that AxelGlobe

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:17.460
will help to protect forest
through fast and affordable

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:21.870
access to high quality
data and insights,

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.230
through lowering costs of
monitoring and alerting,

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:31.530
and forest health analysis
basically on the planet scale.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:34.470
I think we still
have some time, no?

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.320
So maybe I'll give you--

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.110
I will show you several photos
from our previous satellites

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:46.560
to give you some glimpse
into how beautiful photos

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.830
we can take from space.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:53.500
So this is-- ah,
thank you very much.

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:54.931
Yeah.

00:21:54.931 --> 00:21:59.480
So this is South America.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.150
Yeah, southern part
of South America.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.270
There is a glacier
there which is still not

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:06.540
affected by global warming.

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:13.380
This is a really beautiful
photo of a river in Madagascar.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.280
This is Mount Fuji in Japan.

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:22.278
And this is one small island
in the French Polynesia.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:30.100
And this is called
the Eye of Sahara.

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:33.700
It's in Mauritania,
as far as I remember.

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:37.330
And this photo was
taken in Algeria.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.860
Sand dunes.

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.184
And Italy.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:54.076
Minnesota, USA,
taken last winter.

00:22:54.076 --> 00:22:55.200
Everything covered in snow.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.990
And south part of New Zealand.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.440
Colorado, USA.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:12.960
And yeah, some plants
in Saudi Arabia.

00:23:18.295 --> 00:23:20.370
Bay of Hong Kong in China.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.637
So more at AxelGlobe.com.

00:23:29.637 --> 00:23:30.220
You can visit.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:35.570
You can see much
more photos there.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:40.460
You can enjoy how Earth
is beautiful there.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.210
