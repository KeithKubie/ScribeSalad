00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this problem, we want you to write a function that takes in a graph

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
represented as a list of tuples and returns a list of nodes

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that you would follow on in an Eulerian Tour.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For example, if the input graph was an edge between 1 and 2,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
an edge between 2 and 3, and an edge between 3 and 1,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
a possibly Eulerian Tour would be to go from node 1 to 2,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
from 2 to 3, and from 3 back to 1.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Write your code here.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We haven't provided any testing, and we recommend that you write your own test

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to verify if your answer is correct.
