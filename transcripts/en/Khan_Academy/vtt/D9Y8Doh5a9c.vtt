00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.098
- [Kim] So that takes us to our third

00:00:03.098 --> 00:00:07.512
and what will be final
expedition to the New World.

00:00:07.512 --> 00:00:08.993
- [Man] And this is where
the spooky part comes in.

00:00:08.993 --> 00:00:10.821
- [Kim] This is where
the spooky part comes in.

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:12.815
Sir Walter Raleigh and John White

00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:15.373
realized that a whole group
of soldiers was probably

00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:18.604
not the right group to
send to the New World.

00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:21.252
Instead he thinks, alright,
this is what we're gonna do.

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:22.857
We're gonna send civilians.

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:23.690
- [Man] Okay.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.587
- [Kim] We're gonna send families.

00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:27.754
So they send about 90 men,

00:00:29.194 --> 00:00:32.861
about 20 women, and
maybe about 10 children.

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:39.799
And say okay, you are
going to start a colony

00:00:41.947 --> 00:00:44.246
and a settlement in the New World.

00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:45.932
So it's not just a trading post.

00:00:45.932 --> 00:00:48.058
- [Man] Yo, but back up,
like still on Roanoke Island

00:00:48.058 --> 00:00:49.318
next to the Native Americans

00:00:49.318 --> 00:00:50.643
that hate them?
(laughing)

00:00:50.643 --> 00:00:52.585
Is that where they're
still putting the colony?

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.376
- [Kim] Well, they were really hoping

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:57.505
since they've discovered
that this is a terrible place

00:00:57.505 --> 00:00:58.338
to sail--

00:00:58.338 --> 00:00:59.671
- [Man] Uh huh?

00:00:59.671 --> 00:01:01.370
- [Kim] That they can actually head up

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.120
to the Chesapeake Bay

00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:07.827
and make that their place of operations.

00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:09.952
- [Man] Why not just make landfall there?

00:01:09.952 --> 00:01:11.629
- [Kim] Well, they usually started

00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:16.273
by going from England all
the way down to Bahamas.

00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:17.106
- [Man] Mm hmm.

00:01:17.106 --> 00:01:17.939
- [Kim] Where they could refuel.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.095
So this was an area where
they already had power.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:23.077
So instead of going to
the unknown land first,

00:01:23.077 --> 00:01:25.621
they would go down to
the West Indies, meet up,

00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:26.871
- [Man] Get fresh water, get food.

00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:28.904
- [Kim] Get fresh water and
supplies and then come up

00:01:28.904 --> 00:01:32.064
to Virginia, AKA North Carolina.

00:01:32.064 --> 00:01:34.266
Unfortunately, as the weather worked out,

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:36.537
they couldn't make it
farther than Roanoke Island.

00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:37.495
- [Man] Oh.

00:01:37.495 --> 00:01:39.707
- [Kim] So they are hanging out

00:01:39.707 --> 00:01:42.717
with what they hope are
their friends, the Secotans,

00:01:42.717 --> 00:01:45.310
and right after they get there

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.448
one of the English colonists is murdered

00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:49.314
by probably a Secotan person,

00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:52.597
and it's because they
say to their translators,

00:01:52.597 --> 00:01:55.968
we don't have enough food,
you're gonna steal more food

00:01:55.968 --> 00:01:57.747
and we just can't have you here.

00:01:57.747 --> 00:02:00.131
It's obvious that they
brought women and children,

00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:01.676
they're intending to stay,

00:02:01.676 --> 00:02:04.333
and the Native Americans have decided

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:06.529
that the English are not to be trusted.

00:02:06.529 --> 00:02:08.196
- [Man] So this is just a whole series

00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:12.664
of tragic diplomacy by
ultimatum movements, right?

00:02:12.664 --> 00:02:13.890
- [Kim] Yeah, it's really interesting

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.361
because I think there are
a couple of places here

00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:18.455
where things might have
gone very differently.

00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:20.118
- [Man] You can see the inflection points

00:02:20.118 --> 00:02:22.666
if both sides decided not to play hardball

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:23.691
with each other so much.

00:02:23.691 --> 00:02:26.266
- [Kim] Yeah, I think there
are so many places here

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.712
where ships get lost or they get grounded

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.902
on the shoals outside North Carolina

00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:34.209
so they can't get more supplies.

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.094
Or later storms will
prevent reinforcements.

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:41.574
Weather and a silver cup
are kind of the things

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:45.470
that keep the Roanoke
Colony from succeeding.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.637
So right away after this new
group of colonists arrives,

00:02:50.944 --> 00:02:51.875
one of them is murdered

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:53.730
and so they ask their
governor, John White,

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.377
to go back to England and
get them more supplies.

00:02:56.377 --> 00:02:57.348
- [Man] John White, the illustrator

00:02:57.348 --> 00:02:59.397
who made these images on the right.

00:02:59.397 --> 00:03:00.712
- [Kim] And he's now governor.

00:03:00.712 --> 00:03:01.545
- [Man] Okay.

00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:05.501
- [Kim] He's the only one
of the original Raleigh's 11

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.432
who's still part of this venture.

00:03:07.432 --> 00:03:09.221
So he's now moved up in the ranks.

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:11.842
So John White sails back to England,

00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:15.394
and then he runs into a big
problem, the Spanish, basically.

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:17.312
He wanted to get supplies.

00:03:17.312 --> 00:03:20.688
Some of these colonists,
including the Dares,

00:03:20.688 --> 00:03:23.241
are actually John White's children.

00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:24.369
- [Man] Oh, snap.

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:26.844
- [Kim] So this is his
actual family that's here

00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:28.149
that he's trying to protect.

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:29.515
So he goes back to England and he says,

00:03:29.515 --> 00:03:32.032
Sir Walter Raleigh, I
need more reinforcements.

00:03:32.032 --> 00:03:35.101
But all English shipping is cut off

00:03:35.101 --> 00:03:37.152
because of the threat of the Spanish.

00:03:37.152 --> 00:03:40.149
The Spanish Armada is coming
to England at this time period

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:42.283
and so not a single ship can be spared

00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:45.213
to go try to bail out these
colonists in the New World.

00:03:45.213 --> 00:03:46.256
- [Man] Oh, wow.

00:03:46.256 --> 00:03:49.637
So they're alone and entirely isolated

00:03:49.637 --> 00:03:52.940
on this new continent among
people that do not like them

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.050
because of stuff that
people before them did.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.385
- [Kim] Exactly, yeah,
that's about the size of it.

00:03:57.385 --> 00:03:58.802
So it's like 1588

00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:03.231
when John White sails back to England

00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:07.789
and because of the Spanish
Armada it's not until 1590

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.507
that he can finally get back

00:04:09.507 --> 00:04:12.783
and try to find these
colonists including his family.

00:04:12.783 --> 00:04:13.616
- [Man] Right.

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:15.589
- [Kim] When he gets there
this is all he finds,

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:18.839
the word, Croatoan, carved into a tree.

00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:21.209
- [Man] What do you mean all he found?

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.208
What happened to their town?

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:23.825
- [Kim] It was completely abandoned.

00:04:23.825 --> 00:04:24.743
- [Man] Whoa.

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:28.429
- [Kim] So it looks as if they'd
left of their own volition.

00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:29.470
- Okay.
- Because it doesn't look

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.113
like there was an attack there.

00:04:31.113 --> 00:04:33.683
And they had agreed beforehand

00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:36.045
that if they decided to go somewhere else,

00:04:36.045 --> 00:04:37.539
remember, they already knew that they were

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.442
in unwelcome territory,

00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:41.711
so they thought maybe
they'd go farther inland,

00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:44.332
they would leave traces,

00:04:44.332 --> 00:04:46.204
they would carve something in a tree

00:04:46.204 --> 00:04:47.601
to say where they had gone.

00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:49.600
Unfortunately, another storm hit,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.038
and so John White was forced to leave

00:04:52.038 --> 00:04:55.630
and go back to England without ever going

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.871
to see the Croatoans, this
other Native American tribe,

00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:02.625
along with their town called, Croatoan,

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:04.654
to see where the rest of his family

00:05:04.654 --> 00:05:06.307
and the rest of the colonists were.

00:05:06.307 --> 00:05:07.751
- [Man] Did he ever
return in his lifetime?

00:05:07.751 --> 00:05:08.766
- [Kim] No he did not.

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:10.081
- [Man] Oh, that's heartbreaking.

00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:12.539
- [Kim] So he never found out
what happened to his family,

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.989
and technically we never
found out what happened

00:05:15.989 --> 00:05:17.565
to the Lost Colony at Roanoke,

00:05:17.565 --> 00:05:19.175
but there's some pretty good evidence

00:05:19.175 --> 00:05:21.128
about what might have happened to them.

00:05:21.128 --> 00:05:21.961
- [Man] Tell it to me, Kim.

00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:24.697
- [Kim] Alright, so here's what
we think may have happened.

00:05:24.697 --> 00:05:28.185
So there are about 130 people, right?

00:05:28.185 --> 00:05:29.507
- [Man] Right.

00:05:29.507 --> 00:05:31.747
- [Kim] Assuming that none
of them died from disease.

00:05:31.747 --> 00:05:32.925
- [Man] That's a charitable assumption.

00:05:32.925 --> 00:05:33.758
- [Kim] Yeah.

00:05:33.758 --> 00:05:37.163
Not all of them could have gone to see

00:05:37.163 --> 00:05:38.949
and live with the Croatoans.

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:39.782
- [Man] Okay.

00:05:39.782 --> 00:05:40.615
- [Kim] Right, because they were

00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:42.143
a much smaller tribe than that.

00:05:42.143 --> 00:05:44.927
So they could never have been
all supported by these people.

00:05:44.927 --> 00:05:48.927
What we think happened
is that some of them went

00:05:50.198 --> 00:05:53.135
to live with the Croatoans
who are along the coast.

00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:55.668
So if John White comes back

00:05:55.668 --> 00:05:59.001
then they can connect up with him again.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.815
So that's what we think
happened to some of them.

00:06:03.815 --> 00:06:07.685
We also think that some of
them went further inland

00:06:07.685 --> 00:06:10.018
to a more stable environment

00:06:11.251 --> 00:06:14.597
around what is maybe called, Merry Hill.

00:06:14.597 --> 00:06:15.597
So about 15,

00:06:17.138 --> 00:06:20.262
oh sorry, about 50 miles
inland from Roanoke Island.

00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:21.095
- [Man] Okay.

00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:22.865
- [Kim] Today Merry Hill, North Carolina.

00:06:22.865 --> 00:06:26.698
And we think some of
them may have gone north.

00:06:27.781 --> 00:06:30.912
So here's the evidence
about these various things.

00:06:30.912 --> 00:06:33.006
- [Man] How do we know that
these colonists went there?

00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:36.641
- [Kim] So when John White
was sailing to Roanoke

00:06:36.641 --> 00:06:40.977
he saw big fires along the
coast where the Croatoans lived.

00:06:40.977 --> 00:06:42.996
So we think the English
may have been there

00:06:42.996 --> 00:06:45.478
trying to signal them, but
he went straight to Roanoke,

00:06:45.478 --> 00:06:47.437
and then because of his
troubles with his ship

00:06:47.437 --> 00:06:48.680
had to go back to England.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.317
So there's strong evidence there.

00:06:50.317 --> 00:06:53.986
Also, later an Englishman heard a legend

00:06:53.986 --> 00:06:56.053
from the people who lived in that region

00:06:56.053 --> 00:06:58.690
that some of their ancestors
had been White people,

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.478
and they had English coins.

00:07:00.478 --> 00:07:02.684
So I think it's probably safe to say

00:07:02.684 --> 00:07:06.566
that some of them did actually
intermarry with Croatoans

00:07:06.566 --> 00:07:09.659
and lived there for most
of the rest of their lives.

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:12.398
The ones who went north

00:07:12.398 --> 00:07:15.808
we know about because John Smith,

00:07:15.808 --> 00:07:20.113
the captain of the
Jamestown Colony in 1607,

00:07:20.113 --> 00:07:23.843
met up with some Native
Americans who told him

00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:27.403
that there had been White
people living in the area

00:07:27.403 --> 00:07:31.196
who had lived peacefully
among the Native Americans

00:07:31.196 --> 00:07:33.857
until just recently
when they were massacred

00:07:33.857 --> 00:07:35.448
by the Powhatans.

00:07:35.448 --> 00:07:38.102
Powhatan was the father
of Pocahontas, right?

00:07:38.102 --> 00:07:41.004
So there's some overlap here.

00:07:41.004 --> 00:07:42.903
- [Man] So he was trying
to get the lay of the land,

00:07:42.903 --> 00:07:46.754
how the local people
felt about the English,

00:07:46.754 --> 00:07:48.192
and the intelligence that he got was,

00:07:48.192 --> 00:07:49.812
oh, everyone's cool with the English

00:07:49.812 --> 00:07:51.699
except for the people that
you're living right next to.

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:55.263
- [Kim] (laughs) I think it
was probably intended, yeah,

00:07:55.263 --> 00:07:56.673
to be maybe a warning.

00:07:56.673 --> 00:07:57.506
- [Man] Yeah.

00:07:57.506 --> 00:07:59.651
- [Kim] We think what might
actually have happened

00:07:59.651 --> 00:08:03.345
was that the people from
Roanoke had intermarried

00:08:03.345 --> 00:08:05.163
with another Native American tribe

00:08:05.163 --> 00:08:08.109
and had become kind of
indistinguishable from them,

00:08:08.109 --> 00:08:11.759
and then the Powhatans, who
were kind of a larger empire,

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:12.953
actually attacked them.

00:08:12.953 --> 00:08:15.122
So they were killed off in a raid

00:08:15.122 --> 00:08:16.920
against other Native American groups.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.753
- [Man] I see.

00:08:17.753 --> 00:08:19.253
- [Kim] And the last thing that we think

00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:21.322
that they probably went inland

00:08:21.322 --> 00:08:24.162
is from a recent archaeological dig

00:08:24.162 --> 00:08:27.520
which has discovered, it's
called English Border ware.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.180
- [Man] Okay.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.421
- [Kim] In this town near
Merry Hill, North Carolina,

00:08:32.421 --> 00:08:34.527
and it was only made in this time period

00:08:34.527 --> 00:08:38.114
before these English colonists left.

00:08:38.114 --> 00:08:40.780
So we know it has to have dated before

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.446
1588.
- [Man] 90 or so, okay.

00:08:42.446 --> 00:08:46.214
- [Kim] Yeah, so it's highly
likely that at least some

00:08:46.214 --> 00:08:48.558
of those people had
been living in this area

00:08:48.558 --> 00:08:50.914
because we have an
archaeological record of them.

00:08:50.914 --> 00:08:52.339
- [Man] That's so cool.

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:53.876
- [Kim] What I think is
really interesting about this

00:08:53.876 --> 00:08:56.660
is we actually know a lot more about this

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.651
than I think popular
legend says that we do.

00:08:59.651 --> 00:09:00.484
- [Man] Yeah, I always thought

00:09:00.484 --> 00:09:01.915
that the Lost Colony at Roanoke

00:09:01.915 --> 00:09:05.438
was one of those unsolvable
secrets of history.

00:09:05.438 --> 00:09:06.482
- [Kim] I think it tells us a lot

00:09:06.482 --> 00:09:08.441
about the historical process.

00:09:08.441 --> 00:09:10.570
In some ways we know a lot about this.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.315
In other ways we don't know much at all.

00:09:13.315 --> 00:09:14.723
There are some things in history

00:09:14.723 --> 00:09:18.453
that we don't have records
about, and perhaps never will.

00:09:18.453 --> 00:09:20.231
But if I had to say that there's one thing

00:09:20.231 --> 00:09:23.846
that's really haunting
about this Colony at Roanoke

00:09:23.846 --> 00:09:27.452
is just how different
things might have been

00:09:27.452 --> 00:09:29.934
had they chosen to be friendly

00:09:29.934 --> 00:09:31.857
about the theft of a silver cup,

00:09:31.857 --> 00:09:33.198
that may or may not have happened,

00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:35.771
rather than angry and violent.

00:09:35.771 --> 00:09:38.440
We could be talking about
the Colony of Roanoke

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.782
as the very first
successful English Colony

00:09:41.782 --> 00:09:42.725
in the New World.

00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:44.875
- [Man] You and I could have been speaking

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:47.339
an Algonquian-English dialect right now.

00:09:47.339 --> 00:09:48.344
- [Kim] Quite possibly.

00:09:48.344 --> 00:09:51.486
So it shows us just how important

00:09:51.486 --> 00:09:54.609
even the smallest events in history can be

00:09:54.609 --> 00:09:56.105
to the way that things turn out,

00:09:56.105 --> 00:09:58.212
and how much people's
choices really do matter.
