00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.640
Okay, so we've related our attendees to festivals. So

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.000
here we see the Johnny Concerts going in the Cloudstock,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.040
which is very cool. so in theory if I click

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.890
this, I should be able to see everyone is going.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.040
&gt;&gt; You should see Johnny and Missy.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.660
&gt;&gt; Right cool. I think I'm really starting to get to know Johnny and Missy.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.660
&gt;&gt;

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.504
[LAUGH]

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:19.004
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.440
And it's not a field, it's this other, so fields are up here. Festival name and

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.260
all that. But this is something different, and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.030
it's just a list of all these attendees.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.380
&gt;&gt; So that's what came up at the final

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.860
step of the Field Creation Wizard. That was adding

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.730
this related list, which is just a list of

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.730
related records Onto the page layout for the festival.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.280
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay, so great. We have our

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.990
two attendees, who bought some number of tickets

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.760
I assume. But it still, I mean, of

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.510
course, it still says tickets sold as zero. There's

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.280
no way it would have known. ideally, I don't,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.980
you know, I don't like that. What can we?

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.230
&gt;&gt; Well there is a way that it would have known.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.200
And so it's really great that we can create some automated calculated

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.200
fields in Salesforce. So, we've kind of brushed upon the different

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.970
data types, but we haven't talked about roll-up summaries or formula fields.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.280
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.950
&gt;&gt; And so, with a roll-up summary, you're able to summarize information

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.350
about related records.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.700
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.160
&gt;&gt; And so, let's create a roll-up summary, based off of the attendees

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.720
to show how many tickets have been sold in total at the concert.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.210
&gt;&gt; Okay. And, can we do that? I'd actually,

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.600
I don't like how we did this. I would

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.010
rather keep track of the VIP tickets sold, and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.160
the general admission tickets sold separately. Can we do that?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.880
&gt;&gt; We can. We can just create a filter on the summary, so.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.320
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.830
&gt;&gt; Super easy. So again, let's just go to the Quick Access menu.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.140
And create a new field.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.080
&gt;&gt; Okay, we've got a new field. And you

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.540
said roll up summary, but it is grayed out, Sam.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.100
&gt;&gt; So this comes back to me just skipping through, choosing lookup over

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.320
master detail. you can only create your roll up summary when the relationship

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.430
is through a master detail relationship. And since we created a lookup, we're

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.360
not able to do rollup summaries. But thankfully, we can change it now

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.090
that we've related all of our attendees

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.930
to a festival into a master detail relationship.

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.720
So let's go back really quickly to the

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.330
attendee fields, and we can just change that.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.440
&gt;&gt; Okay. Sounds good.
