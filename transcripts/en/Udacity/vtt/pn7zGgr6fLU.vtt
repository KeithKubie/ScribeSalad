00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.410
The correct answer is SELECT gender,

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.656
district, sum aadhaar_generated FROM aadhaar_data WHERE age

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:14.827
&gt; 50 GROUP BY gender, district. Let's talk through this query. First, we

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:18.230
wanted to know how many men and women in each district had aadhaar

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.530
generated. So we select gender, district

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.780
and sum aadhaar_generated from the aadhaar_data table.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.050
Since we're using an aggregate function, we need to include a group by,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.380
with our non-aggregated fields, in this

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.190
case, district and gender. Finally, we want

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.860
to limit this to men and women over the age of 50. So,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.031
we include the where clause, WHERE age &gt; 50, after the table name.
