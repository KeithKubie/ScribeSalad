00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.720
Our culture strongly inclines us to the view

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:09.000
that genuine love must involve complete acceptance of another person in their good and

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.240
especially in their somewhat bad sides.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.770
In moments of fury with our partners, we may be tempted to dismiss their complaints against us, with the cry:

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.050
"Just love me as I am!"

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.479
but in truth none of us should want to remain

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.599
exactly as we are in love and therefore none of us should, too strongly,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.650
want another person to love as opposed to tolerate or simply forgive what is warped within us.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.430
Genuine love might be defined as gently and kindly helping someone to become the best version of themselves,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.220
not accepting themselves precisely as they are.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:05.100
It isn't a betrayal of love for someone to try to help us to evolve, to teach us, to become better people.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.440
In fact, it may be the highest proof of genuine commitment.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.520
Unfortunately, under the sway of a romantic ideology that makes us suspicious

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:25.580
of emotional education, most of us end up being terrible teachers and equally terrible students in relationships.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.620
We don't accept the legitimacy,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.960
let alone the nobility of others desire to teach us and we can't acknowledge areas, where

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.409
we might need to be taught. We rebel against the very structure of a lover's education

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.429
that would enable criticism to be molded into sensible sounding lessons and to be heard as

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.949
caring attempts to reject the more troublesome aspects of our personalities.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.740
At the first sign that the other person is adopting a "teacherly" tone, we tend to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.069
assume that we're being attacked and betrayed and therefore

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.080
we close our ears to the instruction reacting with sarcasm and aggression to the teacher.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.919
Our stance is deeply understandable. To the mother everything

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.280
about her tiny infant is delightful. They wouldn't change even the smallest thing; their baby

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.980
is perfect just as it is.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.410
Our idea of love has taken this kind of attitude very much to heart.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.970
It's what we grow up thinking that love is supposed to be like.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.969
The suggestion that another person could

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.070
want us to change grow or improve is taken as an insult to love.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:48.339
The problem is, the mother never in fact loved us just as we were. She hoped

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.980
we would keep growing up. And the need to keep growing up is still there.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.489
Our bodies may be fully formed but our psyches always have some growing up still to do.

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.048
We should never hold it against our lovers if they don't love us just as we are.

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.549
They're doing something far more generousâ€” wanting us to be a little better.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.309
If you want to learn more about love, try our book on how to find love, which explains why

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.970
we have the types we do, and how our early experiences give us scripts of how, and whom we love.
