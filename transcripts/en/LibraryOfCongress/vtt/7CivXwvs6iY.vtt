00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.610
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.760
&gt;&gt; Grant Harris: Welcome,
Your Excellency,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.580
distinguished guests,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.970
Good morning, and welcome
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.270
I am Grant Harris.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.250
I'm Chief of the European Division.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.610
We would like to thank the
Embassy of Finland for working

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.550 position:56%
with the Library on this celebration

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.000
of 100 years of Finnish
independence.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.280
This is really a great
year, great event.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
And we thank all of the
staff members at the Embassy

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.510
and at the Library here who
made this event possible.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.900
Very briefly, let me say that
the Library of Congress is proud

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.370
of its approximately 100,000
volumes from or about Finland.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.760
Among other things, we have an
extensive collection of monographs

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.380
on the subjects of the Finnish
language, which is featured today,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.610
as well as Finns in the United
States and Finnish-Americans.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.710
Between 400 and 500 volumes from
Finland or about Finland arrive

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.150
at the Library each year.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.630
The European Division is
responsible for providing reference

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.350
and for developing the
Library's collections relating

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.640
to Continental Europe.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.970
We hope you will come again to
explore the Library's collections,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.770
and that you have a
pleasant time here today.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.660
Now, for the inevitable
announcement --

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.570
your cell phones, take a look
at them if you haven't already.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.720
Be aware also that this
event is being recorded

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.150
for Library of Congress webcast.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.390
This is not a live event for
the outside, but eventually,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.310
it will be made into a webcast.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.260
It is now my pleasure to introduce
Her Excellency, the Ambassador

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.010
of Finland to the United
States, Kirsti Kauppi.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.180
She came to Washington as
the Ambassador in 2015,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.270
but she has previous experience
in the Embassy of Finland.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.890
She was here from 1997 to 2000.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.700
Ambassador Kauppi has over 30 years
of experience in foreign policy,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.360
and has traveled widely,
starting from her native Oulu area

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.720
in northern Finland, which is not
too far south of the Arctic Circle.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.600
With a master's degree in
economics, she began working

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.150
in development cooperation.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.170
Then, moving to the political
side of foreign relations,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.510
she worked at Finland's
permanent representation to the EU

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.780
in Brussels, and at Finnish
Embassies in Bangkok and Berlin.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.230
Madame Kauppi has been Director
General of the Political Department

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.260
at the Finnish State Department.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.810
Most recently, she served
as Ambassador to Austria,

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.520
and Finland's permanent
representative

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:13.340
to the International Atomic Energy
Agency, and to other UN agencies.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.840
Don't be surprised if you meet her
bicycling around in Washington,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.020
D.C. She is an avid reader,
also, of works on history.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.460
She's fluent in English,
Swedish, German and French,

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.230
so she could really take advantage
of our European collections.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.360
We'd like you to work in
our division, actually.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.780
After remarks by the Ambassador,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.020
we will meet our distinguished
panelists

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.200
and hear their presentations, but
I give you now the Ambassador.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.000
Thank you for being here.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.290
[ Applause ]

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.760
&gt;&gt; Kirsti Kauppi: Good
morning, [foreign language].

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.090
Thank you very much
for the introduction,

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.480
and I'll consider your offer.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.520
Sometimes my job as Ambassador
is quite demanding and stressful,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.200
and I wouldn't mind switching
over to the Library of Congress,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.100
maybe, at some point of time.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.370 position:56%
It's -- I'm very grateful to the
Library of Congress, and, of course,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.010 position:56%
to my own staff at the Embassy of
Finland, that this event has been --

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.490
is now organized, and
is taking place.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.470
I think the Library of
Congress is really something

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.250
like not only a national treasure
for the United States of America,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.880
but actually an international
treasure,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.300
and the facts that you
gave about Finland --

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.410
connection to Finland and
the collections related

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:46.170
to Finland are -- show that this
institution is very important

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.960
for Finland also, and I think for
basically every country on earth.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.420
So congratulations for that, and
we are very happy to cooperate

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.570
with the Library of Congress.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.270
And we are very grateful for the
attention the Library has given

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.850
to Finland, and the
Finnish language.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.060
Yes, we have the centennial
of our independence,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.460
100 years of Finnish independence,
and our language is very much

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.300
in the core of the national
identity of Finland and Finns.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.650
There is a twist there,
which is that we are --

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.720
we have two official languages.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.920
So it's not only the Finnish
language that is in the core

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.870
of the national identity.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.540
It is also very much
the Swedish language,

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.710
and the fact that we
are a Nordic country.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.070
That is a big part of our identity.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:51.590
Finnish language is beautiful,
difficult, very expressive,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:06:00.180 position:56%
and I think really quite an exciting
environment to study, to live in.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.840
And the way -- I mean, the
Finnish language is a little bit

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.150
like Finland.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:13.100
It's almost like an island, which
means you have an environment

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.830
where you tend to develop
something quite special,

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.980
and quite different
from anything else.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.980
And I think the Finnish language
has allowed that kind of a --

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:30.630
you know, a world of its own
for Finns and Finnish speakers.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:39.540
And I think it also shows in the
way the language has evolved.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.640
Teaching the language, and studying
the language is very important.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.910
It is like, you know,
history or anything else.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.550
Like, if you walk the
streets of Washington,

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.370
D.C. and you don't know anything
about the history of the buildings,

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.810
or what has happened
here, it's only maybe 5%

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.390
that you understand
about what you see.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.190
And that is a little bit
the same with the language.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.400
If you just hear it, or read it,
and take it, well, maybe it's more

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:25.100 position:56%
than 5%, but you really get a deeper
understanding, and you can master --

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.790
excuse me -- master the language
only if you study the history,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.920
the structure, and
so on and so forth.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:40.270
I'm old enough to have
gone to school at the stage

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:44.760
when you really studied the
language in much detail.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.130
And I don't know the terms in
English, but the way you had

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.600
to study your own language
was really quite something.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.350
And I think that is very
much still behind the fact

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.800
that Finns are very literate,

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.780
and they not only can
read, but they do read.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:11.950
And they love to read
different kinds of literature,

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.760
and also factual literature.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:22.270
Reading is important,
and that is the area

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:27.820
that I'm very worried
about also in Finland.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.230
People read less, especially
the young people,

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.050
especially boys, read less.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:39.490 position:56%
And I think that's going to have --
unless we can do something about it,

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.260
and I believe we can
do something about it,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:47.390
that can have a very negative
influence not only on the --

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.860
how we speak and use the language,

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:55.840
but on how we understand
the world around us.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:02.970
Reading different kinds of
literature is -- it's sort of --

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:10.220
it's really important in
reaching your own mind,

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.860
and bringing the world to you.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:20.630
So -- but I think today, we are
really going to hear and learn

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.300
about the history of the Finnish
language, how it is today,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:30.480
and also how Finnish language
has evolved in this environment,

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.100
in the U.S., which is very,
very interesting as well.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:37.070
And I'm very happy to
see that there are --

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.980
there's quite a lot of
material on the screens.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.860
Also quite funny material,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.210
which also is circulating
in our social media.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.150
And that's great, because
some of the --

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.400
some of the examples here
I think are very good

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:59.090
in raising the interest
towards the Finnish language.

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:08.970 position:56%
The final point about, you know, how
the interest towards language rises,

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:12.700
or sort of where are the
rules for the interest,

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.910
that's also sometimes interesting.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.350
When I served in Austria,

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:20.960
there's also Finnish language
teaching in the university.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.490
I went to meet the class.

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:32.950
It was something like 20 people,
around -- maybe from 17 to 35,

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:34.970
and I was looking around.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:40.540
It was people with black
clothes, and black hair,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.110
and a little bit eccentric makeup.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:49.460
And I asked each of
them, "Why do you --

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.250
why do you want to learn Finnish?"

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:56.630
And they all referred to the
heavy metal bands in Finland.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.930
So --

00:10:57.930 --> 00:10:59.230
[ Laughter ]

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.130
&gt;&gt; Very interesting,
but also, I love the --

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.030
you know, that kind of
stories, because it shows

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.350
that there are links --
different kinds of links,

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.790 position:56%
and people really are very creative.

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:13.710
In any case, I'm very
happy to be here.

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:17.070
I have to leave a little
bit early, but very grateful

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:22.220 position:56%
that this seminar takes place, and
very eager to hear from the experts.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.510 position:56%
So thank you, everybody, for coming.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:36.440
[ Applause ]

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.740
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:42.120
[Foreign language], Finland 100.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.830
I'm Taru Spiegel from
the European Division.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:47.450
I work there with Nordic books.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:51.630
And I know that everybody's eager
to hear from our presenters,

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:54.240
so I will be brief
in the introductions.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.400
And I'm going to do this in order
of presentation, so this time,

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.840
it will be gentlemen first.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.640
So Daniel Karvonen works at
the University of Minnesota.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.030
His Ph.D. is in linguistics with
a specialization in phonology,

00:12:08.030 --> 00:12:12.520 position:56%
and his research and publications
are in word prosity, metrical theory

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.460
and the phonology of loan words
with an empirical focus on Finnish.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:19.690
Dan is a fourth-generation
Finnish-American,

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.360
and has spent much time in Finland.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.900 position:56%
And this was the hardest part to
introduce because of all these words

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.540
like word prosity, and
phonology, and so forth.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.860
But we'll hear about it from Dan.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.540
Alli Flint was born
and raised in Finland.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:35.590
Her doctoral research was in
linguistics and Uralic studies,

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:36.890
and she has had a long

00:12:36.890 --> 00:12:40.980
and distinguished career
at Columbia University.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.420
Alli and her late husband,
Professor Austin Flint,

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.560
collaborated on translating
numerous works from Finnish.

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.380 position:56%
They were presented with a Finlandia
Foundation Award for their work

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.990
on behalf of Finnish culture, and
Alli's also a Knight, First Class,

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.380 position:56%
of the Order of the Lion of Finland.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.810
Hillary Virtanen comes from
Finlandia University of Michigan,

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.540
as well as the University
of Wisconsin, Madison,

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.100
where she received her Ph.D. in
Scandinavian studies and folklore.

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.240
Her research interests center on
Finnish-American folklore, orality

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.710
and literacy in folk culture,

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:17.230
and on protest-oriented folk music
among Finnish-American laborers.

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:20.460
She's a fourth- and
fifth-generation Finnish-American.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:23.510
So please welcome our
distinguished panelists.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:32.370
[ Applause ]

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.670
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen:
Okay, [foreign language].

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.650
Good morning.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.950
I like the response.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.250
That's very nice.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.060
You're learning after the third
time, see, after the Ambassador,

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.630 position:56%
and after Taru both introduced that.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:48.280 position:56%
My name is Dan Karvonen, and as
Taru said, I'm a lecturer of Finnish

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:49.580
at the University of Minnesota.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.510 position:56%
And I first want to say thank you to
Taru from the Library of Congress,

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.190
and the Ambassador, and all of
the Ambassador's staff, for this,

00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:00.100
for inviting us to
speak at this event.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:04.440
It's really a pleasure and a thrill
to be at the Library of Congress.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.980
And back home, when I was telling
people what I was doing this week,

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.640
why I wasn't going to be at work,
I said, "Well, I'm giving a talk

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.460
at the Library of Congress,"
and in Minnesota,

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.900
that's kind of a big deal.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.040
[ Laughter ]

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.840
So anyway, here we are,
and it's quite exciting.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.140
So, all right.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.020
So I'm going to talk
about why Finnish is so --

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.320
why is Finnish so different?

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.940
So there's sort of -- you know,
if you ask people about Finnish,

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.860
and the Ambassador already
alluded to this, said,

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.360
you know, Finnish is difficult.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.680
Finnish is different.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.310
You know, what -- what is it?

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.610
Why is it so different?

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:38.010
And then, we're going to look
at it both from the structure,

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.420
and also sort of the history.

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.800
So I wanted to start out
by talking about myths.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.200
So there are a lot of myths
going out there, and as we saw,

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.760
the slideshow that was going
before I started talking,

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.340
you saw all these nice memes
kind of coming across the screen.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.670
And a lot of people have
probably seen those memes.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:57.810
And here's a couple that
you might have seen,

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.170 position:56%
the welcome to the Finnish language.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:03.420
I like that the Embassy had
the same one that I have.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.500
There's -- and there's
also this other one

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:08.120
with the 10 oldest languages
still spoken in the world today,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.770
and Finnish is apparently
one of those.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.250
That's what people say.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:12.810
So this is what people say.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:14.110
People say, "Look at this.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:15.410
Welcome to the Finnish language.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:16.710
Look at this difficult language.

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.380
You take -- " this graphic
in the middle is an example

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.780
of where you take one word, and
you add all these different kinds

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:26.180
of suffixes, and you can
create all these other words.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.890
So that must mean that Finnish is
just this crazy difficult language,

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:31.190
right?

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.490
Just by virtue of that.

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:34.930
And then, on the right here, you
have this example of all the --

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:36.230
the case system of Finnish.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.470
Finnish has 15 cases, and people
say, "Finnish is difficult

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:42.080
because it has 15 cases."

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.670
Right? So instead of saying
something like "in", in English,

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.950
you would say -- add the
suffix S-S-A, or S-S-ah, saw,

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:50.400
sah [phonetic] for example.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.590
And people say, "That's what
makes Finnish difficult."

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.830
And then, you have this sort of
idea out there that Finnish is one

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.500
of the oldest languages
in the world today.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.880
I would really like to say
that none of this is true.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.350
And I'll tell you why.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.030
So number one, I'll start with
the oldest languages in the world.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:14.000
I mean, that's kind of a crazy
idea, that languages are old.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.670
If the language is
spoken, it's modern.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.960
It's new. So this -- anytime
I see something like this --

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.920
and people forward things
like this to me all the time.

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.410
I just say, "Wait,
wait, wait, what is --

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:24.070
you know that that can't be true."

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.370
Languages -- what they -- what
they're trying to say, maybe,

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.640
is that these are languages that
maybe have not changed a lot,

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.950
but there's really
different from saying

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.790
that a language is old, or new.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.520
All languages are -- that are
spoken now are equally modern.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.730
There's nothing old about them.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:43.650
And then the whole idea of the case
endings making Finnish difficult --

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:46.400
that's not a difficult
thing to learn.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.350
In English, we say "in,"
we say "from," we say "to."

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:55.010
In Finnish, you just learn the
endings that relate to those.

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:56.520
That's -- there's nothing
difficult about that.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.890
That's 15 things to learn.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.660
That's not a huge task.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.310
And I will argue about the
graphic in the middle if that --

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.680
that actually is what makes
Finnish easy, not difficult.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.560
At the aspect of taking
a single word,

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.580
and then basing all these
other words on this --

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.890
this is what makes
Finnish easy to learn.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.960
So let's take a look at that.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.310
So what is the Foreign
Service Institute saying?

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.510 position:56%
So I was looking for the original --

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.540 position:56%
there are people from the Foreign
Service Institute here today, but --

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:24.180
and I've seen different
categorizations.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.330
But different sources that you
look at, they put Finnish as one

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.320
of the more difficult
languages, right?

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.520
So there are these different
categories, a language that is --

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:36.760
and it's based on sort of the
degree of relationship to English.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.440
These are all from the perspective
of an English speaker, of course.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.540
Right? There are two factors
that factor into this.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.730
One of them is the degree of
relatedness of the language

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.040
to English, and the second one is
sort of the cultural differences.

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:51.660
So we can see languages like
Dutch and Swedish, they're related

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.270
to English, being Germanic
languages.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:55.310
And then, culturally,
they're -- there's --

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.610
there's a lot of similarities

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.430
between American culture
and European culture.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.730
And then you see category two.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.280
You have German, but
then you have Swahili.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.300
So here, we have a different
culture, but we have a language

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:09.370
that is maybe not so
difficult to learn,

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.920
compared to Finnish,
for English speakers.

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:14.790
And then we say Finnish is in
the same category as Kazakh,

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:17.470
and then we see category four,
with Chinese and Japanese.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:18.770
And one of the big things

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.080
about those two languages
is the writing systems.

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.380
But not only that.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.420
Japanese, for example,
is the politeness levels.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:29.710 position:56%
So there's all kinds of factors that
go into what makes a language --

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:31.030
learning a language difficult.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:34.480
Right? So it's not just --
it's not just people out there.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.650 position:56%
There are experts out there that say
that actually, we need more weeks --

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.880
more weeks to actually learn
Finnish than we do to learn Dutch.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.000
And you can see this
in practice, if you --

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.820 position:56%
I was an exchange student in Finland
in high school, and most of us were

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.310
in Finnish-speaking
homes, but some people were

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.610
in Swedish-speaking homes.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.770
And occasionally, during the
year, we would get together.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:54.660
And the ones that were in
Swedish-speaking homes,

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:56.260
after three months, they
could already speak.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.220 position:56%
And the ones in the Finnish-speaking
homes were just barely able

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:02.330
to get a single word
out of their mouth.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:03.840
So there's the proof right there.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.110
The proof is -- and
this is from the --

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.760
the perspective of
an English speaker.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:14.770
So one of the reasons that Finnish
is so difficult is this, is this.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.960
So how many people do not know
Finnish in the room at all?

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.320
Okay, so there's some.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.620
I know there are a lot of people --

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.020
I've talked to a lot of people
[inaudible] know Finnish.

00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.630
But people that don't know Finnish,
can you guess what this is about?

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.100
Can you have any guesses?

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:30.520
This is from the Finnish news.

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.020
I just plucked it off yesterday.

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.570
I wanted to get fresh news.

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:35.530
I just took a paragraph
from a news article.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:37.020
Any guesses to what this is about?

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.790
Is it a letter to grandma?

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.380
Is it about the weather?

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:46.870 position:56%
Is it about, you know, the hurricane
that sort of went to Ireland?

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:48.170
Is it about any of those things?

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.310
Is there anything we can grab onto?

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:51.830
No. Nothing.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:53.130
&gt;&gt; Asia.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:54.430
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Pardon?

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:55.730
&gt;&gt; Asia.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.030
&gt;&gt; Asia.

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.330
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Asia?

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:59.630
Yeah, no. That's actually not Asia.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:00.930
That's actually not Asia.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:02.230
Yeah, that's asia.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:03.530
Yeah, it's actually not even Asia.

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.160
Yeah. That's not -- that's
actually -- asia means matter.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.100
So you don't -- yeah.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:11.030
So there's not even a
single cognate in this text.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.330
And this is the --

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:13.630
&gt;&gt; Rosatom.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.930
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Rosatom.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.230
That's a name.

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:17.530
Yeah, that's a proper name.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:18.830
That's the only thing, right?

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:20.140
And there's another surname
in there, Hanhikiven.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.680
But none of the other words
have any cognates in English.

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.630 position:56%
So this is what -- this is one of
the reasons that Finnish is sort of,

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:28.530
in a way, impenetrable
to English speakers,

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:32.230
is that if you study a language
like French, or German, or Swedish,

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.400
you can look at a text, and you
can just guess sort of what --

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.760
what it -- what it's about.

00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.300
This is actually about
nuclear energy.

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:42.870
So you wouldn't know
by looking at this.

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:45.620
And we can contrast
this with French.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.400
So I just pulled this out
of "Le Monde", just also,

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.860
just to give an example of
kind of a random article.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.280 position:56%
And we look at this, and right away,
as English speakers, you don't need

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.900
to know French to recognize
all kinds of words, right?

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.030
And we can see them -- I've just
highlighted them here in yellow.

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.440 position:56%
My color scheme, by the way, is a --

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.390
is a bow to the two official
languages of Finland.

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:08.960
If you haven't noticed that,
the blue and the white --

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.070
the blue and the white,
and the yellow.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.920
So yellow is my accent color.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:16.850
But you can see malady,
neurology, generally --

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.180
you can see that learning French,

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:21.630
there's just so much you
get for free, for example.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.360 position:56%
Right? You don't get that for free
when you're studying Finnish, right?

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.690
All these words are
just completely --

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:29.040
I mean, there are definitely loan
words, and I'll talk about that,

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.360
from English and other languages.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.290
But they're not as frequent,
and the overlap is much less.

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:41.930
So this is one description that I
-- someone told me a long time ago,

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.320
and I use it all the time,
because I love it so much.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:47.310
So people have said, "Learning
Finnish is like a pyramid,

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:50.400
and learning English is like
an upside-down pyramid."

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.580
So what does that mean?

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:53.880
What does that mean?

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.340
Well, if you take an example
of English -- so the --

00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.400
what this means is that, at the
bottom of the pyramid for English,

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.300
you don't need to know
very much to get going.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:06.730
You can kind of just pluck words
out of a dictionary and speak,

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.200
because English doesn't
have much morphology.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.840
So if you take the
sentence on the left there,

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.940
"The boys have two plates," all you
have to do is go in the dictionary.

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.690
The, boy, have, two,
plates, and you just have

00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.560
to put an S for the plural.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.030
You just slap it on, and
you've got your sentence.

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:24.860
There's absolutely no manipulation
you have to do to that sentence

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:26.410
to make it a good English sentence.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:28.150
And it sounds perfect, right?

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:29.810
Completely perfect.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.320
So it's dictionary-plucking.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.740
So pull the words out,
and not much morphology.

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:38.040
That exact same sentence in
Finnish is not at all like that.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.340
So [foreign language].

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:46.140
There's a lot of manipulation that
the learner of Finnish has to do

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.980
in order to make that
sentence sound correct.

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.940
So one thing about it
is, the word in Finnish

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:52.320
for boy is [foreign language].

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.120
So in Finnish, we don't
have a verb for to have.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.020
Instead, we say at.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.140
So I would say, "I have a car."

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.760
[Foreign language],
"At me is a car."

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.760
So for one thing, the structure
is completely different.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.280 position:56%
And here, we see [foreign language].

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.260
What we have to do the
word [foreign language],

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.380
we have to add this L-L-A
ending on it, and then we have

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:16.720
to do something called consonant
gradation, which means we have

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.820
to weaken the consonant -- in this
case, the K completely goes away.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.820
And we have to add the
plural ending of the I there.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.770
So there's a lot you have to know
to go from [foreign language]

00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:29.570
to [foreign language], and
to make it sound right.

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:32.740 position:56%
And then, you see [foreign language]
then requires the partitive singular

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.040
case after it.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.840
So you can't just say
[foreign language].

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.460
It's just -- you can say it.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.770
My students say, "Can I say that?"

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.070
I say, "You can say that.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.510
It's just incorrect."

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:44.140 position:56%
Everyone will understand you, but
it's not right, and you're not going

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.670
to be my student, talking that way.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:47.900
[ Laughter ]

00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.640
So you have to know that there's
a particular word type of words

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.790
that end in N-E-N, and in
the partitive singular,

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.110
they change like that.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:57.160
So the N-E-N becomes S-T-A.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.700
So, like my name, Karvonen,
if there were two of me,

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.800
it'd be [foreign language].

00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:04.860
First time I saw my name
written in a different way,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.160
I thought, that's a misspelling.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.200
And they said, "No, no, that's
how we do it in Finnish.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.940
We change the words like this."

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.460
So literally, what
you're saying sort of is

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.460
"Boys at is two plate of."

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:15.930
Right? Which makes no sense.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:19.480
So someone learning English, it's
a lot easier to kind of get going

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.910
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.520
But the thing about English is
that, as you get going in English,

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.140
English has this immense
vocabulary, immense vocabulary.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.720
And native English speakers
are constantly reading English,

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.990
and seeing words they
don't understand.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.970
I mean, how many people
read English word --

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:37.670
read words then they
don't understand,

00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.680
or run across words
they don't understand?

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.110
Yes. Probably everybody.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.080
In Finnish, the Finnish speakers
here, how often do you run

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.490
across Finnish words that
you don't understand?

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:46.790
Not often.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.600
Finnish people reading
Finnish, they rarely run

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.530 position:56%
across a word they don't understand,
and there's a reason for that.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.570
Because learning Finnish
is a pyramid.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:55.550
You need a huge base.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.850
Where -- big.

00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.150
I don't say -- want to say huge,

00:24:58.150 --> 00:24:59.450
because then it makes
it sound too scary.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.880
You need a pretty big base to learn
Finnish, but as you get going,

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.880
then it gets easier, actually.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.340
Everything starts to make sense.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.040
And when you get to the top, it's
just like -- it's like nirvana.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.660
Everything really makes sense.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.960
And it's really true.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.260
My students in my advanced
Finnish class,

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:16.290
they start to see all these
connections at the end,

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:20.120
and then they say, "It gets
so -- it's just easy now."

00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.420
Whereas the students

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:23.580
in the intermediate stage
really, really, really struggle.

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.770 position:56%
I'm having melt -- I have meltdowns
every fall in my intermediate class.

00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:28.840
And I say -- and I always
tell them, I say, "Oh,

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:30.660
the advanced class,
they're all relaxed.

00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:32.130
So just wait a year.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:33.430
It'll be okay.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:36.030
You just have to -- you just
have to move up the pyramid."

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.550
And that's really, I
think, a good analogy

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.700
for how learning English is
compared to learning Finnish.

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.730
So, okay. So one of the
reasons about -- that it is --

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.610
Finnish is learning a pyramid,
is because the vocabulary is --

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.180
a lot of words are sort
of built on a common root.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.390
So if we take the word
[foreign language], book,

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:58.400
then we can create all these
different words based on it.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.520
[Foreign language], all
based on the same word.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:05.500
So a child learning -- acquiring
Finnish learns a new word.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.590
Here's -- knows [foreign
language], of course.

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:08.890
Then here's [foreign language].

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:10.390 position:56%
Oh, has something to do with a book.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.150
Okay. I don't need to know exactly,

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:13.690
but I know it has something
to do with a book.

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.280 position:56%
A kid learning English, here's book,
and then someone says literature.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.550
No idea. No idea.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.650
Right? There's a lot more learning
that has to go into learning

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.450
that book, and literature, and
author, and library are all related

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.750
to each other, conceptually.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:30.680 position:56%
Because there's nothing in the words
themselves that link them together.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.910
So that's one of the things that
makes really Finnish easy, really,

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.850
and not difficult, I would claim.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:40.470
So just a little bit about
the background of Finnish,

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:44.640
is that English is an Indo-European
-- is an Indo-European language,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.950
and Finnish is a Uralic language.

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.490
So one of the reasons that
makes it so different is

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:49.710
because they're completely
different language families.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.270
Right? So English is Germanic.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.680
It's in the Germanic sub-branch of
the Indo-European language family,

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.090
and Finnish is Uralic
-- a Uralic language.

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:02.510
So just being -- by virtue of being
in a different language family,

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.050
the vocabulary's different,
and the structure is different.

00:27:05.050 --> 00:27:08.570
So that's really one of the
challenges of learning it,

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.660
is that it's just --
it's very different.

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.600 position:56%
I wouldn't necessarily so difficult.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.640
And just to give you --
if you're not familiar

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.050
with the Uralic languages, here's
a nice map that kind of shows you

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.380
where the Uralic languages
are spoken.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.780
We can see Finland
over there on the --

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.230
on the left, and we can see the
languages that are related to it.

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.840 position:56%
Most people, when you -- when you --

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.360
they say, "What languages
is Finnish related to?"

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:32.710
I will tell them Estonian
and Hungarian,

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:34.010
and I always finish it off with,

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.480
"and a bunch of languages
you've probably never heard of."

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.730
Because I rarely run into a
person that's heard of any

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.040
of the other languages, like Mari
or Udmurt, or Khanty, or Mansi,

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.330
or Votic, or Livonian, or Veps.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.970
I mean, these don't ring
any bells for most people.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:49.270
But they ring lots
of bells for people

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:51.250
that speak these languages, right?

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.680
Because they're their languages.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.820
So these are the languages
that Finnish is related to,

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.420
and as you can see,
they're sort of far-flung

00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.560
across -- mainly spoken in Russia.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.890
The reason that Finnish, and
Estonian, and Hungarian are doing

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.250
so well is because they
all have national borders,

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.680
and none of the other ones do.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:10.240 position:56%
And all the other ones are seriously
endangered for exactly that reason.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.200
You get borders, your
language is going to do okay.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.850
That's really the way that
you preserve a language,

00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:19.390 position:56%
is by having borders, and, you know,
having education in your language,

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.380
having media in your language.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.230
I mean, that's -- you know, that's
why Finnish is so vibrant, really.

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:27.220
If Finland were part of Sweden,
it might not be the same.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.520
Or part of Russia.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.000
It would be a very different story.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.220
And just a little bit about sort
of where did Finnish come from.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:37.830
We don't really know for sure.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.130
Don't really know.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.530
But this is a -- this is a map that
kind of offers some suggestions.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:45.790
This is a DNA haplogroup.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:51.920
The Y DNA, haplogroup N, which is
actually my own haplogroup, and --

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.780
which men inherit from their
father, and who inherited

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.460
from their father,
going back in time.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:02.300
You can see here that the -- 60% of
Finnish men -- Finnish men have --

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.620
belong to haplogroup N,
and you can see the --

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.430
this is the concentration
of it in the world,

00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:08.850
where the darkest concentration
is the -- is the --

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:11.160
the darkest color is the
greatest concentration.

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.580
So you can see, in Finland, it
has a really, really dark color,

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.570
and also all the way across the top

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.550
of northern Russia,
going all the way over.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:23.660
So those people are all genetically
related to those Finns that have

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.050
that -- that belong
to that haplogroup.

00:29:26.050 --> 00:29:27.930
Not all Finns belong
to that haplogroup.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.300
Some of the Finns, we say
some of them came from Europe,

00:29:30.300 --> 00:29:31.660
and the others came from the east.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.990
Some came from the west,
and some came from the east.

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:38.300
But one of the -- sort of the
migratory paths that one set

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:41.880 position:56%
of people came through is sort of
out of Africa, into the Middle East,

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.720
and then into Asia, and then
finally reaching Finland

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.240
as their sort of final terminus.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.580
And you can see that
in western Europe,

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:50.590
there's almost no incidence of it.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.590
So basically, Finland --
a little bit into Sweden,

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.540
a little bit into Norway, and
then it completely drops off.

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.360 position:56%
In the British Isles, there's almost
zero incidence of haplogroup N.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.260
So they just didn't get
any farther than Finland.

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:05.060
But that kind of tells us, alludes
to where the language is from.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:08.760 position:56%
And if you notice, that previous
map with the Uralic languages, it --

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:13.670 position:56%
they overlap to quite an interesting
-- in a very interesting way, right?

00:30:13.670 --> 00:30:16.890
So the fact that the languages --
language and genetics, of course,

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:20.760
are not the same thing, and modern
Finnish people are not genetically

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.360
the same as the other
Finno-Uralic speakers.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:28.460
But, there is a certain amount
of overlap, and this sort of--

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:32.000 position:56%
the DNA can kind of tell this, where
the linguistic ancestors of the --

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.970
both the genetic and the linguistic
ancestors of the Finns were.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:42.350
And just a little bit about the
lexicon of Finnish, but first,

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.050
I want to talk a little
bit about English.

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:47.860
So English is a Germanic
language, right?

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.160
As we all know.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.500
So it's a Germanic language
in the Indo-European --

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.020
Germanic sub-branch of
the Indo-European family.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:58.410
But in terms of its vocabulary,
only 20% -- 26%, approximately,

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:00.150
of its words are Germanic.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.490
So any time that any of
us are speaking English,

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:05.840 position:56%
only about a quarter of the time
are we really using those core words

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:07.140
from English.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:08.440
The rest of the time, we're
learning words that --

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.230
we're saying words that came from
French, that came from Latin,

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.230
and that came from
Greek, for example,

00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:14.890
French and Latin being
the bulk of it.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:17.720
Right? That's why that
newspaper article from

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.530
"Le Monde" had so much overlap.

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:23.110
Because really, English is
about a quarter French, or so,

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:24.410
really, and then a lot of Latin.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:28.400 position:56%
And that's what makes it so tough
to learn, even as a native speakers,

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.270 position:56%
is because it's not transparent
when you get into the higher levels.

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:34.770 position:56%
When you get into the fancy words
in English, if you don't know Latin,

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:37.290
you know, we have these tests
where you have to take the GRE

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:39.870
and learn all this
crazy Latin vocabulary.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:41.750
And these are -- you know, people
say, "These are English words,"

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:43.650
and the kids are saying, "What?

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.570
They're not English words,"
we use in our daily life.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.720
But that is one of the reasons
that English has its sort

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.960
of huge, huge vocabulary.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.690
So in -- and Finnish
has also a similar --

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:59.450
Finnish is not a pure language
anymore than English is.

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.950
There is no such thing
as a pure language.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.690
That's completely a myth.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:03.990
It's another myth.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:06.110
There's no -- there are no pure
-- genetically pure people.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.550
There's no pure language.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:10.160
So Finnish definitely -- even
though I showed that page

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.110
where you saw that, you know,
Finnish looks sort of kind

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.400
of impenetrable, it has had lots of
influences from all different kinds

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.500
of languages over its
thousands of years of existence.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.830
So we have sort of
these strata in Finnish.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.870
And if we go from the bottom, the
bottom would be the native stratum.

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:28.040
Those are words that are shared
with most all Uralic languages.

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.810
And then, moving up -- this
is sort of a time-depth thing.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.510
So the first context that the
ancient Uralic people had was

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:38.720
with Indo-European people, and
then Baltic peoples, Germanic --

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.610
I mean, the proto-Finnic people.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.850
Germanic, Slavic, Swedish,
and English.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:46.350
And you can see -- based on
this going from the, you know,

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:48.600
6000 years ago or so
up to the present,

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:52.230 position:56%
you can see the different kinds of
people that the linguistic ancestors

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.670 position:56%
of the Finns interacted with, right?

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:56.380
So originally, the fact

00:32:56.380 --> 00:33:00.480
that Indo-European loans
was the first group tells us

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.020
that the Finns have not
always been in Finland,

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:04.620 position:56%
or at least the linguistic ancestors

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.040
of the Finn have not
always been in Finland.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.580
Because they had these interactions
with Indo-European people,

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.940
probably in central Russia.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:14.640
And then, the Baltic loans
tells us that they got

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.800
to the Baltic at some point, right?

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.840
And then the Germanic loans tells
us that there was also interaction

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.990
with Germanic-speaking
peoples at that time.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:25.070
So we think of sort of these
strata as just like archaeology,

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.050
the graphic there with
the archaeological layers.

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:31.010 position:56%
Finnish has these layers in its
vocabulary of -- it has its basic --

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:35.340
basic native stratum, and then
it has these accumulated layers.

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:39.100 position:56%
Modern Finnish speakers can't tell
you this, "This word is from Baltic,

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.890 position:56%
and this word is from Germanic," any
more than English speakers can say,

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:45.010
"This word is from French," or
"This word is from Arabic," at all.

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:47.850
Unless it's a really, really
recent loan, people --

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:50.350
speakers have almost
no intuition about it.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:53.660
It has to be a recent loan for
people to have an intuition.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.870
So the native stratum, an
example would be body parts,

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:01.740
or words from animals and nature,
of course, because those are words

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:04.670
that people have needed
all the time,

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.120
regardless of where they lived.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:07.650
Right? Regardless of
your environment,

00:34:07.650 --> 00:34:09.270
you need to talk about body parts.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.380
You need to talk about
animals and nature.

00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:13.570
The kinds of animals and
the kind of nature can vary,

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.540
depending on your environment, of
course, but this tell us something

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:19.700
about the -- where the
Finns originally lived.

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:21.000
You see that the word
"birch," [foreign language],

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.230
is a very, very old word.

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.320
So that suggests that where
the Finns originally were,

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.150
birch trees existed.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:32.060
And, for example, [foreign
language], river,

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.850
that there was water, of course.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.010
And they had dogs and fish kind
of everywhere, [foreign language].

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:43.070
Then, the -- one of the -- I'm not
going to talk about all the strata,

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:45.750
but another stratum that's really
interesting is the Baltic stratum.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:49.550
So the Baltic stratum tells
us, then, at one point,

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.770
that the linguistic ancestors
of the Finns met with people --

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:56.190 position:56%
interacted with people in the Baltic
area, so the ancestors of current,

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:59.710 position:56%
modern-day Latvians and Lithuanians.

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:04.140
And you can see the kinds
of words that were --

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.940
were borrowed into Finnish
really reveal something

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.730
about the nature of the contact.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.760
So here, we can see --
I've kind of done a couple

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:14.310
of different colors here, to
kind of show that we have words

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.080
like [foreign language],
hay, goat and seed,

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.860
and those clearly relate
to agriculture, right?

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:22.340
So agriculture was something that
kind of happened during this period

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.910
when the linguistic
ancestors of the Finns met,

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:26.390
encountered the Baltic peoples.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.790
They didn't have -- they were
hunter-gatherers to that point,

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.650
and then they encountered
agriculture.

00:35:31.650 --> 00:35:33.590
And they needed words for things

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:36.040
that they had never needed
to talk about before.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.960
Interestingly, there are three
really interesting words, daughter,

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.070
sister and bride, that were
also introduced in this area.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:46.270
Which, you might just want
to speculate at home tonight

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:49.100
about what happened there.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.080
But it's a -- really intriguing to
think about those kinds of things.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.380
Why would a language -- certainly,
there were daughters, and sisters,

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.840
and brides before this point,

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.670
but why were these particular
words introduced at this point?

00:35:58.670 --> 00:36:01.960
Again, it tells you something about
the nature of the contact, right?

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:03.260
What was happening.

00:36:03.260 --> 00:36:04.560
It wasn't just a culture sharing.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.830
It was more intimate
sharing, of course, right?

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.820
And then, we see there are
other words related to food.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.160
So we have, for example,
salmon, pea and porridge,

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.670
and then we have the sea.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:16.970
That's really interesting.

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:19.410
So the word [foreign language],
the sea -- so in other words,

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:21.450
this is the first time
they ever saw the sea.

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.290
Right? They didn't see the
sea at -- they don't --

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:26.080
you don't need to talk about
the sea if you don't have a sea.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.830
And then you have a sea, and
then you need a word for bay.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:32.650
So it's really revealing, these
layers of the vocabulary, if you --

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.690
if you -- you know, the people
that do this kind of research,

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:40.810
you can really see what kinds of
cultural contact sort of happened.

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:44.370
Moving onto the Germanic
stratum, we have a similar kind

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:48.590
of cultural contact here, where
we have a lot of farming words.

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:52.070
So chicken, sheep, plow, all
the words for grains, right?

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:54.330
So all the grains were
introduced at this point.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.820
So they were -- you know,
again, the linguistic ancestors

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:00.940
of the Finns were hunter-gatherers,
and now, suddenly, they were --

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.560
they were living in places where
they were -- they were growing --

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:07.780
growing food, and staying
in one place at one time.

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.380
A very, very interesting --

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:12.310
and also, we see all the words for
the different metals, so gold, tin,

00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:17.470
iron, [foreign language],
for example, ore, and a very,

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.460
very interesting word is
[foreign language], mother.

00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:23.100 position:56%
Which is just always -- the students
are -- my students are always just,

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.480
how could mother be a loan word?

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:27.490
Didn't they have mothers before?

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:28.860
And I always say, "Well,
the Finns were hatched."

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.160
No, not really.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:35.070
It goes back to the Kalevala
egg kind of idea, but -- but --

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.540
if you know anything
about the Kalevala.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:38.620
But it's a very interesting word.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.010
So there is a -- there's a --
the original word for mother,

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.640
which is [foreign language]
and [foreign language],

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:46.490
then is used only for animal
mothers, now, in modern Finnish.

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:49.240
So what happened was, the
original word became smaller,

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.990
in terms of its semantic field,

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.730 position:56%
and then this new word [foreign
language] came in and supplanted it.

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:58.220 position:56%
So then -- and that, again, suggests
a different kind of contact.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.580
Not just cultural contact,
but people contact, right,

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.880
which is really interesting.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.180
When students learn
[foreign language],

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:08.150
they have to learn we divide
words in Finnish that end in I

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.720
into old words and new words.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.660
And they have to learn that that is
a new word, even though they want

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:14.960
to think it's an old word.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.260
Because they say, "That language --

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.560
the word has to have been in
the language for a long time."

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.250
I said, "Yeah, a couple
thousand years, but not 6000.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.980
It's relatively new."

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.540
So -- and then we get to
the most recent stratum,

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:29.120
and this is the stratum that
is really happening right now.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.570
This is what's happening in
Finnish, and there are just tons

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:35.510
of words every single day coming
into Finnish from English.

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:42.510 position:56%
So we have words like [foreign
language], to work out, for example.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:46.170
[Foreign language],
very recent word, right?

00:38:46.170 --> 00:38:47.510
This came up with Skype.

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:48.810
Then they have -- they need
a verb, [foreign language].

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.450
To Google, [foreign language].

00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:53.130 position:56%
You can also say [foreign language].

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.440
There's two verbs for that.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.420
[Foreign language],
to hang out, right?

00:38:56.420 --> 00:39:00.120
Just plain old show, for
example, [foreign language].

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:06.510
There were perfectly good ways in
Finnish for saying these things,

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:07.810
but suddenly, they say this.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.220
And then, my absolute
favorite is yes.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:13.550
Which does not, in
Finnish, mean yes.

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:17.380
It means good or excellent.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.600
So what happens when -- you know,
when a language borrows a word,

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.720
it just -- there are
no rules, right?

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:25.400
It's like you give something
-- you give a gift to somebody,

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.150
and they do whatever
they want with it.

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:29.900
And Finnish took this word, and
just went and did what it wanted.

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.060
So now, in Finnish, it's
totally normal to say --

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.420
you say [foreign language],
how was the movie?

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.080
They say [foreign language] yes.

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.480
It was really yes.

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.180
Which is something in English
we would never say, right?

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.480
We would never do it that way.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.890
Yes means yes and yes only.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:47.190
It's not an adjective.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:49.280
In Finnish, it has
become an adjective,

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:50.580
which is really fascinating.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.390
So yeah. So -- and this --

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:56.040
this group is being
added to all the time.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:01.370
Okay, then, moving away from the
vocabulary and into the morphology,

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.130
just -- this is kind of a familiar
concept to a lot of people,

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.430
is that one of the things --

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:07.500
the characteristics of
Finnish that make it different,

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.260
not necessarily difficult, is
just this ability to add suffixes

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.420
onto words, and to
build longer words.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.720
So we say [foreign languages]
means house, [foreign language]

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:17.480
in the house, [foreign language]
in my house, [foreign language]

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:22.290
in my house also, [foreign
language], make it a question

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.690 position:56%
by adding the ko [phonetic],
[foreign language] in my house also,

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:26.300
and then you can say "I wonder."

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:27.600
So [foreign language].

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:31.020
I wonder in my house also,
are there rats, maybe?

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.610
Your neighbor has rats,
and you would say --

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.010
because you would think,
no one would ever say that.

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:35.830
No, no, I can think of a context.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:37.130
Your neighbor has rats.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.430
Oh, [foreign language].

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:41.340
I wonder if there are
rats in my house, too.

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.640
Totally natural context.

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.020
This is not a crazy word.

00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.520
So that's one thing that people
say makes Finnish difficult.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.650
There's nothing difficult about it.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:50.950
You see the word.

00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.250
You know the endings.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:53.550
You know what they mean.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:54.850
You add them on.

00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:56.830
That aspect of it is not difficult.

00:40:56.830 --> 00:41:02.010
Making long words based on these
little suffixes is not difficult.

00:41:02.010 --> 00:41:06.740
What is -- okay, yes, and here's
another graphic that's gone around.

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:08.040
This is from Scandinavia
in the world.

00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.490
This is kind of one of these memes.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:12.140
Finnish has a word for "I wonder
if I should run around aimlessly,"

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.440
and in Finnish, that
is [foreign language].

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:17.350
And you see that same
-han suffix, right?

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.460
So again, this is what people
think makes Finnish difficult.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.220
I don't think that's what
makes Finnish difficult.

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.850 position:56%
So I would say Finnish is different,

00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:28.040
but one of the things is the
vocabulary is so different, right?

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.410
So learning the vocabulary
is an enormous task.

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:33.700
You just have to learn that this
is called [foreign language],

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.970
which has no relation
to table, right?

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:37.920
Or you have to learn that
this is [foreign language],

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.540
which has no relation to shoe.

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.840
You just have to memorize that.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.260 position:56%
There's nothing you can do about it.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.550
But, one of the challenges
of Finnish is what --

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:47.420
something that we call [foreign
language], which are word types.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.970
So in Finnish, as you notice
from the previous slide --

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:51.610
or, two slides ago, when you
have the word [foreign language],

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:54.280
if I would've written it -- I
didn't write it here by itself,

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.420
but if I wrote it by itself, then
you just do add the ending on,

00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.200
and you don't do anything to it.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:02.130
However, not all words
are so friendly.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.530
There are a lot of words in Finnish
that are -- you have to know more.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:07.170
So you have to know what
we call [foreign language].

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:10.410
So you remember from my
initial slide, my early slide,

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:14.540
the one with the two plates,
the words that end in N-E-N,

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:16.820
you don't just add
the ending to the --

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.150
you don't slap it on
the end of the word.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.210
What you do is, you
have to know the root.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:23.320
And the root is the -- is the
form on the far right there,

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.530
that has the little dash, and
the dash means I'm not complete

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:28.780
until I get a suffix added onto me.

00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:31.390
So [foreign language] means
red, and if you want to say

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:33.910
"in the red house," for example,
you say [foreign language].

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:40.020
So the student has to learn, okay,
[foreign language] is a "nen" word.

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:43.350
"Nen" words, their stem is in "se."

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:46.450
So "nen" becomes "se," and
then I add my ending on.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.790
So then I have to say
[foreign language].

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:52.380
But, if I have a word ending
in S-I, then it's different.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.240
Then a word like [foreign
language], which means water,

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.790
becomes [foreign language].

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:58.940
Okay, so "in the water" then
has to be [foreign language].

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:02.200
Or, if I have a word like [foreign
language] at the very bottom,

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:07.810
"beautiful," then I want to say "in
the beautiful house," then I have

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.110
to say [foreign language].

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:11.870
This is definitely a task to learn.

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:15.650
And I have -- I don't know
how many, five, 10 types here.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:17.320
There are about 40.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.790
So I don't tell the students
that at the beginning.

00:43:20.790 --> 00:43:23.360 position:56%
If I would, they would -- they
would run out of the room screaming.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.160
We introduce them a
little at a time.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.990
But that is definitely one
thing that I would say,

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:29.990
not the fact that there
are case endings.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:31.920
This is one of the
things that makes Finnish,

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.860
not difficult, but challenging.

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.380
And just another couple
examples here, is people will --

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.900
students will say me -- say to me,
"How do you say dogs in Finnish?"

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.820
I'm like, oh, it depends.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:46.120
So in English, "The
dogs are running.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.420
I have two dogs.

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:48.720
There are dogs in the yard."

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.020
Dogs, dogs, dogs.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.320
In Finnish, [foreign language].

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.990
All depends on the sentence.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:55.920
I can't answer that question.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.510
I cannot answer that
question without a sentence.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:02.560
And in a similar way, how
do you say "for" in Finnish?

00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.970
This is even worse.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:05.270
How do you say for?

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:06.570
Oh, "This is for you.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:07.870
I'm waiting for the bus.

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:09.170
She went there for a year.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:10.470
Buy a ticket for the movie."

00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:11.770
No, in Finnish, [foreign language].

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:15.400 position:56%
For -- there's, like, five different
-- four different endings there,

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.700
depending on the context.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.580
There's not a one-to-one mapping.

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:21.470
That definitely is a
challenge to learn.

00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:23.920
Not the fact that there
are case endings,

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:27.570
but that there is this
really -- this --

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:30.140
not a one-to-one match
between the two languages.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.550
So what I would say is
that Finnish is different,

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:35.590
not necessarily difficult.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.960
And so the proof of that is me.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:42.070
I did not grow up speaking Finnish,
and I am not a genius by any means.

00:44:42.070 --> 00:44:44.930
And I have learned
Finnish, and the --

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:47.150
on the picture on the right
is a group of my students

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.340
who all speak Finnish very well.

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:52.310
And I've had 15 years of
these kind of students coming

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.860
through my program, and
they're not all geniuses.

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.160
Well, some of them are.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.640
But not all of them are
geniuses, and they do really well.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:00.940
So that's it.

00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:02.240
Thank you.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:04.040
Thank you for your attention.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:10.450
[ Applause ]

00:45:10.450 --> 00:45:13.580
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Well, Dan
is a hard act to follow.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:17.860
I just have to say, before I launch
into what I want to say in --

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:24.170
at length, is that when I
kept getting new information

00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:27.750
about this conference, and
was very happy to be invited

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:31.330
to it, and really honored.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:34.460
I then thought, oh, yes, but --

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:38.960
and I finally then looked at
exactly where, and at the Library

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.720
of Congress, this was
going to take place.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.410
And it was -- and then,
oh, now, wait a second.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:45.290
That reminds me of something.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:52.580
In -- I want to take you back
to January 24th, 1985, where --

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:56.540
when there was a symposium
on the Kalevala at --

00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:05.220
on the 150th anniversary of
the first Kalevala, in 1820 --

00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:09.280
1835, which is now referred to as
the Old Kalevala, since the '40 --

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.720
1849 was then the canonic version.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:20.340
There was a really wonderfully
designed conference of folklorists,

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:25.100 position:56%
and people in literature, and people

00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:28.900
who had thought deeply
about the Kalevala.

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:35.060
The -- but there was also the
sound of the Kalevala being heard

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:40.780
after Alan Jabbour, who was the
head of the folk life center

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.910
at the time, had welcomed us in.

00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:51.190
And then -- and Lauri Honko, a
professor of folklore in University

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:53.660
of Helsinki, and a very
major figure in epic --

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:57.060
study of epics, internationally
respected.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:01.140
They had started it with
brief announcements.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:05.000
Then my -- I, and my husband --

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.460
late husband, Austin Flint,
had been from Columbia.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:14.840
Both of us were asked to give a
bilingual reading of the Kalevala,

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:19.740
and those of you who know something
about the Kalevala would --

00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.250
when one says [foreign
language], mother of Lemminkainen

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.410
at Tuonela River would
mean something.

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:30.780
You immediately see an image of
the mother of one of the heroes

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:34.380
of the Kalevala, or scandal --

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:37.770
heroes or scoundrels
of the Kalevala.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:42.140
Lemminkainen, who always
got into trouble, and was --

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:49.880
finally met his end, having thought
that he was invincible, was very --

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:54.430
was killed, and was
in pieces in the River

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.340
of Tuonela, the abode of the death.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.040
Now -- so it's not a cheerful text,
but it's a very interesting --

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.970
it's a very dramatic
scene in the Kalevala,

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:07.940
where Lemminkainen's mother, with
her shamanic powers, is putting --

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:10.840
is first of all, raking with
an enormous rake these pieces

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:13.470
of her son from the
River of the Dead,

00:48:13.470 --> 00:48:16.160
and then bringing him back to life.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.800
So I read it in Finnish, but I
read it from the Old Kalevala,

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:24.220 position:56%
which is -- which is the same
story, but slightly different words,

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:29.700
in honor of that we were
celebrating the 18 -- 1835 version.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:31.440
And then my husband
read it in English,

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.600
and then we were later told that,
yes, the English version made it

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:40.380
to the Finnish TV, and they had
seen it, which pleased me no end.

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.730
So I just really want to
-- and there was so much --

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:48.090
now that I go back to think about
that symposium, it really --

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:49.390
I mean, I had studied the Kalevala.

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:50.990
I had taught the Kalevala
at Columbia.

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:56.750
I had done various things, and
I realize now how much that kind

00:48:56.750 --> 00:49:02.780
of gathering, of getting together
folklorists, literature people,

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:06.110
anthropology -- cultural
anthropologists,

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.390
music -- ethnomusicologists.

00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:13.610
And then, in a way, looking at all
the pieces, and what -- what --

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:17.180
you can, in a way, to get the
essence of it, and get a sort

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.340
of grip on what all it can mean.

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:25.780
And so -- and I thought that, just
in case there are people here --

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.780
which, I think in any audience,
there might well be, who don't --

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.400
the Kalevala, what is it?

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.500
I will read the pithy --
is of my humble photocopy

00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.080
of the program, of
the '85 conference.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.970
"The Kalevala is the
Finnish national epic.

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:45.730
It was compiled by Elias Loennrot
from folk poems collect in rural --

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:50.540
in rural Finland, and
first published in 1835.

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:53.510
The symposium will explore the
role of the Kalevala as a symbol

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:57.060
of Finnish national identity,
and reflect upon the development

00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:02.040
of its symbols of identity in
American-Finnish communities."

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:03.340
And so then it when it on --

00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:08.050
the whole day went on to
discuss what other aspects,

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:12.460
what other tokens of
identity might there be

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.510
in Finnish-American communities.

00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:18.250
And then, Yvonne Hipakaluk
[assumed spelling],

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:22.170
who gave a very interesting talk
on -- a cultural anthropologist,

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:27.160
gave a wonderful talk on the
various -- on [foreign language],

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:32.010
but also pasties, which became big.

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:37.550 position:56%
However, they were a Cornish --
Cornish immigrants had brought those

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:39.770
to the country, and the Finnish --

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.460
they seem probably enough
like a [foreign language]

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.990
that they became very
much taken by the --

00:50:44.990 --> 00:50:47.050
and I've had students
at Columbia who just --

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:49.650
"Oh, pasties, oh, my mother's
going to send me some pasties.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:50.950
I'll bring some to class."

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:52.250
And we had them.

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:55.800
And I had them also at Hancock,

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:59.000
so it was my first time
of ever getting pasties.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.430
So that the -- and
then, the last item

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:05.180
that Yvonne Hipakaluk
[assumed spelling] would --

00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:09.860
spoke about was the St. Urho myth,
which was of totally newfangled --

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:14.370
new, new celebration, day
before St. Patrick's Day.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:15.820
So there was a certain kind

00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:19.700
of inter-European jealousy
of the saints.

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:24.370
So very unlikely, really
a tall tale.

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:28.220
But so -- that day was sort of --
it was -- it really was excellent,

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:31.980 position:56%
in terms of looking at the Kalevala.

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.960
Of course, it can -- we
can just read it as a --

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:38.260
read it, or be exposed
to it one way or another

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:41.570
as a work of art, which it is.

00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.920
Loennrot was a collector.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:45.920
He was first a medical doctor.

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:50.800
That was his, as one would say --
maybe his day job for a good while,

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:56.160 position:56%
and he was -- in eastern Finland, he
was the district doctor in Kajaani,

00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.660
and -- way, way, eastern
-- northeastern Finland.

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:03.740
And he then started
listening to the folklore,

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:08.410
people who still knew the
old songs and the old poems.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:12.900
And this was a very -- it was
very poor area, and the whole --

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:16.920
but he would -- usually on
foot, and sometimes he got sort

00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:20.170
of a horse ride, but mostly
on foot, he collected,

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:24.840
and he then got the sort of
cultural [inaudible] to collect it.

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:30.360
And there was the Finnish
Literature Society,

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.580
which had the intelligentsia of --

00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:40.100
interested in seeing
how these could be --

00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.160
come to fruition and be published.

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:47.530 position:56%
And, in fact, the Finnish Literature
Society was established just in time

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:51.650
to publish the Kalevala, and to
fund it, and really use -- when --

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:55.840
if anyone has ever had anything
to do with trying to get funds

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.550
for certain cultural
-- you're nodding.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:04.930
Cultural efforts, it's always
a -- it's also political.

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:08.720
And also, we have to keep in
mind that the -- that in --

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.180
so 1835, where was Finland?

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:17.290
Finland was -- had, in 1809,
stopped being part of Sweden.

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:21.530
And the Peace of Hamina
decreed that the border was

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:26.220
to be made more eastern, and the
border was -- more western, rather.

00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.770
It was to be moved west
between Finland and Sweden.

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:34.280
So Finland suddenly wasn't part
of Sweden, and then from --

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:40.760
so 1809 to 1917, Finland was the
autonomous Grand Duchy of Russia.

00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:44.520
And so that there was room
to -- what -- now what?

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:48.790
And so there was this --
actually a very dramatic --

00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:53.550
by the end of the 19th
century, dramatic shift

00:53:53.550 --> 00:54:02.930
where Finnish intelligentsia who
were deciding things, who, in fact,

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:04.230
spoke with each other --

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:06.920
they negotiated these
issues within Swedish,

00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.630
because that was the language

00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:16.410
of the ruling class,
and the cultural great.

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:23.240
So the -- and many families
-- and to hold the drama --

00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:27.420 position:56%
and I think it's not much has been,
in fact, paid attention to the drama

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.630
of Finnish families who had,
until then, spoken Swedish,

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:33.770
because they would know Finnish.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:37.430
But they would -- Swedish was,
in a way, the going language,

00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:40.430
and they would then, within
a couple of generations,

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:44.210
totally shift the family
language into Finnish,

00:54:44.210 --> 00:54:46.320
and be very conscious about it.

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:51.070
And the political discussion is
interesting, but we won't go there.

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:56.890
So after had -- had these wonderful
days of this Kalevala conference,

00:54:56.890 --> 00:55:00.060
I then got on the Amtrak train
and went back to New York.

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:04.570
And in -- but, like, five
days later, we had a symposium

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:08.630
at Columbia called
From Folk to Nation.

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:12.520
Now, folk in Finnish
is [foreign language].

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:15.160
Nation in Finnish is
[foreign language].

00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:18.070
So that -- in a way
-- and that sort of --

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:23.290 position:56%
when you talk about the transparency
of Finnish vocabulary, and one says,

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:26.480
"Well, [foreign language],
lots of folks there, right?"

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.700
Very informal, not
organized, but then,

00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:35.280
the same semantic root was also
used for the collection of people

00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:38.170
who were Finns, who were
-- lived in Finland.

00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:39.470
That was [foreign language].

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:45.530 position:56%
So the -- and then, we have -- so
[foreign language], the folk poetry,

00:55:45.530 --> 00:55:51.310
but then [foreign language],
the derivational suffix

00:55:51.310 --> 00:55:55.360
of what sort are you, the citizen.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.750
So that, in a way, it --
root Finnish really does --

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:03.310 position:56%
I was happy that you brought that
-- brought that in, that for a Finn,

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:06.400
it's intuitively easy to say
what has got to do something --

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.990
it has got to mean
something about people, right?

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:10.290
Yes. Okay.

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.660
So then -- and I think what --

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:14.770
what I think, when you said
at the intermediate year

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:18.160
of learning Finnish, teaching
Finnish, is very frustrating,

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:20.530
because the first year is okay.

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:24.190
Because when you add
something to zero,

00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:27.290
it feels like an accomplishment,
and you're happy.

00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:29.460
Because you learn -- you
do learn a fair amount.

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:34.120
And then, if the teaching
is being done well, then --

00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:39.480
or if the class is designed
sort of in a sound way, the --

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:44.130
you will have learned sort of --

00:56:44.130 --> 00:56:46.300
you will have learned
it in different kinds --

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:48.290
different ways of complexity.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:52.290
But the intermediate
is -- then you begin

00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:54.620
to know what all else is ahead.

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:59.420
And -- but then, exactly, advanced
students, once that's past,

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:03.380
then that can -- that
can really change.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.200
So we had another conference,
and then, obviously,

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:07.810
life went on at Columbia.

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:13.610
Now, I will move to Columbia, and
I want to tell you about the --

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:15.640 position:56%
that Finnish has been at Columbia --

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:19.330
there has been some Finnish
at Columbia since 1940s.

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:23.270
The first person teaching it was
Professor John B. Oley [assumed

00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:26.770
spelling], who was also a -- who
was a professor at City University

00:57:26.770 --> 00:57:30.150
in Germanic and Slavic languages.

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:31.690
And so he taught them in courses.

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:38.190
By 1960s -- the '50s, '60s,
it was more and more included

00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:42.300
in the academic curriculum of the
university, and then was offered

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:46.510
as -- by '60s in Uralic --

00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:49.970
Uralic studies within the
department of linguistics.

00:57:49.970 --> 00:57:55.640
And so -- and there were a
great many theoretical --

00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:58.520
theoretical courses in
Uralic studies as well.

00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:03.560 position:56%
The contemporary -- the most -- very
recent maps reminded me of the --

00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:08.360
of the less pretty maps,
but the same information

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.440
of the related languages.

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:15.060
And so those of us who
were at Columbia --

00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:17.400
and I did my doctoral
work at Columbia,

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:21.030
and sat in -- Ken, where are you?

00:58:21.030 --> 00:58:22.330
There you are.

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:24.100
With Kenneth Neradi [assumed
spelling] of the Library

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:28.380
of Congress, and of
the European section.

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:30.730
We sat in Uralic seminars,
and we were working

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:34.090 position:56%
on entirely different things, right?

00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:42.020 position:56%
And then, I have to just -- to sort
of -- the Finnish wouldn't continue,

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:46.600
or the Uralic languages
wouldn't continue at Columbia

00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:49.830
if it hadn't been for someone
like Professor Robert Austerlitz.

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:54.860
Who might be familiar to some
of you who are not too young --

00:58:54.860 --> 00:59:02.850
who are not so young as not to have
met him, who was a very multi --

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:07.960
multilingual, multi-talented
human being.

00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:11.970
And his -- with his
seminal research in Finnish

00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:15.080
and with Uralic languages, as
well as many other languages,

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:21.920
and scholarly publication,
he was one who was the --

00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:26.400
at some point, he was the head of
the American Linguistic Society.

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:32.810 position:56%
And he was very active in the entire
country, as well as internationally.

00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:37.220
So he brought a lot of the
knowledge of that to the, say,

00:59:37.220 --> 00:59:42.240
American academia, and always
-- I don't know how about in --

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.630
in Minneapolis, whether you
have students in linguistics

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:48.060
who flock to your classes.

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.500
Yeah? Most?

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.800
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Some.

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.100
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Some.

00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:54.400
Yeah, okay.

00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.700
Some. Because it's a
really interesting thing,

00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:57.000 position:56%
that if you have students who are
in linguistics, and they really want

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.510
to do Finnish, or they are required

00:59:59.510 --> 01:00:03.720
to learn a non-Indo-European
language,

01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:07.560
which immediately puts them on
the different -- on the heavier --

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:13.410
heavier workload languages, they --

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:17.370
they get delighted when
there is [foreign language].

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:20.250
And that's an easy one, obviously.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:24.330 position:56%
But the more suffixes, the better,
whereas the student who says, "Look,

01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:27.700
please, not -- no more grammar
today," then it -- there's a --

01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:33.220 position:56%
so that there are kind of all kinds
of pyramids that -- in the contrast.

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:37.640
So Columbia certainly -- when I
was first teaching at Columbia,

01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.150
Finnish at Columbia, I was --
most of the students -- maybe --

01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:44.720
really, I would say more students
than not were from linguistics.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:46.910
Because they truly
had that requirement,

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.950
that they had to learn one
-- that they had to have --

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:51.460
and many of them wanted to,

01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:54.570
and quite willingly
were studying Finnish.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:58.160
And they were also always
students from different fields,

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.020
so that Columbia -- in those years,

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.180
when the graduate student
population was also helped

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:10.000
by the NDFL legislation,
which helped graduate students

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.160
to study an odd language,
or a less commonly-taught --

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.080
I think in those days, they
were called neglected languages.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.610
Now, we all said, who were
teaching, "These languages,

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:21.090
we never neglected them."

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:26.510
Then, I think the -- they were
beginning to be called less common.

01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:30.390
Now, the polite -- politically
okay phrase, I believe,

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:32.830 position:56%
that's used is less-commonly-taught.

01:01:32.830 --> 01:01:35.250
And then, of course, we
would say amongst ourselves,

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:37.030
"Teach them every Monday,
Tuesday, Thursday."

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:42.700
So it's not less -- it's not
less common, but they are --

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:47.160
they have this different status.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:52.210
And so, the -- so linguists
have always been interested,

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:56.860
but we had -- but over the years,
there have been master's theses

01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:04.360
and doctoral dissertations in
anthropology, for, like, almost,

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.450
like, three generations of
anthropology graduate work.

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:14.360 position:56%
Students who then been professors in
various places, including Columbia

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:20.940
and -- I think Michigan
State, and Brooklyn College,

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.990
at the City University of New York.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:28.010
And sociology, literature,
and linguistics, obviously,

01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:32.320
as well as in music,
where the people who were

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:37.320
in music also sometimes
came to the Uralic seminars.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.950
Now, Ken Neradi [assumed
spelling] was working on Komi,

01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:44.510
which I was a part of -- was very
exciting, because I was also trying

01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:47.700
to learn enough Komi in
order to be able to go

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:54.180
to the Finno-Ugric Congress in
Syktyvkar, Komi at the -- in 1985.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:55.520
It was a big seminal year.

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.120
And so you -- I was so impressed by
Ken Neradi's opening the newspaper

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.460
and just reading, reading fully
all these things about Komi.

01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:11.420
And I was working on Komi
riddles in folklore, and there,

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:15.260
there was always a man with axe
walks into woods, and what is it?

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:19.500
So that my -- my sort
of -- kind of --

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.760
the texts that I was reading
were very different from yours.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:27.410
But we -- the whole seminar was run
in such a way that Austerlitz --

01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:32.160
in fact, he just simply started as
an extra thing for everybody, that,

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.770
well, in two years, there's going
to be this Finno-Ugric Congress

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:39.270
in Syktyvkar, in Komi land.

01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:44.110
And it would be good if quite a
few of us went, and gave papers.

01:03:44.110 --> 01:03:47.630
Now, if we're going to Syktyvkar,
we should really do something

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:48.930
about their language, shouldn't we?

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:50.240
It would be polite.

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:54.390
And some of us said, "Well,
we don't know enough," or --

01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:55.740
he said, "Well, we have two years."

01:03:55.740 --> 01:04:00.440
Every week, we had an extra Komi
-- an extra session on these.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.590
So we worked on them,
and four of us did go.

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:08.130
So it is -- but with
Columbia, it tends to be

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:10.320
that Finnish has always been sort

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.580
of in the midst of
many other languages.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:18.190
Columbia still teaches over four
-- there are 40 foreign languages,

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:21.950
plus -- 40-plus languages taught.

01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:27.920
And so Finnish is one of them,
and Hungarian is another.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.650
And -- which you also
studied, right?

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:38.300
And so the -- so it's
a very kind of --

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.670
in a way, the context in
which Finnish is taught

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:43.560
at Columbia is very much
in the context of many,

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.310
many other languages, as
many other fields, as well.

01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:51.840
The students, at this point, aren't
writing doctoral dissertations

01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:55.680
because the -- in a way, the
graduate program has waned.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:59.190
And the under -- there are
more undergraduate students.

01:04:59.190 --> 01:05:04.450
But they're doing very well,
and many have -- many have --

01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:09.090
over the years, have been
helped by Finland, which has --

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:15.000
Finland has a very generous system
of inviting foreign students,

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.770 position:56%
who have to apply, to summer
courses, and get a really heavy dose

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:23.250
of being among others -- being
with students from other countries,

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:28.530
studying Finnish in
Finland, in the location.

01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:34.100
And so their -- they have a lot
of contact with Finland as well.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:38.200
The other thing that happens,
and it's been very much design,

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:45.690
and sort of we've wanted it
that way, is that when --

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:50.890 position:56%
people who come to the United
States from Finland, they somehow --

01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:54.160
lots of planes land on
the -- at the airports.

01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.250
And people who don't even
mean to come to New York,

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:58.670
they happen to come through.

01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:04.240
And so they very often then are in
touch, and come by, and so that --

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.180
we've had -- just even naturally
-- [inaudible] visitors --

01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:17.420
visitors from Finland,
so that the dialogue

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:21.190
and the contact can continue.

01:06:21.190 --> 01:06:29.760 position:56%
And we've had a great many organized
events of symposia and lectures,

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:36.460
as well as -- as well as informal
-- and readings, poetry --

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.620
a flock of Finnish poets were
in New York at a given year.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:46.410 position:56%
And they were also at Columbia,
where we had then a trilingual event

01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:51.060
of Finnish, Swedish and
English poetry being read.

01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:55.580
And so students have,
over the years,

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:59.590
met everybody from Neils
Aslakvolkyapa [assumed spelling],

01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:07.000 position:56%
a Sami performer and singer, and
all-purpose -- he was a very gifted,

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.420
gifted individual for that group.

01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:17.530
And so then, the one thing that --
and we go through, you know, the --

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:22.210
where every -- I think in every
place, the language is the same,

01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:24.600
and students need to learn it.

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:27.800
And it -- we are -- we
have really used a lot --

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:32.020
some of the Austerlitzian
way of looking at the sort

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:36.570
of morphophonemics of Finnish,
and -- for the linguists, you --

01:07:36.570 --> 01:07:38.180
it can be done explicitly.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.790
And then, for the non-linguists,
it needs to be softened,

01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:46.190
and shown in the right context.

01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:51.850
But so, the -- our students
are used -- or certainly were,

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:55.420
and they still are,
used to meeting Finns.

01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:59.080
And they are from the very -- when
they first walk in, they're greeted

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.710
in Finnish, and they're
expected to make a noise

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.610
in Finnish at that point.

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:06.830
And it is indicated
what it might be.

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:12.640
And -- so that, in a way, they
start expressing themselves

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.740
in Finnish from the very start.

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:19.980
And that's -- I think with
many languages at Columbia,

01:08:19.980 --> 01:08:22.120
that's usually -- very often
is the case, that it's --

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:26.390
the target language is what
is -- what you hear in class.

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:28.870
I certainly have heard it in --

01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:34.850
having been reviewing the
Chinese teacher, and hearing --

01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:36.320
not that I know -- but I was --

01:08:36.320 --> 01:08:40.530
as an external reviewer of a
particular Chinese teacher,

01:08:40.530 --> 01:08:45.240
and there was an elementary
Chinese Mandarin class

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:48.760
where there was just this
noise in the classroom

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.110
that the students were producing.

01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:53.250
And she was keeping
it very organized

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:56.890
at the same time as
it was exuberant.

01:08:56.890 --> 01:09:01.090
So the fact that they meet --

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:04.720
that students have gotten used
to the idea that Finnish --

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.750
Finns might come anytime.

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:09.100
Because I very often them have --

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:14.110
I used to, and my younger
colleagues who've followed after,

01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:17.850
have often done it as well,
having a Finn visit a class.

01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:23.670
And then, the Finn is sort of --
they really have to be kind of a --

01:09:23.670 --> 01:09:26.780
kind of interested person,
who is not going to say,

01:09:26.780 --> 01:09:28.630
"Why are you studying Finnish?"

01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:31.870
Which, of course, very many
people will ask, but I sort of --

01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:34.650
I said, like, that's
not one thing we'd say.

01:09:34.650 --> 01:09:38.200
And we will not -- we will
not slip into English.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.790
We will stay in Finnish.

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:44.310 position:56%
But it then has to be -- that person
has to be sensitive to children,

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:48.150 position:56%
because you have to have someone
who doesn't start telling them, "Oh,

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:51.020
you speak better than you,"
or something like that.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:58.210
No. But in most cases -- in
just about all cases, it is --

01:09:58.210 --> 01:10:00.250
it has been very successful.

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:04.160
So that then, when President
Ahtisaari gets his honorary

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:11.310
doctorate at Columbia in 2000, and
after various cajoling of the --

01:10:11.310 --> 01:10:18.180
of getting the permit to get the
students to meet him afterwards,

01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.840
and he addresses the students.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.370
And they have a meeting,
and everyone can --

01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:26.290 position:56%
is able to say something in Finnish.

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:30.780
And then, Ahtisaari also
spoke a lot in English,

01:10:30.780 --> 01:10:33.900
dealing with world sort of affairs.

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:35.460
But they had the meeting.

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:41.110
And another one, when President
Tarja Halonen, in the fall of 2005,

01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:44.810
I believe it was, gave
the opening lecture

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:51.010
at Columbia's World
Leaders Forum, where --

01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:57.600
when all the heads of state
arrive at the UN for those weeks,

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.320
they are -- they are then,
very often come to Columbia.

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.530
And she met them, and spoke Finnish
with them, and told a funny story.

01:11:04.530 --> 01:11:09.170
And so these events become
then part of the curriculum

01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:11.680 position:56%
of that particular year, and that --

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:17.340
those classes, and the students
then go back and research more

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.880
about the people whom they've met.

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:22.490
Now, we've met -- we've
also had people

01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:25.570
who are not presidents, as well.

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:29.210
But in a way, that -- the fact
that you've spoken with a Finn,

01:11:29.210 --> 01:11:34.510
or with some Finns, lets you
be natural when the President

01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:37.490
of Finland shakes your
hand, and you say --

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:39.690
he says something, or
she says something.

01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:41.810
And you can -- you know
that there's something

01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:45.720
that you might say,
or you might ask.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:52.650
So then, I will also move to one of
the events that we've used a lot,

01:11:52.650 --> 01:11:55.370
which has -- it doesn't
seem possibly --

01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:57.670
perhaps, it doesn't seem likely.

01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:01.910
That if you declare that you're
going to have a multilingual,

01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:09.850
multicultural evening on Kalevala
poetry in many, many languages,

01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:14.060
it might not seem part
of language teaching.

01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:17.340
But it ends up being, which is
really very kind of interesting.

01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:21.520
It -- the fact that
we've now had many --

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.120
several Kalevala marathons
of anything from [inaudible].

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:29.210
The first one was eight hours, and
second -- then it was six hours,

01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:36.280
and then it's been four or five
hours of Kalevala in just this --

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:42.130
there would be tables with
translations into other languages.

01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:45.400
And since the Kalevala
has been translated

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:50.420
into over 60 foreign
languages by now,

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:54.250
and if Columbia still teaches
more than 40 foreign languages --

01:12:54.250 --> 01:13:00.690 position:56%
so it seems like -- and then, 40% of
Columbia faculty are foreign-born.

01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:06.490
And New York is -- I don't even
frankly know how many languages,

01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:10.330
but it's somewhere around 200
languages spoken around New York.

01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:12.680
All you need to do is
to be in a subway car,

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.220
and you know that there are
languages you don't know

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:16.520
that are being spoken.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:19.360
So that there's --
the milieu, in a way,

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.320
is hospitable to something
like this.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.410
Then, the fact that many young
Finnish artists come to New York --

01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:29.260
some of them are performing
artists, and some are --

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:32.170 position:56%
and many musicians come to New York.

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:36.330
And they get sort of slightly
homesick for tribal events, too.

01:13:36.330 --> 01:13:39.080
So they're happy to
come and perform.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.620
So one person who has been
solid, always on hand and willing

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:47.240
to do her piece is Stina
Elt [assumed spelling],

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:50.180
who lives not far from
the university.

01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:56.620
And she has always been part
of the Kalevala marathon,

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.160
and done it in Finland Swedish,

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.290
which was actually her first
language, and then in Finnish.

01:14:02.290 --> 01:14:04.580
And she's done wonderful things.

01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:07.060
Younger artists, such
as Thomas Hildanen

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.960
and Ulla Swalko [assumed
spelling], who are both musicians

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:17.350
and wonderful performers, have
also been very steadfastly --

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:19.370
but when they're -- now,
they have both left New York.

01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:21.090
So we'll see what happens.

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:25.150
But we will -- we will -- there
definitely are musicians who are --

01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:26.450
and they're usually interested.

01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:30.220
And it's always done with a
sort of [foreign language],

01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:35.520
sort of work party/barn raising,

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:38.740
that you'll perform,
and then we'll eat.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.200
That's a little bit -- and when --

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.790
those years when the Consulate
General has been able to --

01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:47.880
and it has to do with
their budgets, too,

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:52.170
has been able to have his
chefs do wonderful things,

01:14:52.170 --> 01:14:57.040
like [foreign language], and
sort of basic Finnish happy --

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.230
comfort foods, and treasures.

01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:04.540
So those have been very --
they've been very, very successful.

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:08.230
And sometimes, the students -- in
a way, that when you have students

01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:10.830
who -- and -- but it always
centers around the students.

01:15:10.830 --> 01:15:14.070
And so, that the students are
either studying Finnish language

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:18.300
and culture in Finnish
language classes, but then also,

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.250
I've taught a great many folk
-- Kalevala [foreign language]

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.170
and Finnish folklore classes,

01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:26.970
that those students become really
quite knowledgeable about it

01:15:26.970 --> 01:15:30.800
in a way, from having read it.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.260
In a -- and then the
-- once the -- that --

01:15:33.260 --> 01:15:37.980
those courses can also be English,
so that the translation comes in.

01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:41.090
And there are five excellent
translations into English,

01:15:41.090 --> 01:15:43.430
and they can choose
which they like best,

01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:46.960
which they find suits them best.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:52.120
But there also -- we've
had sometimes 21 languages,

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.200
sometimes 26 languages
that have been --

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:59.990
including Hindi, including Quenya.

01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:06.380
Now, then came the whole notion of
the Tolkien fans, who, these days,

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:09.660
truly flock -- I mean, the
past -- I'd say past 15 years,

01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:13.600
there have been many Tolkien
specialists among the students.

01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.450
And they almost know
their Tolkien by heart.

01:16:15.450 --> 01:16:19.810
I don't, but -- so one
year, a student said, "Well,

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:24.610
I'm learning Quenya on the -- on
the internet, and there's a course.

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:25.910
And I'm taking it.

01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:27.210
And I've learned quite a bit."

01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:32.130 position:56%
And then, as she got bolder about --
learned more, then she said, "Now,

01:16:32.130 --> 01:16:34.740
for the Kalevala marathon,
would it be really --

01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:37.480
would it be okay, would it be dumb

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.960
if I translated some
of it into Quenya?"

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.600
And the class said, "Why don't you?

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:45.900
I mean, please do."

01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:51.450
So she chose the second
rune, or second canto,

01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:55.790
where Sam Sapellervoinen
[assumed spelling], a tiny lad,

01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:58.690
sows all the trees, and
puts them into the --

01:16:58.690 --> 01:17:01.410
and has them growing in
the right kind of soil.

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:06.130
It almost sounds like a forestry
specialist's workbook, in --

01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:09.810
because it lists the trees.

01:17:09.810 --> 01:17:11.910
And she said, "Oh, yeah,
well, I'm doing it.

01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:15.540
It's just that Quenya doesn't have
as many different names for trees,

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:18.520
so I'll have to be kind
of brief about it."

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:22.610
And then, they -- then the -- her
classmates encouraged her to --

01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:25.320
well, you'll read that at
the marathon, won't you?

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.740
And she said, "Oh, yes.

01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.040
Yes, yes, I will."

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.120
And she did, and it was a big hit.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:35.870
There were other Quenya in -- sort
of oriented people there as well.

01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:39.010
And so the -- part of the
-- and the students --

01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:42.700 position:56%
but then, it also gives the students
agency, that Finnish is a --

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:47.700
sometimes not an easy
challenge to get through.

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:53.310
They also will need -- need a sense
of -- that they can -- they can --

01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:58.860
they can have a lot
of say how it is done.

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:08.050
So one year, particularly
-- in 2005, I think it was.

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:11.910
There was a class that was --
had one city planner, had very --

01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:13.680
had one computer specialist,

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:16.050
and they all took different
parts on how to do it.

01:18:16.050 --> 01:18:18.400
And they just took it, and
ran with it, and did it.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:24.620 position:56%
And so their agency in putting on an
event to which 90 performers came,

01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:30.500 position:56%
and people appreciated their
efforts -- also, everyone I could --

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:35.200
and yet, there was the affective
effort -- effect of the --

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:39.140
of the music, of everything
that went into the --

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:43.780
into the marathon was very
helpful in their learning.

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:46.140
So -- and my time is up.

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:47.440
&gt;&gt; About.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.740
&gt;&gt; About. Okay.

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.040
I shall then -- I shall
then wrap up.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:52.250
There's a -- one starts
thinking about --

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:55.660
there was a question of how --

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:57.860
I will then just say
a couple of things.

01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:00.680
My new colleague, Haley
Sylvia [assumed spelling],

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.780
who has just started this
year, is involved in a --

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:12.260
in an arrangement with
Columbia where students at Yale

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:16.770
and Cornell can take
courses at Columbia

01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:19.570
if their universities
don't offer it.

01:19:19.570 --> 01:19:25.020
And so she's teaching Finnish now,
and they are using their virtual --

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.680
the virtual Yale person

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:29.850
and the Cornell person are
going to be also involved.

01:19:29.850 --> 01:19:38.090
Also, through the consortium of --
with Julliard School and others,

01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:41.990
people from other universities can
also study Finnish at Columbia.

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:46.370
And so it seems to be -- it's
been a good start this year.

01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:50.200
And there are Tolkien
fans, again, and --

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.050
so they are -- they're
charging ahead.

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:56.950
And maybe some of them
will follow the footsteps

01:19:56.950 --> 01:20:01.750
of the earlier students who
really have made major --

01:20:01.750 --> 01:20:04.810
for whose careers the study

01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:08.100
of Finnish has been very
central and important.

01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:10.410
So we keep on working.

01:20:10.410 --> 01:20:12.210
Thank you.

01:20:12.210 --> 01:20:20.280
[ Applause ]

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.580
&gt;&gt; Hillary Virtanen: My
name is Hillary Virtanen,

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:23.910
and I'm the assistant professor
of Finnish and Nordic studies

01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:26.610
at Finlandia University
in Hancock, Michigan.

01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:29.960
And my presentation is called
"My Grandma Used To Say That:

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.790
Finnish As A Heritage
Language In The Upper Midwest."

01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:34.950
I also -- well, the camera's on,

01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:36.340
and my family will be
watching this later.

01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:38.140
Happy birthday to my
youngest sister, Erin --

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:40.040
my second-youngest sister.

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:41.340
We'll call her the youngest.

01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:43.580
Thank you for letting
me be out of town today.

01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:48.150
So the day was May 12th, 2017,
and I had just arrived in Helsinki

01:20:48.150 --> 01:20:51.480 position:56%
with my study abroad class from
Finlandia University for a few weeks

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.840
of observation, documentation,
and interviewing,

01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.560
to learn about Finland's
past, present, and future.

01:20:57.560 --> 01:21:00.350
My own excitement at returning to
a country I know as a researcher

01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:02.680
and as an ethnic Finn
from America was bolstered

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.640
by the excitement of my students.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:08.010
Two of my three students were
also ethnic Finns, and one was --

01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:10.300
experienced her first
moments on Finnish soil.

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:13.200
I had already begun my process
of re-acclimating myself

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.410
to Finnish language by
greeting our travel agent,

01:21:15.410 --> 01:21:16.710
Mikho [assumed spelling],
and telling him all

01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:19.590
about our day layover in Iceland.

01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:22.150
As we settled into the bus, my
attention turned to my student,

01:21:22.150 --> 01:21:25.450
Leia, who has Finnish heritage
on both sides of her family.

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:27.200
She had an intent expression
on her face

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.150
that I had seen others make before.

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:31.380
She was drinking in the
land her family had left

01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:34.020
over 100 years earlier
for the first time.

01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:36.130
As we drove from the
airport into Helsinki,

01:21:36.130 --> 01:21:39.170
we all looked around at the
modern city, the cars, the Finnish

01:21:39.170 --> 01:21:41.030
and Swedish language road signs.

01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:44.840 position:56%
[Foreign language] I heard the voice
next to me, and nodded in agreement,

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.580
until I realized that the person
who quietly said to look was Leia,

01:21:48.580 --> 01:21:50.590
who had never spoken a
word of Finnish to me

01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:52.360
in the conversational context.

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:55.240
I looked at her in
amazement, and she continued.

01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:56.770
"My grandma used to say that.

01:21:56.770 --> 01:21:58.490
That means look, right?"

01:21:58.490 --> 01:22:01.270 position:56%
I smiled, and said, "Yeah, it does."

01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:03.160
Leia, in her first
moments in Finland,

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.430
was channelling what she knew
of the language of the country

01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:07.520
that her family had
left so long ago,

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.500
but which hadn't entirely
left them yet.

01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.350 position:56%
It shouldn't be incredibly
surprising that Leia, a young woman,

01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:15.810
would be able to recall words
and their meaning in a language

01:22:15.810 --> 01:22:17.420
in which she was not fluent.

01:22:17.420 --> 01:22:18.800
Her home community
in Houghton County,

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.790
Michigan boasts the
largest concentration

01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:24.710
of ethnic Finns outside of Finland,
and over the past 100 years,

01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:27.320 position:56%
Finnish language and culture have
continued to have an important place

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.580
in the community's
private and public life.

01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:34.330
According to the 2013 U.S. Census
American Community Survey estimate,

01:22:34.330 --> 01:22:37.910
just under 32% of Houghton County
residents indicated Finnish

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:41.520
as being either their primary
or secondary ethnic ancestry.

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.090
This means that, in this
county, they are the largest --

01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:45.390
they are the ethnic majority.

01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:48.790
As can be seen in this map that we
can't see, but I can show you later

01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:51.940
if you're interested, Finnish
ancestry is a rather common trait

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:55.750 position:56%
across the Lake Superior region,
which includes Minnesota, Wisconsin,

01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:58.310
upper Michigan, and areas
around Ontario, too.

01:22:58.310 --> 01:23:01.990 position:56%
And so we affectionately know of
this region as being the Sauna Belt.

01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:03.870
And if you ever need a
sauna, just drive around.

01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:05.170
You'll see one.

01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:06.470
You can ask.

01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:08.590
In everyday terms, this means that
Finnish culture is a visible part

01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:11.310
of the community for those
who are Finnish or not.

01:23:11.310 --> 01:23:15.490
Finns, though originally heavily
stigmatized as being undesirable,

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:18.930
second-wave, eastern European
immigrants in the late 1800s,

01:23:18.930 --> 01:23:22.620
have gradually come to a place
of semi-esteem in the region,

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:26.130
and have asserted pride in their
culture in a number of ways.

01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:28.920
In Houghton County and places
like it, towns with Finnish names

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:31.260
like Doyvila [assumed
spelling], Isanti, Tapiola

01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:33.760
and Oulu dot the map,
though the pronunciation

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:36.880
of these words may differ from
how we would hear them in Finland.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.180
Businesses have Finnish names,

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.090
either because of the
proprietor's surname,

01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:42.900
or because of a conscious
decision to use a Finnish name.

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:45.990
Restaurants may offer Finnish baked
goods, and churches originating

01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:47.640
from the Finnish State
Lutheran Church

01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:51.890
or the Northern Nordic Laestadian
Lutheran Movement are found

01:23:51.890 --> 01:23:54.050
in abundance in this region.

01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:56.760
And there are people who speak
this language in varying degrees

01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.420
from native and near-native fluency
to the use of a sprinkling of terms

01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:02.250
that maintained for
a variety of reasons.

01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:04.940
And I will describe this variable
situation for you in this paper.

01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:09.020
Finns began to come to the upper
midwest starting in the 1860s,

01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:11.150
with work opportunities
in mining as a result

01:24:11.150 --> 01:24:14.000
of the Civil War production
and worker shortages.

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.440
It is merely a coincidence that
these migrants should have come

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:19.120
to a place that is geographically
so similar to Finland.

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.940
A common idea among
Finnish-Americans and those

01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:26.160
that learn about them is that
this similarity drew the Finns,

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.460
but this is not based in truth.

01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.580
It's perhaps rather a
good deal of serendipity,

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:31.770
especially when they started
farming, and they knew exactly how

01:24:31.770 --> 01:24:33.220
to farm in a rocky, frozen place

01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:35.710
that has a super short
growing season.

01:24:35.710 --> 01:24:38.310
When they came, they knew no
English, and they were relegated

01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:41.550 position:56%
to the hard labor jobs that required
little talking beyond gestures,

01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:44.640
shouts indicating danger, and
basic mining vocabulary learned

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:46.250
on the job.

01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:49.280
Under these circumstances, it was
rather common for Finnish-Americans

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.560
to create a Finnish
language community in order

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.130
to meet their basic needs
in their new setting.

01:24:54.130 --> 01:24:57.200
With a higher literacy rate than
similar recently-arrived groups,

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.570
Finns had the means to create
their own infrastructure,

01:24:59.570 --> 01:25:02.840
and over the next half-century,
Finnish language businesses,

01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.590
newspapers, temperance
societies, churches, workers' halls

01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:08.400
and other concerns
became rather common

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.970
in the areas in which they settled.

01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:13.720
As many Finns still arrived to
the towns that offered jobs,

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:15.710
others were able to retreat
into the countryside,

01:25:15.710 --> 01:25:18.300
and to create farming
communities based on homesteads

01:25:18.300 --> 01:25:21.470
and stump farms created on
the leavings of lumberjacks.

01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:23.560
Under these conditions,
and due to the fact

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:26.390
that Finnish was incomprehensible
to any other linguistic community

01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:29.550 position:56%
in the reason, Finnish was able to
live on in some form for much longer

01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:32.230
than many of the other immigrant
languages in the region.

01:25:32.230 --> 01:25:36.690
As Finns incorporated further
into the local community,

01:25:36.690 --> 01:25:40.420 position:56%
a unique transitional dialect known
as Finglish or Fingliskad developed,

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:42.330
merging Finnish and
sometimes Swedish words

01:25:42.330 --> 01:25:44.780
with Finnish word order, phonetics
and grammatical roles, and --

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:46.080
actually, Dan probably --

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:47.440
Dan has actually taught
me a lot about Finglish.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:50.110
I really appreciate his early
comments in some of my research

01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:51.410
when it first started out.

01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:54.260
So he probably has great
things to say about it.

01:25:54.260 --> 01:25:56.100
So this language, to say the least,

01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.950
is extremely creative
and fun to use.

01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:59.430
And an example of its creativity,

01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:01.330
which I don't have the
visual graphic for,

01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:02.690
would be the sentence
[foreign language].

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:08.070
Is there anybody here who
knows what that means?

01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:09.720
Yes -- yeah.

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.010
Because we were pushed into
that [foreign language], right?

01:26:12.010 --> 01:26:14.780
Okay, so -- but -- so
this is actually --

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:20.530
it takes English words and
uses Finnish case ending rules.

01:26:20.530 --> 01:26:22.800
And so [foreign language]
means to push.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:28.520 position:56%
[Foreign language] is a baby buggy,
and it's got the vestapt [phonetic],

01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:30.920
the genitive kind of form.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:34.200
You're going to push
the whole thing.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.500
[Foreign language] means kitchen.

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:36.800
So [foreign language]
means from the kitchen,

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.450 position:56%
and [foreign language] is a bedroom.

01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:40.200
Into the bedroom.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:46.090
So you're pushing the baby buggy
from the kitchen into the bedroom.

01:26:46.090 --> 01:26:48.600
And oh -- but now it's just
the big TVs that don't work.

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.190
That's okay.

01:26:50.190 --> 01:26:52.480
[ Laughter ]

01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.570
I'm allergic to computers,
so it's -- you know.

01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:59.400
So the Finnish brought over by the
immigrants also continued to live

01:26:59.400 --> 01:27:01.610
on in a number of areas
of daily life.

01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:04.200
The children of immigrants,
and their children, and so on,

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:07.030
became further incorporated
into English-speaking life

01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:10.290
through public education,
employment, military service,

01:27:10.290 --> 01:27:14.010
inter-ethnic romances, and exposure
to mass media and popular culture.

01:27:14.010 --> 01:27:17.550
In 1937, Finnish-American scholar
John Komeinen [assumed spelling]

01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:18.850
notes these very factors

01:27:18.850 --> 01:27:22.830
in the language shift taking place
among the children of immigrants.

01:27:38.090 --> 01:27:41.810
Sorry. I'm just going to
turn this on, if it'll work.

01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:43.550
If not, I'll just keep talking.

01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:46.160
So anyway, John Komeinen
in 1937 notes

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.440
that these very factors are
affecting language shift among the

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.170
children of immigrants, though
some token nods to continued use

01:27:52.170 --> 01:27:53.470
of Finnish, mostly

01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:56.320
through Finnish-American social
organizations, were made.

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:59.150
The pressures of Americanization
were compounded

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:04.050
by local inter-ethnic social
problems, including suspicions

01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:06.920
against Finnish leftist
political and labor organizations

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.180
from the 1910s to the 1950s.

01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:12.480
&gt;&gt; Yay.

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.780
&gt;&gt; Hillary Virtanen: Yay.

01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:15.080
So there's my sentence.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.380
So [foreign language] And
so I wrote this, you know --

01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:18.600
baby buggy, the B and
P relation sound,

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.040
and you can see the case
endings that, of course,

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:24.130
are quite famous in Finnish.

01:28:24.130 --> 01:28:25.430
[Foreign language],
from the kitchen,

01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:26.870
that S-T-A that Dan
had mentioned earlier,

01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:29.800
and then [foreign language],
that extra A-N at the end

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.070
of that word means that
you're going into it.

01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:34.640
So these are very, very common
Finnish-American sentences

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.650
that you would hear, and
that have nothing to do --

01:28:36.650 --> 01:28:38.230
what is it, like, [foreign
language], right?

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.840
Like, yeah, something like that.

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:45.680
So it'd be quite different
in Finnish.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.380
Like, they're very kind of
incomprehensible to each other.

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:52.330
So I will scoot forward.

01:28:52.330 --> 01:28:56.130
So yes, this is, you know, some
radical Finns up in upper Michigan.

01:28:56.130 --> 01:28:58.210
There were a lot of
strikes that we end

01:28:58.210 --> 01:29:00.200
up seeing causing social
problems with people.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:04.580
Oh, wait here -- sorry.

01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:07.400
Okay. So the pressures of
Americanization are compounded

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:10.360
by these local inter-ethnic
problems, including suspiciousness

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:13.140
against Finnish leftist
political and labor organizations

01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:15.670
from the 1910s to the 1950s.

01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:18.200
In the upper midwest, this
resulted from several divisive

01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:20.820
and deadly labor strikes,
resultant blacklisting

01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:23.920
and general social deprecation
of Finns, the residual effects

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.400
which live on today in areas
such as the copper country.

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.640
To speak Finnish in public areas
marked you as disloyal and radical

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:33.530
at worst, and a provincial
bumpkin at best.

01:29:33.530 --> 01:29:36.540
It -- this didn't, however,
stop Finnish-Americans

01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:39.160
from using their language in
several venues that were safe to --

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:42.370
safe to use it in, including
the church and the home.

01:29:42.370 --> 01:29:46.040
From 1962 until 2014, the
Evangelical Lutheran Church

01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:49.450
of America maintained a special
Suomi conference of the church

01:29:49.450 --> 01:29:51.960
to reflect the needs of
Finnish ethnic parishioners.

01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.330
And people to this day
still sing Christmas carols,

01:29:54.330 --> 01:29:57.730 position:56%
make Finnish foods, take saunas,
and use a variety of obscure Finnish

01:29:57.730 --> 01:30:00.280
and Finglish words to
describe everyday things.

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.620
This is where Finnish starts to
come in as a heritage language.

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:05.470
A heritage language, though often
defined in many multiple ways

01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:08.620
by linguists, is meant here
by me as being a language

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:10.970
that a person recognizes
as having a relationship

01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:12.370
with that person's
own ethnic heritage,

01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:14.180 position:56%
whether they speak any of it or not.

01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:16.390
So it has a significance to
them as a part of their own kind

01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:18.070
of internal sense of culture.

01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:23.110
In the 1960s and 1970s,
Finnish-Americans took part

01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:24.800
in a resurgence of ethnic identity

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.990
that was also taking place among
many other white Americans,

01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:29.000
and this is also after
the Civil Rights Movement.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.700
So this was a whole
period in American life

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:33.840 position:56%
when people were asserting
different identities, and, you know,

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:37.820
a lot of great, wonderful
things came out of that.

01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:40.230 position:56%
It was also an opportunity for these
previously marginalized groups,

01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:42.520
including Finnish-Americans
in the upper midwest,

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.820
to look at their heritage
in a new light.

01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:45.790
And this happened at
about the same time

01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:47.680
that longstanding Finnish
community groups,

01:30:47.680 --> 01:30:50.750
including temperance societies,
Finnish-language churches,

01:30:50.750 --> 01:30:53.180
and consumer cooperatives,
were having their last splash

01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:55.030
with the Finnish language,
and were moving

01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:56.760
to primarily English-language
groups,

01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:58.980
if not disbanding altogether.

01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:01.650 position:56%
At this time, the loss of the
language became a source of distress

01:31:01.650 --> 01:31:03.160
within the community,
and they started throwing

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.730
out ropes to rescue the language.

01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:08.040
The Salolampi Finnish Language
Camp was one of the first,

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:10.260
most concrete examples
of an institution

01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:12.690
that was created specifically to
teach Finnish language to youth

01:31:12.690 --> 01:31:14.730
in the ethnic group, and also
outside the ethnic group.

01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:17.420
A lot of people from all walks
of life have gone to Salolampi.

01:31:17.420 --> 01:31:21.040
It's a camp that's run by Concordia
University in Morehead, Minnesota,

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:23.620
and it provides a total immersive
language learning environment

01:31:23.620 --> 01:31:25.400
in which English is not used.

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.010
For many Finnish-American youth,

01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:30.390
this camp has become an important
experience in their childhood.

01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:33.010
Finnish language has also been
offered, at least since the 1970s,

01:31:33.010 --> 01:31:34.920
at the University of
Minnesota Twin Cities.

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.220
I think -- was Boutier
[assumed spelling] maybe the one

01:31:36.220 --> 01:31:37.520
who started that?

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.820
&gt;&gt; '60s.

01:31:38.820 --> 01:31:40.120
&gt;&gt; Hillary Virtanen: '60s.

01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:41.420
Oh, okay. Good.

01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:42.720
&gt;&gt; Even before that.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.020
&gt;&gt; Hillary Virtanen:
Even before that.

01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.320
But, yeah, it kind of really
gets -- gets in there.

01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:46.620
And it's been taught off and
on at Finlandia University,

01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:47.920
which was known as Suomi
College until 2000,

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.300
as well as the University
of Wisconsin, Madison.

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:51.160
So this means that
ethnic Finns that live

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:54.230
in the region have a wide variety
of study options for, you know,

01:31:54.230 --> 01:31:56.760
local and regional universities.

01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:59.490 position:56%
Community language classes have
also been offered in varying degrees

01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:02.350
in small institutions across
the midwest that have a stake

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:05.990 position:56%
in maintaining Finnish traditions
in the everyday, including language.

01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:08.540
At the Finnish-American Heritage
Center in Hancock, Michigan,

01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:10.810
for instance, community Finnish
classes have been offered

01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:12.840
since the 1990s.

01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:15.650
In 2004, I undertook a
survey of students currently

01:32:15.650 --> 01:32:18.590
or previously enrolled in the
Finnish language classes offered

01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:19.890
in high schools in Houghton County,

01:32:19.890 --> 01:32:21.880
Michigan through a
distance learning program.

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:24.010
These schools created the
distance learning program in order

01:32:24.010 --> 01:32:26.920
to increase course offerings in
the rural schools of the area.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.790
It was an opportunity to understand
both the cultural experiences

01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:32.630 position:56%
of the students who studied Finnish,
their attitudes toward the language,

01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:34.000
and their ideas for its future

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.590
through their own interactions
with it.

01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:37.590
High school Finnish
is no longer offered

01:32:37.590 --> 01:32:39.170
in the Houghton County
schools, unfortunately.

01:32:39.170 --> 01:32:41.680
Those students do have
the opportunity to take it

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:44.600
through community enrichment
classes at Finlandia University,

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.380
or in dual-enrollment programs
through Finlandia University,

01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:49.650
but that's a little more
difficult, just scheduling-wise,

01:32:49.650 --> 01:32:51.620
and also because it's
a very rural area.

01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:53.740
So kids would have to drive
pretty far for, you know,

01:32:53.740 --> 01:32:55.900
an hour-long class
four times a week.

01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:58.570
High school foreign language
classes are generally designed

01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:00.330
to create a certain
level of fluency,

01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:02.660
and to provide a very minimal
amount of cultural instruction.

01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:05.790
So if you've ever taken Spanish,
or French, and any other language

01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:08.760
at a public school in the U.S., you
know the basic formula for this.

01:33:08.760 --> 01:33:11.240
In the heritage context, however,
there are added imperatives

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:15.120
and interests, and value-added
curricula address these concerns.

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:17.890
Students attended concerts of
Finnish folk music and participated

01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:19.980
in Finnish Independence
Day celebrations.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:22.160
They conducted family
history projects.

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.990
One of these students is standing
before you today, holding a Ph.D.

01:33:24.990 --> 01:33:28.010 position:56%
in Scandinavian folklore, and taking
my own students to Finland each year

01:33:28.010 --> 01:33:30.110
for their own discoveries
and connections.

01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:33.070
So in my survey, I was connected
-- I was concerned with the level

01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:35.570
and types of exposures students
had to aspects of Finnish culture

01:33:35.570 --> 01:33:39.190
in America, including language,
food ways, traditional arts, music,

01:33:39.190 --> 01:33:40.970
and popular culture from Finland.

01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:43.510
These students' experiences differ
sharply from the experiences

01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:47.550
and motivations of non-ethnic
students, who I've also taught

01:33:47.550 --> 01:33:49.810
at the University of
Wisconsin and Finlandia.

01:33:49.810 --> 01:33:51.110
While Finnish popular culture

01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:54.380
and particularly heavy metal
music typically attract non-Finns,

01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:56.510
Finnish-American students will
often be completely unaware

01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:58.680
of Finnish pop culture,
and may know about,

01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:01.720
if not completely identify with,
the older Finnish-American culture

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:04.570
of the 1940s and 1950s
that their grandparents

01:34:04.570 --> 01:34:06.740
and other elders have
presented as authentic.

01:34:06.740 --> 01:34:10.240
In the survey, nine of the 10
respondents explicitly cited their

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:12.530
family heritage as being the
motivating factor for them

01:34:12.530 --> 01:34:14.330
to study Finnish, and the student

01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:16.860
who didn't specifically say
this actually provided answers

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:20.120
that indicated that this was
also the case for him or her.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:22.700 position:56%
Students were interested in learning
about Finland's history and culture,

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:25.810
and many either had visited
Finland or had hopes to do so.

01:34:25.810 --> 01:34:27.300
Their language exposure outside

01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:29.840
of class typically included
the family use of small sets

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:33.830
of vocabulary -- for instance,
swear words or exclamations.

01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:37.320
A lot of us learned those as
our first words, me included.

01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:39.680
Through their language study,
they all increased their knowledge

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:41.980
of Finland itself and
of Finnish America.

01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:44.360
As these were anonymous
surveys, I don't have the ability

01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:47.190
to track these respondents today,
but they provide important clues

01:34:47.190 --> 01:34:50.030
to youth attitudes toward
Finnish as a heritage language.

01:34:50.030 --> 01:34:52.840
For many of these, languages served
to possibly rekindle the language,

01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.020
as their parents typically
didn't speak Finnish,

01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.550
and many grandparents did.

01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:59.100
So a lot of students specifically
said, "I can talk to my grandpa,

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.040
and my mom and dad don't
know what we're saying."

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:03.850
So, I mean, I think grandpa's got
some juicy gossip or something.

01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:06.430
So these surveys reveal the fact

01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:09.050
that there are these positive
attitudes toward Finnish language

01:35:09.050 --> 01:35:11.130
that exist in Houghton County.

01:35:11.130 --> 01:35:13.850
Other, more observational,
data also supports this.

01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:16.360
Periodic birth announcements
in the local paper reveal that,

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.290
over the past 15 years or
so, Finnish names are popular

01:35:19.290 --> 01:35:21.100
with parents naming
babies, and often,

01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:23.000
these names reflect a
Finnish-American past,

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.110
as opposed to naming
trends in Finland today.

01:35:25.110 --> 01:35:30.180
So in 2013, I started teaching
an introductory Finnish language

01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:33.100
community enrichment class at the
Finnish-American Heritage Center,

01:35:33.100 --> 01:35:35.240
which I continued to
teach for three years.

01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:37.940
These classes were organized into
a fall term and a winter term,

01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:40.140
consisting of a weekly
hour-long session meeting

01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:41.440
for a total of 10 weeks.

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:43.750
So this is very low contact, right?

01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:45.470
And when I first designed
this class,

01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:47.980
I did so with very little prior
knowledge of how to go about it,

01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:49.870
and how it would work
out in reality.

01:35:49.870 --> 01:35:51.790
And so as my teaching
continued, I learned a lot

01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:54.590
about the adult motivations
for studying Finnish,

01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:56.340
and about the context and dialects

01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:58.890
in which adults were
exposed to language.

01:35:58.890 --> 01:36:01.110
The majority of my students
were locals of Finnish heritage

01:36:01.110 --> 01:36:04.340
above the age of 50, though the
classes did also attract community

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:05.780
residents outside of the heritage.

01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:07.940
And these are two of them.

01:36:07.940 --> 01:36:10.630 position:56%
And -- Marvin and Rebecca, actually.

01:36:10.630 --> 01:36:12.490
And so these people
typically who were outside

01:36:12.490 --> 01:36:14.520
of the heritage community were
going to go visit Finland,

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:16.510
or they were just curious about
the language, and they had --

01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:18.820
you know, just kind of a
general avocational interest.

01:36:18.820 --> 01:36:21.430
Several times, parents or
grandparents also enrolled

01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:24.010
with a child or grandchild,
and so my youngest student was

01:36:24.010 --> 01:36:26.920
about eight years old, and my
oldest students were in their 70s.

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:30.080
One of the challenges I first
discovered in this class was

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.950
that each term was essentially a
fresh start, which meant that I had

01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:35.650
to start each term at the very
beginning with Finnish alphabet

01:36:35.650 --> 01:36:38.360
and basic pronunciation rules,
though many people caught

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:41.140
on very quickly, or had
previous exposure to it.

01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:43.450
And so, each term,
the entire six terms

01:36:43.450 --> 01:36:47.120 position:56%
that I taught included students who
also previously enrolled in a class.

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:50.120
So one student took four
or five terms with me.

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:51.790
And -- you know, this
-- I was like, oh, gosh,

01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:53.610
I better teach him some
other words, right?

01:36:53.610 --> 01:36:56.140
So several others came close
to this attendance record, too.

01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:58.390
And because of this, I
designed my classes to start

01:36:58.390 --> 01:37:00.780
with the basic pronunciation
and greetings, introductions,

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:03.840
that kind of vocabulary, and then I
rotated the rest of the lesson sets

01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:05.140
around so that students enrolling

01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:08.000
in multiple years would get a
wider variety of vocabulary sets.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:11.540
So I would include things like
travel, work, food, home life,

01:37:11.540 --> 01:37:14.580
family and friends, animals,
all kinds of stuff like that.

01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:16.290
But that way, you wouldn't
just be getting the same thing

01:37:16.290 --> 01:37:17.680
from me every time.

01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:20.520
Several times, my academic training
in Finnish language came at odds

01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:22.820
with the daily language that
my students heard in the home.

01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:24.120
Our food unit, for instance,

01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.230
often had people mention
other words they knew instead,

01:37:26.230 --> 01:37:28.250
making them wonder if
they knew the wrong word.

01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:29.670
The word "fork," for
instance, [foreign language],

01:37:29.670 --> 01:37:33.140
caused one student,
very crestfallen to ask,

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:34.440
"So you mean it's not
[foreign language]?

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:37.100
That's the word we used at home."

01:37:37.100 --> 01:37:39.000
This example made me
incredibly excited,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.370
because it revealed another
dimension of Finnish language use

01:37:41.370 --> 01:37:44.970
in the community, in which
Swedish words were Finnicized.

01:37:44.970 --> 01:37:46.740
The word she had used
for the fork came

01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:48.040 position:56%
from the Swedish [foreign language].

01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:50.580
No, you're not wrong at all.

01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:52.140
Your family must've
come from a region

01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:53.770
that had contact with Swedish.

01:37:53.770 --> 01:37:55.870
That word is likely from
the Meankieli dialect,

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:57.170
which is really interesting.

01:37:57.170 --> 01:37:59.170
And that's a really
beautiful dialect of Finnish.

01:37:59.170 --> 01:38:00.670
Like, that's exciting.

01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:03.170
So, you know, I got exposure to
these kind of things all the time.

01:38:03.170 --> 01:38:07.660
The word potato also
caused a lot of problems.

01:38:07.660 --> 01:38:08.960
[Laughter] They -- I always
say [foreign language],

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.260
and they always say
[foreign language].

01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:12.600
So, as I continued my
teaching, it became clear early

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.120
on that fluency was not the object
for the vast majority of students.

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:18.440
They realized they were beyond the
peak language acquisition years

01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.740
of youth.

01:38:19.740 --> 01:38:23.130
So for them, instead, the emotional
component was much more important.

01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:25.200
They wanted to understand
the words to hymns

01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:27.100
and nursery rhymes
that they remembered.

01:38:27.100 --> 01:38:28.870
They wanted to talk about
food they still ate,

01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:31.350
and about cousins they
had visited in Finland.

01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:33.980
The language class was a window
to a whole world of Finnishness

01:38:33.980 --> 01:38:36.340
in which they were
active participants.

01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:38.920
Our class was a farm for nostalgia,
and for making connections

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:42.110
between the Finnish-American
experience and Finnishness itself.

01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:45.510 position:56%
Sometimes, the simple act of rolling
our ehrs [phonetic] and saying ah,

01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:47.890
ih, ew [phonetic] in rapid
succession was what was

01:38:47.890 --> 01:38:49.190
most important.

01:38:49.190 --> 01:38:51.640
Sometimes reflecting on the
Finland of today and the Finland

01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.550
that their ancestors knew
was what was most important.

01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:59.360
So one fall afternoon, in 2012,
I walked into Karvakko's Market

01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.820
in Tapiola, Michigan with the
rather unusual task of picking

01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:05.930
up deer tongues that had been
promised to my husband for use

01:39:05.930 --> 01:39:09.460
in a pate he planned to make
in a Finnish cooking workshop.

01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:12.130
So I married a man who's not
Finnish at all, but he has come

01:39:12.130 --> 01:39:13.610
to be a wonderful Finnish cook.

01:39:13.610 --> 01:39:16.410
So if you ever need one, and
you're in Hancock, give me a call.

01:39:16.410 --> 01:39:19.580
A man maybe about 15 years
older than I entered,

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:21.360
and began a conversation
with the store proprietor,

01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.660
who appeared to be in his 60s.

01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:24.720
And they spoke completely
in Finnish.

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:27.560 position:56%
So I grabbed a few other items and
waited for their conversation to end

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.860
so I could ask for
these deer tongues.

01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:31.760
And periodically, the men would
cast mischievous glances my way,

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:35.040
and I could tell that they really
enjoyed their talking in front

01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:38.130
of an unfamiliar woman in what they
assumed to be a secret language.

01:39:38.130 --> 01:39:40.250
Their conversation was
mundane, and not offensive,

01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:42.780
and so I let them have their
fun until another glance

01:39:42.780 --> 01:39:48.550
with a big grin came my way, and
I decided to call their game.

01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:49.850
[Foreign language].

01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:51.150
So, we speak Finnish here, then?

01:39:51.150 --> 01:39:53.700
Their smiles erupted into laughter,
and they switched into English.

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:55.830
I admitted that my grandfather
was from just up the road,

01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:57.670
and they promptly gave
me hugs and handshakes,

01:39:57.670 --> 01:39:59.600
and shared memories
of Frannie Virtanen.

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:02.060
Finnish lives in pockets.

01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:04.580 position:56%
Often at about 10 a.m. on
weekdays, you can find a small group

01:40:04.580 --> 01:40:06.990
of elders speaking together
in Finnish over coffee

01:40:06.990 --> 01:40:08.840
at a local bakery in Houghton.

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:11.520
You can find Finnish hymns sung
at Laestadian religious services,

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.170
and at funerals for members
of the Ladies of Kaleva,

01:40:14.170 --> 01:40:16.170
which is a Finnish-American
fraternal order.

01:40:16.170 --> 01:40:18.280
It is used symbolically
on bumper stickers.

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:22.060 position:56%
It is a resource for those needing
particularly satisfying swear words,

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:23.360
and it is a greeting to use

01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.810
when native Finns visit the
Upper Peninsula a minute --

01:40:25.810 --> 01:40:27.740
upper Midwestern Finnish
communities.

01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.090
It comes out in local
Finnish-American festivals,

01:40:30.090 --> 01:40:34.590 position:56%
on Saturday night saunas, and in the
kitchen, baking [foreign language].

01:40:34.590 --> 01:40:36.370
Though researchers
have anticipated a day

01:40:36.370 --> 01:40:38.050
when Finnish will no
longer be spoken

01:40:38.050 --> 01:40:41.140
in the long-time Finnish stronghold
of the upper midwest, in ways great

01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:42.930
and small, it still persists.

01:40:42.930 --> 01:40:45.760
And it serves as a window to a
culture that persists as well.

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:47.560
That's all, folks.

01:40:47.560 --> 01:41:02.640
[ Applause ]

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:06.150
&gt;&gt; Well, in the interests
of time, we have two things

01:41:06.150 --> 01:41:08.290
that I thought we could go on with.

01:41:08.290 --> 01:41:10.310
Questions from the audience,

01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:14.780
and then the Embassy has
provided an amusing video

01:41:14.780 --> 01:41:16.080
about Finnish language.

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:21.240
So I thought if people
still have time --

01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:24.140
I don't know how long the
Embassy video is, but --

01:41:24.140 --> 01:41:25.440
&gt;&gt; It's just about one minute.

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:26.740
&gt;&gt; Couple of minutes?

01:41:26.740 --> 01:41:32.380
Okay. Should we do that now,
to kind of freshen our minds?

01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:34.180
&gt;&gt; Oh, boy.

01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:39.970
[ Music ]

01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:41.860
&gt;&gt; Okay. [Foreign language].

01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:52.510
&gt;&gt; I don't know how to
say this all at once.

01:41:52.510 --> 01:42:22.850
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

01:42:22.850 --> 01:42:24.740
&gt;&gt; That was good, right?

01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:26.070
&gt;&gt; What is this?

01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:29.320
&gt;&gt; I have no idea.

01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:30.620
None.

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:34.600
&gt;&gt; I think it's some
kind of helicopter.

01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:39.260
&gt;&gt; A gift card for a
hot-air balloon flight?

01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:40.560
&gt;&gt; Oh.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:41.860
&gt;&gt; Huh.

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:44.710
&gt;&gt; How do you fit that
on a business card?

01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:46.670
&gt;&gt; I thought, like,
his resume is long.

01:42:46.670 --> 01:42:50.070
&gt;&gt; That's the hardest word I'll
ever pronounce, but now I know

01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:52.610
where to -- how to buy my
hot-air balloon gift card,

01:42:52.610 --> 01:42:54.060
next time I go back to Finland.

01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:57.040
&gt;&gt; But it's -- in Finnish,
it's one word.

01:42:57.040 --> 01:42:58.980
&gt;&gt; Oh, my God.

01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:06.930
&gt;&gt; Time is kind of running out,
so we'll just take questions

01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:09.580
from the audience, and then we'll
ask questions from each other,

01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:11.490
if we still have a few minutes.

01:43:11.490 --> 01:43:12.790
Okay?

01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:15.280
&gt;&gt; One of the tags here was the
future of the Finnish language,

01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:16.980
and I think I heard
two mixed messages.

01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:19.400 position:56%
You said, well, if there's a border,

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:22.430
the language is a little
more firmed up,

01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:26.720
and a little more held
together, too.

01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:31.660
And you said not so many people
are really learning it anymore.

01:43:31.660 --> 01:43:33.690
I think you said that.

01:43:33.690 --> 01:43:36.160
It's kind of reaching back
into their family history,

01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:41.100
but less of a -- not as many people
learn Finnish to learn Finnish.

01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:44.560
And most of those students will
-- so that's in the U.S. context.

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.860
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Mm-hmm.

01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:48.440
&gt;&gt; But in Finland, is the
Finnish language holding strong?

01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:51.180
Are there lots of books
published, and newspapers published

01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:55.210
to reinforce its continued
existence,

01:43:55.210 --> 01:43:57.330
or do you think it's in danger?

01:43:57.330 --> 01:43:58.630
&gt;&gt; Did everybody hear the question?

01:43:58.630 --> 01:43:59.930
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

01:43:59.930 --> 01:44:01.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:04.460
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Well,

01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:05.760
I would say that Finnish is not
an endangered language at all.

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:07.060
I mean, it's -- you don't --

01:44:07.060 --> 01:44:08.360

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:09.660
No.

01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:10.960
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: As -- the
real barometer of it is if you go

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:12.260
to someone's home, and if they're
speaking it to their children,

01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:13.710
then it's doing really well.

01:44:13.710 --> 01:44:16.500
And, you know, the minute
that stops happening,

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:18.500
then -- then there's a change.

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:21.970
One thing that people have
talked about is, in Finland,

01:44:21.970 --> 01:44:25.860
there's so much at higher levels --
so, for example, in universities,

01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:29.440
there are a lot of programs now
that are taught only in English.

01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:32.230
And there is a little bit of
concern in Finland about sort

01:44:32.230 --> 01:44:35.750
of higher-level research
not being conducted as much

01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:38.320
in Finnish anymore, but being
conducted in English simply

01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:41.780 position:56%
because the audience -- if you write
a paper, you write a dissertation

01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:44.890
in Finnish, you -- think about
writing a dissertation in Finnish.

01:44:44.890 --> 01:44:46.270
Okay, number one, just
think about who --

01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:49.060
who's the audience for a
dissertation in the first place?

01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:50.360
Is pretty small.

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:51.900
And then you think a
dissertation in Finnish,

01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:54.780
which is a potential population
of five and a half million,

01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:57.090
but that's not your
dissertation audience, right?

01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:58.490
It's very small.

01:44:58.490 --> 01:45:00.640
So a lot of people now, the kind

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:02.190
of upper research will
be done in English.

01:45:02.190 --> 01:45:07.900
So there's a little bit of sort
of maybe loss of English in --

01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:11.820
Finnish in certain higher-level
domains like that, but not at all,

01:45:11.820 --> 01:45:15.510
for example, in government,
or not at all in, you know --

01:45:15.510 --> 01:45:17.860
in education at other levels.

01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:20.220
So I would say really
there isn't -- you know.

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:25.350
I mean, the influx of English
into Finnish is not the worry,

01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:28.140
because those words are
adapted, as you saw.

01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:29.440
They don't say just shave.

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:30.740
They say [foreign language].

01:45:30.740 --> 01:45:32.040
It becomes a Finnish word.

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:33.360
And then, in 100 years,
no one will ever know

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:34.790
that that was an English word.

01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:36.390
&gt;&gt; Hillary Virtanen:
And could actually --

01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:37.690
could I just make one
comment really quick

01:45:37.690 --> 01:45:40.650
about the way it's living
in the upper midwest?

01:45:40.650 --> 01:45:42.630
There's a lot of really
small words that live on,

01:45:42.630 --> 01:45:44.610
and a lot of people do
things like nicknaming.

01:45:44.610 --> 01:45:46.130
You know, if you don't
have a Finnish name,

01:45:46.130 --> 01:45:47.430
you get a Finnish nickname.

01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:48.730
I have a cousin named Matt.

01:45:48.730 --> 01:45:50.030
His name's Mahtie [phonetic].

01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:51.330
You know, I'm Helavie [phonetic].

01:45:51.330 --> 01:45:52.680
And then there's words like --

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.620
for instance, my kids didn't
know what the English word

01:45:54.620 --> 01:45:56.640
for bellybutton was until
they went to school.

01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:58.170
We also say [foreign
language] at home.

01:45:58.170 --> 01:46:00.120
And so, you know, they went
to school, and they're --

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.680
came home, and they're like,
"Mom, what's a bellybutton?

01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:02.980
Like, what is that?"

01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:07.660
And -- and so, there's a lot of
these words that continue to exist,

01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:09.090
and, you know, sauna
words and stuff like that.

01:46:09.090 --> 01:46:10.480
Like, those won't die.

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:12.690
So even though we aren't
speaking Finnish every day,

01:46:12.690 --> 01:46:14.600
and even though the kids
aren't learning it at home,

01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.900
which is the key thing
-- at least --

01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:17.530
a lot of the kids aren't
homing -- learning it at home,

01:46:17.530 --> 01:46:22.400
there's these words that continue
to live, very bafflingly, you know.

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:25.940
&gt;&gt; Ma'am, as followup to what you
just said, does it seem, though,

01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:29.380
that in almost every language
in the world, or every country,

01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:31.200
when you're getting to
the very higher levels,

01:46:31.200 --> 01:46:32.720
you're going to do
papers in English?

01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.020
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Right.

01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:36.070
&gt;&gt; But the two nuclear scientists
in Helsinki are still going

01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:37.820 position:56%
to be speaking Finnish to each other

01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:40.160
when they're discussing
their research.

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:43.350
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Presumably,
although I have run across Finns

01:46:43.350 --> 01:46:46.400
who sometimes find it difficult
to talk about their own research

01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:49.910
in Finnish, because all of the work
that they've done, all the writing

01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:51.950
that they've done, all
the reading they've done,

01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:53.940
and all the international
collaboration they've done is

01:46:53.940 --> 01:46:55.240
in English.

01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:57.340
So they just sometimes
lack the terms.

01:46:57.340 --> 01:46:58.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:46:58.640 --> 01:46:59.940
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Because
they're not familiar with the terms

01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.240
in Finnish, or maybe the
terms in Finnish don't exist.

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:04.360
Because it's so -- if it's
incredibly specific, you know,

01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:05.880
I've -- I run into
that in linguistics,

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.790
where certain people will be -- in
a particular theoretical framework,

01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:10.380
they don't know the
exact technical terms.

01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.680
&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.980
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: And so
people are always trying to come

01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:14.490
up with them, and make those
words so that people can.

01:47:14.490 --> 01:47:16.770
But yeah, I mean, if they're
talking about something that isn't

01:47:16.770 --> 01:47:18.830
so technical, of course,
it'll be in Finnish.

01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:20.130
Of course.

01:47:20.130 --> 01:47:22.590
I mean, two Finnish people with
-- why would they speak English?

01:47:22.590 --> 01:47:27.650
It would be exhaust -- it would
be -- you know, it's way harder.

01:47:27.650 --> 01:47:29.690
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Okay, one
-- I have two questions.

01:47:29.690 --> 01:47:31.970
One is totally politically
incorrect, okay,

01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:34.290
and the other one is for you, Dan.

01:47:34.290 --> 01:47:36.930
Okay, you -- I appreciate it,

01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:40.680
and I think you highlighted
very much what is difficult

01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:43.000
or considered difficult.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:46.400
But there is one thing that
you completely omitted,

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:48.490
which is the significance
of [foreign language],

01:47:48.490 --> 01:47:51.270
which is a spoken language.

01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:54.550
We have a situation in
Finnish, the same as in Arabic.

01:47:54.550 --> 01:47:56.670
There's language -- say,
modern, standard Arabic.

01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:58.300
Nobody speaks that.

01:47:58.300 --> 01:47:59.600
The same is true in Finland.

01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:00.900
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Absolutely.

01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:04.090
&gt;&gt; If you offer a scripted
speech, including the President --

01:48:04.090 --> 01:48:07.490
he's a little pompous
ass, so he can make --

01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:09.350
written language, but most

01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:11.760
of the Ministers will
switch to spoken language.

01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:13.060
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Right.

01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:14.360
Of course.

01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:15.660
&gt;&gt; The form is very different.

01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:16.960
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Of course.

01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:18.260
&gt;&gt; How do you deal with that
in -- with your students?

01:48:18.260 --> 01:48:20.000
That difficult.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.300
Let me --

01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:22.600
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Totally agree.

01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:23.900
I totally agree.

01:48:23.900 --> 01:48:27.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But today, the Department
of Education has issued materials,

01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:30.500 position:56%
because there is an immigration, and
refugee problems, and all of that.

01:48:30.500 --> 01:48:35.270
Now, the materials that are issued
by the Department of Education,

01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:38.730
they published them
in spoken language.

01:48:38.730 --> 01:48:40.570
The videos are in spoken language.

01:48:40.570 --> 01:48:44.500
The transcripts of the videos are
now written in spoken language.

01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:47.520
How do you deal with that in here?

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:48.820
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Yeah.

01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:50.340
Here, you mean in my teaching?

01:48:50.340 --> 01:48:53.300
&gt;&gt; In -- well, in America,
because that adds a dimension.

01:48:53.300 --> 01:48:54.600
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Yeah.

01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:55.900
Oh, yeah. I always
say to the students,

01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:57.380
"You're getting two
for the price of one."

01:48:57.380 --> 01:48:59.490
Because they're learning the spoken
language and the written language.

01:48:59.490 --> 01:49:00.790
Because you're absolutely right.

01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:04.140
That -- for people that don't know,
I mean, English spoken language

01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:06.130
and English written language
are not that different.

01:49:06.130 --> 01:49:07.430
&gt;&gt; No, they aren't.

01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:08.730
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: And
Finnish written language

01:49:08.730 --> 01:49:10.030
and spoken language
are very different.

01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:11.330
&gt;&gt; Very different.

01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:13.580
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: I mean, it's
just mind-boggling sometimes,

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.710
when -- you know, and in the
old days, the traditional way

01:49:15.710 --> 01:49:17.860
of teaching Finnish was that you --

01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:20.520
all of the textbooks
taught only written language

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:21.820
and no spoken language.

01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:23.430
And my predecessor, for example,
at the University of Minnesota,

01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:25.570
she refused to teach
spoken language,

01:49:25.570 --> 01:49:27.720 position:56%
even though she spoke it, of course.

01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:29.020
But she refused to teach it.

01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:31.920 position:56%
So the students would go to Finland,
be perfectly well understood

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.290
by everybody, but then, when
the Finns spoke to them,

01:49:34.290 --> 01:49:35.870
they couldn't understand anything.

01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:39.150
So it was a one-way sort of
intelligibility that was going on.

01:49:39.150 --> 01:49:42.500
Nowadays, the teaching materials
are much better, and they have --

01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:45.420
the teaching materials that I use
incorporate spoken language along

01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:47.880
the way, although I
would say not enough.

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:52.550 position:56%
And, in fact, I -- you know, one of
my goals is to, you know, write a --

01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:55.550
my own textbook in
collaboration with a Finn.

01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:57.530
And one of the things that
I would like to do is start

01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:59.480
with the spoken language exactly.

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:02.000
Because that is the
way -- that is the --

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.530
that is every Finn's home
language, is spoken language.

01:50:05.530 --> 01:50:08.890
When a little kid says,
"Mom, let's go," or --

01:50:08.890 --> 01:50:10.730
no, let's say, "We are going where?

01:50:10.730 --> 01:50:12.030
Where are we going?

01:50:12.030 --> 01:50:13.330
We are going -- " They don't
say [foreign language].

01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:15.660
No three-year-old kid is going
to say [foreign language].

01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:17.370
They're going to say
[foreign language].

01:50:17.370 --> 01:50:19.410
And that's just the way it is.

01:50:19.410 --> 01:50:21.750
And that should be the first
form that the kid learns --

01:50:21.750 --> 01:50:23.310
I mean, the student learns, too.

01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:25.370
Because they are most
likely to encounter

01:50:25.370 --> 01:50:27.380
that in speaking with
a Finnish person.

01:50:27.380 --> 01:50:29.710
So I would like to kind of
throw that -- exactly what --

01:50:29.710 --> 01:50:31.010
they've been -- they're
doing this in Finland now.

01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:34.380
They're actually starting
with the spoken language.

01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:36.040
So I think it's -- I think
it's the right thing to do,

01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:37.740
and I'd like to start that.

01:50:37.740 --> 01:50:41.250
But you could also -- instead
of using the written language,

01:50:41.250 --> 01:50:44.720 position:56%
and then -- and then bringing in the
spoken language little by little,

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.230
start with the spoken language,

01:50:46.230 --> 01:50:47.920
and bring in the written
little by little.

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:51.050
And actually, make
it task-appropriate.

01:50:51.050 --> 01:50:55.020
So, for example, if you're --
if you're doing a Facebook post,

01:50:55.020 --> 01:50:57.890
then teach them how to write
that in spoken language.

01:50:57.890 --> 01:51:00.640
If they're writing a formal
business thing, teach them how

01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:02.380
to write it in written language.

01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:04.570
So make the -- and if
they're speaking a dialogue,

01:51:04.570 --> 01:51:05.960
have that be spoken language.

01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:08.390
If they're doing a
formal job interview,

01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:09.990
make the language more formal.

01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:13.750
Like, make the -- make the style
of the language fit the task,

01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:16.600
or fit the everyday sort of
context that they're using it --

01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:17.900
&gt;&gt; Now can I ask the
politically incorrect question?

01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:19.570
And it's mostly to you, Alli.

01:51:19.570 --> 01:51:20.870
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Yeah?

01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:25.900
&gt;&gt; Which is that I wonder if,
in America, American Finns,

01:51:25.900 --> 01:51:31.820
political correctness needs to
be fought in today's society.

01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:34.210
Right? We agree on that.

01:51:34.210 --> 01:51:36.810
There's too much political
correctness and emphasis on that.

01:51:36.810 --> 01:51:41.210
In Finland -- Finland is ranked
very, very high in freedom

01:51:41.210 --> 01:51:44.980
of speech, very high
internationally.

01:51:44.980 --> 01:51:47.270
It was number one for a long time.

01:51:47.270 --> 01:51:50.270
Now I think it's number two.

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:58.140
Kalevala was a politically
correct thing, published 1835.

01:51:58.140 --> 01:52:01.700
Sole purpose of it
was nation-building,

01:52:01.700 --> 01:52:06.620
to get us to be recognized
as an independent duchy

01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:09.110
of Russia, not part of Sweden.

01:52:09.110 --> 01:52:15.550
Okay? Now, Loennrot
collected poems, tons more.

01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:18.400
The selection that was chosen

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:22.550
for Kalevala was the
politically correct selection.

01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:27.280
Now they are in National Archives,
the ones that Loennrot collected,

01:52:27.280 --> 01:52:32.290
and there are attempts
to publish those now.

01:52:32.290 --> 01:52:36.170
For instance -- and
this is so that --

01:52:36.170 --> 01:52:40.540
how could we have babies
if we didn't deal with sex?

01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:45.320
Okay? There are tons and tons
of poems that explicit --

01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:48.830
because sex is not a
taboo in Finland, okay?

01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:50.680
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Anymore.

01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:53.950
Okay, 1800s, I tell you,
no, it would have been.

01:52:53.950 --> 01:52:55.250
[Laughter]

01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:57.150
&gt;&gt; So not in those poems,
and not in Kalevala poems,

01:52:57.150 --> 01:52:59.780
in the thousands of them.

01:52:59.780 --> 01:53:03.070
They are going to publish
them, sex in Kalevala.

01:53:03.070 --> 01:53:05.010
They're going to National Archives.

01:53:05.010 --> 01:53:10.990
How will the American community
stay in touch with the --

01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:17.120
how Finns now interpret their
sacred things, like Kalevala?

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:19.820
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: First
of all, I would take --

01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:27.540
I would possibly not agree with
you fully on that it was only

01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:33.270
for its role -- that it was
being published solely for --

01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:34.570
&gt;&gt; Nation-building.

01:53:34.570 --> 01:53:35.870
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: -- nation-building.

01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:38.940
Because, in a way, what
we -- we did have --

01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:41.790
there were folklorists
before Loennrot,

01:53:41.790 --> 01:53:43.930
Denandev [assumed spelling]
who also had been -- studied --

01:53:43.930 --> 01:53:46.340
was medical doctor, was
-- became a folklorist,

01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:48.150
became a lexicographer
the way Loennrot did.

01:53:48.150 --> 01:53:53.070
And so that there was the
-- and it was -- start --

01:53:53.070 --> 01:53:56.080
in a way, it was while Finland
was still part of Sweden.

01:53:56.080 --> 01:54:02.050
There was an interest in
the Swedish Court, in fact,

01:54:02.050 --> 01:54:06.120
for collecting the
grand -- the old --

01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:10.120
the value of old oral
tradition was being seen

01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:12.870
as a possibly important thing.

01:54:12.870 --> 01:54:17.380
It certainly was also central
European, German influence.

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:21.850
So that there was really --
it was not just one purpose.

01:54:21.850 --> 01:54:28.790
It was -- it was been -- in a
way, Kalevala became rather sort

01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:34.560
of politically used
to an extent for that.

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.640
But it was much more than that.

01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:37.970
It was, in a way, distilling --

01:54:37.970 --> 01:54:39.310
&gt;&gt; The collection, yes.

01:54:39.310 --> 01:54:41.080
The collection of poems was --

01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:42.380
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Right.

01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:44.560
But -- But also -- also,
that then -- this was --

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.100
we have to then look
at Loennrot's work.

01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:49.650
To my mind, we have to
look at -- he was --

01:54:49.650 --> 01:54:57.070 position:56%
he saw himself very much more as one
of the singers, and he was also part

01:54:57.070 --> 01:55:02.420
of [foreign language], who had
immersed himself so much in the --

01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:04.960
in the poetry that
he was collecting.

01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:07.940
And the songs, really -- they
were always songs, basically,

01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:13.340
except the -- some
-- some things were,

01:55:13.340 --> 01:55:15.120
quote unquote, prose without music.

01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:18.230
But most really had a --
had also a tune to them,

01:55:18.230 --> 01:55:21.580
so that there was the
artistic expression there.

01:55:21.580 --> 01:55:23.520
So I would say that the
-- that you could --

01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:27.580
you can look at Kalevala
from so many different --

01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:29.120
different points of view.

01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:32.950
Now, as far as -- as far as
what Americans would think

01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:37.040
about now something being
published that's very explicit,

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.360
about sex, I don't know.

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:40.660
I don't know.

01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:41.960
Who knows?

01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:45.090
Whether those Americans
would learn enough Finnish

01:55:45.090 --> 01:55:47.410
to really actually read that --

01:55:47.410 --> 01:55:49.870
whether there's anyone who
would want to publish --

01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:52.990
fund such research, I don't know.

01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:54.290
That's -- that's --

01:55:54.290 --> 01:55:55.590
&gt;&gt; We'll wait for the
[inaudible] that wants

01:55:55.590 --> 01:55:58.560
to be published in a year or two.

01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:02.790
&gt;&gt; Yes. To Daniel, your
interesting presentation

01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:04.520
about layers, oh, there is --

01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:05.820
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Right.

01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:07.600
&gt;&gt; Language [inaudible], anyways.

01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:13.450
The last one was the English,

01:56:13.450 --> 01:56:18.680
and you presented a
whole number of others.

01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:26.310
Finland has a Language Council,
of course, and I wonder how many

01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:30.320
of words really have been
approved for [laughter].

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:33.860
And I would say that --

01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:35.160
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen:
That's a good joke.

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:39.420
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] take off that
are perfectly Finnish words,

01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.810
which are now being used

01:56:40.810 --> 01:56:48.150
as an English version [inaudible]
translated into Finnish.

01:56:48.150 --> 01:56:53.670
[Inaudible] I think there is
responsibility for linguists

01:56:53.670 --> 01:57:00.150
and others also to try to use
the Finnish, if there exists one.

01:57:00.150 --> 01:57:04.210
There's many perfectly correct
words, which are even shorter --

01:57:04.210 --> 01:57:05.510
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Sure.

01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:06.810
Right.

01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:08.110
&gt;&gt; -- than the English word.

01:57:08.110 --> 01:57:11.930
So I wonder whether the role
of the linguists should be

01:57:11.930 --> 01:57:15.370
to maintain the language and
not accept some [inaudible]

01:57:15.370 --> 01:57:17.240
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: What?

01:57:17.240 --> 01:57:18.540
[Laughter] I know.

01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:20.380
Alli and I are like --

01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:21.680
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Yeah.

01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:22.980
&gt;&gt; Hillary Virtanen: Yeah.

01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:24.280
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Well, okay,
I would say as a linguist,

01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:28.070
as a trained linguist, I -- I'm a
-- I'm not a prescriptive linguist.

01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:29.370
I'm a descriptive linguist.

01:57:29.370 --> 01:57:32.830
So basically, we just -- we just
look at language as a phenomenon,

01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:35.020
and study it, and we
don't prescribe.

01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:37.690
Right? So the -- you know,
the board that decides

01:57:37.690 --> 01:57:39.920
on what is a Finnish word and
what isn't a Finnish word,

01:57:39.920 --> 01:57:42.390
what should be -- that's
a totally different thing.

01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:45.350
And those kinds of boards -- like,
in France, too, the same thing.

01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:46.990
We don't have one for
English, for example,

01:57:46.990 --> 01:57:48.470
but in France, they have one.

01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:51.700
They can -- they can
prescribe all day long,

01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:54.500
but they cannot control what
people say on the street.

01:57:54.500 --> 01:57:58.800
And the mystery -- and the
mystery of why one word --

01:57:58.800 --> 01:58:02.140
like, a native word versus a
word -- a loan word sticks,

01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:03.640
nobody really understands.

01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:05.510
Sometimes it is length,
but there's --

01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:06.810
sometimes, there's
something about --

01:58:06.810 --> 01:58:09.720
people have extremely
strong feelings,

01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:11.600
emotional feelings about words.

01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:14.960 position:56%
Oh, I wouldn't use that word because
it just sounds a little something,

01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:16.670
or that just sounds better.

01:58:16.670 --> 01:58:19.280 position:56%
And so, you know, you think about,
like, [foreign language], there's --

01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:23.100
there's -- that's just a
normal thing to say now.

01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:24.720
&gt;&gt; You heard about [inaudible]

01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:26.780
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Yes,
[foreign language], all the time.

01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:28.080
All the time.

01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:29.890
You ask any 20-year-old, that's
what they say, [foreign language].

01:58:29.890 --> 01:58:31.570
Right? Yeah, I know.

01:58:31.570 --> 01:58:33.470
I know, and there's a perfectly
good -- [foreign language],

01:58:33.470 --> 01:58:35.580
but that's just, like,
a -- a -- this is --

01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:37.390
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Old
folks do that, right?

01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:38.690
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Yes.

01:58:38.690 --> 01:58:39.990
And so, this is one of those things

01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:41.290
that there's a perfectly
good Finnish way,

01:58:41.290 --> 01:58:42.590
but you can't control what
people are going to say.

01:58:42.590 --> 01:58:45.450
And then, when you get this younger
people growing up, they don't --

01:58:45.450 --> 01:58:47.620
they don't even think of it as
something necessarily from English.

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:48.920
It's just what they say.

01:58:48.920 --> 01:58:51.810
And again, you know,
Finnish is not going to be --

01:58:51.810 --> 01:58:54.050
is not the same it was
100 years ago, will not --

01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:57.310
even 50, won't be 50 years
in the future, 100 years.

01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:59.570
We have no idea what
direction it'll go.

01:58:59.570 --> 01:59:00.870
But --

01:59:00.870 --> 01:59:05.880
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] factory, there are
large differences between coming

01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:08.770
from [inaudible], and those who are
-- who are Germanic [inaudible].

01:59:08.770 --> 01:59:12.700
So in other parts of Finland,
the words may be different.

01:59:12.700 --> 01:59:14.000
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Yes.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.300
Abso --

01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:16.600
&gt;&gt; Huge place.

01:59:16.600 --> 01:59:17.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Very, very true.

01:59:17.900 --> 01:59:19.200
Regional variation is huge, too.

01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:20.500
I mean, it is in the United
States, but it is in Finland.

01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:21.800
It's very -- it's very big.

01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:23.100
But there is -- there is a
certain level of commonality,

01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:25.290
where certain words that
all Finns will recognize

01:59:25.290 --> 01:59:26.590
and feel comfortable with.

01:59:26.590 --> 01:59:28.280
And then, you know, there
definitely is, you know --

01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:30.900
in Helsinki, for example, there's
maybe a little bit more influence

01:59:30.900 --> 01:59:34.630
than other -- I know the TAs that I
work with, some of them are from --

01:59:34.630 --> 01:59:37.770
I get a full right language
teaching assistant every year.

01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:40.300
And I have lived in Helsinki
when I had been in Finland,

01:59:40.300 --> 01:59:41.730
so that's the kind of
Finnish that I speak,

01:59:41.730 --> 01:59:43.390
but the ones that don't live there,

01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:45.910
sometimes they don't use
the words that I say.

01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:48.470
Because they say, "Oh,
that's so Helsinki."

01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:49.770
Absolutely.

01:59:49.770 --> 01:59:51.070
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Yeah, yeah.

01:59:51.070 --> 01:59:52.370
And that's not necessarily
a plus for you.

01:59:52.370 --> 01:59:53.670
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: No.

01:59:53.670 --> 01:59:54.970
[Laughter] It's not a compliment.

01:59:54.970 --> 01:59:56.270
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: No, no, it's not.

01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:59.050
That is not a compliment to
you, by the people who say --

01:59:59.050 --> 02:00:04.520
for example, when students go to
Finland, and then I explain, yeah,

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:07.080
well, so-and-so is going to be in
Kuopio, or Yoandso [phonetic], oh,

02:00:07.080 --> 02:00:09.690
good, away from Helsinki.

02:00:09.690 --> 02:00:10.990
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Yeah.

02:00:10.990 --> 02:00:13.540
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: So we -- I mean,
Finland has its, you know,

02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:15.640
regional loyalties, for sure.

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:16.940
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Yeah.

02:00:16.940 --> 02:00:18.240
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: And
-- and then, also,

02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:19.540
the symbolism of what it means.

02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:20.840
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Right.

02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:22.140
&gt;&gt; Hillary Virtanen: Right?

02:00:22.140 --> 02:00:23.440
&gt;&gt; Okay, we're running out of time.

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:24.740
So maybe two more questions.

02:00:24.740 --> 02:00:26.040
Yeah?

02:00:26.040 --> 02:00:32.810
&gt;&gt; Okay, mine is actually another
question about what she say

02:00:32.810 --> 02:00:34.110
about the [foreign language].

02:00:34.110 --> 02:00:36.190 position:56%
The form I heard, [foreign language]
so he shaved off a little bit.

02:00:36.190 --> 02:00:38.780
So he [inaudible] they
use it there, too.

02:00:38.780 --> 02:00:40.080
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Mm-hmm.

02:00:40.080 --> 02:00:44.200
&gt;&gt; That if they gave me a little
less money, they shaved some, or --

02:00:44.200 --> 02:00:45.500
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Right.

02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:46.800
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Right.

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:48.100
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: You're right.

02:00:48.100 --> 02:00:49.400
So it's extension of the word.

02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:50.700
Yeah. Yeah, right.

02:00:50.700 --> 02:00:52.000
You know --

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:57.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So it sort of lives on, and takes
forms that are also used in English,

02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:59.080 position:56%
but then it changes slightly, and --

02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:00.380
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Right.

02:01:00.380 --> 02:01:02.880
And at a certain point, all
of us become a little unaware

02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:06.560
of how people 10 years
younger, 20 years younger,

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:09.850
30 years younger are
speaking, and we don't --

02:01:09.850 --> 02:01:11.180
aren't so in-tune with it.

02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:13.680
I mean, the best way -- when I
go to Finland, I like to, like,

02:01:13.680 --> 02:01:14.980
ride the bus and sit in the back.

02:01:14.980 --> 02:01:16.280
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Yeah.

02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:17.750
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: So then I can
hear what the teenagers are saying.

02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:19.830
Then I can get -- kind
of get in, you know,

02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:21.220
hear what people are saying.

02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:23.710
Otherwise, I don't
have contact with that.

02:01:23.710 --> 02:01:26.550
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Can I
do a very short test?

02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:31.440
I just read it very
recently, a woman saying,

02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:36.820
"I don't really want
-- [foreign language]."

02:01:38.020 --> 02:01:40.680
Do we have any sense of what
that might possibly mean?

02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:43.210
It took me a while --
moment there, looking at it.

02:01:43.210 --> 02:01:47.220
It was a person dealing
with -- her mother had died,

02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:49.850
and there was the home
with all the things

02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:52.240
that had been in mother's life.

02:01:52.240 --> 02:01:57.150
And then, she was saying,
"Oh, well, I mean,

02:01:57.150 --> 02:01:58.680
they say one should
[foreign language],

02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:03.560
but since it didn't happen,
we now have all of these."

02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:07.010
Okay, that should be a
slight semantic hint.

02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:08.310
[ Speaking in Foreign Language ]

02:02:08.310 --> 02:02:09.610
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: [Foreign language].

02:02:09.610 --> 02:02:11.380
I had -- I really looked
at it, and I said,

02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:12.680
okay, now, [foreign language].

02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:17.160
Are we doing moneymakers,
or what are we doing here?

02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:18.510
[Foreign language], the Japanese --

02:02:18.510 --> 02:02:19.810
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow.

02:02:19.810 --> 02:02:21.110
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Organizer.

02:02:21.110 --> 02:02:22.760
So this had become a Finnish word.

02:02:22.760 --> 02:02:24.060
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Wow.

02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:26.700
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: So -- not
that you start using it,

02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:28.970
because you maybe don't
[foreign language], but --

02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:30.270
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Wow.

02:02:30.270 --> 02:02:31.570
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: But
-- so I thought --

02:02:31.570 --> 02:02:32.870
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Sure.

02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:34.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: -- but it's -- you --

02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:35.470
the minute you think about it
a little bit, having done a lot

02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:38.340
of work in sort of lexicon,
particularly from the structure

02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:42.860
of meaning, I thought, okay, well,
now this has got to mean something.

02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:46.640
So, okay, the only thing I
could do was to figure out --

02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:48.080
&gt;&gt; One last question.

02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:50.510
&gt;&gt; I have a very, very
basic question.

02:02:50.510 --> 02:02:54.320
Since the Finns call their
country Suomi, where did --

02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:58.450
what's the derivation
of the word Finn?

02:02:58.450 --> 02:02:59.750
&gt;&gt; Hillary Virtanen: Take it away.

02:02:59.750 --> 02:03:01.050
[Foreign language]

02:03:01.050 --> 02:03:02.350
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Well, so,

02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:03.650
there's two answers
to that question.

02:03:03.650 --> 02:03:04.950
So --

02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:06.250
&gt;&gt; We have a linguist here.

02:03:06.250 --> 02:03:07.550
We can ask her.

02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:08.850
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Yeah, go ahead.

02:03:08.850 --> 02:03:11.020
&gt;&gt; Well, we have Suomi,
[foreign language].

02:03:11.020 --> 02:03:18.760
They are all related, are coming
from the [inaudible] language.

02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:20.060
[Foreign language] over there,

02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:24.450
on that northern [inaudible]
on the -- Asia.

02:03:24.450 --> 02:03:31.910
And you had a wonderful map
of the heavy concentration

02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:36.630
of the Uralic peoples, or Uralic
language speaker, or the haplo DNA.

02:03:36.630 --> 02:03:47.940
Not only language, but the
human DNA that is so [inaudible]

02:03:47.940 --> 02:03:53.010
&gt;&gt; Question was, what --

02:03:53.010 --> 02:03:54.310
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: No.

02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:55.730
No. No. It's older.

02:03:55.730 --> 02:03:57.080
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] that
this is the -- yeah.

02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:58.380
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen:
Yeah, it's [inaudible]

02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:00.910
&gt;&gt; I am part of the eastern Finns,

02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:06.040
and then the others
are from the west.

02:04:06.040 --> 02:04:11.650
And you will clearly see it
even in the body structure,

02:04:11.650 --> 02:04:17.830
in dental structure,
and almost in the DNA.

02:04:17.830 --> 02:04:20.210
So anyway, [foreign language]
is the Lapp language.

02:04:20.210 --> 02:04:25.040
That's also the same.

02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:26.340
[Foreign language],
Suomi, [foreign language],

02:04:26.340 --> 02:04:27.740
and there's some [inaudible]

02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:29.860
&gt;&gt; Finland in English --

02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:31.730
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: But let
me just say that the -- the --

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:35.580
so the actual -- so the ety --
so, okay, to answer your questions

02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:38.310
about Finns, so that's
Tacitus, so --

02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:42.600
wrote about people living in the
north a couple thousand years ago,

02:04:42.600 --> 02:04:45.330
about people living in the
north wearing furs for clothing,

02:04:45.330 --> 02:04:48.700
and referred to them as
the Fenni, F-E-N-N-I.

02:04:48.700 --> 02:04:51.210
And that is where the
word Finland came from.

02:04:51.210 --> 02:04:53.290
So that's a very old
word that came --

02:04:53.290 --> 02:04:56.710
and we don't know if he was
really writing about the Finns,

02:04:56.710 --> 02:04:59.690 position:56%
but it was people in the north that
that became associated with Finland.

02:04:59.690 --> 02:05:00.990
Pardon?

02:05:00.990 --> 02:05:02.290
&gt;&gt; Hillary Virtanen: Yeah,
associated with Finns or Sami.

02:05:02.290 --> 02:05:03.590
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Or
the Sami, or the Sami.

02:05:03.590 --> 02:05:04.890
Now, the derivation of --

02:05:04.890 --> 02:05:07.560
the etymology of the word Suomi
is really shrouded in mystery,

02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:09.500
and there are two --
couple hypotheses.

02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:12.800
One of them is that there's a
province in Finland called Hame,

02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:14.770
which some people have
said that Suomi

02:05:14.770 --> 02:05:17.930
and Hame are originally
from the same word.

02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:22.100
And so it's one region of Finland
that then -- the S had changed --

02:05:22.100 --> 02:05:24.360
the H changed to an
S, or whichever way,

02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:28.050
and then that became
generalized for the whole country.

02:05:28.050 --> 02:05:29.680
Another theory that's
been proposed --

02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:32.130
you know, etymology is conjecture.

02:05:32.130 --> 02:05:33.430
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Yeah.

02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:34.980
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: There
are no firm answers with --

02:05:34.980 --> 02:05:38.120
when it comes to etymology,
rarely do you have the final word,

02:05:38.120 --> 02:05:40.090
unless you have some kind of text.

02:05:40.090 --> 02:05:43.340
But with Finnish, we don't
have that depth of text, right?

02:05:43.340 --> 02:05:44.640
So it's a lot of conjecture,

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:46.850
and it's just someone has a
better guess than someone else.

02:05:46.850 --> 02:05:51.700
One of the other suggestions that's
been proposed is the old Latvian

02:05:51.700 --> 02:05:55.510
word [foreign language], which
means earth, and that Suomi

02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:56.830
and [foreign language] come --

02:05:56.830 --> 02:06:00.850
the word for Suomi actually
is a Baltic loan word.

02:06:02.570 --> 02:06:06.130
[Laughter] So, the -- what
the really interesting answer

02:06:06.130 --> 02:06:09.380
to that question is -- about
Suomi, we don't know for sure.

02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:13.810
But those are a couple hypotheses,
and for Finland, it's Fenni.

02:06:13.810 --> 02:06:15.870
And in -- the word Suomi is used --

02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:18.840
the Estonians and the
Latvians both use a variant

02:06:18.840 --> 02:06:20.410
of Suomi to call Finland.

02:06:20.410 --> 02:06:23.470
There aren't other -- many
other countries in the world --

02:06:23.470 --> 02:06:24.770
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Yeah, Suomi.

02:06:24.770 --> 02:06:26.070
Yeah.

02:06:26.070 --> 02:06:27.370
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen:
Yeah, [foreign language],

02:06:27.370 --> 02:06:28.670
and I think [foreign language], I
think is what they say in Latvian.

02:06:28.670 --> 02:06:29.970
&gt;&gt; Alli Flint: Yeah.

02:06:29.970 --> 02:06:31.270
&gt;&gt; Hillary Virtanen: Yeah.

02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:32.570
&gt;&gt; Daniel Karvonen: Yeah.

02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:33.870
So, yeah, great question.

02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:35.170
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you very much.

02:06:35.170 --> 02:06:36.470
