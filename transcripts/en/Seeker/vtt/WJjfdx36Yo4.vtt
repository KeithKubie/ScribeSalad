00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.060
Poe’s raven may have endlessly repeated
the word ‘nevermore’, but did that corvid

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.650
acutely understand the finality of of death
and the act of mourning?

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:15.370
Quoth the raven...maybe!

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.370
Hi everyone!

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.370
It’s Natalia for DNews!

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.560
Dealing with the loss of a loved one is no
doubt a painful time, but are humans the only

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.820
species that mourn their dead?

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.679
Recently a female snub-nosed monkey in a Chinese
Nature Reserve was observed to fall ill.

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.970
The dominant male in the group remained with
her as her symptoms appeared to grow worse.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.930
At one point the female monkey fell from the
tree and landed on the rocky ground.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.210
As she lay injured, the male was seen examining
her and began to groom her while others began

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.510
to do the same.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.110
She eventually died and the group moved on.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.790
Researchers buried the female a kilometer
away and the following day, the group of snub-nosed

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.850
monkeys returned.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.080
The male went to the spot when the female
had died only to discover she was not there.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.210
He waited two minutes until he solemnly moved
on with his troop.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.790
Was this monkey feeling grief?

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.570
Some scientists argue that assigning commonly
associated ‘human’ characteristics to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.250
animals , like love, grief, and empathy is
anthropomorphizing them, or attributing human

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.890
personalities to animals without sufficient
evidence.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.049
However, other scientists don’t see the
comparison of these behaviors far-fetched,

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.829
even finding it ‘species centric’ to assume
that these traits can only belong to humans.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.659
Just because a monkey can’t write a sonnet
about their loss, doesn’t necessarily mean

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.389
they aren’t capable of empathy!

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:29.549
Barbara J. King, a biological anthropologist
wrote a book specifically about the bereavement

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.479
of our animal brethren entitled “How Animals
Grieve.”

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.749
In King’s book she details multiple species
that mourn the loss of members of their group,

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.090
included a dolphin mother who lost her calf,
a group of elephants mourning their matriarch’s

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.479
death, and how a domestic cats wailed for
weeks after the death of her sister.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.021
Although these examples can be considered
anecdotal evidence, King has said that the

00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:53.979
database of stories from peer-reviewed sources
of various animal species exhibiting empathetic

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.170
behavior is growing which will no doubt aid
in the research and understanding of animal

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.920
emotion, including grief.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.369
Some of the best documented animals mourners
are our closest genetic relatives, chimpanzees.

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.360
At Cameroon’s Sanaga-Yong Chimpanzee Rescue
Center, a group of chimps were seen gathering

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.700
around an older female who had recently died.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.350
She had been a maternal figure to many of
the other chimps at the sanctuary and it appeared

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.410
that the group were paying their respects.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.030
Similarly, a deceased chimpanzee at a sanctuary
in Zambia was surrounded by a group of chimps

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.380
who gently touched, smelled, and lightly groomed
his body.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.550
Volunteers noted that the chimpanzees were
not only processing his death- they were mourning

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:31.670
their friend.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.500
Chimpanzees mothers who have lost infants
have also been documented on several occasions

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.530
carrying their dead offspring around for days-
sometimes weeks.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.700
These mothers appear to care for them and
even try to revive them.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.610
This is possible evidence of these animals
understanding or processing death.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.620
This behavior has also been documented in
gorillas, macaques, and baboons.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.040
Another group of animals that have often been
reported to mourn their dead are corvids.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.140
Corvids, or crows, ravens, magpies, rooks
and jays, and have been observed having makeshift

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.920
‘funerals’ for their deceased relatives.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.900
Some have witnessed ravens dropping twigs,
grass, and other ‘offerings’ on the dead.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.590
However, some skeptics assert that these ‘funerals’
may be less about mourning and more about

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.470
understanding what ‘felled’ their corvid
comrade.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.950
Was it muuuuurder?

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.100
Regardless of their intention, it is again
possible evidence of animals understanding

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.880
and reacting to death.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.540
There still is more research needed to truly
understand the emotional lives of animals,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.470
and there is a chance we may never really
know how deeply they feel…

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.260
Now that we know how some animals deal with
death, here’s a fascinating video about

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:37.900
how humans both preserve AND learn from deceased
animals while preparing them for museum collections.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:50.060
What do you think?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.800
Do animals mourn their dead?

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.710
Will your cat grieve over your imminent demise
or is Mr. Mittens just counting the days until

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:59.819
he can eat you?
