MICHAEL HARTNEY: Hi, everybody.

00:00:06.962 --> 00:00:07.090
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Hello.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.923
CAROLINE MARTIN: Hi.

00:00:07.923 --> 00:00:10.260
MICHAEL HARTNEY: How's it going?

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.540
We're going to do
some improv for you.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.590
All we need to get started is a
suggestion of anything at all.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.090
What?

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.072

MICHAEL HARTNEY: Google.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.450
Thank you.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.180
I heard Google.

Hey, guess what, guys.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.360
CAROLINE MARTIN: Oh?

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.318
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: I
got some Gmail invites.

00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:39.723

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:40.640
CAROLINE MARTIN: Yeah?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.260
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Yeah.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.210
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: You
guys want some Gmail invites?

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.080
CAROLINE MARTIN: Yeah,
I'll take a couple.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.163
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah,
it's pretty exclusive.

00:00:46.163 --> 00:00:48.628
You need to be invited.

00:00:48.628 --> 00:00:52.793
MICHAEL HARTNEY:
Uh, it's 2019, man.

00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:53.918
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: What?

00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:54.890
MICHAEL HARTNEY: I--

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.150
I've been on Google--

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.793
I've been on Gmail
for, like, 15 years.

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:01.210
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Well--
well, how come I have these--

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.560
how come I have these invites?

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.900
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Because
your-- you must be new.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.000
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Oh, OK.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.050
So how long have
you been on Gmail?

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.770
CAROLINE MARTIN: Like,
maybe five years?

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.130
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: What?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.340
MICHAEL HARTNEY: What?

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.673
CAROLINE MARTIN: I was a Yahoo--

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:17.600
I was Yahoo ride or die,
and then they said, no more.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.410
[LAUGHS] So I had to
upgrade a little bit.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.260
Guys, I would love
to sit down, but you

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.820
know that I'm not allowed.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.660
I'll see you later.

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:30.130
OK.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.107
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Why is
she not allowed to sit down?

00:01:33.107 --> 00:01:34.690
MICHAEL HARTNEY: I
think she mentioned

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.036
Yahoo a bunch in her interview.

00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:37.660
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Oh, right.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.745
MICHAEL HARTNEY:
They frown on that.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:41.620
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
Man, I need to catch up

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.570
if I'm-- if I--

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.653
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Yeah, how
are you allowed to sit?

00:01:44.653 --> 00:01:46.460
You just got Gmail?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.137
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: I--
I'm the kid of the owner.

Wait, you're Derek Google?

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.980

ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
Well, yeah.

00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:05.370
MICHAEL HARTNEY: So all of
this other email servers, that

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.040
was like childlike rebellion?

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.498
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
Yeah, I never

00:02:08.498 --> 00:02:14.042
used email or any sort of
electronic or digital thing.

00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:16.125
MICHAEL HARTNEY: This is
your first email address?

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:17.973
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah.

00:02:17.973 --> 00:02:18.890
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Yeah.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.818
How did you do anything at all?

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:25.110
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: I would
call people on the phone.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.040
I would visit them in person.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.120
I would write letters.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.620
I would stalk them.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.970
MICHAEL HARTNEY: This is the
longest conversation I've

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.085
had with a person in decades.

right, have a seat.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.700
Listen, you could walk
out of this interrogation

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.440
room a free man.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.005
All you got to do is let us
see your Google search history.

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:58.500
LOU GONZALEZ: Put
me away forever.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.312
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.487
Put me away forever, because
I'm not going to do it.

00:03:09.487 --> 00:03:11.820
KELSEY BAILEY: All you gotta
do is hand over your phone.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.900
We just got to look at your
last 72 hours of search history,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.652
maybe check out your
Google location.

00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:19.110
LOU GONZALEZ: It's
not really about

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.510
my own individual
privacy, it's just--

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.920
I don't want to be embarrassed--

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.823
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:23.823 --> 00:03:24.990
KELSEY BAILEY: I understand.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.580
LOU GONZALEZ: Because
I will be embarrassed.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.420
KELSEY BAILEY: I understand.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.045
LOU GONZALEZ: I don't
clean my history.

00:03:29.045 --> 00:03:29.560
I'm stupid.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.203
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:31.203 --> 00:03:33.120
KELSEY BAILEY: Well,
looks like you're looking

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.500
at life behind bars, then.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.292
LOU GONZALEZ: Cool.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.988
I'm fine with that, as long
as no one sees my history.

00:03:39.988 --> 00:03:41.280
KELSEY BAILEY: All right, fine.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.460
I'll make a deal with you.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.840
LOU GONZALEZ: Cool.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.430
KELSEY BAILEY: I won't look
at your Google search history,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.180
but I do need to look at your
drafts folder in your Gmail.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.980
LOU GONZALEZ: No.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.180
What?

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.900
There-- oh, man.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.602
I don't clear that at all.

00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:55.060
KELSEY BAILEY: No
one knows how to.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.566
We all forget that it exists.

00:03:56.566 --> 00:03:57.358
LOU GONZALEZ: Yeah.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.243
What if I show
you the last five?

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.660
KELSEY BAILEY:
Drafts or searches?

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.130
LOU GONZALEZ: The
drafts, because really, I

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.398
don't know what's there.

00:04:07.398 --> 00:04:09.190
And once I get a gauge
of what's happening,

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.398
I could then make a decision.

00:04:10.398 --> 00:04:11.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.470
KELSEY BAILEY: Cool.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.630
Pull up your phone.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.630
LOU GONZALEZ: All right.

00:04:17.304 --> 00:04:17.804
OK.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.120
All right, so this is a--

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.620
OK.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.170
Hey.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.670
Hi.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.630
What's up?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.730
What happened yesterday?

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.590
I miss you.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.680
OK, so far, so good.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.115
KELSEY BAILEY: Who were these
emails intended to go to?

00:04:36.115 --> 00:04:37.420
LOU GONZALEZ: Um--

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.503
KELSEY BAILEY: The victim?

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.260
Chastity Bono?

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:47.117
LOU GONZALEZ: No, a lot of
these are different people.

00:04:47.117 --> 00:04:48.700
I don't know, like
you could literally

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.320
look at the people who--

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.910
so this is-- this is for my mom.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.440
That's I miss you.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.230
I don't contact her much,
so I feel guilty about it.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.760
And so I always start a draft,
and I'm like, you know what?

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760
She's going to judge me.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.710
I'm not going to
send this email.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.480
So I choose not
to send the email.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.830
I have a lot of that.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.090
A lot of, like, I miss you.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.088
Let's catch up.

00:05:13.088 --> 00:05:14.630
Because she'll read
an email, but she

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.860
doesn't respond
to text messages--

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.080
that doesn't make sense.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.860
It's wild.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.610
KELSEY BAILEY: OK.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.750
I'm going to close that.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.290
LOU GONZALEZ: OK.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.150
So I'm good to go?

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.800
This was fine.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.880
KELSEY BAILEY: No, sit down.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.830
You're still being
charged for murder.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:28.794
LOU GONZALEZ: What?

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:29.294
Still?

00:05:29.294 --> 00:05:32.222
KELSEY BAILEY: Those drafts!

00:05:32.222 --> 00:05:34.174
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.620
CAROLINE MARTIN: Everybody--
everybody, I want everyone

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.550
to feel empowered to
pitch ideas for how

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:47.020
animate the little
Google guy every day.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.260
Now I'm going to start, because
y'all never take my ideas,

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.060
but I want to turn it around.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.530
I think there should be a little
cat with a little horn that's

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.630
just like boop, boop, boop.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.130
And he has nothing
to do with what's

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.782
happening in the calendar, but
just a little boop, boop, boop,

00:06:03.782 --> 00:06:04.282
boop.

00:06:04.282 --> 00:06:05.800
Wouldn't that be fun?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.154
Google-- boop, boop, boop.

00:06:08.154 --> 00:06:10.301
Right, guys?

00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:12.160
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
I-- you know,

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.530
I think one reason we
don't take your ideas

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.010
is we don't quite understand
what you're talking about.

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.350
CAROLINE MARTIN: OK,
so, like, so, OK.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:21.522
So there are cats.

00:06:21.522 --> 00:06:22.105
Those are big.

00:06:22.105 --> 00:06:23.500
A kitten's smaller.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.930
A horn-- they're smaller.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.640
And then a little horn--

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.940
it's a brass instrument,
but it's going to be small.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.482
LOU GONZALEZ: We
understand the words

00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:33.180
in the sentences you said.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.750
We understood that.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.862
We just didn't
understand how it applied

00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:37.945
to the animations of the--

00:06:37.945 --> 00:06:38.260
CAROLINE MARTIN: Got it.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.535
I'll bring it home.

00:06:39.535 --> 00:06:40.450
OK, so--

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.450
LOU GONZALEZ: Please do.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:45.700
CAROLINE MARTIN: When you think
about joy and opportunity,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.820
don't you think of a kitten
who's empowered itself

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.500
to learn a musical instrument?

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.050
MICHAEL HARTNEY: No one's
ever thought that once.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:55.690
CAROLINE MARTIN: OK, but
I think that's the truth

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.530
of the situation.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:57.370
But you know what?

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.460
Let's just put that--

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.960
let's just--

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.710
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
Let's table it.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.710
CAROLINE MARTIN: OK, OK.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:01.550
Put it on the table.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.800
KELSEY BAILEY: I have an idea.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.900
CAROLINE MARTIN: OK.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.400
Let's do it.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.987
KELSEY BAILEY: OK,
so close your eyes.

00:07:05.987 --> 00:07:06.820
CAROLINE MARTIN: OK.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.840
KELSEY BAILEY: We'll think
about joy one more time.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.673
MICHAEL HARTNEY: OK.

00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:11.308
KELSEY BAILEY: All
right, here we go.

00:07:11.308 --> 00:07:12.850
I've made a little
illustration we'll

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.590
put up on the SMART Board.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:15.180
Right there.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.300
LOU GONZALEZ: Right.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.100
Do I open--

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.830
KELSEY BAILEY: Open your eyes.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.032
It's a futon eating nachos.

00:07:20.032 --> 00:07:20.740
LOU GONZALEZ: Oh.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.823
KELSEY BAILEY: That's fun.

00:07:24.303 --> 00:07:25.220
MICHAEL HARTNEY: What?

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.090
CAROLINE MARTIN: I don't get it.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.632
KELSEY BAILEY: OK,
well think about--

00:07:27.632 --> 00:07:30.105
OK, a futon is somewhere
that you go to relax.

00:07:30.105 --> 00:07:30.980
CAROLINE MARTIN: Yes.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.200
KELSEY BAILEY: But what
does a futon do to relax?

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.985
It eats nachos.

00:07:35.985 --> 00:07:38.152
Nachos are a traditionally
Mexican dish that--

00:07:38.152 --> 00:07:39.610
CAROLINE MARTIN:
No, we get nachos.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:40.420
We get the nachos.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:40.820
KELSEY BAILEY: Corn chips--

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:41.760
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
We know what it is.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.060
Again, we know all the words
that were in the sentence

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.360
that you just said, but it feels
like a lot of the suggestions

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.440
that are coming up are very
specific to the individual that

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.527
is suggesting them.

00:07:52.527 --> 00:07:53.360
CAROLINE MARTIN: OK.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:53.950
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Right?

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:54.270
CAROLINE MARTIN: All right.

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:55.190
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
Like you love kittens.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.020
You love nachos.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.420
KELSEY BAILEY: Futons.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:56.855
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Oh, OK.

00:07:56.855 --> 00:07:57.590
Futons.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.727
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:58.727 --> 00:08:01.688
Maybe we can try to think
a little bit more broadly.

00:08:01.688 --> 00:08:03.230
MICHAEL HARTNEY:
I've gotten an idea.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.880
I've got an idea.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:04.820
LOU GONZALEZ: All
right, bring it, Barry.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:06.153
CAROLINE MARTIN: Come on, Barry.

00:08:06.153 --> 00:08:09.190
MICHAEL HARTNEY: So
instead of Google, it'll

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.990
say, yeah, great job
this quarter, Barry.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.490
And--

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:15.334
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.480
There will be a ram,
because I'm an Aries.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.480
So then the ram will come
in, and it'll be like,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.570
Barry is handsome.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.500
CAROLINE MARTIN: OK.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.040
OK, well--

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.780
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
OK, again--

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.170
CAROLINE MARTIN:
Very specific to you.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.040
KELSEY BAILEY: Specific, yeah.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.832
CAROLINE MARTIN: How
did you get that idea?

00:08:30.832 --> 00:08:32.880
Could you just
take us through it?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.520
MICHAEL HARTNEY: So
the signs of the zodiac

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.080
are an astrological--

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.830
CAROLINE MARTIN: No,
we know what that is.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.120
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:08:42.735 --> 00:08:46.390
MICHAEL HARTNEY: I just
want to be celebrated more.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.280
CAROLINE MARTIN: OK.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.155
MICHAEL HARTNEY: So--

00:08:49.937 --> 00:08:51.020
CAROLINE MARTIN: Well, OK.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.940
I'll apologize for that.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:55.587
I can-- I will write that down.

00:08:55.587 --> 00:08:57.170
LOU GONZALEZ: Barry,
I appreciate you,

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.700
and I apologize I
haven't celebrated you.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.290
MICHAEL HARTNEY:
Are we tabling mine?

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:04.390
KELSEY BAILEY: I
think we should.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:04.883
CAROLINE MARTIN:
We should table it.

00:09:04.883 --> 00:09:06.716
KELSEY BAILEY: I
definitely think we should.

OK.

ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah,
when I say stop, we can stop.

So just let me know--

going to fucking crush this.

Yeah, let's do it again.

didn't crush that?

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:40.900
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: No.

OK, let's pause.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.965
Yeah, there are no shapes
or dots on the sheet.

00:09:55.965 --> 00:09:57.340
Yeah, I think
we're going to need

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.660
to upgrade your prescription.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.260
I know you were
feeling a little bit--

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.968
LOU GONZALEZ: I studied
so hard for this.

00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:05.385
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: I know
you were feeling a little bit

00:10:05.385 --> 00:10:06.520
self-conscious about that.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:07.437
LOU GONZALEZ: I just--

00:10:07.437 --> 00:10:10.300
I just don't want to have
the level of prescription

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.580
where it makes my eyes smaller.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.870
I don't want that.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.640
I'm never going to get that.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.300
I'd rather be blind.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:19.390
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: No,
it's not a big deal, OK?

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.280
It's just a little bit
thicker of glasses.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.280
LOU GONZALEZ: I just don't
want to hear anything

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.848

LOU GONZALEZ: All right?

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.380
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Do
they-- do your employees

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:29.980
always fun of you?

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.260
LOU GONZALEZ: No, it's
a fear that I have.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.635
I'm pretty-- as a boss, it's--

No!

MICHAEL HARTNEY:
New prescription?

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:43.615
You got a tiny,
little eyes, baby!

Hey, girlfriend.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.900
I feel like we're bonding.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.108
So I'm going to be real real.

00:11:08.108 --> 00:11:09.180
I don't work here.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.900
I know, right?

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.440
I just got in.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.030
Yeah.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.540
It's funny.

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.110
If you just take any ID and you
swipe it confidently, and then

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.300
look back and go,
they'll open the gate.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.925
KELSEY BAILEY: You fired
four people this morning.

00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:27.040
CAROLINE MARTIN: Yeah, I did.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:27.470
Yeah.

Yeah.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:29.030
I'm empowering myself.

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.350

during the day-- who are we?

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.422
KELSEY BAILEY: I'm sorry.

00:11:37.422 --> 00:11:37.970
I-- this is--

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.012
I'm a little taken aback.

00:11:39.012 --> 00:11:41.360
I feel like I should tell
security that you're here.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.860

No, no, no, no, no.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.070

if someone was wandering

the building and they did
not have the right to be here

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.568
and they also fired
four people from a team?

00:11:54.568 --> 00:11:55.610
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: OK.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.000
I'm actually not sure,
because I don't work here.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.430
Yeah, no, you just
called me Gary.

good, how are you?

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.875
KELSEY BAILEY: Good.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:24.000
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Lunchtime!

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:24.800
KELSEY BAILEY: Yeah.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.200
Hey, Barry, what would happen
if someone snuck in here-- two

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.760
people snuck in
here-- one pretending

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:32.600
to be security for a large
company and another person

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.765
acting as a CEO firing people?

00:12:34.765 --> 00:12:36.140
MICHAEL HARTNEY:
Oh, well, let me

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.940
consult my employee handbook.

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.600
Psych!

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.177
I've never worked here!

00:12:40.177 --> 00:12:41.400
KELSEY BAILEY: Barry!

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.530
We made you a Google!

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.610
You were in a Google animation.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.610
MICHAEL HARTNEY: I know!

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.765
It was such a coup.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.230
KELSEY BAILEY: Am I
the only person who

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.585
actually works at Google here?

00:12:52.585 --> 00:12:54.460
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
Yeah, what you do here?

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:55.377
CAROLINE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:12:55.377 --> 00:12:56.030
What do you do?

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.730
KELSEY BAILEY: I put
on corporate events,

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.260
make sure that
there's team bond--

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:02.010
LOU GONZALEZ: Hey,
how's everything going?

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:02.800
Derek Google here.

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:03.633
CAROLINE MARTIN: Oh.

00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:05.470
The Derek-- Derek?

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.980
Wow, it's Derek Google.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.112
LOU GONZALEZ: I'm
taking all this food.

00:13:09.112 --> 00:13:11.570
MICHAEL HARTNEY: He starts from
the other side of the line.

00:13:14.242 --> 00:13:15.450
LOU GONZALEZ: How's it going?

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:15.840
KELSEY BAILEY: Good.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.007
CAROLINE MARTIN: Going good.

00:13:17.007 --> 00:13:20.270
KELSEY BAILEY: Mr. Google Jr.,
I have a question for you.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.480
Say a company of 458
people didn't actually

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.150
work in the building that they
were showing up to and rather

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.060
they were just sort of
breaking in and acting

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.020
as if they worked here.

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.450
What-- what would happen?

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:34.640
LOU GONZALEZ: Oh, fuck!

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.317
Do, do, do!

00:13:35.317 --> 00:13:36.400
CAROLINE MARTIN: [SCREAMS]

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.922
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Holy shit.

00:13:37.922 --> 00:13:47.127
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:47.960
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Oh.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.270
Let's get some chairs.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:49.920
KELSEY BAILEY: Oh, we're done.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.920
LOU GONZALEZ: All right.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.635
Team work.

00:13:51.635 --> 00:13:53.510
SPEAKER 2: Well, thank
you so much, everyone.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.658
So funny and great way to start.

00:13:57.658 --> 00:13:58.950
LOU GONZALEZ: Great suggestion.

00:13:58.950 --> 00:13:59.783
KELSEY BAILEY: Yeah.

00:13:59.783 --> 00:14:00.380
Thank you.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.270
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:01.820
LOU GONZALEZ:
Yeah, it's probably

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.760
one of the best suggestions
I've ever gotten.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.480
SPEAKER 2: Probably the
lowest hanging fruit.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.402
So just for people who have
never seen improv before,

00:14:12.402 --> 00:14:14.360
if you could just describe
a little bit of what

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:18.170
are the main guidelines
or like major points

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:19.830
of how to-- how does this work?

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:23.300
How do you sort of create
something in the moment?

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.770
Michael, do you want to start?

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.120
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Sure.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.950
Fun.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:34.340
So long form improv is
usually about taking

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.030
a single suggestion and doing
a longer form, like, you've

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.610
seen "Whose Line Is
It Anyway", where they

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.820
do short little improv games.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.440
But at UCB, we do longer scenes.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:52.010
And you use the
tentative "yes, and?"

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.690
We explore an unusual thing.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.720
We react to that unusual thing.

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.370
We build ideas together.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:02.960
And then we heighten and
explore, is what we call it.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.350
SPEAKER 2: So what does
that mean to, like, heighten

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:08.910
and explore, like
if you want to--

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:15.220
MICHAEL HARTNEY: So for
example, the lunch line scene,

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.800
that scene heightened by
the world kept expanding.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.890
We found out that
even Derek Google Jr.

00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.000
himself did not work
at Google, which

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.200
was a heightening from
Caroline not working at Google.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.250
We thought she was weird.

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:33.877
Turns out every-- turns
out she was weird.

00:15:33.877 --> 00:15:34.710
KELSEY BAILEY: Yeah.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.170
Yeah.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.820
SPEAKER 2: So Kelsey,
we mentioned this

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.180
is long form improvisation.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.430
And we know that there's
short form, which is probably

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.500
something people know
from college improv

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.280
groups and television.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.170
What are some other forms,
and what do they all

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:55.437
have in common as
one thing, as--

00:15:55.437 --> 00:15:56.270
KELSEY BAILEY: Sure.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.280
Other forms of improv
are just, yeah-- well,

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.920
I think for any type
of improv, whether it's

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.710
short form or long
form, just being

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.370
on board with whoever
you're on stage with is

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.870
the key to any type of
improv that you're doing.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.530
Whether it's a short
form game where you all

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.528
are playing crazy
characters, because you're

00:16:14.528 --> 00:16:17.070
supporting that person you're
going to be set up for success.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:21.500
It's the people who might
not be able to appreciate

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.750
an idea that's being pitched
to them by their teammate

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:26.960
or not listening, by
being in agreement,

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.470
being on each other's side,
and both working together

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.970
to be able to build something,
whether it's a scene, or just

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.010
a short improv game,
is probably the thing

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:38.610
that they all have in common
to be able to succeed.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:43.970
SPEAKER 2: So what
are some qualities

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.380
of teams and teammates that make
it work, that are important,

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.900
that you look for, or that
you try to bring to your team

00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.096
as you're performing?

00:16:53.096 --> 00:16:54.000
Caroline?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.930
CAROLINE MARTIN: Sure.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.600
I would say trust.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.193
I know that I can try
something out, give it a whirl,

00:17:00.193 --> 00:17:01.860
and that someone has
my back and they'll

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:03.750
help me see this idea through.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:06.990
Or if I start with a half
idea and my scene partner

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.380
or teammate can see in my eyes
that I'm, like, I'm not sure.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.240
I'm just throwing this out.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.250
And knowing that they're going
to see it through with me

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:21.280
and have my back and support
me is really important to me.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.280
SPEAKER 2: That's great.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.730
So does anyone
else have something

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.830
that's important to
them in their teams?

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.955
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah.

00:17:29.955 --> 00:17:32.550
I think embracing everybody's
strengths is really important.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.050
Because each
individual performer

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.680
brings in kind of their
unique set of skills

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.180
and their sense of humor.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.900
And anytime that
you're just making

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.420
that other person
correct and true,

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:49.110
it makes the work of
improv a lot easier.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:51.120
Because then you're
not having to fight,

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.020
two people having to
be funny at each other,

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.740
they can be funny together.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:56.410
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:57.570
Yeah.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.270
So there's a very
common improv saying

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:02.910
that you need to make
your partner look great.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.770
So sometimes, like,
as a performer,

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.500
it might sound like a
little counterintuitive.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:11.610
The point is to put on a big
show, to shine, to be funny.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:15.160
But in improv, it's, like, put
the emphasis on your partner.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.240
So do you want to describe--
how does that work

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.930
to the benefit of both people?

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:21.270
LOU GONZALEZ: I try not
to make them look good.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.180
I want to stand out.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.530
But it actually is.

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.400
It's just about
communication, really.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.510
It's all about yes, anding.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.300
I need my scene partner to be
on board with what's going on.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.772
And in order for them to
truly be in sync with me,

00:18:37.772 --> 00:18:39.480
I also have to accept
them for everything

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:41.530
that they're bringing
to the table, as well.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:43.830
And so it's one of those
things a lot when I teach,

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.050
you see little micro no's.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:49.280
And you see how it impacts how
the scenes progress sometimes.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.030
SPEAKER 2: What do you
mean by micro no's?

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.710
LOU GONZALEZ: Like
someone will say,

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.250
I can't believe you
did x, y, and z.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:59.070
Because a lot of times,
especially in new classes,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.380
people are, like, I'm
going to blame my scene

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.905
partner doing something.

00:19:02.905 --> 00:19:04.905
And that immediately puts
them on the defensive.

00:19:04.905 --> 00:19:07.110
It puts something
on them, rather

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.180
than accepting it not being.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:13.260
And that's why we always say
like, oh, yes, and, and build.

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.420
And also do small things,
where it's cold outside.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:17.940
It's, like, yeah,
but you know what?

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.710
I like how cold it is.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:20.640
It's OK.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.360
But someone said in a very
negative tone that it's cold.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.800
And we're not necessarily
reciprocating that.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.810
And so sometimes that in itself,
just that small interaction,

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.150
could impact how a
scene progresses.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:35.970
Because it impacts how the
person feels about what's

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:37.278
going on in the scene.

00:19:37.278 --> 00:19:39.570
And so small things like
that, when you're doing stuff.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:41.298
I mean, when I
trust, after you've

00:19:41.298 --> 00:19:43.590
been doing it for a while,
and you'd like trust people.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.480
You just straight
up mess around.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.480
That's why I brought out a
jetpack, because I was, like,

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.010
well, it doesn't matter.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:55.068
I know that they all looked up.

00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.610
When I did the job,
it's, like, cool.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.430
I pull away, great.

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.830
Because I was just, like,
oh, I trust these people.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.380
And that is something
that is sometimes

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:07.030
earned through experience.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.930
But in improv, we
try to let you--

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:12.970
we'll have that for
everyone, in that sense.

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:14.440
SPEAKER 2: So what
if sometimes--

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.370
any one of you-- if you
are doing a scene or a show

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:19.770
with someone you
don't know as well,

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.440
or is not as
experienced as you are,

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.780
how do you sort of empower
them to shine the way you want

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:28.600
any scene partner to shine?

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.267
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
The thing I always

00:20:30.267 --> 00:20:32.910
tell students is
treat that person as

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.055
if they're like the greatest
improviser who ever lived.

00:20:37.055 --> 00:20:39.180
Because you don't want to
be a jerk to the greatest

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.263
improviser who ever lived.

00:20:40.263 --> 00:20:41.970
You want to make them look good.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:44.250
So I just tell them
pretend like it's

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:47.130
the person you admire
the most or whoever.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.560
It's like, oh, you're
improvising with the Dalai

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.770
Lama or something like that.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:51.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:53.445
You don't want to undermine
the Dalai Lama's--

00:20:53.445 --> 00:20:54.570
LOU GONZALEZ: He's so good.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:55.690
It's crazy how good.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:55.950
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.480
You should see him do improv.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.200
It's very enlightened.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.910
But yeah, the goal is, I
think, to make that person

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:06.420
feel trusted in their ideas.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:11.190
And then to try to build
and agree on something

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:13.530
together so that
you're not just trying

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.635
to be funny at the person.

00:21:15.635 --> 00:21:17.010
There's another
saying we have in

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.340
improv where there are no
lead actors in an improv team.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:23.100
We're all supporting actors.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.630
And that should be
our mindset when

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:28.710
we're going into an improv set
where not one or two people

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:29.700
are carrying the set.

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.540
Everybody's pulling on
the same rope together.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.910
CAROLINE MARTIN: I think
everyone fully believes that.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:39.930
But I feel like you can
access truly being at ease.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.760
I don't have to do
anything, because I

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.710
know anything I throw
out there someone

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.203
will say great I can help.

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:46.620
I will help you
with that premise.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.803
I see the intention
of your initiation,

00:21:48.803 --> 00:21:50.970
or how you wanted to start
that scene, and I'll help

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:52.120
you finish it off.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.750
So I feel like eventually
you get to this place

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.780
where, when you're improvising,
you're just living and being

00:21:57.780 --> 00:21:59.590
in the moment, easier
said than done.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.190
But if everyone's supporting
each other, it's easy.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.857
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:22:02.857 --> 00:22:05.940
And you're sort of, like you
said, they have an intention,

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.520
assuming that the person
you're working with

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.412
has some sort of idea that
they're trying to put forward

00:22:12.412 --> 00:22:14.370
and assuming that they
know what they're doing.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:18.552
And making them look just as
good as you know that they are.

00:22:18.552 --> 00:22:19.510
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Right.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:21.900
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.680
So here at Google, we also,
of course, work in teams.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:28.290
We collaborate with other teams.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:33.280
No one is on their own
doing something all day.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.210
And even if you're not taking
Improv 101, which everyone

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:40.320
should, there are
some skills that

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.240
could be translated from
that to any type of work.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.390
So what are things
that you found yourself

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.090
using in day-to-day life?

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:49.880
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Listening.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:50.790
LOU GONZALEZ: Yeah.

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.610
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Listening
is super important in improv,

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:57.570
and it turns out, in life.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.460
But I think improv made
me a better listener.

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.180
And being good at
listening makes

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:04.395
you better at being a person.

00:23:04.395 --> 00:23:05.520
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah.

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.490
And to like, go off
this specific thing.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.650
Sometimes in classes, we
talk about active listening.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.460
Which just means instead
of simply hearing

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.610
what the other person is saying,
hearing what they're saying,

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:23.438
but also digesting it so that
you can react to it honestly.

00:23:23.438 --> 00:23:24.980
Rather than just,
like, OK, I'm going

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.313
to wait for this person to
finish so I can say my thing.

00:23:27.313 --> 00:23:28.410
That's not listening.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:32.370
That is just competing
with the other person

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.470
to get the funny thing out.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.310
But yeah, listening should
lead to some sort of reaction

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.320
off what they just said.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.240
SPEAKER 2: So I bet
this is something

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.450
that's a little, like,
you don't think of it now.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:47.020
And it's a lot more natural.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.520
But so when you're listening,
what are you're trying to do?

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.895
What is your goal while you're
listening to somebody else

00:23:51.895 --> 00:23:53.563
speak, when you're
active listening?

00:23:53.563 --> 00:23:55.980
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: I think
it's just to react honestly.

00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:59.670
I think that's our one
goal in that moment.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:00.300
Yeah.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.300
MICHAEL HARTNEY: They're
also giving information

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.900
that you don't have.

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.690
Because a scene can't
exist if it's being

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:08.010
driven by just one person.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:11.790
So they're building
the scene in ways

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:15.040
you couldn't have imagined.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.887
So you need all that
fuel for that scene.

00:24:17.887 --> 00:24:18.720
KELSEY BAILEY: Yeah.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.850
SPEAKER 2: So listening
is one major thing

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:23.310
that I think we all see that
people can do better at.

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.120
Are there other skills
that you've encountered?

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.120
KELSEY BAILEY: I think--

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:27.460
CAROLINE MARTIN: Oops, sorry.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.110
KELSEY BAILEY: Go ahead.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:28.943
CAROLINE MARTIN: No.

00:24:28.943 --> 00:24:31.950
I also just feel like
hearing someone's idea all

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:40.090
the way through and helping
them fully flesh it out,

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:41.560
if you will.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.680
So I feel like "yes, and"--

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.120
if you really believe it, I
agree with what you're saying,

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.330
and I'm building off
of what you've said.

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.800
We might get to absurdity.

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.930
But generally,
someone feels safer

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.827
and heard when you
genuinely believe in them,

00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:56.910
hear them out, and then
help them build that idea.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:00.360
So I think how you
brainstorm, you

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:04.170
can also use a lot of tenants
of improv that, as well.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.390
SPEAKER 2: So there's
yes and I hear you.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:07.652
I'm building on your idea.

00:25:07.652 --> 00:25:09.360
I'm not bringing
something completely new

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:10.950
just because you
have done talking.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:11.867
CAROLINE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:25:11.867 --> 00:25:14.640
And consciously making
it "yes, and" and not

00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:18.630
its devilish cousin,
"yes, but", which feels,

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:19.630
like, yeah, I heard you.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.005
But that's not
what I want to do.

00:25:21.005 --> 00:25:22.480
That doesn't feel good.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.810
So truthfully attacking.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:27.485
listening to
someone's POV as yes,

00:25:27.485 --> 00:25:28.860
I'll hear it all
the way through.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:31.470
And then maybe at the end,
we might not practically

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.550
be able to do it, it may
not work in the budget.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.880
But I am giving you
the space in the ground

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.080
to fully tell me exactly
what you're interested in.

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.592
I think that's really helpful.

00:25:40.592 --> 00:25:42.300
KELSEY BAILEY: That's
almost exactly what

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.092
I was going to say.

00:25:43.092 --> 00:25:44.340
Just the tenet of "yes, and."

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:48.390
Especially in my
work environment,

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.040
implementing "yes, and"
when managing people,

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:53.652
that people are coming in with
ideas who might be someone

00:25:53.652 --> 00:25:55.860
that I managed, to let them
know they're being heard.

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.540
And it's very scary to
present a new idea to someone,

00:25:58.540 --> 00:25:59.840
especially someone above you.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.340
So I mean, like, yes, and let's
see how we can explore this.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.320
And even if it moves away
from the original idea,

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.520
because you know in
your brain, like,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.470
oh, they're never going
to let us do that.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.480
We don't have the freedom
to do that, right?

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.220
It's still like
exploring and showing

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:15.240
that you appreciate the person
who came to you with an idea

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:18.670
to try and help you achieve
whatever goal it is.

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.540
SPEAKER 2: Your goal
is to help them make

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.500
whatever is possible a reality.

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.310
Yeah.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:31.178
So what are some--

00:26:31.178 --> 00:26:32.970
if you were playing
with different groups--

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.760
and I've seen all of you
in different configurations

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.950
at the theater performing
with different people--

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:40.620
do you find that when you're
with a different group

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:42.510
of people, you play one role.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:49.943
Not being a character, but like
a part, a utility on the team,

00:26:49.943 --> 00:26:51.360
and then with
another group you're

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.580
doing something
completely different.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.205
Do you find that that
happens to you sometimes?

00:26:56.205 --> 00:26:57.330
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.840
I think that at
least for me, I feel

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:04.830
the better you know your
team the more comfortable

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:07.440
you are with them.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.650
So on the team that I
regularly play with,

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.000
we're all very good friends.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.750
So that gives us
kind of some license

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:19.290
to screw around with
each other and do things

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.360
that are a little bit riskier.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.010
Whereas if you're doing an
improv jam or something, where

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:28.450
it's a mix of different levels--

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.060
SPEAKER 2: What
is an improv jam?

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:30.615
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
An improv jam

00:27:30.615 --> 00:27:32.070
is you put your
name in a bucket.

00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:34.740
And if you've never done
improv before you can do that.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:40.140
And yeah, just a bunch of
different levels of improvisers

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.117
jamming together
on an improv stage.

00:27:42.117 --> 00:27:43.950
SPEAKER 2: Everyone
comes onstage and just--

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:45.075
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah.

00:27:45.075 --> 00:27:47.618
And yeah, sometimes
they'll be a drunk person.

00:27:47.618 --> 00:27:48.660
Sometimes there will be--

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.362
LOU GONZALEZ: Sometimes
there will be a drunk person.

00:27:51.362 --> 00:27:53.820
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Usually
there will be a drunk person.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.250
But Yeah, I think the
better you know somebody

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.270
and the more you--

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:01.530
I think it's just a baseline
level of trust and comfort

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.310
and experience with your
team, the more you're

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:09.630
willing to take riskier moves.

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.380
Whereas with more of like
an improv jam setting,

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.790
it's you're trying to
be polite to people.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:19.470
You're trying to be
in your best behavior,

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:24.150
but probably your ceiling
isn't as high as an improviser

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.317
when you're in that setting.

00:28:26.317 --> 00:28:27.900
SPEAKER 2: You're
playing a role there

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.610
as an experienced
improviser, trying

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:33.870
to sort of rein it in and make
it like make sense, maybe.

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:34.500
Help out.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:37.770
Is that something that you
will do in other scenarios

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:42.180
like try to achieve certain
goals for yourselves

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.453
or for your show?

00:28:44.453 --> 00:28:46.620
LOU GONZALEZ: I think each
scenario speaks to things

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:47.198
differently.

00:28:47.198 --> 00:28:48.990
I think it's about just
assessing that when

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:50.160
you're there.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.378
Because sometimes I'll assume
that a certain type of show

00:28:54.378 --> 00:28:55.170
is going to happen.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.130
But you can't predict that.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:58.387
I can never predict how an
improv show is going to go.

00:28:58.387 --> 00:29:00.720
Sometimes the most entertaining
times I've had on stage,

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:03.630
I was just, like, oh, boy,
it's going to be weird.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.010
There's this weird
energy around.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.122
Sometimes, like, you'll feel it.

00:29:07.122 --> 00:29:08.830
Sometimes the worst
shows I've ever done,

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.440
I was, like, oh, boy,
what's happening?

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.570
And sometimes you feel it.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:14.940
And then you're just, like,
everyone's just like brr.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:20.370
Because improv is so much about
just connecting with someone.

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.860
And especially if
everyone's bright--

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:26.040
no one comes every day with
their brains functioning

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.080
the same, just like there's so
many different outside forces.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:32.700
And when you're doing improv,
that shows very clearly,

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.638
like if something's
cluttered in your brain.

00:29:34.638 --> 00:29:36.180
You either are
unencumbered by improv

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.910
and you play freely, or not.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:44.858
A lot of it depends on what's
given to you a lot of times.

00:29:44.858 --> 00:29:45.900
Like today, for instance.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.040
I was like oh wow.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:47.660
This is cool.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.840
This is weird as shit.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.210
I said to you.

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.310
And I was, like, this is weird.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.010
I was, like, how do I don't
put myself in a situation

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:58.580
where I feel comfortable?

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:04.800
I performed for a weird
situation, the ambassador

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.140
of Denmark in Denmark.

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.268
And I remember, like,
with my group it was OK.

00:30:09.268 --> 00:30:11.310
We're about to perform
for a bunch of dignitaries

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:12.090
for no reason.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.343
And we do this exercise
where we huddled up

00:30:16.343 --> 00:30:17.760
and we say that's
going to happen.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.440
Just be, like, keeping
things positive--

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.773
and then I looked down and
we were all wearing sneakers.

00:30:21.773 --> 00:30:25.080
And I was, like, this
is dumb, so dumb.

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:27.900
And then I think
like sometimes it's

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:29.970
about alleviating the
pressures that you

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:33.900
put on yourself so that you can
be open to what's happening.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.400
Because yes, you can have that.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.022
Like, yes, this is my role.

00:30:37.022 --> 00:30:37.980
This is what I'm doing.

00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:41.160
But you cannot let that
be your sole focus.

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:43.200
You have to just be
yourself, as well.

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.130
SPEAKER 2: How does what's
going to happen work?

00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:49.020
How does that help you
get ready for a show?

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.478
LOU GONZALEZ: It's sort of just
putting positive energy out

00:30:51.478 --> 00:30:52.090
there.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.490
Just, like, we are going
to support each other.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.490
And then everyone says
that's going to happen.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.367
It's, like, we are going
to yes, and aggressively.

00:31:00.367 --> 00:31:01.325
That's going to happen.

00:31:01.325 --> 00:31:01.640
CAROLINE MARTIN:
That's going to happen.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.280
LOU GONZALEZ: And I'm not going
to say shit, that happened.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:05.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.890
So you want to keep it positive.

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.140
But then, like, things--

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.407
you know, life happens.

00:31:11.407 --> 00:31:12.990
SPEAKER 2: That seems
like a great way

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.600
to start any scene, committee.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.370
That's going to happen.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:19.530
KELSEY BAILEY: I do do
it in personal things

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.550
when I need to amp
myself up, kind of, like,

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.670
getting an affirmation you
would do in the mirror.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:26.190
If I have an interview
or something,

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.170
I'll be, like, you're
going to get this job.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:28.740
That's going to happen.

00:31:28.740 --> 00:31:29.350
And then I don't get it.

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.944
But it's OK.

00:31:29.944 --> 00:31:30.444
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:30.444 --> 00:31:34.328
It can still put you in
a positive head space.

00:31:34.328 --> 00:31:35.370
And it's very empowering.

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.560
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, that's awesome.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.730
So I'm going to go back
to-- in the last year,

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.870
you've created
two shows that aim

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.470
to give underrepresented
groups in improv voice

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:50.490
and have these groups
perform different shows.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.020
So I wanted to ask
you how did you

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.140
come up with these
shows and the classes,

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.660
and how did you shape those?

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.340
LOU GONZALEZ: I think it was--

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:03.450
I just wanted to create spaces
that I could confidently

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.080
speak in for my identity.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:07.020
You know, I am a
queer person of color.

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.490
And so therefore,
last year I created

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:12.690
an all queer class
and an all POC class,

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.470
mostly for safe space.

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:21.180
The way-- you know, improv,
I love it, very white space.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:22.900
But it's getting better.

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:28.080
But I wanted to just create a
space where people could just

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.198
be themselves.

00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:31.740
And I was, like,
it'd be really cool.

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:32.490
It's Pride Month.

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:33.530
Let's do a queer show.

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:35.280
And I was, like, well,
I'm not just queer.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:35.940
I'm POC.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.460
So let me do a POC show.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.232
And so that was just
the intent I'm just

00:32:41.232 --> 00:32:42.190
going to do this thing.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:43.148
Let's see what happens.

00:32:43.148 --> 00:32:49.110
And I was blown away by the
scenes that I was seeing

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.510
and the camaraderie
that was developing

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.090
and the empowerment
that was happening just

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:58.380
by being with people who are
underrepresented, but felt

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.320
like they were in a safe space.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:05.490
And that in itself created
such trust within each group

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.790
and created such
brave moves on stage.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:12.420
And I think also
improv especially

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.790
is about a connection
with the audience.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.520
And what we're giving
out, your receiving.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.500
All that energy is being
shared back and forth.

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:22.860
You're following along with
the scene the same time we are.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.040
You're discovering things
at the same time we are.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.330
And when you align with a person
based on your own experiences,

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.340
based on how you view
the world, the closer

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.430
that is, the more you're
following that journey closely

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.130
and the more wonderful
that discovery becomes

00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:41.500
when it's in line with your
understanding of what you want.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.790
So sometimes people
laugh when you just

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.790
plainly state stuff that's
happening in an improv scene.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.928
Like I was doing an eye test.

00:33:49.928 --> 00:33:52.470
And just by doing the eye test,
I was getting small chuckles.

00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:55.170
But like, it was
pretty evident what

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:57.300
it was but we're just
laughing because we're

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:59.345
affirming what's going on.

00:33:59.345 --> 00:34:00.720
And it becomes
that much stronger

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.290
when it becomes more personal.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.290
I think both of those
shows became very personal

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.480
for the people on
stage and connected

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.159
with people in the audience
on these very personal levels.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:10.992
SPEAKER 2: And I've
seen both of those shows

00:34:10.992 --> 00:34:14.330
and they were unbelievable and
super fun and really inspiring.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:15.750
So thank you for those.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:16.250
Yeah.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:17.940
And every person
here on this panel

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.530
is involved in some show that
is giving a voice to a group

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.409
that they identify with, which
I think is really important.

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:28.889
And here at Google, like
any other organization,

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:33.150
we try to amplify
diversity, because everyone

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.239
knows how it improves the work
experience and the actual work

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:36.940
being done.

00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:40.139
So I was wondering, Michael,
as the artistic director when

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:43.310
you schedule shows, how
do you let that guide you

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:46.679
when you're trying to
decide what's actually

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:49.050
being put on at the theater?

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:50.010
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Sorry.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:52.710
How do I let what guide me?

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.570
SPEAKER 2: Trying to
achieve diversity and--

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:55.110
MICHAEL HARTNEY:
Diversity, got it.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:55.907
Sorry.

00:34:55.907 --> 00:34:56.782
SPEAKER 2: --voices--

00:34:59.015 --> 00:35:01.640
MICHAEL HARTNEY: I just want to
see a bunch of different voices

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.190
onstage.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:07.320
Because I think that
hearing a bunch of shows

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.780
from the same type of
person over and over again,

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.950
it's monotonous.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:21.360
And shows like-- we
do a show called Gay

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:26.730
by Play, where we do gay
commentary over improv scenes.

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:31.125
So there's no other
show like that.

00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:33.250
You're not going to see a
different show like that.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:38.940
And certainly like yeah,
Achilles frequently

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.820
does a show called
Asian AF, which

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:46.230
is a super funny
show that we wouldn't

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:50.420
have just a few years ago.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:52.170
And I think the theater's
getting stronger

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:58.260
because so many different
stories are being told.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.663
So I think about it a
lot when I'm programming.

00:36:01.663 --> 00:36:04.080
SPEAKER 2: If anyone has any
questions for our performers,

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.820
feel free to line up.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.240
There are mics on either side.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.500
So we've talked a little
bit about different shows

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:14.370
at the theater.

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:17.580
So what are some
of the things that

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.840
are being programmed at UCB.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:23.481
So you know that there's improv,
but what other types of shows?

00:36:23.481 --> 00:36:25.560
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Well,
there's sketch comedy.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.560
We have some stand
up variety shows.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.000
We have a storytelling show.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.230
CAROLINE MARTIN: Sketch.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:33.230
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Did
I not say sketch?

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.930
CAROLINE MARTIN:
It's the first--

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:34.050
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Sketch.

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:34.880
CAROLINE MARTIN: Never mind.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.130
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Oh.

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.255
CAROLINE MARTIN: Listening!

00:36:36.255 --> 00:36:38.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.623
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:40.623 --> 00:36:41.540
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Yeah.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.910
But mostly I would say our big
thing is improv and sketch.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:47.100
SPEAKER 2: And sketch, yeah.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.520
So where can people see
you guys, specifically,

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.010
at the theater regularly?

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:53.760
CAROLINE MARTIN: I
perform with The Curfew

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:57.150
every Saturday at 7:30
at UCB Hell's Kitchen,

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:00.360
as well as with my team
Astronomy Cloud, which is all,

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.410
you know, people of color.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.340
And we perform
one Friday a month

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:07.822
at 10:30 at UCB
subculture, but you

00:37:07.822 --> 00:37:09.030
can see that on the calendar.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.697
So come on down.

00:37:09.697 --> 00:37:12.190
It's real fun.

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:14.370
MICHAEL HARTNEY: I
do musical improv

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.620
with a team called
Rumple Teaser.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.830
That is Mondays at 9:00
at UCB Hell's Kitchen.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:27.120
And occasionally, you'll see me
throwing shade as part of Gay

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.730
by Play.

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:33.930
LOU GONZALEZ: I occasionally
throw shade at Gay by Play.

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:38.160
And I perform every
Friday at 7:30

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:43.640
with [INAUDIBLE]
at UCB Subculture.

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.270
KELSEY BAILEY: I
perform Tuesday nights

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:48.750
on Herald Night, which is one
of UCB's famous improv nights

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.200
with teams, on a
team called Reba.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:53.630
And then I also am
on a show called Here

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.880
and Queer, which is an all queer
improv cast with special queer

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:02.277
storytellers the first Wednesday
of the month at 7:30 at UCB.

00:38:02.277 --> 00:38:04.110
I'm so happy this is
here so I can remember.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:04.902
UCB Hell's Kitchen.

00:38:04.902 --> 00:38:06.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.490
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
I perform on Saturdays

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:12.360
at UCB Subculture with a
group called Airwolf at 8:30.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:15.920
And then on the Sunday night
show at UCB Hell's Kitchen,

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:17.700
The Asscat 3,000 show, both.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.440
Shows

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:21.677
SPEAKER 2: We have
some questions.

00:38:21.677 --> 00:38:22.260
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:26.820
I'm curious about
when improv goes bad.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:29.310
Have you ever had a case
where you had a yes,

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:33.480
but what the F did
this person just say?

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:36.420
Where you just
couldn't, you know,

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:41.610
because it was so horrible
or disgusting or shocking?

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:43.065
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:43.065 --> 00:38:45.980
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:38:45.980 --> 00:38:48.730
AUDIENCE: What
happens in that case?

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:52.290
KELSEY BAILEY: There is, like,
a beautiful mechanics to improv

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.230
that can allow you to get out
of a scene if you have to,

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:57.180
especially if it's
gone bad in a way you

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.850
saw us running in
front of scenes,

00:38:58.850 --> 00:38:59.850
which is called an edit.

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.230
Which means that scene is over.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:04.300
You can tag people out, like
with the tiny eyes scene.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:07.230
So there's a lot of mechanics
to help be able to divert away

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:10.470
from something that is so
egregious that you're just

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:13.610
like I just can't see this
player on stage anymore.

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.500
Or again, we are working at
the top of our intelligence

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.540
and trying to even
make people who say

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.130
horrific things look better.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.740
So I just, yeah.

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:25.830
I mean, lift them up, right?

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:29.490
There are ways that you can
try and take what they said

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:32.162
and make it work
through skills, as well.

00:39:32.162 --> 00:39:34.620
AUDIENCE: I guess those are
the biggest opportunities, too,

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:35.853
for comedy?

00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:37.186
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Sometimes.

00:39:37.186 --> 00:39:39.470
Sometimes.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:41.107
LOU GONZALEZ:
People assume that.

00:39:41.107 --> 00:39:42.940
Because they assume
that because something's

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.320
getting an immediate reaction,
that it's worth being comedic.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.600
But actual good
comedy is something

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:52.962
that's earned and built.
Because a lot of times,

00:39:52.962 --> 00:39:54.670
I'll get a lot of one
on one students who

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.520
just say really absurd
nonsense up top because they

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.868
want to be funny.

00:39:58.868 --> 00:39:59.535
And the desire--

00:39:59.535 --> 00:40:00.618
MICHAEL HARTNEY: Shocking.

00:40:00.618 --> 00:40:02.020
--very shocking,
offensive stuff,

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:03.110
because it gets a reaction.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:04.180
CAROLINE MARTIN: Reaction, yeah.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:06.180
LOU GONZALEZ: And so they
look at that reaction,

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.350
like, well, any
reaction is good.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:10.300
People are liking this.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.010
And there's certain
human beings who

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.960
navigate this Earth
that just assume

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.380
a reaction is positive towards
them, no matter what it is.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:18.910
I've seen them onstage.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:20.600
I've performed
with some of them.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:25.690
And those people tend
to not stick around

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.910
because that's not
comedy, unfortunately.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:35.333
It's something, but I wouldn't
necessarily call it comedy.

00:40:35.333 --> 00:40:37.000
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY:
Yeah in my classes

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.080
I call them puppy
stomping laughs.

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:41.905
Yes.

00:40:41.905 --> 00:40:43.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:46.150
And the reason I call them
that is, yeah, they're

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:49.390
moves that are made in the
scene purely for a reaction,

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:53.380
not for any sort
of comedic idea.

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:57.010
And we try to, as
Kelsey was saying,

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.710
try to play to the top of our
intelligence, which just means

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.905
do the smartest type
of scene you can

00:41:02.905 --> 00:41:06.580
and react honestly to whatever
is going on in the scene.

00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.910
And the way we deal with it when
it's coming at us from somebody

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:12.553
is we try to not sweep
it under the rug.

00:41:12.553 --> 00:41:14.470
We try to react to it
honestly, call attention

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:16.480
to it so that we can deal
with it in a way that

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:19.573
is honest rather
than just being,

00:41:19.573 --> 00:41:21.490
like, oh, I hope the
audience didn't see that.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:22.548
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:41:22.548 --> 00:41:23.340
LOU GONZALEZ: Yeah.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:24.610
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Because
we know with the whole audience.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.110
LOU GONZALEZ: Yeah,
you can't avoid that.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.150
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.662
I guess I'll ask sort of the
opposite question of that.

00:41:29.662 --> 00:41:32.350
I'm curious to hear about
some sketches that just went

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:34.900
fantastically well, especially
if they started from, maybe,

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:37.930
a seemingly pedestrian
or unfunny premise.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.580
And then somehow they
got to this place

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:41.710
that was amazingly hysterical.

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:44.490
I'm just curious to hear
about some of those instances.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.210
KELSEY BAILEY: Hm.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:49.010
SPEAKER 2: Do you remember
a lot of scenes that you do?

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:51.010
LOU GONZALEZ: Man,
they're so ephemeral.

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.358
KELSEY BAILEY: Yeah.

00:41:52.358 --> 00:41:53.650
MICHAEL HARTNEY: I can recall--

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:58.480
so we do this thing
every year called

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:03.160
the Del Close marathon, which
is tons of improv groups

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:07.570
do shows for literally
days and it's exhausting.

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:13.540
And my group was going
after a team of celebrities.

00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:15.580
So the theater was packed.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.480
And everyone was there
to see those celebrities.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.930
And they did their show.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:20.650
It killed.

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:22.180
They got off stage.

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.070
And we got on stage.

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:29.790
And they were, like,
you aren't famous.

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:31.690
Make me laugh.

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:35.350
They were not-- they didn't
want to like our show.

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:39.470
And we didn't let
it make us nervous.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.460
We didn't let it
change how we play.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:45.930
And we got 'em.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.800
We got 'em good by the end.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:50.020
Took a few minutes.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:58.180
But yeah, we just relaxed and
built a great show together.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:02.350
LOU GONZALEZ: In terms of,
like, a sketch or a scene

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:09.520
starting not in a
good place, I think

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:15.610
I'd say maybe 40% of my
scenes start with nothing.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.680
And because it's
all about discovery,

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.790
and as long as you're listening
and adding and creating,

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.890
especially if you're
working on a sketch

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:26.350
and you think you
have the premise,

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:28.905
but the premise isn't
the focus of your scene,

00:43:28.905 --> 00:43:30.280
you could discover
something else

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:35.380
that may be what's delightful
and joyful and entertaining

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:36.490
about that scene.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:39.340
I think that happens
more than not, where

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.080
you're working on something.

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.900
I think some of the best
stuff that I've worked on

00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.000
started pretty innocuous.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.210
And I found that the things that
I was the most excited about,

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.465
ended up being OK.

00:43:50.465 --> 00:43:52.090
Like of the things
that I've worked on,

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:53.350
like, nothing that
I started on was,

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:55.180
like, oh, man, this is
going to be the best thing

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.138
ever-- didn't end up
being the best thing ever.

00:43:57.138 --> 00:43:59.870
And a lot of things where I
was, like, oh, this is fine.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.600
I'm like, oh, wow,
this is great.

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.240
Oh!

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.170
It's sort of just about
the creative process.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:06.770
And then building off of that.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:09.100
And I think a lot of improv
is connected to that.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.545
But also, writing and working
on sketches is like that.

00:44:11.545 --> 00:44:12.670
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:14.230
I think just to add
to that, I think

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.000
one experience
that we've all had

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.320
is performing for
out of town or places

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:22.750
that have never seen
any type of improv.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:24.490
And this is just,
like, oh, what is this?

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:27.910
They have no idea
what it is walking in.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:30.340
And yeah, it was like
Michael was saying.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.650
You kind of just get them
within a few minutes.

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.410
They're like, oh,
this is what this is.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:35.140
This is amazing.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:38.060
And those are often
really gratifying.

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:43.050
CAROLINE MARTIN: I also am
thinking of a complicated start

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:44.340
to a show.

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.040
My team Astronomy Club,
again, all people of color,

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.320
we, for like a year
and maybe some change,

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.470
did a show called "Let's
Talk About Race, Baby",

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:56.850
where we interviewed the
audience about moments

00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:01.320
that interacted with race,
more often than not negative,

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:02.460
of course.

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:07.980
And so we would get three or
four pretty intense stories

00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.400
with upsetting content
that, as comedians, we

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:14.370
had to kind of sift
through it and see

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:16.770
what is our perspective
as comedians,

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.420
what has a charge on it.

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:23.940
How can we take this idea and
find something funny in it?

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:29.850
And being able to ride that wave
and find cathartic solutions

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:33.720
where the audience knew
what was the inspiration.

00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.200
You know, police brutality--
absolutely not hilarious.

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:41.460
But if we have themes of that,
but it's played by ducks,

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.320
maybe we can get some laughs.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:47.470
So that kind of matrix
of play, you know?

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:49.680
That's definitely not
a casual, have wine

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.540
before you improvise situation.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:56.090
But as a comedian, for me,
that was really rewarding.

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:58.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.110
AUDIENCE: My question
is, what do you do

00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:03.900
to get you open to any ideas?

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.510
What do you study?

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:07.820
What do you prepare?

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:08.690
CAROLINE MARTIN: Oh.

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:11.210
Well, just to-- well,
I guess before--

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:13.028
LOU GONZALEZ: Just
to be open to ideas?

00:46:13.028 --> 00:46:14.570
AUDIENCE: What do
you do, what do you

00:46:14.570 --> 00:46:17.910
study to get some new
ideas, to be open,

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.940
to be open to any ideas?

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:24.560
Bizarre, or bad ideas,
any strange ideas?

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:28.990
LOU GONZALEZ: I think,
like, live a life.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:30.660
That's so important.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.960
Go out and engage with
the world and fail a lot.

00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:38.830
Because failing is a
good experience to have.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:41.040
And I think the more I
failed, the more empathetic

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.120
I became about
other human beings.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:49.130
Because this existence is
weird, just in general, just

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:50.270
by navigating space.

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:52.580
And I think I became
more open to ideas

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:57.060
once I became more empathetic
to just people in general.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.060
I feel like I'm a better
improviser because I've

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:02.690
grown as a person, not
only an improviser.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.120
And you do that by
living, meeting people,

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:10.420
getting to meet people from
different aspects of life

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.710
than you.

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:14.210
And improv has helped me do
that by just going out and doing

00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:15.290
stuff.

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:17.660
But also, just
navigating New York City.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.240
You can meet a lot of
people in a short distance.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:23.250
SPEAKER 2: We have time
for the last two questions?

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:23.833
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:23.833 --> 00:47:24.500
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.410
First of all, thanks for
the talk and the show.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:28.790
That was amazing.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.770
And one thing I was
wondering was that you

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:33.400
mentioned a improv musical?

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.150
I was wondering, like,
how does that work?

00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:37.802
Do you come up with music
and songs on the fly?

00:47:37.802 --> 00:47:38.760
MICHAEL HARTNEY: We do.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.650
It's crazy.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:43.880
I still can't believe I do it.

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.740
Yeah.

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:47.330
The team that I'm
on was put together

00:47:47.330 --> 00:47:53.630
by a musical director, a great
improviser, named Eric Gerson.

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:58.670
His big thing is that good
musical improv is just

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:01.343
good improv with music.

00:48:01.343 --> 00:48:03.260
And he recruited a bunch
of people who'd never

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:05.750
done musical improv before.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.670
I was-- I did not want to do it.

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:10.110
I thought it was terrifying.

00:48:10.110 --> 00:48:12.140
And he said just
please just let me

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.000
work with you for three hours.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.550
We'll teach you a few
different song structures.

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:21.320
And I think you'll
be good at it.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.050
And so a bunch of
us got in this room.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:25.220
He taught us a couple
of song structures.

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.080
And by the end of it,
we were doing things

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:32.970
that we had no idea that we
ever had the capacity to do.

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:34.700
And so now we do it every week.

00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.610
And it's really fun.

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:41.460
So yeah, do what's scary to you.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:42.602
You might be good at it.

00:48:42.602 --> 00:48:43.310
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:45.320
That's amazing.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.098
SPEAKER 2: Yeah?

00:48:46.098 --> 00:48:46.640
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.520
Thank you for being here.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.340
Any tips or techniques
that you use

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:55.040
that would apply during
a scene or giving a toast

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:58.205
or having a conversation over
dinner, power of the pause

00:48:58.205 --> 00:49:01.610
is an example I think
someone mentioned.

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:04.430
Stating the obvious, so I
guess it could make you funny

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:06.603
or make you charismatic
or just bring attention

00:49:06.603 --> 00:49:07.520
to what you're saying.

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:15.850
CAROLINE MARTIN: I feel like
one of the most important parts

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:18.520
of general conversation
that I find

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:21.380
that my one-on-one students
have a hard time with,

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:24.910
which actually makes you a
good listener and charismatic,

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:29.080
is showing someone that you
care about what they just said.

00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.380
And if you are asking them
questions that are immediately

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.770
interacting with exactly
what they just said,

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:35.770
they're like, oh, great.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:36.980
You cared about what I said.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:38.980
And as an improviser, I'm
using that same thing.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:40.840
I really care about
what you just pitched.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.173
I will help you build off of it.

00:49:42.173 --> 00:49:44.710
Which sounds so obvious,
but sometimes we

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:47.360
aren't interacting with what
someone just threw down.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.690
And by doing that,
it creates a distance

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:52.370
because I do not care
about what you just said.

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:54.455
So that would be my quick tip.

00:49:54.455 --> 00:49:55.580
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: Yeah.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:57.250
I think that is really the key.

00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:58.930
You mentioned the word charisma.

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:01.780
And I think that when
it comes down to it,

00:50:01.780 --> 00:50:05.162
a charismatic person
makes you feel

00:50:05.162 --> 00:50:07.120
like you're the only
person they're speaking to

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:07.850
in that moment.

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:10.720
And I think that's
the same feeling

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.760
we want to have when
we're in a scene,

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.950
at least when it starts
out as a two person scene.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:18.080
It should really feel like
it's just we're in this scene,

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:20.110
there's no audience,
there's no back line here.

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:21.285
It's just the two of us.

00:50:21.285 --> 00:50:22.660
And I'm really
interested in what

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:23.827
the other person has to say.

00:50:23.827 --> 00:50:27.040
And I going to build and
agree and go off of that.

00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:31.630
But yeah, I think the
approach should be I just care

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:33.020
about what the other person is.

00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.224
CAROLINE MARTIN: And a
lot of shoulder work.

00:50:35.224 --> 00:50:37.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:40.160
KELSEY BAILEY: I think
also one of the main tips,

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.577
and especially something that
we teach in one on one a lot

00:50:42.577 --> 00:50:43.850
is just be yourself.

00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:47.570
If you go in being, like, I
need to be a funny person,

00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:48.923
it's going to crash and burn.

00:50:48.923 --> 00:50:50.590
Because you're just
putting on something

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:52.400
that's not true to who you are.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.060
So I think just allowing
yourself to shine through,

00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:57.280
whether it is giving a
toast, or in a conversation,

00:50:57.280 --> 00:50:58.870
or in an improv
scene, you're going

00:50:58.870 --> 00:51:01.180
to find things so much funnier
because you're reacting

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.890
honestly as yourself,
as opposed to,

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.550
like, I need to
make everyone laugh,

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:08.560
so I'll say something crazy
as a character, right?

00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:11.137
So just being true
to who you are.

00:51:11.137 --> 00:51:13.720
SPEAKER 2: Thank you so much for
everyone who asked questions.

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:18.073
Just to close this
event, I want to know

00:51:18.073 --> 00:51:19.990
what are the types of
people who take classes?

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:22.810
Because I know most people here
have very different careers.

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.090
It's not something
that we'll naturally

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:27.760
be drawn to if you're
doing other things.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.575
But I feel like you've been
teaching for many years.

00:51:30.575 --> 00:51:32.200
What are the types
of students you see?

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.170
ACHILLES STAMATELAKY: I think
there is a pretty wide range

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:36.690
of students.

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:38.950
I think it gets a
little bit narrower

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:43.750
as you go up in levels.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.580
To make it very
general, I think it's

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:48.400
people who are interested
in comedy and being funny

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:52.870
or are doing, applying
some sort of training

00:51:52.870 --> 00:51:56.830
to some sort of
theatrical background.

00:51:56.830 --> 00:52:01.550
They tend to be in their 20s or
30s, kind of figuring out what

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:05.950
their hobbies or careers are.

00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:09.780
People who are, yeah, trying
to make funny friends.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.790
And then sometimes,
oftentimes, it's

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:16.930
a lot of people who have
grown up knowing about UCB

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:20.150
and want to go down that track.

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:21.850
But I think those
are very broad kind

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:24.940
of bullet points of
the type of student

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:28.390
that takes classes at UCB.

00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:31.480
I think, in general, they
have an interest in comedy.

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:35.300
And they want to learn
how to do it and apply it.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:36.130
Yeah.

00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:39.070
SPEAKER 2: Why do you
think somebody who is not

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:41.140
pursuing a career in
comedy should maybe

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.607
take a class or two at UCB?

00:52:43.607 --> 00:52:45.940
CAROLINE MARTIN: I think it's
great for public speaking,

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:49.990
problem solving on
your feet, and just

00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:53.480
general interpersonal
skills and conversation.

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:54.730
I think that definitely works.

00:52:54.730 --> 00:52:57.710
I have had a lot of students
who are executives who just want

00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:59.710
to feel a little bit more
comfortable expressing

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:01.900
themselves, and I
think the classes

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:03.890
are very helpful for that.

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:07.630
And it is fun to see those folks
interacting with maybe the more

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.707
hard core, like, I'm
a comedian, and then

00:53:09.707 --> 00:53:11.290
someone else is,
like, well, you know,

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:12.410
I'm here for different reasons.

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:14.243
But they work together
really well in class.

00:53:14.243 --> 00:53:17.890
So it doesn't matter what
your perspective or purpose is

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.140
before you go into the class.

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.870
And we definitely don't isolate
different types of classes

00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:24.540
for personality or objective.

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:28.330
So it is nice for
everyone to mix.

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:30.650
SPEAKER 2: So thank you
all again for being here.

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:34.150
This was lovely and insightful
and very, very funny.

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:37.390
You can see what shows
are on the schedule

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:39.610
at UCB Theater in
the fancy spelling,

00:53:39.610 --> 00:53:44.950
British spelling [INAUDIBLE]
and the logo UCBTheatre.com.

00:53:44.950 --> 00:53:47.560
And you can see classes there.

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:51.640
and There is so much to
see seven nights a week.

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:54.500
So I highly recommend
checking it out.

00:53:54.500 --> 00:53:58.450
So thank you so much to Caroline
Martin, Michael Hartney, Lou

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:00.783
Gonzalez, Kelsey Bailey,
and Achilles Stamatelaky.

00:54:00.783 --> 00:54:01.700
And thank you so much.

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:04.450
