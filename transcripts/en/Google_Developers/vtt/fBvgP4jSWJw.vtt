TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right,
let's get this party

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.780
started, shall we?

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.380
This is the Advanced Google+
History session.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.430
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.600
Only the hardcore make it this
far, and I appreciate every

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.830
single one of you.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.900
Hi, I'm Timothy.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.520
I'll be your developer advocate
for the next hour.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.030
And we're going to go through
a whole bunch of really

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.220
interesting topics.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.490
And it's all going to center
around this one big thing that

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.170
we just launched recently.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.340
Now, it's an early developer
preview.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.870
So it's the time for us to
experiment with it and get

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.420
ready for a user launch.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.850
And for those of you-- and
I'm going to do some

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.230
recap at the beginning.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.830
I just want to get an idea of
who was at the Google+ History

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.856
session this morning.

00:00:48.856 --> 00:00:50.640
All right, so about
half of you.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.010
Great.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.810
So I'm going to go through
this review quickly.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.190
This is the idea.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.520
Instant upload is cool.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.820
I take pictures with my phone.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.990
And they get uploaded
to Google+.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.120
I can go back and look at them
any time that I want.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.690
And for those that I want to
share, I get to choose to

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.010
share them to my friends,
my family, or public.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.420
All right?

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.460
And it's this save privately
and optionally share action

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.000
that we're using for other
activities on the web.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.570
And this is where you come in.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.360
You write moments into Google.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.840
And it shows up for that user
in their private area.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.740
And then they can choose
to share those

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.640
out by making a post.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.080
This is all about getting your
content in more places.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.160
Let's take a quick look at a
demo to see this in action.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.375
All right, so I am going
to-- let's see here.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:53.390
I want this window and
these buttons.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.470
Here we are.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.190
So we had the opportunity to
work with Last.fm to play with

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.660
this API before releasing it.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.940
And they've been really great
about telling us where our

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.900
bugs were and testing
things out.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.890
Now, if you're not familiar
with Last.fm, it's a great

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.630
product that allows you--

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.390
they call it scrobbling.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.960
They remember the music
that you play from

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.870
wherever you hear it.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.090
And then they use that data to
recommend additional music and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.660
concerts to you.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.000
And because of these reasons,
we think it's a really good

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.350
match for Google+ History.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.550
I'll show you how it works
on Last.fm here.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.800
So this is the test page
that they set up

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.590
with a Sign In button.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.790
I'm going to click
this button.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.580
And I get a permissions
dialogue.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.420
Now, I'm granting Last.fm
permission for two things.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.790
One, my Google+ ID, and the
ability to write into my

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.890
Google+ History.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.140
I'll go ahead and hit Connect.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.910
Now, what's happening right now
is it's going through the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.960
second part of the
OAuth process.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.510
And Last.fm just got
my credentials.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.230
So now the next thing I
want to do is perform

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.120
some sort of activity.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.930
So I think I'll jump
over to Radio.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.640
And my buddy Ade recommended
a band to me

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.450
just the other day--

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.450
Stereo 360.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.700
Let's load that up.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.210
All right.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.676
So this is playing now.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:38.120
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh,
there we are.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.680
So this is the Last.fm that
you're familiar with--

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.800
going on there and listening
to music and

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.770
discovering new music.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.400
By adding Google+ History, the
next thing that we have here

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.850
is I can now go over to Google+
into this developer UI

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.120
that you see.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.570
If I reload the page, there's
a new moment--

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.820
Listened to California.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.740
And I want to mention a couple
things about this.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.610
First off, you see some
album art there.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.709
And we're pulling this
from the target URL.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.920
And I'm going to talk more about
that in some detail in

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.080
the session.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.620
You also see Last.fm's logo
and the actual activity--

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.520
Listened to California.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.190
Now, if I click on California,
it's going to take

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.510
me to the song page.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.330
And I can download, or
I can listen again.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.060
So far, even before sharing,
we've seen the value for the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.620
user here is this huge
nostalgia thing--

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.940
being able to go back to their
Google+ History and see what

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.000
tracks they listened
to yesterday, last

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.630
week, or last month.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.300
Now the next step is, if they do
want to make a post out of

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.550
this, they can hover over
that moment and

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.130
click the Share button.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.035
And they can share with their
friends, or their family, or

00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:04.990
the public using the
power of Circles.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.240
I'm going to share
it back with Ade.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.880
I'll go ahead and click Share.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.800
And I've created a post.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.050
Just see what that looks like.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.110
You'll notice a couple
things here.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.240
First off, there's the album.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.760
And there's the attribution
to Last.fm, right

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.650
there at the top--

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.050
Listened on Last.fm.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.490
And then below, of course,
is the link to the song.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.780
This is Google+ History.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.520
We've seen a simple OAuth
process, and then the ability

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.680
to share moments privately, and
then optionally post them.

00:05:53.638 --> 00:05:54.888
All right.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.280
I'm going to go ahead and
turn off that song.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.300
Very good.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:12.480
Cool.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.450
So that's History.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.540
And we went over all the basics
in the first session,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.030
Getting Started with
Google+ History.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.140
In this session, I'm going to
cover some advanced topics.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.100
We're going to go in depth with
a number of things and

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.530
take a look at some extra stuff
that you can do, both on

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.240
mobile and using the Sign
In button to do some

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.535
authentication for login.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:40.330
Let's review the overall
process.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.860
First, you set up your
application.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.450
And to do that, you use
the API console.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.330
Next, you authorize the
user using OAuth 2.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.870
And third, you write moments.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.320
These are all technologies that
you're likely already

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.830
familiar with.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:57.060
And let me just get
a survey there.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.340
Who's been to or knows about
our API console?

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.890
Great, several of you.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.990
For those of you haven't, it's
developers.google.com/console.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.290
It's how you create
an application and

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.750
add services to it.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.150
So you can actually
access our API.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.280
Who's used OAuth 2?

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.740
All right, so a lot of us.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.570
And who's used our
RESTful API?

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.110
All based on that,
super easy to do.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.930
This is what the flow
looks like.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:28.080
You initiate the OAuth flow.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.230
And then the user gets the
permissions dialogue.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.490
And they say, yes, I would
love to connect.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.630
And then we send the user
through a client-side or a

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.280
server-side flow.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.610
And then we're done.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.730
Next step is, in the
background, you

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:45.790
start writing moments.

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.820
There's a Write in which you
send some JSON to Google,

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.030
identifying the activity.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.270
And then there's a Fetch.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:58.850
And this is the point at which
Google grabs the target URL,

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.090
learns about it, and then knows
how to display that

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:04.530
moment in Google+.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.780
Let's look at this
in some depth.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.170
This is the process from
start to finish.

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.460
There's an activity
on Last.fm--

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.110
listening to this radio
station, in

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.050
particular, this song--

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.640
with the result all the way on
the other side of having a

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:24.480
moment in Google+ History.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.550
The first step, as
I mentioned, is

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.610
writing that activity.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.059
And this is the list of
activities that you can write.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.330
We want help on this.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:42.260
This is one of the reasons we've
got a developer preview,

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.270
is that here's a
list of verbs--

00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.390
of activities on your site--
that we think are going to be

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:50.530
common and you're going to want
to write into Google+.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.180
But there's going
to be others.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:52.530
Yeah?

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:55.370
And for the time being, you
can use one of the generic

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.430
verbs, such as AddActivity.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:00.580
When something else doesn't fit,
AddActivity's a good one.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.160
For all sorts of creations,
CreateActivity's a good one.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.930
But if you can be specific,
like a purchase, use the

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.390
BuyActivity.

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:10.510
And if there's an activity that
you think is going to be

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.920
common, but it's not on this
list, let us know.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.960
We have an issue tracker
that's linked off the

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.210
documentation.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.890
Now, the activity
looks like this.

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.620
You have a type and a target.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.790
This is the first one we're
going to look at.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:28.440
This is a ListenActivity.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.570
The type is the activity that
was performed, in this case

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:32.530
ListenActivity.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:35.830
And the target is the item
that it was performed on.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.370
In this case, it's a song.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.880
Here's a CommentActivity.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.670
And I'm going to add
a new section here.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.260
We have the type and the target
as before, but now we

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:50.500
also have a result.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.140
And this is because I've
written a comment.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.490
And now a comment exists
out in the world.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.080
It's a result of the activity.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.170
So that result will include
the type, in this case, a

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:05.810
comment; the permalink to that
comment; and then the text of

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:06.480
the comment.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.570
Now, these fields are going to
differ depending on what

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:09.560
you're creating.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.040
And we have a reference for
that in the documentation.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.360
And that's the difference
between these two kinds of

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:15.890
activities.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:19.330
There's those that have a result
and those that don't

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.580
have a result.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.050
After you write the activity,
there's a Fetch step, which is

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:32.870
how we get the information to
render the moment and a post,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.510
if the user makes it.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.630
Now, who's familiar with this
process for when users just

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.570
share on Google+, how we
construct this using

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.980
schema.org?

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.140
So a handful of us.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.270
For the rest of you, the way
this works is that you mark up

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.730
your page, indicating
what you want to be

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.220
displayed for these.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.575
And then we respect that.

00:10:54.575 --> 00:10:58.940
You use schema.org markup to do
so, and it looks like this.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.360
Now, this is a music
recording.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.700
And you'll see up at
the top, we have

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.160
itemscope and itemtype.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.950
And then we have itemprops--

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.720
name, description, image.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.270
And then we have a sub
itemtype below that.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.810
And this is microdata markup.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.470
It's the HTML5 spec.

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:24.260
Schema.org uses that spec with
its own activity types and

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:25.510
property names.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.920
Let's take a look at
another one here.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.550
Here's that CommentActivity.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:34.120
And this is BlogPosting.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.850
We have itemscope up there
and itemprops--

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:39.590
URL, name, and description.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.720
Now, a couple key things here--
and I'll reiterate

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.050
these from the Getting
Started session--

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:53.020
is that you don't have to add
any new content to your site.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.300
Most of the time, all the
content that you need is

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.205
already in the page.

00:11:56.205 --> 00:11:58.130
You just have to mark
up what's there.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.730
You have to indicate
what's there.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.080
And the other thing is that
this isn't visible to the

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.190
user, whether you have
the markup or not.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.270
So you're not changing
how your page

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.730
appears on a website.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.200
You're just marking
it up for Google.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.210
Real quick--

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.400
itemscope is going to be
on the parent tag.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:19.220
And the itemtype is the
type of an item.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.180
All below there is where we'll
look for itemprops that

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:25.030
correspond to that type.

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:29.140
And then each of these itemprops
indicate the

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.480
properties of this item.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.590
In this case, you see a URL, you
see a name, and you'd see

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.850
a description.

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:36.350
OK.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.270
Let's take a look at some these
in practice, shall we?

00:13:01.838 --> 00:13:02.550
All right.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.732
So this is our Google+ History
API starter, and it does some

00:13:05.732 --> 00:13:06.950
pretty cool things.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:10.900
Once I sign in, it gives me
this UI that lets me write

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.150
some canonical moments.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.790
These are example moments.

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.090
And we're hosting the
target URLs on our

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:21.080
documentation site.

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.530
So let's just write
some of these.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:28.200
How about a BuyActivity, a
CommentActivity, and a

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.450
CheckInActivity?

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.400
I'll go over to my Google+
History and reload.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.590
And there we have them.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:42.130
So here's the BuyActivity
and the CommentActivity.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.330
Let's see if the CheckInActivity
will show up.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:46.900
There's the CheckInActivity.

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.020
Now, you'll notice each
of these has--

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.320
it's a rich moment.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.390
We can tell by looking
at it what it is.

00:13:53.390 --> 00:13:54.930
Let's click through
to one of these--

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:56.415
Alice's Adventures
in Wonderland.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.870
Very simple page-- you can see
us on our documentation site.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:05.180
And if you want, you can-- let's
see if I can do this on

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:05.810
this keyboard.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:07.590
There we are.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.020
You can take a look
at the source.

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.680
And you'll see the schema.org
markup right up

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:14.340
there on the page.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.785
This is a great opportunity to
look at all the activity types

00:14:16.785 --> 00:14:19.230
that we have, find the ones that
you're going to use, and

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.920
look up how we actually
communicate these and how we

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.600
mark them up.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.170
And one other thing to note
down here is that--

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.620
so that you see the markup,
as far as the payload--

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:31.770
what you send--

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.680
it's actually printed down
here in this box.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.960
So you'll see Sending moment.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.760
And there's the BuyActivity
right there

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:40.100
with the target URL.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.580
So start to finish, you can see
the code for some of these

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:43.830
canonical moments.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.060
All right, what's next?

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:52.860
Straight to OAuth.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.100
Now I'm going to be bouncing
around a lot, because these

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:56.170
are just advanced topics.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:58.290
There's no real order here.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:01.200
This is one topic I wanted
to cover briefly.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.510
We put together this Sign
In button also in

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.640
the developer preview.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.850
Because we think it's a good
idea to have a button that

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.140
users are going to recognize
on websites to sign in with

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.250
Google+, but also to make
it really easy to

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:15.860
start the OAuth process.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.485
However, there's times that
you're going to want to start

00:15:17.485 --> 00:15:20.800
the OAuth process
your own way.

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.730
Maybe you want to do
this because you

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.290
want to do it in flow--

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.790
the user signing up
to your website

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:26.730
through your own system.

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.920
And you just want to authorize
at the same time.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.340
Now to do that, you can initiate
the OAuth flow like

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:35.340
you would any other
OAuth flow.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.160
It's OAuth 2.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.910
It's a standard.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.560
And it's just this step right
here at the beginning.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.060
Now, I'm going to show you some
code for starting this

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.950
with the JavaScript
client library.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.590
And I'll give you a brief peek
at some of the languages.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.450
And I use the client library,
because starting OAuth without

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:56.070
a client library is
much more painful.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.900
In fact, just a show of hands--

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.480
who's used OAuth before?

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:00.950
Right.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.390
And keep those hands up.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:08.270
Who of you have started the
OAuth process manually,

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.560
without a client library?

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.100
OK.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:13.565
Keep your hands up if you
enjoyed the process.

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.014
Ade, you are the only one.

00:16:19.014 --> 00:16:20.210
[? AUDIENCE: He's lying. ?]

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.300
TIMOTHY JORDAN: He
probably is.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.010
So the thing is, these client
libraries just automate a lot

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:29.640
of the issues for you, and just
get that OAuth process

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.840
standing up without
too much work.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.200
And this is what it looks
like in JavaScript.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.360
And you'll see--

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.160
really straightforward.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.955
First, we include the
client library.

00:16:38.955 --> 00:16:42.880
In JavaScript, we just have
to include the JS.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.500
Then we have a method that
does some initialization.

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.850
In this case, we're telling the
Google client library what

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:53.640
API we want to use and
what our API key is.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.090
Next, we have a button that when
you click it, we initiate

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.220
the OAuth process.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.780
And all you got to do
here is pass the

00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.850
client ID and the scope.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:04.195
And then finally,
we authorize.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.720
Now this is really simple, for
those of you that have seen

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.609
the manual process versus
the client library.

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.440
And it's available in
multiple languages--

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.970
PHP and Python.

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:19.359
In fact, we have a whole
list of them.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.300
Check out the client library.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.280
And if you do it, this is
the best way to do it.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.040
If you do need to do it
manually, we do have

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.170
documentation.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:29.190
Make sure to pour yourself a cup
of coffee and sit down for

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.440
a good read.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.720
All right, Error Handling--

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.880
another topic.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.150
I'm going to show you
a lot of errors.

00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:43.840
And it can look kind
of daunting.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.940
But there's only a couple that
you really have to pay

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:46.940
attention to.

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:49.410
I want to cover them so you know
the kinds of things that

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:51.590
can go wrong and get an
idea of what you might

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:52.640
be looking out for.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.230
But again, there's only a couple
that you're going to

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:56.800
encounter commonly.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.950
They're going to occur
in a couple areas.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.430
I'm going to cover first the
authorization process.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.380
And then I'm going to look
briefly at writing moments.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.710
For the authorization process,
you can see them after

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.590
initializing OAuth.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.150
And you can see them after the
user has gone through the

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.910
permissions dialogue.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.180
So let's take the first one,
right after initializing the

00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:24.540
OAuth flow or while
trying to do so.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.580
You're going to see a couple
different kinds of these

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.520
button errors.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.010
You're going to see missing,
malformed, or invalid data.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.490
And this could be an invalid
callback parameter, an invalid

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:39.250
scope, or an invalid clientid.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:45.260
You might also see not defined
or unmatching errors.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:46.340
And I put up this list.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.660
You can look deeper at these
slides later when

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:49.910
we post them online.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.700
The other set of errors that
you'll see are after the

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:00.160
permissions dialogue, when
you're entering into either

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.290
the client-side or the
server-side flows.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.030
And this is the whole
list of errors.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.590
Again, this is part
of the standard.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.965
And all of these are important
to have a rough idea about at

00:19:08.965 --> 00:19:10.120
the very least.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.800
But there's one that you're
going to get commonly--

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.460
hopefully, not too commonly.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.330
This is when the user
sees the permissions

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:21.830
dialogue and says, no.

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:25.230
At that point, you're going to
want to do something, like ask

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:30.980
them why, or say, please,
try again.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.410
But you do want to
handle this one.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.920
Because you're going to handle
that a little bit differently

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.380
than if it's a server-side error
that you need to fix,

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.760
that you need manual
intervention.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.770
And this is what it will look
like on the client side.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.030
So I've written a function
here for

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.650
the client-side callback.

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:51.190
And a parameter is
passed to this.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.960
I've called it event here,
and I'm looking

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.010
for property error.

00:19:55.010 --> 00:19:57.220
If there is an error,
this will be set.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:01.780
If it's not an error, it
just won't be set.

00:20:01.780 --> 00:20:03.550
And I'm throwing in a switch
statement here.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.480
You can do an if.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.650
Whatever it is, you're just
looking for that Access

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:11.400
Denied, asking why they don't
like you, and then moving on.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.610
However, if there's no error,
all you're doing

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.230
is hiding the button.

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:16.440
Everything worked perfectly.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:19.970
This should be the
common case.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:24.150
For the server side, same set
of errors, you just get to

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.890
them in a different place.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.770
Instead of not setting that
property on the parameter we

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:33.400
passed to the callback, we won't
set the parameter on the

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.210
URL, if there's no errors.

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.990
If there is, we will.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:41.100
So you need to grab that
from the request.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.530
And if it's there, you
handle the error.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:44.925
Again, same set of errors.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:53.310
And then we have errors here.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:55.580
We write a moment to Google.

00:20:55.580 --> 00:21:00.030
And then we fetch
the target URL.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:01.710
And there's one that I'm going
to look at, and that's a

00:21:01.710 --> 00:21:04.370
missing metadata field.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:05.830
So let's actually look
at these in practice.

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.000
No session is complete without
a demo where you at least

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.710
break one thing.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.850
So I purposely broke
some things.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.170
Now, this is the History
API starter again.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.820
And I've got a couple versions
of this doing

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.200
things that are wrong.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.080
The first one is the missing
clientid parameter.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.460
And you will typically see this

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.940
printed out on the console--

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.000
this particular error.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.055
In this case, I'm just pushing
it into the browser here, on

00:21:40.055 --> 00:21:42.260
the actual page.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.690
So you'll notice two things--

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:44.600
you'll see the error
down here.

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.640
And you'll also notice
there is no button.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.800
That is as intended.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.660
The next error I wanted
to show you is

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:55.040
the malformed clientid.

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.060
In this case, I put in, "My
voice is my passport, verify

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:02.420
me." And it didn't work.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.090
So again, it's not showing
the button.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:06.400
And it's telling me
what's going on.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.910
And this one, I want to show
you what happens if I

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.680
disapprove.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:21.860
I'm going to click Sign On, hit
Cancel, and there we are--

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.110
Access Denied.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.070
This one is bad metadata.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:33.310
So let me go ahead
and sign in.

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:36.050
I actually have some canned
bad metadata here.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.140
In this API starter, you can
write a custom moment.

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.675
I'm going to paste
it in right here.

00:22:50.140 --> 00:22:52.790
And this is actually pointing to
a URL that we'll look at in

00:22:52.790 --> 00:22:57.030
a moment that has
bad metadata.

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.665
We'll go ahead and write
this moment.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.400
And you'll see we
get a response--

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.430
missing metadata field,
the name.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:11.190
So we've looked at the errors
that come from the button.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.640
And we've looked at the errors
that come after the

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.720
permissions dialogue.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.800
And this is--

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.470
after you do the OAuth process,

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.910
you're writing moments--

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:22.790
the errors that you
get at this point.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:26.360
And in fact, if you have
incorrect metadata, oftentimes

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.370
we'll be able to give you
an error message.

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:35.790
In this particular page,
it looks like this.

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:40.110
I'm specifying a schema.org
thing type.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.500
And I've got no itemprops.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.260
Name is a required field.

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:46.815
It's missing.

00:23:46.815 --> 00:23:48.065
And we throw an error.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.020
There's a couple more topics
that I want to talk about.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.620
First, starting with mobile.

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.480
Now, who did see the
mobile session?

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.610
So a few of you.

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:15.450
I'm going to just review
a little bit of mobile.

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.520
It looks like what we saw
before, where you set up your

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:23.500
application, you authorize the
user, and you write moments.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:27.080
But instead of using just the
API console, OAuth 2, and REST

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.430
API, we're going to use
these new things.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:33.790
In the API console, we need
to specify an installed

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.860
application, in this case,
an Android application.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.300
I'm going to talk about Android
specifically, though,

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:43.210
coming soon, this will
work for iOS as well.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.810
And then you need to give it
your SHA-1 fingerprint.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.800
And this is how we're able to
both associate and verify the

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.310
application that you are
building an APK for--

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:58.650
and the app that you've defined
in the API console.

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:00.485
It looks like this.

00:25:00.485 --> 00:25:03.160
Instead of choosing a web
application, we're choosing an

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.520
installed application.

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.580
And then we're setting the
package name and the SHA-1

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.830
fingerprint.

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.680
Next, we want to initialize
the client and the OAuth

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:21.920
device flow.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.470
And we do that in code
in the application.

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.160
And finally, on Android, to
submit a moment, you just fire

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.130
up an intent and use that
to submit a moment.

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.820
Now for more information or a
look at this code, you should

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:43.210
go to the Integrating Google+
into Mobile Apps session.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:46.470
You can find that
on that link.

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:50.910
But I want to take a look at the
application just to give

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:52.660
you a brief taste of what
it will look like.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:03.600
So let us switch to,
I think, this one.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:05.220
There we are.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:07.930
Works like a charm.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.610
I've got a couple applications
here I'm going to show you.

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:11.550
This is the first one
for this section.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:15.450
And this is a general Google+
SDK sample application.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:22.260
You can download this, set up
your application, put in your

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:25.830
SHA-1 fingerprint, compile,
and run this.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:26.990
And it'll just work.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.250
I'm going to sign in.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.250
And it's going to ask which
account did I want to use.

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:36.700
And I'm signed in.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.700
Oh, look, it has my name.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.460
That's cool.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.840
So let's go back here.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:43.200
And let's just submit
a couple moments.

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.210
What haven't I done yet?

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:51.720
Let's try a ListenActivity,
and maybe a ViewActivity.

00:26:55.436 --> 00:27:00.220
So switching back over to here
to take a look at that.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:11.790
[INAUDIBLE]

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:16.130
Here we are, back
on the computer.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.750
And you can see we've got
a ViewActivity and a

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:21.800
ListenActivity coming from
the mobile device.

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.050
Pretty cool, right?

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:29.460
All right, switching back to
the presentation here.

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.520
One more thing I want to
talk about is login.

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.560
I think there's a hidden gem in
here for using the Sign In

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.710
button, which gives you
an OAuth 2 flow for

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.650
login across platforms.

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:50.710
Now, this is the flow that we
saw earlier where you initiate

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:53.025
the OAuth flow, then you get the
permissions dialogue, and

00:27:53.025 --> 00:27:54.280
then you do client-side
or server-side.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.310
And then you're done.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.910
But that permissions dialogue,
if you've already authorized,

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.770
just bounces back some
credentials.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:04.270
It's login.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.600
The user's already logged
into the Google account.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.420
They hit that button, and you
know who they are-- that

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.080
particular user in that
particular browser.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.480
All you need to do is
keep that Google+

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.690
ID somewhere safe.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:22.770
And you can find that in here.

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.370
This is the OAuth 2 response.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:32.290
And inside it are an access
token, and token type, when it

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:36.455
expires and created, and an
ID token right there.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:40.200
Now the ID token--

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.750
it's a web-safe, Base64-encoded,
and it

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.560
contains a few fields.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.090
There's a lot of interesting
stuff in here,

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.090
if you take a look.

00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:50.910
It's a JSON web token, if you're
familiar with JWT.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:55.100
But there's one thing in
particular that I'm going to

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.320
be interested in.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.950
It's this ID.

00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.290
So for this example, I'm
just grabbing this ID.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:04.780
That said, if you're actually
doing this flow, you want to

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.120
verify the signature.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.690
And you want to make sure
that the cid there

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.750
is your client ID.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:15.120
And that's going to add that
extra layer of security--

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.560
to know that on the round trip
of that flow, what's coming

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:24.510
back is what's actually intended
for you from Google.

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.770
And more information about how
to do to each of those steps--

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:28.200
it's actually really
straightforward--

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.120
is in our documentation.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.960
But this user ID is what I'm
going to use to indicate this

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:36.610
user in my user database.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.550
Maybe I have a local
ID, which is great.

00:29:38.550 --> 00:29:40.040
And I use that in my
URLs or whatever.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.030
But in that ID, I associate that
with their Google+ ID.

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:47.700
So when they hit this button,
I learn that--

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:51.960
I hit my user database for my
website, so that this is the

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.720
person I know from Google+.

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.840
And then I get back my local
user ID and all their

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.000
information.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.730
And I can do that just as easily
on the website as I can

00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:02.570
from mobile.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.520
So we're going to look at it
first on web, just a demo of

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:06.380
how this works.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.240
And then we're going to
look at it on mobile.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.220
And of course, I'll
make this source

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.470
available for you later.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.460
All right, so first
with the web.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.060
One of these browsers--

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:36.820
here we are.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.870
So I threw together this really
quick web page that

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:43.740
first asks me to sign in
with Google+, which

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:44.700
I'm going to do.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.780
And that allows me
to set a quote.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:53.902
"Improve life through science
and art." Cool.

00:30:53.902 --> 00:30:57.300
And I'm going to submit that--

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.040
really simple.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.690
What's happening here behind
the scenes is I hit

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.940
that Sign In button.

00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.620
I get the user's ID.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.770
And then the user
sets a quote.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.310
And I send that to my
user database, both

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:11.950
the ID and the quote.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:15.790
And it's associating the
ID and the quote.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:31.360
Now I'm going to go over to
mobile here, and load up my

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.070
application.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:37.540
So I actually took the starter
app, pulled out all the stuff,

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:41.880
kept the sign in and a call
to my customized API--

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.050
where I send the user ID,
and I get back a quote.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.360
I hope it works.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.900
I'm going to sign in again
with Captain Timothy.

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:51.630
We've got that.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:52.930
Signed in.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:54.370
And there's my quote.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:55.150
Right?

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:57.070
Really straightforward,
end to end.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.860
This demo would take you about
an hour to build by just

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.250
pulling down the starter apps
and pushing the data out--

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:05.620
maybe a few more minutes if
you have to build a little

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.250
custom API that I did
for the quote.

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:20.510
So we've covered a
lot of topics.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:25.160
We've talked all the way through
an overview, a review

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:28.450
of the flow of Google+
History, through to

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.940
activities in depth.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:34.350
And we've also covered errors,
OAuth, and mobile.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:36.960
And finally, we looked at
using it for login.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.260
So you can see, at the end
of the day, there's

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:42.150
a lot to this API.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:47.200
But remember, the intention here
is to allow the user to

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:52.710
communicate online better, by
giving them the capability to

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:57.920
save moments privately to their
Google+ History and then

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:01.890
to optionally share them
with whom they want.

00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.410
Thank you.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:09.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:10.452
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's
do questions.

00:33:10.452 --> 00:33:12.430
Oh, and I have stickers
to give away.

00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.940
It's the end of the day.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.600
I need to give them all away.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.700
So maybe I'll do that
right after.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:22.940
But those who ask questions
get more, which is good,

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:24.600
because Gerwin always
needs more stickers.

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.985
AUDIENCE: So actually, just
a short question first.

00:33:30.985 --> 00:33:34.680
Is this Last.fm functionality
available to those who signed

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.170
up for the preview?

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:39.400
Because I checked the
Last.fm page, and I

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.050
didn't find the settings.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:41.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It is not.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.920
AUDIENCE: It is not.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So in this
developer preview, you're

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.400
developing your own
application.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.650
You're not testing other
company's applications.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:50.550
That said, if you want
developers in your team to

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.650
test your own application,
you can do that.

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:54.170
And you can grant them access.

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:55.310
But there's two things
restricting--

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.500
one, Last.fm just gave
me the password.

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.980
And two is that there's an
API restriction, right?

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:02.970
So you're only going
to be able to make

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.550
1,000 queries per day.

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.650
It's not quite enough to
open it up to anybody.

00:34:06.650 --> 00:34:09.860
It's really, truly just
a developer preview.

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:12.320
AUDIENCE: And the second
question was, how about

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:15.870
moments for Google+ pages
as opposed to profiles?

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.050
Because I think that's going to
be an interesting use case.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.739
Especially since we have the
possibility to display the

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:23.280
moments on your profile
or on your blast

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.040
page on this [? new ?]

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.159
[? app ?].

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:28.719
So I think that would be an
interesting addition for some

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:31.960
pages, because they could have
some news feed where they just

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:33.110
have some items.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.739
They have some favorites which
they want to show so that they

00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:37.350
don't get lost in the stream.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:39.710
But I guess that's the problem
with the OAuth workflow,

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:42.300
because that's the same with
Hangout apps, which you can't

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.370
use because of the
OAuth workflow.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:47.139
But I think that's something
that's going to be

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:47.594
interesting.

00:34:47.594 --> 00:34:48.050
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Cool.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:49.000
AUDIENCE: Excuse me, Tim.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.800
I'm curious, because I think
about the point of this is

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.650
taking the activity that
[INAUDIBLE] person are doing

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:58.530
on the websites--

00:34:58.530 --> 00:34:59.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Will--

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:01.840
for everybody out there
in the internets--

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.980
Will asked for an example.

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.950
He used many more words, but
he asked for an example.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:14.350
AUDIENCE: So my point is, you
could use the two to make

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:18.670
favorites of different stuff and
just share those favorites

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:21.310
in your moment step.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.570
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I think I hear
what Gerwin's asking for is

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.770
for pages also to have the
ability to share, or to

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.640
collect moments and then share
them specifically.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.280
Let's talk more about
this afterwards.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:35.020
Thank you for the feedback.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.390
Any other questions?

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.140
Oh, over here.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:41.410
AUDIENCE: Is it possible to
embed HTML in the result

00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:44.390
field, so that besides the link
to the page, that you

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.290
could put other links in the
description part of the schema

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:50.864
markup that goes at the bottom
half of the share?

00:35:50.864 --> 00:35:54.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I do not believe
so, but I'm not 100%

00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.970
percent sure about that.

00:35:55.970 --> 00:35:57.620
You can ask that on the
discussion forum, and we can

00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.550
dig into that.

00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:01.030
So far, we've been
looking at it--

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:03.230
most of the time we've wanted
to just sort of keep that

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.670
plain text, so it
hasn't come up.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:08.350
But I would love to dig
more deeply into your

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:08.610
[? prospects. ?]

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.650
AUDIENCE: Right, so one use
case is [? plussing ?] the

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.450
profiles of other
Google+ users.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:16.820
So from a Hangout that you did
some activity, you could post

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.940
that to your History.

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:21.770
But be able to tag the other
people that were in that

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:25.835
Hangout with you, which you
can do through the profile

00:36:25.835 --> 00:36:26.970
link markups.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:27.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
right, cool.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.020
Thanks for the feedback.

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:31.150
Oh, more questions.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:32.076
I love this.

00:36:32.076 --> 00:36:32.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.940
I was wondering will you
possibly in the future open

00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.830
access to the History
to developers?

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.830
For example, as a use case--

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.910
I don't know if other
third parties do it

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:46.230
or Google does this.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:51.950
For example, a couple of years
from now, send up snippets of

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:56.080
what you might have done this
day, or the most important

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.860
stuff you did this day five
years ago, or the photos you

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.630
took, or the events
you attended.

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.130
So I don't know if this could be
handled by Google or third

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:10.140
parties, which would have access
to the History API.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.530
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So what you're
asking for is read access to

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:13.680
moments that have
been written.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:14.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:15.960
Thanks for the feedback.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.670
AUDIENCE: Oh, just me?

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:24.570
Is there a way to undo the
moment, ie, delete the moment

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:27.300
which was accidentally
created?

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
a great question.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.850
So if you--

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.310
and we'll cover this in more
detail in the documentation--

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.940
right now, you can update it.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.860
But there's no way to fully
remove a moment

00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.880
once it's been written.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.590
AUDIENCE: And by updating, you
just update the content on the

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:41.265
URL, right?

00:37:41.265 --> 00:37:41.830
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Correct.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.150
AUDIENCE: And if I insert
it, it will just

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:44.470
pull the new data.

00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:46.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Also users
can delete their moments.

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.450
So whereas the site will just
write moments, the user can

00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:51.730
actually go into the UI.

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:54.450
And right by that Share button
that you saw under the

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.650
triangle, you can click that
and delete the moment.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:38:01.990
AUDIENCE: So what if the site
creates 1,000 moments?

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You could
delete all of them.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.430
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:10.610
David's feeding me
answers here.

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:12.260
There is an option to delete
all the moments

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:12.760
from a certain source.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:13.666
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:15.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.620
Sorry, that was like--

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.330
what?

00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:20.130
I'm not the only one with
caffeine, am I?

00:38:23.749 --> 00:38:25.120
Yes.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.930
AUDIENCE: So for moments right
now-- they're being treated as

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.290
individual moments that belong
to a particular user.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:34.820
And therefore that user allows
them to go public, basically.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.110
But for a Hangout, a moment
could involve several

00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:41.180
different people.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.430
I know that's not really handled
right now, but if you

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:46.090
were in a Hangout with five
other people, you're playing a

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.450
game, and you want to have
a moment in that game--

00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.900
I've had this conversation
with a few people.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:55.120
And the first issue that gets
brought up is that there's a

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.680
bit of a privacy issue there,
because you're sharing a

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.220
moment that isn't just
your moment.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.400
You're sharing other people's
involvement in that moment.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.500
Is there any thought around
whether you should just be

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.260
allowed to do that?

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.040
Or whether you will have some
sort of process where

00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:13.570
everybody can vet it or check
it, approve it, or if you can

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:15.100
approve it going in?

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.860
I recognize that my face will be
used, and blah, blah, blah,

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.820
kind of thing.

00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's
a great question.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.935
And actually, David Glazer has
just stood up to a microphone.

00:39:22.935 --> 00:39:25.490
So of course, I'll
defer to him.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:28.040
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah, I mostly
want to say that that is a

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:28.730
great question.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.590
We have talked about
exactly that.

00:39:30.590 --> 00:39:33.020
And we don't have
the full answer.

00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:35.930
So as you are working through
what could you do with the

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.390
History API, get those
conversations

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:39.410
going in the forum.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:41.370
We like that idea.

00:39:41.370 --> 00:39:45.520
But we also recognize the
challenges you introduced,

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:49.790
because there's a ton of power
in how personal History is,

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:52.520
and how private and how much
I, as a user, know

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.770
that this is mine.

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:00.510
I expect users will have the
kind of relationship with

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:05.000
their History that they would
have with a private diary or a

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.310
private journal, where it would
feel really wrong for

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:11.690
someone else to have
written into it.

00:40:11.690 --> 00:40:15.030
At the same time, many of the
most important moments in my

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.730
life are shared moments.

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.310
A lot of the important things I
do, I do with other people I

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.150
care about.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:21.620
So there is an answer here.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.590
AUDIENCE: It's the social
medium, isn't it?

00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:24.350
DAVID GLAZER: Yes.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:25.110
Yeah.

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.360
So we're looking for
the right answer.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.830
One of our metaphors that we're
trying to ride on is how

00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:31.260
you can tag people in photos.

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.410
And we're trying to
see if that works.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.680
Because I take a picture that
has four of us in it, and I

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.310
tag them in those flows there.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:42.970
So really my answer is keep
this conversation going.

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:44.140
Work through it.

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:45.540
Think through specific cases.

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:47.020
And say, boy, could I do this?

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:51.170
The person who asked earlier
about putting a profile markup

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.680
in a moment was really getting
at the same use case.

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.010
We think it's an interesting
use case.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:57.510
AUDIENCE: We work together.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:58.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And to reiterate
that-- thank you

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:02.490
very much, David-- is the
discussion forum is linked

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.000
from our documentation.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:04.870
We're very active in there.

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:07.070
And it is an early developer
preview.

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:09.480
This is just the right time to
really be raising a lot of

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.220
these tough questions
and trying to push

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.590
this product forward.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.970
AUDIENCE: This is a little bit
of an extension to this--

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:19.320
because what do we want
to share here?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:22.810
I understand that sometimes you
want these moments to be

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:26.490
private, but I listen to
some music, maybe my

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:30.120
friends or my Circles.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:32.840
So maybe I want to listen to the
same music that other in

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.580
my Circle listens to.

00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.310
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, so
it's a great use case.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:39.080
And what you can
do now today--

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.400
and play around with
this in the

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.070
developer UI in the product--

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:46.220
you'll be able to set some
moments from some sources as

00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:48.820
visible on your Moments tab.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.740
So it's not creating a post and
sending them to everybody.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.960
But maybe you want your listens
on Last.fm visible to

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.025
your music friends.

00:41:57.025 --> 00:41:59.390
AUDIENCE: But I'd have to
do this manually, right?

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:02.400
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You as the user
would make the choice.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.600
AUDIENCE: Also, announced at
the developer preview--

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.950
I understand that you don't have
any dates, but I'm very

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:09.380
excited on using this.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.960
And we have cases where
we want to do

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.170
this right now, actually.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:15.080
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Cool.

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:17.320
AUDIENCE: But release dates?

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We don't have
any dates right now.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:19.620
AUDIENCE: Nothing?

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.860
The year?

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:23.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We don't have
any dates right now.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.830
But thank you, and please
do get started.

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:27.150
AUDIENCE: We will.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:28.630
JOSEPH: And keep beating
us up until we launch.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:29.910
I also work on History.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:32.550
And it's a preview partly
because we think we need to

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.180
build more stuff.

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.930
And partly because we want to
get developers actually

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:36.680
putting content in there so when
we can open up, there's

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.210
more stuff.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.490
But when you really feel like
it's good enough, and we're

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.850
just being dumb by not opening
it up, as opposed to it's a

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:44.745
good thing for all of us that
we're continuing to work on

00:42:44.745 --> 00:42:46.860
it, make sure you say
that loud and clear.

00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:48.650
Because that will obviously
influence our choice.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.750
This is one of those things--
we could hold longer or less

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.190
long, and there's trade offs.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:53.710
So it's good to have
input on that.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:56.726
AUDIENCE: Now, I can't say for
the quality of the API, if it

00:42:56.726 --> 00:43:00.040
works and everything, but
from the overview, it

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.750
looks good for me.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.120
Of course, I don't
have all the--

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:03.510
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You're ready.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:04.720
AUDIENCE: --details
in the UI, but--

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We hear that.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:07.220
Thank you.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.580
JOSEPH: And well, on things like
not knowing what to do

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.320
with the social stuff-- those
are the kinds of things we

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.720
have to gnarl on and say, is
that something we need to

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:13.720
figure out before
we open it up?

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:15.940
Or can we just add that later?

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:19.050
And we really don't
know right now.

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:20.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Cool, thank
you for the question.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.800
And thank you, Joseph.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.760
We've got a couple more.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:24.150
Hi, John.

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:28.460
AUDIENCE: So maybe you covered
this this morning, but did the

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.920
different moments--

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.480
you have the different types,
the listen and the watch-type

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.170
events-- do they have different
meaning within the

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.610
Google+ application context?

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:40.055
Do they do something different
on the page?

00:43:40.055 --> 00:43:42.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So right now,
you'll notice that the moments

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.630
look a little bit different,
mostly on how

00:43:43.630 --> 00:43:46.770
we phrase what happened.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:48.720
And there could be more that
we could do there.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.490
But right now, you'll just see
that differ a little bit.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:58.720
And again, the key difference
is how we display it.

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:01.990
AUDIENCE: So one issue
comes up with these--

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.230
I don't want to say these
types of systems.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:04.050
I don't want to sandbox it.

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:10.330
But are you planning for more
types of moments, if they have

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:12.460
that special meaning, if there's
something more to

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.510
them, planning for more types?

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:18.500
And if so, is there a process
to suggest types, vet types,

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.805
develop or create types?

00:44:19.805 --> 00:44:20.600
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah, we
would love to know what

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.550
types should be added.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.270
And we have an issue tracker set
up on our documentation.

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.990
Go to that issue tracker.

00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:29.350
Say, I want this
type, and why.

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.690
AUDIENCE: So the API at present
doesn't look like it's

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:34.040
well-structured to handle
lots of different types.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:36.060
It looks like it's a
very small set of

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:36.860
well-structured types.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:38.580
I mean, you could eventually
have a lot.

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:42.060
But it's because it's part of
the call, as opposed to, say,

00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.170
part of one of the tokens that
you're passing in or

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:44.980
something like that.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I
actually disagree.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.550
What we ended up doing is we
went with schema.org markup.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.610
And what we transmit in the
payload at moment write time

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:55.540
is jsonified schema.org
markup.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:57.550
And what you mark up
on the page is,

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:59.260
again, schema.org markup.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.130
Now, if you look at schema.org,
it scales very

00:45:02.130 --> 00:45:04.040
well to many, many,
many types.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.980
In fact, I think you can even
mark up a volcano if you want,

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.450
with a postal address
and everything.

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:09.740
AUDIENCE: You could definitely
mark it up.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.940
But your actual API list has the
name of the moment in it,

00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:16.190
like a Buy moment or
a Listen moment.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:20.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So but how you
encode that is the URI

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:23.000
specifying that particular
type.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.300
So right now, those are the
only ones that we accept.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.750
And most of those have
schema.org URLs.

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:31.940
But as we accept more, we can
probably just pick that URL

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:33.830
from schema.org.

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.600
And if necessary, we can talk
about adding in new types in

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:37.500
schema.org.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.440
And also, we can cover
generic types.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.090
So if it's not on the list and
we don't add it in later, you

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:46.890
can try and fit it under, say,
AddActivity or ViewActivity or

00:45:46.890 --> 00:45:50.400
CreateActivity, which all can
cover several very more

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.490
specific type of activities.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:54.440
AUDIENCE: So that issue of
overlap is also the last thing

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:56.580
I was going to bring up, which
is, as you add those things--

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:59.180
and even with what you've got
now, there's often overlap

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:01.900
issues where people might
disagree as to what type of

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.690
moment it is.

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:06.680
I'm sensing that you guys are
aware of these issues, but it

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.720
doesn't sound like you've
worked through

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.350
them very much yet.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:10.560
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well,
we're still in

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.500
early developer preview.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.990
I'll stop there, actually.

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:15.260
It looks like David
is itching to add

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.430
something in here as well.

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:18.300
DAVID GLAZER: Just that--

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:18.820
you're right.

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.040
We haven't worked them through
all the way, which is why we

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.160
started with a--

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.800
we picked a vocabulary to start
with that we wanted to

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:29.190
be big enough to get the idea
across of hey, we're going for

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:30.100
different kinds.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.670
And we have the ability to do
different types of rendering

00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:34.510
and different types
of metadata.

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.130
But no bigger than to
get the idea across.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:40.500
So as Timothy said, there is a
link in the documentation.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.880
Specifically, it's right under
the list of nine moments.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.880
It says, Submit a request
for a new type.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:47.570
Because we want to
look at that.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:49.900
And I've had a couple
of good hallway

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.300
conversations about this.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.060
There's a tension between
the complete, open-ended

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.850
possibility, where each
individual action gets to be

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:02.220
as well-defined as you want,
but you lose the ability to

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:05.870
sort of cluster and categorize
and think about my life in

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:07.160
organized chunks.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.980
Or too constrained, where
everything gets fit into a

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.060
one-size-fits-all--

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:14.760
the equivalent of "add thing,"
which is not very useful.

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:17.880
So we want to look at the
specific requests that you

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.650
have, saying, I want a
verb that does this.

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:24.110
Because in my application, it
would be a perfect fit for.

00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:25.800
And we want to look
at a set of those.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:28.300
And this is just my gut.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:30.130
My gut is we have
nine right now.

00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:33.490
At launch, we should have
two to three times that.

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:34.230
That's my gut.

00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:37.320
Not 10, but not just
a couple more.

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.280
But I could be off by a
factor of two there.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:41.130
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:41.490
Cool.

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:42.110
Thanks, guys.

00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:46.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Thank you
Any final questions?

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:47.090
Well, OK.

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:49.740
Check out that URL if you want
to take a look at the other

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.870
sessions, either the Getting
Started or the Code Lab, which

00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:57.140
we'll be doing in a room a few
doors down tomorrow morning.

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.470
Thank you so much.

00:47:58.470 --> 00:48:01.845
