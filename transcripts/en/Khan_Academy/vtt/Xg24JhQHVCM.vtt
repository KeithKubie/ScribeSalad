00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.473
- [Voiceover] Let f of x
be equal to the square root

00:00:02.473 --> 00:00:05.644
of four x minus three,
and let c be the number

00:00:05.644 --> 00:00:08.692
that satisfies the mean
value theorem for f

00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:11.842
on the closed interval
between one and three,

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:13.526
or one is less than or equal to x

00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:15.553
is less than or equal to three.

00:00:15.553 --> 00:00:16.386
What is c?

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:20.169
So let's just remind ourselves
what it means for c to be

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:23.644
the number that satisfies
the mean value theorem for f.

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:27.171
This means that over this
interval, c is a point,

00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:30.305
x equals c is a point where
the slope of the tangent line

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:34.873
at x equals c, so I
could write f prime of c,

00:00:34.873 --> 00:00:37.357
so that is the slope of the tangent line

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:39.783
when x is equal to c, this is equal

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:42.503
to the slope of the secant line

00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:45.031
that connects these two points.

00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:47.527
So this is going to be equal to,

00:00:47.527 --> 00:00:50.773
see the slope of the
secant line that connects

00:00:50.773 --> 00:00:54.773
the points three, f of
three, and one, f of one.

00:00:56.475 --> 00:01:00.225
So it's going to be f
of three minus f of one

00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:02.981
over three minus one.

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:08.136
And if you wanted to think
about what this means visually,

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:10.230
it would look something like this.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.236
So if this is our x axis

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:13.986
and this is one, two,

00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:18.876
actually let me spread
it out a little bit more.

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:20.543
One, two, and three.

00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:26.050
And so you have one, comma,
f of one, right over there,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.800
so that is at the point
one, comma, f of one,

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:32.531
and we could evaluate that, actually,

00:01:32.531 --> 00:01:35.172
that's one, comma, one.

00:01:35.172 --> 00:01:38.847
So that's gonna be the
point one, comma, one.

00:01:38.847 --> 00:01:41.044
And then you have the point three, comma,

00:01:41.044 --> 00:01:44.139
let's see, you're gonna
have four times three is 12

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:48.306
minus three is nine, so it's
gonna be three, comma, three.

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:54.179
So maybe it's right over
there, three, comma, three,

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.663
and the curve might look
something like this,

00:01:57.663 --> 00:02:00.746
so it might look something like that,

00:02:02.045 --> 00:02:04.693
so if you think about
the slope of the line

00:02:04.693 --> 00:02:07.055
that connects these two points,

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:10.722
so this line that
connects those two points,

00:02:12.058 --> 00:02:14.199
all the mean value theorem,

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:15.972
I'm doing a different color.

00:02:15.972 --> 00:02:18.648
All the mean value
theorem tells us is that

00:02:18.648 --> 00:02:21.967
there's a point between
one and three where

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:25.238
the slope of the tangent line
has the exact same slope.

00:02:25.238 --> 00:02:26.945
So if I were to eyeball it,

00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:28.789
it looks like it's right around there,

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:31.299
although we are actually
going to solve for it.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.032
So, some point where the
slope of the tangent line

00:02:34.032 --> 00:02:36.381
is equal to the slope of the line

00:02:36.381 --> 00:02:38.614
that connects these two end points

00:02:38.614 --> 00:02:41.806
and their corresponding function values.

00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:46.180
So that is c, that would
be c right over there.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.863
So really we just have to solve this.

00:02:48.863 --> 00:02:51.828
So let's first just find
out what f prime of x is,

00:02:51.828 --> 00:02:54.590
and then we could substitute a c in there

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.553
and then we can evaluate
this on the right hand side.

00:02:57.553 --> 00:02:59.886
So I'm gonna rewrite f of x,

00:03:01.522 --> 00:03:04.624
f of x is equal to, and I'm gonna write it

00:03:04.624 --> 00:03:08.869
as four x to the minus
three to the one half power.

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:10.937
Makes it a little bit more
obvious that we can apply

00:03:10.937 --> 00:03:13.247
the power rule and the chain rule here.

00:03:13.247 --> 00:03:16.759
So f prime of x is going
to be the derivative

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.341
of four x minus three to the one half

00:03:19.341 --> 00:03:21.895
with respect to four x minus three,

00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:25.227
so that is going to be
one half times four x

00:03:25.227 --> 00:03:28.109
minus three to the negative one half,

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.910
and then we're gonna multiply that

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.906
times the derivative of four x

00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:34.112
minus three with respect to x.

00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:37.236
Well, derivative of four x
with respect to x is just four,

00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:39.718
and the derivative of negative
three with respect to x,

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:41.440
well that's just gonna be zero,

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.214
so the derivative of four x minus three

00:03:43.214 --> 00:03:45.278
with respect to x is four.

00:03:45.278 --> 00:03:46.918
So times four.

00:03:46.918 --> 00:03:48.168
so f prime of x

00:03:50.507 --> 00:03:53.174
is equal to four times one half,

00:03:55.144 --> 00:03:59.311
which is two, over the square
root of four x minus three.

00:04:01.483 --> 00:04:03.763
Four x minus three to the one half

00:04:03.763 --> 00:04:05.786
would just be the square
root of four x minus three,

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:07.319
but it's the negative one half,

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.590
so we're gonna put it in the
denominator right over here.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.759
And so f prime of c, we could rewrite this

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:16.926
as two over the square
root of four c minus three,

00:04:19.663 --> 00:04:22.438
and what is that going to be equal to?

00:04:22.438 --> 00:04:25.437
That is going to be equal to, let's see,

00:04:25.437 --> 00:04:28.512
f of three we already
figured out is three,

00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:31.495
f of one we already figured out is one,

00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:35.181
and so we get three minus
one over three minus one,

00:04:35.181 --> 00:04:38.258
well that's gonna be two over
two, which is equal to one.

00:04:38.258 --> 00:04:41.019
So there's some point
between one and three

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:43.632
where the derivative at that point,

00:04:43.632 --> 00:04:47.276
the slope of the tangent
line, is equal to one.

00:04:47.276 --> 00:04:50.332
So let's see if we can solve
this thing right over here.

00:04:50.332 --> 00:04:54.416
We can multiply both
sides of this by four c

00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:57.496
by the square root of four c minus three,

00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:59.774
and so then we are going to get

00:04:59.774 --> 00:05:03.941
two is equal to the square
root of four c minus three.

00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:08.310
All I did is multiply both sides of this

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.121
by square root of four c minus three

00:05:10.121 --> 00:05:12.072
to get rid of this in the denominator,

00:05:12.072 --> 00:05:14.075
and so let's see, now we
get rid of the radical,

00:05:14.075 --> 00:05:16.541
we can square both sides, and so

00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:18.540
actually let me just show that,

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.396
so now we can square both sides,

00:05:20.396 --> 00:05:24.229
so we get four is equal
to four c minus three,

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:30.683
add three to both sides,
seven is equal to four c,

00:05:31.636 --> 00:05:34.553
and then divide both sides by four.

00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:37.944
I'll go right here to do it,

00:05:37.944 --> 00:05:40.485
you're going to get c is
equal to seven fourths.

00:05:40.485 --> 00:05:42.985
C is equal to seven over four,

00:05:44.748 --> 00:05:47.814
which is equal to one and three fourths,

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:50.314
or we could view this as 1.75.

00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:54.695
So actually, the c value
is a little bit closer,

00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:57.859
I hand drew this, it's closer
to about right over there

00:05:57.859 --> 00:06:01.464
on our diagram, actually
that looks pretty close,

00:06:01.464 --> 00:06:03.168
that actually looks pretty good,

00:06:03.168 --> 00:06:06.222
I just hand drew this curve
so it's definitely not exact.

00:06:06.222 --> 00:06:08.499
But anyway, hopefully that gives you

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:10.683
a sense of what's going on here.

00:06:10.683 --> 00:06:12.720
We're just saying, hey,
the mean value theorem

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.720
gives us some c where the
slope of the tangent line

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.545
is the same as the slope of the line

00:06:16.545 --> 00:06:20.712
that connects one, f of
one, and three, f of three.
