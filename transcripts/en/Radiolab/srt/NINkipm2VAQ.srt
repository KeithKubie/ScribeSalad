00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,090
Hello. I'm Jad Abumrad,
and I'm Robert Krulwich.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,430
This is Radiolab and our topic today is,

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,750
do you want to say the word
stochasticity? Stochasticity t o,

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,030
which is a wonderful and fancy word that
essentially means randomness, chance,

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,740
like the kindness built into flipping a
coin or a playing the lottery or to take

6
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:23,850
things deeper when you breathe cro,

7
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:26,130
which sing about the air that's
flying around your head right now,

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,480
it's full of atoms and molecules.
They're flying about. Yeah,

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,730
smashing into each other and colliding
and shooting off in different

10
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:34,020
trajectories that can't be predict.

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,580
It's totally chaotic, right?

12
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,670
[inaudible] until you breathe it all in.

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,640
When you do things get predictable.
Okay, let me release. Nope. Nope.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,720
Okay, great. The point is,

15
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:58,721
when you breathe in all of those chaotic
flexi molecules come in and become a

16
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:03,230
part of the machinery that is
you. They go into your blood,

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,030
they go into your cells, which are
themselves. These little factories,

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,870
factories full of even tinier
factories like Mitochondria.

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,000
What our Mitochondria,
I'm not really sure,

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,910
but I do know that's Jonah
Lehrer again, himself,

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,190
a factory of inside factories full
of these intricate things which,

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,880
which working, you can understand, you
know, this gene makes this protein,

23
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:27,810
which makes this organ out, which
does this thing for the cell.

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,430
This process is Jonah of taking in lab

25
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,450
flux and

26
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,170
giving it a shape, giving it an order.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,800
That is what life does. In fact,

28
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,430
you might say it is the definition
of life. The closer you get,

29
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:52,300
the more you kind of stand in
awe. At the exquisite engineering

30
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,370
there is a sense of life is can
be the world's most elegant clock.

31
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,553
Nice.

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,630
Good. Now, if life is a machine,
you would think that the most,

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,540
the clock,

34
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,210
like most machinery part of life would
be all the way down at the bottom.

35
00:02:21,211 --> 00:02:25,230
I would think so. Which for our
purposes is when a gene makes a protein

36
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,890
gene protein gene, this
is the basis of life.

37
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,610
So you would think it's gotta be
orderly. It's gotta be predictable.

38
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,450
Otherwise none of us would be in his area.

39
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,980
Very predictable, orderly systems.

40
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:47,980
So we all have beliefs.
Pretty amazing study.

41
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,740
But then we spoke to this guy.
Am I talking? Have I been,

42
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,850
have I been talking about your art?
Yeah. Okay. And he, um, muck things up,

43
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:58,100
be looking this way, but what's
your name? My name is Carl Zimmer.

44
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,990
He's a science writer.
Like Jonah. I wrote a

45
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,210
lot for the New York Times and
scientific American and discover I blog.

46
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,930
And he told us that, uh, this whole
genes making proteins situation,

47
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,830
here we are again as tick-tock and
affairs. We've always assumed it to be.

48
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,900
In fact, scientists have
never actually seen it. Well,

49
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,400
I mean it's very small,

50
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,900
but finally scientists have figured
out a way to turn on a light when it

51
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:23,351
happens.

52
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:27,940
So they now can see a
gene turning on a protein.

53
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,530
Literally see it with
their own eyes. Yeah.

54
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,190
And what they saw well was
astonishingly on clock, like, yeah.

55
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,980
At the fundamental level,
that's this sloppy, sloppy.

56
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,610
That's the best word for it.
In fact, in our interview,

57
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,500
he used that word like 42 times
sloppy, sloppy, sloppiness,

58
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,550
sloppiness.

59
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,720
Sometimes you use this word random or
this fluctuating in this noise. Chaos,

60
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,030
noise. Definitely use that one a
lot. Trimble noise. Noisy accident.

61
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,980
Noisy noise, noise, noise,
noise, noise. Noisy.

62
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:06,540
Sloppy, chaotic noise. Sloppiness,
sloppy and fluctuating. It's,

63
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,330
it's fluctuate really crazy in there.

64
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,380
He started by telling us about this
experiment that happened in California at

65
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:16,280
cal tech involving a little
tiny bacteria called E-coli,

66
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,660
which is Carl's favorite indeed.
Yes. So these are eco lie.

67
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,500
These are harmless residents
of our gut. And they're also,

68
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,620
as you call them creatures,
they're creatures. Sure. They,

69
00:04:28,621 --> 00:04:32,130
they sense their world,
they make decisions. They,
they feed, they reproduce.

70
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,310
They have genes like us.
They've got 4,000 jeans,

71
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,800
I think their earn that title creature.

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,290
And these creatures are actually
very similar to our own sales.

73
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:41,220
Their genes make proteins just like ours.

74
00:04:41,221 --> 00:04:46,190
So what these scientists did was they
took some equal eye that were exactly the

75
00:04:46,191 --> 00:04:49,250
same clones and every single way
they're genetically identical.

76
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,060
And then they put the whole batch in
a dish and they said, okay everyone,

77
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:55,330
we're going to turn on your
genes. Start making proteins.

78
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,570
No. And they watched

79
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,480
because like you said earlier,

80
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:03,420
they had found this new way of
getting the ECO lie to glow.

81
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,220
Not every time it's jeans made of protein.

82
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,320
It seems like it ought to be like just
flicking a switch that you turn on the

83
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:17,410
genes. Click protein, protein, protein,
protein, protein, poetry. Turn it off,

84
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,670
turn it on. Protein, protein, budget,
body pony. But you turn it off.

85
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,480
Couldn't get simpler. This is like
a basic function of biology. Yeah.

86
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:27,370
This is biology one-on-one. And again,

87
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:31,030
these are genetically identical eco-line
meaning they've got the same genes,

88
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:34,120
they're making the same protein, so
they should glow the same, right?

89
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,860
You just expect the steady glove

90
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,060
[inaudible]

91
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,893
and all of them.

92
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:40,690
Mm.

93
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:45,680
Nice and steady. Then that's
not what happened. You,

94
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:48,970
you, you could start with like an
individual eco lie and say, okay,

95
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:52,450
well what happened with that
one? Um, it didn't start to glow.

96
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,760
It started to flicker.

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,890
That'd be a little bit of light.
No light, a little bit more light.

98
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,900
Then maybe a sudden flat, then dark again,

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,870
then a little bit of light. Hmm.

100
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,280
And they were expecting what
they got. At the time was

101
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,390
swoop. It was completely defective,
like a car with no muffler going.

102
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,880
More troubling still when they
looked at Ecola and number two,

103
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,740
it two was defective except
in its own unique way

104
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,200
to head his own thing going.
Same with number three.

105
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:42,000
He had his own thing going. I mean,
they're genetically identical.

106
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,500
Same in number four.

107
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,480
This is essentially the same creature
in many different copies and five,

108
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,780
six, two and seven.

109
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,740
Each one was flickering
in its own brake pattern.

110
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:00,630
Nine 10 fluctuating 11 sloppiness,

111
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,890
chaos, jumbo,

112
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,300
random Latina.

113
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,730
That stuck with me.

114
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,603
Okay.

115
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,690
Is this noise would not be a problem if
it's just bacteria we're talking about,

116
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,540
but according to Carl, it's everywhere.

117
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,260
Everywhere in us we are built.

118
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,990
He says on a foundation of chaos.

119
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,110
This is very puzzling to me because
if down at the deep level of our DNA

120
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,500
[inaudible], there's just
this random mayhem and bedlam.

121
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:53,501
How do you go from bedlam up to
the organization that I represent?

122
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,820
I wake up in the morning, I go to
sleep at night, I get hungry, I eat,

123
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,400
I breathe in, I breathe
out, listen to my heart.

124
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,250
I am very, very orderly.

125
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:13,980
I don't know how you
get from this to this.

126
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,440
That's right. I mean,

127
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:23,441
so somehow all of this sloppiness has
got to be somehow tamed because more

128
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:30,760
alive. I mean that it's not
total chaos in our bodies, but,

129
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,900
but you keep the sentence
never seems to quite finish.

130
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,770
But we don't know how that happens is
that when we have some ideas of how it

131
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:37,800
happens, I mean as,

132
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:42,440
as scientists start to understand
how genes work with other genes,

133
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,310
they can see ways in which
you can, you can, um,

134
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,840
filter out the noise and
keep, keep the good signal,

135
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,930
keep the music. Okay.

136
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:57,300
Set anywhere really. No.

137
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,780
Now this I find really cool. The
research on this stuff is really new,

138
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:05,700
but Carl says one of the ways that the
body may do this testing to Lou Lou may

139
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:10,701
go from like check to is
by doing something that I
actually do on the show all

140
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:15,030
the time, which is use a noise filter.

141
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,220
The body may have engineered
its own noise filters.

142
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,740
I'll just give you an
example from my world,

143
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:23,410
and this is the honest to God's truth.
I have a friend named little elite. Hey,

144
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,710
literally, hello dead.

145
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,330
Tell me what you're holding in
your hands there in my hands.

146
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:30,480
I have two audio tapes. Thing just
recently called me up. She said,

147
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:32,460
I've got these two cassette
tapes. They're really old.

148
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,940
I think they were made in the 70s my mom
found them in her attic and they're of

149
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:39,420
my grandmother, ones labeled
Mima singing, singing,

150
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,320
[inaudible] singing old slave songs
and old hymns and the little rings,

151
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:50,490
grandmother died last year.
She was 99 years old. Wow.

152
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,730
And they were really close. Very close.

153
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,540
They used to call me little Mima when
I was a kid. So she's got these tapes,

154
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,291
she wants to hear them.

155
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,300
The problem is that you put it
on for more than three minutes,

156
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,470
you get annoyed and there's
that weird like it's too noisy.

157
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,500
Yeah. She wants to know if I could do
something about it. Yeah. So real quick,

158
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,730
here's what I did. I'd put it into
a computer, launched the DQ program,

159
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:16,970
found the base noisiness,
which was around 600 hertz.

160
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,700
Dial that down like so.

161
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,050
Then I found the high
street around 2000 Hertz.

162
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:27,980
Dial that down. Yeah. Now as a final step,

163
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:31,550
I just kind of located the voice around
a thousand hertz and dialed it up.

164
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,340
[inaudible]

165
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,020
okay, so it's not a
flawless process. I mean,

166
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:40,640
now she sounds like she's
coming out of a well,

167
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:45,020
but for the first time you can
hear her voice. I don't know.

168
00:10:45,021 --> 00:10:47,120
This is the first time
I'm hearing this song,

169
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,860
but it seems like she's describing the
night that my grandfather passed away

170
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,010
talking about the doctors telling her
that my grandfather's passed and then

171
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:06,551
she's describing putting a fern in his
hand and she said it should be a rose

172
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,473
[inaudible]

173
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,900
[inaudible] eh,

174
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,880
uh,

175
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,880
the thing that's applicable here is that
we started with this and then just by

176
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,470
bringing certain frequencies down and
others up [inaudible] we ended up with

177
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:25,304
this.

178
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,580
This might be how it is in the body that
you've got this noise all the way on

179
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,310
the bottom, these genetic circles,
which we're spitting out messiness,

180
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:38,630
but somehow just on top of that,

181
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,910
or other genetic circuits
which are cleaning it all
up, giving it a share. Wait,

182
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:48,020
what is that now, right? Not Quite David

183
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,070
Science. What's wrong with
it? Well, in there is no

184
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,720
grandma. What do you
mean there's no grandma.

185
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,960
You don't start off with some very
clear signal that gets masked by noise.

186
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,680
The noise is there from
the start, Huh? It's noise.

187
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,490
And then all of a sudden you
have this beautiful song.

188
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,550
Carl went on to explain it. It took me
like an hour for us to finally get this.

189
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,270
It's not,

190
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,750
there's nothing but noise down there at
the bottom and yet somehow out of that

191
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:19,960
noise, the song emerges like a phantom.

192
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:23,390
It's almost as if the noise
is somehow filtering itself.

193
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,060
So if to be able to get the analogy right,

194
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,740
little wing would hand jad a
tape with just fragmented sound.

195
00:12:30,741 --> 00:12:33,740
Little bits of me, little bits of
me, mine, all kinds of random ways.

196
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:38,700
Maybe she gave you eight or nine tapes
[inaudible] and somehow he says it all

197
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:42,360
starts to kind of get into a network
where this one filters that one and that

198
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,450
one filters to the other one and the
other one filters that ninth one.

199
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,540
And out of all of that
comes grandma comes a song,

200
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,210
the song of a living
regular organism. Literally.

201
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,970
I mean grandmas are made from chaos.

202
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,750
I love that you say like, it's
almost like it seems like a miracle.

203
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,830
Think it stands up and walks.
But see the thing is you've hit,

204
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,800
I mean we are talking about something
that scientists don't understand yet.

205
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,460
Yeah. So I don't have it. So there's not,

206
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,660
if you want to have a part
of this show where you say,

207
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:24,100
and this people is how it
all works, can't do that. No,

208
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,630
but here's the thing. If you want to
get fruity about this, you could say,

209
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,650
and I put this to Carl,

210
00:13:29,651 --> 00:13:33,490
that if all the way down at the
bottom of us there is this a fuzz,

211
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,550
it cannot be predicted then in
some sense we can never be known.

212
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:44,470
And if we can ever be known, then we're
free to be whatever we want. Hmm. Well,

213
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,690
no, I mean look,

214
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,130
I can sit here and concentrate and I
can think any thought I want to right

215
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,460
now, any thought. Sure.

216
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,140
But you can't think about a poem
from second century China. True.

217
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,170
Could you make an equivalence between
loose mechanics and sense of freedom?

218
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:08,120
Um, is, you know, I mean, does the,

219
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,130
the sloppiness and the floppiness of of
a protein clamping onto your DNA scale

220
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:19,330
up to what you're going to be when
you grow up on Radiolab? Yes. Okay.

221
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,040
All right. Well, here we are. No,

222
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:28,060
you can see it's an example of JC stone,

223
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,160
Non Rube DDT predictability is called

224
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,220
