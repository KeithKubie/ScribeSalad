00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:05.371
Gloria Steinem,

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:07.573
one of the leading lights
of modern feminism.

00:00:07.606 --> 00:00:10.476
You will surely go down
in the annals of history

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:13.146
just as surely
as Lisa Lampanelli will go down

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.314
in the locker room
of the Houston Rockets.

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:18.117
(LAUGHTER)

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.054
Hey, BoJack,
are you a Zoe or a Zelda?

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:22.522
Don't know what that means.

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.690
-Well, I was talking to Wayne.
-Who's Wayne?

00:00:24.723 --> 00:00:27.226
-I'm Wayne.
-Wayne's writing an article
about me for<i> BuzzFeed</i> .

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.229
Fun fact:
Wayne is also my ex-boyfriend.

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:31.597
Ha! You're funny.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.232
MR. PEANUTBUTTER:
Pretty cool, eh, BoJack?

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:34.834
Diane's writing a book
about you,

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.736
Wayne's writing
an article about me.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.204
We're the same!

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:39.772
How could you think that
that's the same?

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.607
My book will be in libraries
for hundreds of years.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.509
Your<i> BuzzFeed</i> article
will be crammed

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.812
between an animated GIF of a cat
falling asleep

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.814
and a list of fun facts
about<i> Legally Blonde.</i>

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.850
-Ha! Classic Zoe.
-I still don't know
what that means.

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:52.819
Well, are you familiar
with<i> Mr. Peanutbutter's House?</i>

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:55.088
Do you mean his sitcom

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.757
that coincidentally
had the exact same premise
as my sitcom?

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.093
Not the exact same.

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:03.296
<i> Mr. Peanutbutter's House</i>
featured a pair of twins,
Zoe and Zelda.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.399
<i> Zelda was the sunny,
 fun-loving extrovert.</i>

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.367
Look at my pumpkin,
Mr. Peanutbutter.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.636
-Pretty smile, Zelly-belly.
-AUDIENCE: Aww...

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:13.339
<i> Whereas Zoe was the smart,
 cynical introvert.</i>

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:15.441
My pumpkin's throwing up

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.643
because Halloween encourages
excessive consumption
of refined sugar

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:20.713
at a time
when obesity rates are sky high.

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:24.383
Plus, Halloween costumes
are a gateway to casual racism.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.486
Why don't I keep the knife,
Zo-bo?

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.255
<i> -♪Who's that dog? ♪
 -♪Mr. Peanutbutter ♪</i>

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:31.390
<i> ♪Knick-knack, paddywhack
 Give a dog a bone ♪</i>

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.426
<i> Now, was the show's acting
 ham-fisted</i>

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.660
<i> and the writing moronic?</i>

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:37.130
-No?
-Yes,

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:39.599
but the Zoe/Zelda paradigm
rang true.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:42.235
I believe everyone's
either a Zoe or a Zelda.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:46.305
For example, Nixon was a Zoe
and Kennedy, a Zelda.

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:49.842
It's R2-D2 and C-3PO,
Zooey and Emily Deschanel.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.310
So Zooey's a Zoe?

00:01:51.343 --> 00:01:54.180
No, Zooey's a Zelda.
Emily's the Zoe.

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:55.515
What a crazy world.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:56.916
So which one are you, BoJack?

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:59.318
I think I'm... above this.

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:00.351
Said the Zoe.
