This episode of Dnews was proudly made possible
by the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.839
It’s not just a sedan, it’s a Subaru.

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.559
If you’re unhappy at work, but not quite
ready to quit your job just yet - then science

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.910
has offered up an easy solution.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.400
Adopt a plant!

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:24.380
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you
work in an office with a bunch of people - then

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.280
you know just how important maintaining your
personal space is, to your sanity.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.599
But what you might not know, is that plants
- can have a very real impact on your emotional

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:33.599
state of mind.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:37.960
A new study from the University of Queensland,
finds that an office enriched with plants,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.160
doesn’t just make employees happier - it
actually boosts productivity by 15%.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.710
This is the first study to look at the long-term
effects that plants can have on the quality

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.890
of professional life.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.190
But it’s timely, considering a lot of companies
are now starting to adopt the idea of “lean

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.820
office management,” where they strip the
office of any extraneous decorations, to reduce

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.809
distractions and so they can accommodate more
people as needed.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.729
Most studies up until now, have concluded
that a lean office environment - is a more

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:04.729
productive one.

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.010
But according to this study, that may not
be entirely true.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.710
Researchers looked at employees from 2 large
commercial offices in the UK and the Netherlands,

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.250
and monitored their productivity levels over
a 2-month period, during which time plants

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.460
were introduced into their workplace.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.440
Employees were also surveyed on their concentration
levels, workplace satisfaction, and their

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.790
perceptions of air quality within their office.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.360
Turns out, employees from previously “lean”
office environments, became more satisfied

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.860
with their workplace, reported increased concentration
levels, and perceived the air quality in their

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.360
offices to be better, once plants were introduced.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.660
And the improved quality of life, led to a
more effective workplace.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.380
According to the author of the study, adorning
your office with plants - helps employees

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.260
be more physically, mentally, and emotionally
involved in their work.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.600
And he believes the reason for that, is that
it communicates to workers that their employer

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.930
cares about them, and their welfare.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.920
So there you have it - if your employees hate
you, just buy them a few plants.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.330
Or maybe stop having such a terrible workplace.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.330
What do you guys think?

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.830
I definitely think having plants in my HOME
makes me a happier person, but what about

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.830
the office?

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.709
Let us know your thoughts in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.780
watching.
