NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I don't
want to add too much to the day,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.990
to Pavni's wise words, to
the amazing fireside chat

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.010
that we had.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.720
But I didn't want
to say thank you.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.400
So as we mentioned
before, Women Techmakers,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.920
we provide
visibility, community,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.520
and resources for
Women in Technology,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.290
and that's really to drive
innovation and participation

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.410
in the field of technology.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.350
And some of you might have
a technical background.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.110
I don't.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.760
I'm a history major.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.150
But I'm on a path to just
understanding all the ways

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.340
that I can participate
in this industry.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.580
I actually think that if I were
to pursue a new line of work,

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.110
I think I'd want
to be a designer.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.585
And so I'm really excited
that there were so many of you

00:00:48.585 --> 00:00:51.310
in here that participated
in the design sprint.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.110
And I popped over
to the code lab

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.340
that was being led
by Wayne and team,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.900
and that seemed really awesome.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.240
I'm already retweeting and
favoriting a lot of the watch

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.810
faces that you've developed.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.960
So I'm just really thankful
and excited that you showed up,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.220
and I say that because
you create a party,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.730
and then you still worry if
people will come, so thank you.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.230
And so I want to just take
this moment to say some of you

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.420
were here last year,
and we took a lot

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.480
of your feedback to make
the event even better

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.500
for this year.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.250
When it comes to
next year's event,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.970
we want to hear your feedback.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.590
So please, share
your ideas with us.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.500
You can email me directly.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.460
I'm just
women-techmakers@google.com.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.970
I answer all the emails.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.650
And we have our Twitter handle
that we launched this week

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.570
that's @WomenTechmakers.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.990
And share your thoughts, your
ideas, your inspirations,

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.500
your favorite photos
with our hashtag.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.510
And again, let's have
a round of applause

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.500
for all of our
instructors, TAs, speakers.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.440
They're amazing.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.750
The volunteers that created
this event-- there are many.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.210
And I know that we're all
sitting here in Mountain View,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.270
and we're thinking, oh,
there's about 300 of us.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.240
And are we it?

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.940
Is this it?

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.090
And no.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.140
So we actually have
13 global summits

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.190
that are happening in
the month of March.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.040
Singapore happened
a couple days ago,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.530
and then we had Mexico City.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.050
Today was also New York.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.720
And then as you're seeing
in the tent social feed,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.930
we also have many events.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.340
We recognize we don't have
Google offices everywhere,

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.170
so we have some hyperlocal
events, about 100 of them,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.360
that are happening around
the world from mainland China

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.450
to Africa to Latin
America to Canada

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.060
to Russia-- like,
everywhere, right?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.574
So when you're looking
at the social media feed,

00:02:45.574 --> 00:02:47.740
you're going to see so many
voices around the world.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.720
And we did that
intentionally to let you

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.340
know that you are a part
of a global movement.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.050
You're not alone
in those moments

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.590
when you're being self critical.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.360
You literally have a community
of tens of thousands,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.230
if not hundreds of thousands
of people, to help you,

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.350
to support you, to cheer you on.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.940
And this whole team and all
the speakers and instructors

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.990
are on that team to support you.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.550
So with that, I
want to invite us

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.030
all to our outdoor reception.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.430
Pavni is going to be around,
as well as all of us.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.070
If you have questions or
ideas, please let us know.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.400
And thank you, and
come back next year.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.950
[APPLAUSE]
