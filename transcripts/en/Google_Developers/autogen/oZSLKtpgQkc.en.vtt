going to talk about the glass platform

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840
going to talk about the glass platform
 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.049
going to talk about the glass platform
and talk about the components the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
and talk about the components the

building blocks of glassware we're gonna

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
building blocks of glassware we're gonna
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.880
building blocks of glassware we're gonna
spend a little bit of time asking the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
spend a little bit of time asking the
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.190
spend a little bit of time asking the
question what is the GDK but it's not

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
question what is the GDK but it's not
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.080
question what is the GDK but it's not
that existential it's very clear and

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090
that existential it's very clear and
 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.210
that existential it's very clear and
straightforward and then we're gonna

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
straightforward and then we're gonna
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.400
straightforward and then we're gonna
look at some development paradigms or

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410
look at some development paradigms or
 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.210
look at some development paradigms or
patterns for glass so it sound like fun

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220
patterns for glass so it sound like fun
 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.699
patterns for glass so it sound like fun
alright so let's jump into it first off

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:19.709
alright so let's jump into it first off
 

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:21.859
alright so let's jump into it first off
I wanted to say note about glass and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869
I wanted to say note about glass and
 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.949
I wanted to say note about glass and
glass is this really cool thing as we

00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:24.959
glass is this really cool thing as we
 

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.809
glass is this really cool thing as we
all know in this room that gives us

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819
all know in this room that gives us
 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.669
all know in this room that gives us
access to the technology that we love

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679
access to the technology that we love
 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.580
access to the technology that we love
without getting in the way and that's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
without getting in the way and that's
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.880
without getting in the way and that's
very cool but what's even cooler is that

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
very cool but what's even cooler is that
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.249
very cool but what's even cooler is that
it's a way to build services for users

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259
it's a way to build services for users
 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.449
it's a way to build services for users
that they can use in a natural and

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:40.459
that they can use in a natural and
 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.029
that they can use in a natural and
everyday way in their lives and we knew

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039
everyday way in their lives and we knew
 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.139
everyday way in their lives and we knew
this was awesome when we started

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
this was awesome when we started
 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.969
this was awesome when we started
building the hardware and software at

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
building the hardware and software at
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.889
building the hardware and software at
Google we knew it was going to be even

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
Google we knew it was going to be even
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.290
Google we knew it was going to be even
cooler when you built the things that we

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300
cooler when you built the things that we
 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.550
cooler when you built the things that we
knew you were gonna build on this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
knew you were gonna build on this
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.609
knew you were gonna build on this
platform but even more exciting is the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
platform but even more exciting is the
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.169
platform but even more exciting is the
stuff that we couldn't even have

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179
stuff that we couldn't even have
 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.729
stuff that we couldn't even have
imagined that you've started to build

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:58.739
imagined that you've started to build
 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:00.650
imagined that you've started to build
and you're yet to build now that you

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660
and you're yet to build now that you
 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.710
and you're yet to build now that you
have access the GDK that really reaches

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720
have access the GDK that really reaches
 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.749
have access the GDK that really reaches
these users in their everyday lives in a

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
these users in their everyday lives in a
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.460
these users in their everyday lives in a
way you could never do before glass was

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470
way you could never do before glass was
 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.919
way you could never do before glass was
available and that's the glass platform

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929
available and that's the glass platform
 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.050
available and that's the glass platform
you've been building on it using the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060
you've been building on it using the
 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.860
you've been building on it using the

we knew we needed to give you more and
 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.289
we knew we needed to give you more and
that's why we built the GDK and we

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299
that's why we built the GDK and we
 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.449
that's why we built the GDK and we
talked about this at Google i/o this

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459
talked about this at Google i/o this
 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.479
talked about this at Google i/o this
last Google i/o and we've been building

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489
last Google i/o and we've been building
 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.550
last Google i/o and we've been building
it since and we're going to tell you all

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560
it since and we're going to tell you all
 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.649
it since and we're going to tell you all
the details about it today there are

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659
the details about it today there are
 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.319
the details about it today there are
three major things here that you can do

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329
three major things here that you can do
 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.330
three major things here that you can do
on glass now that you couldn't do before

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340
on glass now that you couldn't do before
 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.679
on glass now that you couldn't do before
the first one is offline you can now

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:17.689
the first one is offline you can now
 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.830
the first one is offline you can now
build code that runs on glass so the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840
build code that runs on glass so the
 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.449
build code that runs on glass so the
user can use it whether or not they're

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459
user can use it whether or not they're
 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.869
user can use it whether or not they're
connected to the Internet and you can

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879
connected to the Internet and you can
 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.229
connected to the Internet and you can
also get real-time immediate user

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239
also get real-time immediate user
 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.670
also get real-time immediate user
response all right so this is a

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680
response all right so this is a
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.170
response all right so this is a
glassware that's installed on glass and

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180
glassware that's installed on glass and
 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.849
glassware that's installed on glass and
the user can interact with and there

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859
the user can interact with and there
 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.349
the user can interact with and there
doesn't need to do a round-trip to your

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359
doesn't need to do a round-trip to your
 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:39.849
doesn't need to do a round-trip to your
service in the cloud to be able to

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859
service in the cloud to be able to
 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.399
service in the cloud to be able to
respond to a user request and then

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409
respond to a user request and then
 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.699
respond to a user request and then
finally deeper access to hardware such

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709
finally deeper access to hardware such
 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.460
finally deeper access to hardware such
as the accelerometer and the GPS now

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470
as the accelerometer and the GPS now
 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.390
as the accelerometer and the GPS now
these three things are cool trust me

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400
these three things are cool trust me
 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.439
these three things are cool trust me
they're very cool we're gonna get into

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449
they're very cool we're gonna get into
 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:58.030
they're very cool we're gonna get into
detail about how these are implemented

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040
detail about how these are implemented
 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.800
detail about how these are implemented
at the GDK but before we get there I

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810
at the GDK but before we get there I
 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.809
at the GDK but before we get there I
want to show you so we do a demo right

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819
want to show you so we do a demo right
 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:11.229
want to show you so we do a demo right
away okay so this is word lens on glass

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239
away okay so this is word lens on glass
 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.009
away okay so this is word lens on glass
and I don't know if you've had this

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019
and I don't know if you've had this
 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.240
and I don't know if you've had this
happen to you but I've had it quite a

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250
happen to you but I've had it quite a
 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.029
happen to you but I've had it quite a
few times where I'm in a foreign country

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039
few times where I'm in a foreign country
 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.499
few times where I'm in a foreign country
and there's a sign like this and it's

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:20.509
and there's a sign like this and it's
 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.420
and there's a sign like this and it's
like that guy looks like he's having so

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430
like that guy looks like he's having so
 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.510
like that guy looks like he's having so
much fun I want to do that but maybe I

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520
much fun I want to do that but maybe I
 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.300
much fun I want to do that but maybe I
should read the sign first you think and

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310
should read the sign first you think and
 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.529
should read the sign first you think and
so typically what I'll do is I'll have

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:29.539
so typically what I'll do is I'll have
 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:31.120
so typically what I'll do is I'll have
like a travel book right and I'll flip

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130
like a travel book right and I'll flip
 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.409
like a travel book right and I'll flip
through and try and translate or if I

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419
through and try and translate or if I
 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.600
through and try and translate or if I
happen to have a sim in my phone for

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610
happen to have a sim in my phone for
 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.050
happen to have a sim in my phone for
that country

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060
that country
 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.120
that country
bring up you know Google Translate and

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130
bring up you know Google Translate and
 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.409
bring up you know Google Translate and
I'm trying to enter in the foreign

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419
I'm trying to enter in the foreign
 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.420
I'm trying to enter in the foreign
characters but on glasses you'll see

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430
characters but on glasses you'll see
 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.460
characters but on glasses you'll see
it's a way cooler experience okay glass

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470
it's a way cooler experience okay glass
 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.940
it's a way cooler experience okay glass
translate this I'm just going to look at

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950
translate this I'm just going to look at
 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:54.159
translate this I'm just going to look at
the sign and through glass I'm gonna see

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169
the sign and through glass I'm gonna see
 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.800
the sign and through glass I'm gonna see
the translation which is pretty cool on

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810
the translation which is pretty cool on
 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.250

glassware and these are our glassware
 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:15.820
glassware and these are our glassware
components and there's sort of three

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830
components and there's sort of three
 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.550
components and there's sort of three
areas that I'd like to talk about first

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560
areas that I'd like to talk about first
 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.420
areas that I'd like to talk about first
are types

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430
are types
 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.279
are types
what kind of glassware that you might

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.289
what kind of glassware that you might
 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.980
what kind of glassware that you might
want to build in vacation and this is

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.000
want to build in vacation and this is
how you start the glassware

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010
how you start the glassware
 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.719
how you start the glassware
and elements sort of the primary UI

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729

you've already been doing with the
 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.780
you've already been doing with the
cloud-based API and a gtk+ mirror you

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:55.790
cloud-based API and a gtk+ mirror you
 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.550
cloud-based API and a gtk+ mirror you
can in fact use both of these in a dance

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560
can in fact use both of these in a dance
 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.740

menu this is a top-level voice menu that
 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.020
menu this is a top-level voice menu that
can trigger your glassware either via

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.030
can trigger your glassware either via
 

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.400
can trigger your glassware either via
the mirror API or the GDK menu item on a

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.410
the mirror API or the GDK menu item on a
 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.300
the mirror API or the GDK menu item on a
timeline card so you can interact with a

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.310
timeline card so you can interact with a
 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.480
timeline card so you can interact with a
glassware and even start up a GDK

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:22.490
glassware and even start up a GDK
 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.430

themselves which are inserted from the
 

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.710
themselves which are inserted from the
mirror API and then there's these

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720
mirror API and then there's these
 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.390
mirror API and then there's these
elements and let's actually dive deeper

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400
elements and let's actually dive deeper
 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.570
elements and let's actually dive deeper
into these elements this is kind of what

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:37.580
into these elements this is kind of what
 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.420
into these elements this is kind of what
they look like the first one live card

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:40.430
they look like the first one live card
 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:41.920
they look like the first one live card
so something that you couldn't do on

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:41.930
so something that you couldn't do on
 

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:43.480
so something that you couldn't do on
glass with a mirror API but you can now

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.490
glass with a mirror API but you can now
 

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.050
glass with a mirror API but you can now
do with the GDK now this is something

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:47.060
do with the GDK now this is something
 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.390
do with the GDK now this is something
that gives developers the ability to

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:49.400
that gives developers the ability to
 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.420
that gives developers the ability to
draw directly into the glass timeline in

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:52.430
draw directly into the glass timeline in
 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.810
draw directly into the glass timeline in
real time and the reason I chose that

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.820
real time and the reason I chose that
 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.640
real time and the reason I chose that
particular example is that this is a

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:57.650
particular example is that this is a
 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.380
particular example is that this is a
stopwatch running on glass with

00:07:59.380 --> 00:07:59.390
stopwatch running on glass with
 

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.290
stopwatch running on glass with
millisecond updates on glass so you can

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:02.300
millisecond updates on glass so you can
 

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.240
millisecond updates on glass so you can
actually see that stopwatch count up and

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.250
actually see that stopwatch count up and
 

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.580
actually see that stopwatch count up and
you can scroll through glass to other

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:06.590
you can scroll through glass to other
 

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.080
you can scroll through glass to other
parts your timelines scroll back and

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.090
parts your timelines scroll back and
 

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.770
parts your timelines scroll back and
that card is still updating static cards

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:11.780
that card is still updating static cards
 

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.910
that card is still updating static cards
which you already know from the mirror

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:12.920
which you already know from the mirror
 

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.160
which you already know from the mirror
API this is a moment in time that you

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:15.170
API this is a moment in time that you
 

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.500
API this is a moment in time that you
inserts in the users lost timeline as a

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:17.510
inserts in the users lost timeline as a
 

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.300
inserts in the users lost timeline as a
timestamp and they can interact with

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:19.310
timestamp and they can interact with
 

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.150
timestamp and they can interact with
that card via the menu items immersions

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160
that card via the menu items immersions
 

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.640
that card via the menu items immersions
this is another new thing with the GDK

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:24.650
this is another new thing with the GDK
 

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:27.460
this is another new thing with the GDK
today this is a focused user experience

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:27.470
today this is a focused user experience
 

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.990
today this is a focused user experience

where the rest of the the glassy works
 

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.670
where the rest of the the glassy works
kind of fades away and they're focused

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:30.680

those are our building blocks and I'm

00:10:23.319 --> 00:10:23.329
those are our building blocks and I'm
 

00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:25.810
those are our building blocks and I'm
going to describe each of these a little

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:25.820
going to describe each of these a little
 

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.910
going to describe each of these a little
bit more later when we get into the

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920
bit more later when we get into the
 

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.610
bit more later when we get into the
demos more demos but first let's take a

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:30.620
demos more demos but first let's take a
 

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.069
demos more demos but first let's take a
step back and say well what is this GDK

00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079
step back and say well what is this GDK
 

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:37.660
step back and say well what is this GDK
thing the GDK is super straightforward

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:37.670
thing the GDK is super straightforward
 

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.380
thing the GDK is super straightforward
and simple we worked really hard to make

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:41.390
and simple we worked really hard to make
 

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.050
and simple we worked really hard to make
sure that if you're an Android developer

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:43.060
sure that if you're an Android developer
 

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.250
sure that if you're an Android developer
developing for glass would feel natural

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:45.260
developing for glass would feel natural
 

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.960
developing for glass would feel natural
it uses the same paradigms that you're

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:46.970
it uses the same paradigms that you're
 

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.210
it uses the same paradigms that you're
already used to so we built the GDK with

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:49.220
already used to so we built the GDK with
 

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.850
already used to so we built the GDK with
standard Android ap is compiled for

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:51.860
standard Android ap is compiled for
 

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.130
standard Android ap is compiled for
glass so that when you use those Android

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:54.140
glass so that when you use those Android
 

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.380
glass so that when you use those Android
ap eyes on glass it gives you the

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:56.390
ap eyes on glass it gives you the
 

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.259
ap eyes on glass it gives you the
experience that it should on glass and

00:10:59.259 --> 00:10:59.269
experience that it should on glass and
 

00:10:59.269 --> 00:11:01.240
experience that it should on glass and
I'll describe some of those in detail in

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:01.250
I'll describe some of those in detail in
 

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:02.400
I'll describe some of those in detail in
a moment

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:02.410
a moment
 

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:05.290
a moment
for features specific to glass we have a

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:05.300
for features specific to glass we have a
 

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.269
for features specific to glass we have a
simple add-on that you add into your

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279
simple add-on that you add into your
 

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.910
simple add-on that you add into your
already standard Android development

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920

gives you access to those specific

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:13.080
gives you access to those specific
 

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.190
gives you access to those specific
features things like the live card or

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200
features things like the live card or
 

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:21.110

the voice invocation commands all right

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120
the voice invocation commands all right
 

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.790
the voice invocation commands all right
so let's look at both those less in a

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800
so let's look at both those less in a
 

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.230
so let's look at both those less in a
bit more detail the platform features

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240
bit more detail the platform features
 

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.170
bit more detail the platform features
are things like the location provider

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:29.180
are things like the location provider
 

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.970
are things like the location provider
now those of you that have experienced

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980
now those of you that have experienced
 

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.650
now those of you that have experienced
directions on glass you know that you

and if I let's say if I tap you can see

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440
and if I let's say if I tap you can see
 

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.080
and if I let's say if I tap you can see
that I can go through my segment history

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.090
that I can go through my segment history
 

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.880

those of you who use straw every day you

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:43.890
those of you who use straw every day you
 

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.920
those of you who use straw every day you
know they have these cool segments and

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:45.930
know they have these cool segments and
 

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.990
know they have these cool segments and
one of the things that I like to do is

00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000
one of the things that I like to do is
 

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.970
one of the things that I like to do is
if I know where the segment is I ride

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:49.980
if I know where the segment is I ride
 

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.860
if I know where the segment is I ride
faster because that's the thing this

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:51.870
faster because that's the thing this
 

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:52.670
faster because that's the thing this
gets recorded

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:52.680

travel on glass it tells me as I just

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:02.280
travel on glass it tells me as I just
 

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:04.070
travel on glass it tells me as I just
start the segment about halfway through

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080
start the segment about halfway through
 

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.110
start the segment about halfway through
and near the end as well so that I'm

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120
and near the end as well so that I'm
 

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:08.090
and near the end as well so that I'm
really charging as fast as I can so I

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:08.100
really charging as fast as I can so I
 

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:09.890
really charging as fast as I can so I
can get that good time and then as I

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900
can get that good time and then as I
 

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.440
can get that good time and then as I
passed through the segments it will load

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:12.450

you the demo I want to now look at the
 

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.810
you the demo I want to now look at the
flow just on a static page here and

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820
flow just on a static page here and
 

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.820
flow just on a static page here and
describe some of the platform features

and the location provider so they're
 

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.890
and the location provider so they're
accessing GPS all throughout my game to

the location provider okay so let's talk

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:19.590
the location provider okay so let's talk
 

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.350
the location provider okay so let's talk
about this next pattern which is

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360
about this next pattern which is
 

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.840
about this next pattern which is
immersion alright and this is this is

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:23.850
immersion alright and this is this is
 

00:23:23.850 --> 00:23:25.640
immersion alright and this is this is
really new for glass it's when the user

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:25.650
really new for glass it's when the user
 

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:28.430
really new for glass it's when the user
wants to have a focused task in front of

them where the rest of the UI kind of

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:30.270
them where the rest of the UI kind of
 

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.230
them where the rest of the UI kind of
fades away and a great example of this

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240
fades away and a great example of this
 

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.110

very glass like alright so let's look at

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080
very glass like alright so let's look at
 

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.670
very glass like alright so let's look at
some of the tools from the GDK that who

translated and through glass I see it

00:26:52.629 --> 00:26:52.639
translated and through glass I see it
 

00:26:52.639 --> 00:26:56.730
translated and through glass I see it
translated into my natural language and
