so I think what's really fascinating is

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080
so I think what's really fascinating is
 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.780
so I think what's really fascinating is
that there have been a number of recent

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
that there have been a number of recent
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.420
that there have been a number of recent
studies looking at brain structural

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.430
studies looking at brain structural
 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.100

differences between liberals and

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110
differences between liberals and
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.580
differences between liberals and
conservatives and what's been found in

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
conservatives and what's been found in
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.670
conservatives and what's been found in
several studies is that liberals tend to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
several studies is that liberals tend to
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.140
several studies is that liberals tend to
have a larger anterior cingulate gyrus

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150
have a larger anterior cingulate gyrus
 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.390
have a larger anterior cingulate gyrus
that is an area that is responsible for

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
that is an area that is responsible for
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.109
that is an area that is responsible for
taking in new information and that

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119
taking in new information and that
 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.489
taking in new information and that
impact of the new information on

decision-making or choices conservatives
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.360
decision-making or choices conservatives
tended on the whole to have a larger

informational information specifically

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670
informational information specifically
 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.549
informational information specifically
fear-based information so the it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559
fear-based information so the it's
 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.349
fear-based information so the it's
really responsible for the flight or

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359
really responsible for the flight or
 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.729
really responsible for the flight or
fright response and this isn't everybody

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739
fright response and this isn't everybody
 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.830

it's not black and white and of course

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
it's not black and white and of course
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.419
it's not black and white and of course
then you know what about all of the

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429
then you know what about all of the
 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.209
then you know what about all of the
people in the middle but basically the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219
people in the middle but basically the
 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.400
people in the middle but basically the
studies showed that if you just based it

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410
studies showed that if you just based it
 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.030
studies showed that if you just based it
on brain structural size difference you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040
on brain structural size difference you
 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.200
on brain structural size difference you
could predict who would be a

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
could predict who would be a
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.240
could predict who would be a
conservative and who would be a liberal

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
conservative and who would be a liberal
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.540

percent is a pretty high ability to
 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.190
percent is a pretty high ability to
predict who is a conservative and who is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
predict who is a conservative and who is
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530
predict who is a conservative and who is
a liberal just from brain structure when

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
a liberal just from brain structure when
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.950
a liberal just from brain structure when
you look at what your parents were in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960
you look at what your parents were in
 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.160
you look at what your parents were in
terms of predicting what you might be in

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
terms of predicting what you might be in
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.950
terms of predicting what you might be in
terms of conservative versus liberal

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960
terms of conservative versus liberal
 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.200
terms of conservative versus liberal
that enabled you to predict in studies

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210
that enabled you to predict in studies
 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.470
that enabled you to predict in studies
at a rate of 69 point five percent so

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480
at a rate of 69 point five percent so
 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.440
at a rate of 69 point five percent so
very close not quite as good and why is

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450
very close not quite as good and why is
 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.020
very close not quite as good and why is
that interesting it's because the brain

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
that interesting it's because the brain
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.040
that interesting it's because the brain
is plastic so the question as to whether

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050
is plastic so the question as to whether
 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.020
is plastic so the question as to whether
you have a brain structure to start with

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
you have a brain structure to start with
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.210
you have a brain structure to start with
that informs whether you will be a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
that informs whether you will be a
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.960
that informs whether you will be a
liberal or conservative or whether the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970
liberal or conservative or whether the
 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.560
liberal or conservative or whether the
formation of certain thoughts from your

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570
formation of certain thoughts from your
 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.920
formation of certain thoughts from your
parents for example shapes your brain

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
parents for example shapes your brain
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.300
parents for example shapes your brain
structure because the brain is plastic

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310
structure because the brain is plastic
 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.990

and ever-changing particularly in youth
 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.390
and ever-changing particularly in youth
so does thinking certain thoughts or

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400
so does thinking certain thoughts or
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.119
so does thinking certain thoughts or
predominantly let's say utilizing your

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129
predominantly let's say utilizing your
 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:16.280
predominantly let's say utilizing your
right amygdala versus your anterior

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
right amygdala versus your anterior
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.809
right amygdala versus your anterior
cingulate gyrus in four

cingulate gyrus in four
 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.059
cingulate gyrus in four
the growth of those areas and therefore

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069
the growth of those areas and therefore
 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.420
the growth of those areas and therefore
help you predict later who is liberal

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430
help you predict later who is liberal
 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.720
help you predict later who is liberal
and who is conservative so in terms of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730
and who is conservative so in terms of
 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.110
and who is conservative so in terms of
interpreting the meaning of different

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120
interpreting the meaning of different
 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.449
interpreting the meaning of different
size structures for a liberal versus a

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459
size structures for a liberal versus a
 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.520
size structures for a liberal versus a
conservative I think you have to look at

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530
conservative I think you have to look at
 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.589
conservative I think you have to look at
what that area is predominantly

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599
what that area is predominantly
 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.710
what that area is predominantly
responsible for so for instance for

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
responsible for so for instance for
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.240
responsible for so for instance for
conservatives if your right amygdala is

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250
conservatives if your right amygdala is
 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.309
conservatives if your right amygdala is
enlarged and that's the fear processing

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319
enlarged and that's the fear processing
 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.509
enlarged and that's the fear processing
area you would expect maybe choices or

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519
area you would expect maybe choices or
 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.309
area you would expect maybe choices or
decisions or character and personality

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319
decisions or character and personality
 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:55.020
decisions or character and personality
to be more informed by a response to a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030
to be more informed by a response to a
 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.580
to be more informed by a response to a
fearful situation so for example

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
fearful situation so for example
 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.349

studies do tend to rate higher in areas

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209
studies do tend to rate higher in areas
 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.979
studies do tend to rate higher in areas
of stability loyalty not liking change

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989
of stability loyalty not liking change
 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.720

being more religiously involved in terms

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730
being more religiously involved in terms
 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.940
being more religiously involved in terms
of decision making having that that rate

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950
of decision making having that that rate
 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.160
of decision making having that that rate
higher for them in making certain

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170
higher for them in making certain
 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.830
higher for them in making certain
choices and if you look at liberals from

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840
choices and if you look at liberals from
 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.780
choices and if you look at liberals from
a personality character standpoint

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790
a personality character standpoint
 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.569
a personality character standpoint
you're going to find stronger ratings in

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579
you're going to find stronger ratings in
 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.500
you're going to find stronger ratings in
terms of like and change wanting to

actually base decision-making on new

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260
actually base decision-making on new
 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.430
actually base decision-making on new
information on science information and

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440
information on science information and
 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.870
information on science information and
so those differences are not surprising

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880
so those differences are not surprising
 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.539
so those differences are not surprising
in light of these brain structural

differences being a liberal or being a
 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.140
differences being a liberal or being a
conservative really is not black and

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150
conservative really is not black and
 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.940
conservative really is not black and
white it's really a bell-shaped curve

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950
white it's really a bell-shaped curve
 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.309
white it's really a bell-shaped curve
where you know someone who considers

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319
where you know someone who considers
 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.949
where you know someone who considers
themselves conservative may be far less

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959
themselves conservative may be far less
 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.199
themselves conservative may be far less
conservative so to speak then someone

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209
conservative so to speak then someone
 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.430
conservative so to speak then someone
else who still calls themselves a

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440
else who still calls themselves a
 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.619
else who still calls themselves a
conservative and that bell-shaped curve

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629
conservative and that bell-shaped curve
 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.050
conservative and that bell-shaped curve
continues all the way through we're in

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060
continues all the way through we're in
 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.270
continues all the way through we're in
the middle there may be a large group

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280
the middle there may be a large group
 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.780
the middle there may be a large group
that calls themselves independents what

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790
that calls themselves independents what
 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.300
that calls themselves independents what
we don't know is whether that has to do

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310
we don't know is whether that has to do
 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.810
we don't know is whether that has to do
with differences in brain structure and

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820
with differences in brain structure and
 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.029
with differences in brain structure and
so would we see an independence no one's

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039
so would we see an independence no one's
 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.370
so would we see an independence no one's
done that study to say oh independents

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380
done that study to say oh independents
 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.650
done that study to say oh independents
don't show any differences in brain

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660
don't show any differences in brain
 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.510
don't show any differences in brain
