[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.920
SAURABH MADAAN: Hello
and welcome everyone.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.870
Today, we have a very special
guest with us here today,

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.310
Bill Nygren.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.950
A quick introduction for Bill.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.620
Bill has been a manager
of the Oakmark Select Fund

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.870
since '96, Oakmark [INAUDIBLE]
2000, and Oakmark Global Select

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.150
Fund since 2006.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.490
He is also the chief
investment officer

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.030
for US equities at
Paris Associates

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.640
which he joined in 1983.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.710
He served as the firm's director
of research from 1990 to '98.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.110
Bill has received many accolades
during his investment career,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.070
including being named
Morningstar's Domestic Stock

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.080
Manager of the Year for 2001.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.570
I would just add a
footnote to that.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.910
A lot of people who've
earned that distinction,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.120
if you talk to them 10 or
15 years down the line,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.120
there are very few who are still
performing as strongly as Bill

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.070
has been.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.100
He holds an MS in finance
from the University

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.940
of Wisconsin's applied
security analysis program

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.550
and a bachelor's in
accounting from the University

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.580
of Minnesota.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.360
Just personally
speaking, I've read a lot

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.170
about investing over
the past few years.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.490
But I think Bill is
unique in his ability

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.630
to talk about the story of
value investing in technology.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.221
So we are very, very honored
to have you here with us today,

00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:34.720
Bill.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.130
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.088
BILL NYGREN: Thank you.

00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:38.547
Great to be here.

00:01:38.547 --> 00:01:39.630
SAURABH MADAAN: Excellent.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.590
So I thought we might
begin by just asking

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.810
you to talk to us about what got
you started in value investing.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.990
And maybe we can pick
up the story from there.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.670
BILL NYGREN: Sure, I,
as a kid, was always

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.000
more interested in
numbers than words.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.570
And that quantitative
bias led me to baseball

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.500
as an interesting,
because baseball,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.400
the same situation
recurs so many times.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.260
You get good quality statistical
samples and statistics

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.220
mean something.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.080
Somebody who hits 300 is a
better player, more valuable,

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.410
than somebody who hits 250.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.345
And so I was always interested
in baseball statistics.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:30.560
And growing up in St. Paul,
Minnesota, in our newspaper,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.450
the stock quotes were
always right next

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.760
to the baseball box scores.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.210
And I was very interested
in because there

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.021
were all these numbers, and
they moved around every day.

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:42.770
When I asked my dad
what they were, and he

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.180
said they represented money,
it got really interesting.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.950
So I started getting interested
in all kinds of different ways

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.830
that you could put
capital at risk,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.880
and whether that was in
things we'd call gambling,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.415
like slot machines.

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:02.750
There was a family
trip to Las Vegas,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.150
where we were visiting
one of my cousins

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.430
who is in the Air Force.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.450
And my dad took us
across the street to,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.200
I think it was a
Kroger grocery store.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.310
And my older brother
and I-- he's like kids,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.610
I'm going to show you why
you don't want to gamble.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.430
And he put five
nickels in his hand,

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.040
and starts putting them
into the slot machine.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.520
The first one that he puts
in, seven come back out.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.070
The next one that goes
in, more comes out.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.330
And this object lesson
gone awry was turning me

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.180
into a slot machine fanatic.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.460
It took him half an hour to
get rid of all the nickels

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.139
that came out.

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.180
And it was like he was
getting madder and madder.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.405
I'm like, dad, you should
stop, we're way ahead.

00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:47.030
And he's like no,
I'm going to show you

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.130
this is stupid, and keeps
putting the money in.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.560
So that fascination then was--

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.940
why was gambling stupid.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.530
I knew my dad was smart.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.320
And you start investigating, you
see that the casino keeps 15%

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.170
of the take on blackjack,
and 1-1/2% on craps,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.050
about the same on blackjack.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.110
Horse racing is something in
the upper teens percentage.

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.100
Then there are these
things called stocks,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.850
that if you did
average in stocks,

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.600
your money was worth maybe
8% or 10% more a year later,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.640
rather than less.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.340
And that distinction between
gambling and investing,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.090
putting capital at risk
either way, but in investing,

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.790
expected returns were positive.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.245
And from the time I
was in high school,

00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:43.785
I started reading everything
I could about investing.

00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:46.920
I'd go to the local library,
take a couple of books home.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.870
And back then, the
investing section

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.970
was probably just this wide.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.150
So it wasn't heroic to think
you could read everything

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.630
about investing
that was available.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.170
And as I read about
investing, and of course,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.810
all kinds of
different approaches,

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.440
the ones that made sense
to me were the value ones.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.150
Because I grew up
in a middle class

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.450
family, going
shopping with my mom.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.210
And if grapes were
on sale this week,

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.040
we'd buy more than
we usually would.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.200
And if cherries
weren't on sale, we'd

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.760
wait until they went on sale.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.160
So this idea that
as a consumer, you

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.190
could get more for your money
if you paid attention to price

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.150
was something that was
very appealing to me.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.210
And of course, that's
what value investing is,

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.470
is being patient and wanting to
make sure that you're actually

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:43.230
getting more value than you're
expending to make a purchase.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.600
I thought that if
I wanted investing

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.660
to be a career that
it only made sense

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.360
that I would learn the
language of business, which to

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.980
me was accounting.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:56.040
So I got an accounting
degree as an undergraduate.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.180
It still surprises me today
how many people go into finance

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.170
and don't have a good solid
understanding of accounting.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.240
I think it's been very
helpful through the course

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.310
of my career.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.340
Then got a master's degree at
the University of Wisconsin,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.610
was part of their applied
securities program.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.530
Worked a couple of years at
Northwestern Mutual Life.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.640
And during that
experience, really learned

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.760
how important it
was that if you're

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.500
going to be a valuable research
analyst to portfolio managers,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.890
you have to have the same
investment philosophy they do.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.740
And what they did at
Northwestern Mutual

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.710
was quite a ways away
from value investing.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.570
So when I'd look at
a company and say,

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.860
hey, nobody on Wall
Street's recommending this,

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.490
the assets, the
real estate they own

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.710
looks like it's worth
more than the stock price,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.140
they would say, well,
let's wait a while,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.520
let's see if we can get a couple
of Wall Street recommendations

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.350
on this first.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:00.870
And then a year or
two would go by,

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.060
and the stock would
have gone up somewhat.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.680
It was becoming a
little more popular,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.138
and they'd asked
me about it again.

00:07:06.138 --> 00:07:07.650
I'd be like, well,
at this price,

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.620
it's not very interesting to me,
because it's no longer a value

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.120
story.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.090
I can't tell you the real
estate is worth more than we're

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.330
paying for it.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.920
SAURABH MADAAN: Hold on, let's
just pause there for a second.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.860
Because this reminds
me of something

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.270
that I had to ask you.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.970
And maybe it will be
entertaining for the group

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.730
as we move forward
through the conversation.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.850
So I'm going to phrase
my question trying

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:36.240
to be in a more
entertaining way,

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.910
rather than necessarily factual.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.550
So I'll let you sort
the facts out later.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.560
So one of your
analysts wrote to us.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.700
They said that Bill
really likes and remembers

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.300
the facts when you
present something to Bill.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.600
So they presented a
stock to you at $10.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.050
And about six years later, when
the stock had grown 20 times,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.670
you still remembered
the presentation,

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.930
and you liked it even more.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:08.100
So you purchased
the stock at $200.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.980
BILL NYGREN: I did.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:09.400
Thanks for reminding me.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.730
SAURABH MADAAN: Is that correct?

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.688
What is the message you're
trying to send here?

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.970
BILL NYGREN: Well,
things change over time.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.140
The stock that we're
talking about is Netflix.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.850
And one of our
analysts presented it

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.070
about seven years ago.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.309
And his story was
basically everybody's

00:08:32.309 --> 00:08:33.990
focused on the
wrong numbers here.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:36.570
What you should look
at is the market

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.480
thinks HBO subscribers are
worth whatever the number was.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.020
I don't remember, $800 a sub.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.930
And Netflix subs are
worth a small fraction

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.950
of that in the market.

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.490
And it seems like that's wrong.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:54.030
Netflix is growing so
rapidly, HBO isn't.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.820
So the time, we
knew a lot of people

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.750
in the media industry because
of investments that we had,

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.320
and we talked to them.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.650
And they said, Netflix
is hugely risky.

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.650
HBO spends about three
times as much on programming

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:08.670
as Netflix does.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:13.020
They could basically squash
it any time they want to.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.392
By the way, look at look
at their churn statistics,

00:09:15.392 --> 00:09:17.100
especially in the
month of February, when

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.020
they release House of Cards.

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.490
This is a one-show company.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.460
Most of the media companies that
have sold programming to them

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.570
regret the decision.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.230
They had no idea it would
be sold to so many people.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.100
So they're going to see enormous
increases in programming costs.

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.170
When House of Cards
goes up for rebid,

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:40.860
they'll easily be outbid by
one of the bigger studios.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.300
And we looked at it and
said, the stock's cheap,

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:48.580
but it's really at a very
risky stage of its lifetime.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.230
And one of the things
we do at Oakmark

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:56.820
is, if we think the risk--
the risk and reward have

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.610
to have to be in balance to
make something interesting.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:03.480
You can't go into a high risk
situation for a small reward.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.490
You'd only want to be
in a high risk situation

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.680
if the reward is
very, very large.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.250
And as we looked at it, the
risks were just too high.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.050
So as I was saying
earlier, I don't even

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.360
think of this as a mistake.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.610
I think you learn a
lot about investors

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.790
by what they look back on
and say were big mistakes.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.160
A lot of people would
say this stock went up

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:28.290
10-fold, 20-fold maybe, not
buying it was a big mistake.

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.390
Well, it didn't
meet our criteria.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.250
When we researched
it thoroughly,

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:34.650
it didn't have the
risk return profile

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.230
that we were looking for.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.570
And fast forward to
just a few months

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:43.320
ago, one of our young analyst
comes into a large room.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.720
There are about 20 of
us, the investment team,

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.950
that sit around the table.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.540
He'd written a report on
why we should buy Netflix.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.770
And I'd gone through it.

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.800
And of course, it's hard
to get out of your mind

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.560
that you missed buying
it at like 5% or 10%

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.300
of the current price.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.660
And the report didn't
really jump out at me.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.250
We go into the
room, and he starts

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:10.010
by saying people
subscribe to HBO now

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.290
and they pay $15 a month.

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.590
They subscribe to Spotify,
they pay $15 a month.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:19.890
Sirius XM, more
like $20 a month.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:21.720
Those same people,
when they rate

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:24.210
the services they
subscribe to say Netflix

00:11:24.210 --> 00:11:26.670
is more valuable to them.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.660
That if Netflix,
instead of charging $10

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:35.490
a month charged $15, it would
be selling at 13 times earnings.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.830
And it was like
the bell went off.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:42.180
It's like that's a way of
thinking about the business

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.640
value that I had
never thought of.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:51.210
That the willingness of Netflix
to sacrifice current income

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:54.510
by not charging as much as
they could for their product,

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.920
to instead grow their
subscriber base 25% a year,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.430
get to the point today where
the moat has become almost so

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.460
large that it's impossible to
think of somebody displacing

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.710
them, $8 billion a
year on programming,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:11.070
that's almost now two
to three times what

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.070
HBO spends on programming.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.560
And because the sub base
is growing so rapidly,

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.830
the cost per subscriber is
going to be substantially less

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.110
for any programming
that Netflix considers

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.810
buying compared to HBO.

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.570
Now clearly, that's a stock
most value managers won't touch.

00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.260
It sells at almost
200 times earnings.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.000
The market's at
18 times earnings.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.430
It's just a name they
don't even think about.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:41.590
But I think, as value
investing has evolved,

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.780
more of the interesting
opportunities

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.560
today are coming
from these businesses

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.580
that the P/E ratio does a really
poor job of assigning value.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.360
We've talked about companies
that have non earning assets.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.046
And I was asked not to talk
about this company, so I won't.

00:13:02.046 --> 00:13:03.420
But there are
companies that have

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.550
a lot of cash on
their balance sheet

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.650
that earns almost nothing today.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.497
So the P/E investor really
is getting cash for free.

00:13:11.497 --> 00:13:13.080
There are companies
that are investing

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.550
in unrelated businesses.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.520
It's costing them
current income.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.440
And the accounting
doesn't set up

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.790
an asset to represent
the venture cap type

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.107
investment that they're making.

00:13:26.107 --> 00:13:27.690
There are companies
that are investing

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:31.740
in largely unrelated
businesses, like a Netflix,

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.100
sacrificing current
income to grow scale.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.690
And when you can find companies
with those characteristics,

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:42.470
that happen to have
large P/E ratios,

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.400
you get in kind of
this weird area,

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.190
where most value investors
won't buy it because the P/E

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.990
ratio is too high.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.660
Sometimes growth investors
aren't excited about them

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.170
anymore because they aren't
in that upper decile of growth

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:56.470
rates.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.910
So I think of it as kind of an
overlapping area between growth

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.280
and value, where
the growth rates

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.560
are higher than value
investors are used to,

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.280
the prices are cheaper than
growth investors are used to,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.430
and the names kind of fall
through the cracks there.

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:16.560
And you find a lot of
our portfolio at Oakmark

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.790
has large pieces of hidden value
in assets that aren't currently

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.710
earning anything.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:27.300
SAURABH MADAAN: So just to take
that part one step further,

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.070
a lot of companies, and
I'm thinking Amazon,

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:34.700
for example, which have
a large user network,

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.150
are also in a position where
they can invest in content.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:44.100
And I'm not
necessarily posing this

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:46.320
as a question of
Amazon versus Netflix,

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.670
but I'm just wondering
about Netflix's mode

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:53.940
in general, independent
of their valuation,

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.210
could there be danger to
Netflix from other people, who

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.660
could come in and compete
with them on as big a scale

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:02.070
as Netflix has?

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:04.080
BILL NYGREN: Right, I
think that is a risk.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.380
But when you look at the scale
that would have to be today,

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.500
it's a pretty small
number of companies.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.310
And Amazon is probably
large enough to do that,

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:18.090
maybe Facebook, maybe
Alphabet, maybe Apple.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.450
But to go in and say we're
going to commit $10 billion

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:24.120
to programming without
an obvious revenue source

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.690
to offset that, there
aren't many companies that

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:29.640
can take that kind of risk.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.370
And then I would
also add, people

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.190
are paying today
$100, $150 a month

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:37.990
for their cable
TV subscriptions.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:41.030
This doesn't have to be
a winner take all market.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:45.690
You can have a $15 Netflix
subscription, and maybe a Hulu

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.600
subscription, and
an Amazon Prime,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.280
and there's no reason
to think that it

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.750
has to be one versus the other.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:56.130
I think there are a small
handful of companies

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.570
that will be disruptors relative
to the current cable TV model

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.010
that we have.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:05.250
And there'll be more
than one winner.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:07.710
SAURABH MADAAN: All
right, and I know

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:10.400
I paused you there while you
were continuing your story.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.990
So I just want to throw
the gauntlet back at you.

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:17.820
BILL NYGREN: Oh, so we had
kind of this different style

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:18.710
of investing.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:23.310
And when I got an opportunity to
interview at Harris Associates,

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.944
all of the companies that
they were talking about

00:16:25.944 --> 00:16:27.360
were the same
companies that I had

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.660
been doing research work on.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.130
And you could see kind of
a meeting of the minds.

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.490
And I knew that was
a way that I would

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.780
be able to maximize my
value as an analyst,

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:42.630
is working in a shop where
other people were like minded.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:46.230
And I think that's been
one of the biggest reasons

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:50.520
that Harris and Oakmark has been
as successful as we've been,

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.420
is our brand means something.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.740
Oakmark, anybody who hears
that knows its long term value

00:16:58.740 --> 00:16:59.390
investing.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.765
It doesn't matter if it's our
international fund, if it's

00:17:01.765 --> 00:17:04.920
a domestic fund, or
funds that combine

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.859
stocks and bonds to have
more of an income element,

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.040
it's all long term
value investing.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:18.940
And that helps in multiple
ways, a network effect where

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.810
smart analysts know that
other value analysts are

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:24.250
at Harris Associates.

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.880
So they want to come there
to be in like company.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.270
Investors know that the
Oakmark Fund is a value fund,

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.550
so maybe they should look
at Oakmark International,

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.580
if that type of
investing works for them.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.300
And one of the big
advantages we've had

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:45.070
is, because of that environment,
where everything we do

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:49.450
is value investing, we
don't lose a lot of people.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:52.470
So our top investment
decision makers,

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.390
from the time I've
been there, have always

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.190
worked with each other
for more than a decade.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.154
And when you work with
somebody that long, you

00:17:59.154 --> 00:18:00.945
get to know their
strengths and weaknesses,

00:18:00.945 --> 00:18:03.120
you know their biases.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.780
You know what you can learn
from them, bouncing ideas off

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.370
of them.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.640
It makes our-- it
effectively gives us a moat.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.210
Because you couldn't
just take a similar group

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.880
of talented people,
throw them in a room,

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:21.660
and have something as successful
as Harris and Oakmark is.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.810
Because the group has
worked together and that's

00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:26.040
a big asset.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.592
You think of most
mutual fund companies,

00:18:28.592 --> 00:18:31.050
and it's almost like they're
trying to fill the Morningstar

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.000
style boxes.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.990
They'll have a high
turnover growth fund.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.790
They'll have a long
term growth fund.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.990
They'll have a value fund.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.710
They have all the
different boxes filled.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:45.840
But when you do it
that way, your brand

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.050
loses value, both in terms
of attracting customers

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:52.350
and attracting employee talent.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:55.992
And I think that's something
that's really helped us.

00:18:55.992 --> 00:18:57.450
SAURABH MADAAN:
And do you see that

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.430
this philosophical
evolution in value investing

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:06.450
is going to a
different level now?

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:09.060
People were talking
about this in 2000.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.590
So I think I ask this question
with a lot of humility in fact,

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:17.010
and skepticism, because in
2000 when people were investing

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:19.740
in technology companies,
there was a case

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.200
to be made that value
investors were not--

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.060
they were saying they were not
getting in on the internet.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:30.420
What you're saying is that
there is a similar case today,

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.970
but the situation has changed,
where these companies are

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:37.690
big enough, they're producing
cash and real earnings.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:38.970
Lay that out for us.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.360
Help us understand what
the reality is now.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:44.260
BILL NYGREN: Sure, to
that specific question,

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:47.230
and I want to go broader
with that in a minute,

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.950
but when I started in the
business in the early '80s,

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.620
most of the companies we
think of as tech leaders

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:57.360
today were of a size that
the ability that they

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.940
could be displaced by someone
else was a very real risk.

00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:04.890
They used to joke about two
high school kids in a garage

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:09.150
coming up with an invention
that would eliminate

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.880
one of the industry leaders.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.540
You think today
the market position

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.300
that companies like Intel
have, or Texas Instruments,

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.260
or Microsoft, two
kids in a garage

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.319
aren't going to displace
these companies.

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:27.110
And one of the things,
as a value investor,

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.350
you're always thinking out
like five to seven years

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:30.980
into the future.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.310
How is the company
likely to change?

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.200
How will it market share change?

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.840
How will cash flows change?

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.810
How does the addressable
market change?

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:43.480
The tech companies
back in the '80s,

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.360
your vision got
really cloudy fast,

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.250
because the industries
were changing so much.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.710
And I think now
that companies are

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.560
of a scale that can't happen.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.920
But the evolution
of value investing,

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.360
I'd like to take
back to more just

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.280
the evolution of investing.

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.930
If you think this asset
category called stocks

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.670
that got me interested
in investing,

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:11.660
because it had such a high
expected value, 50 years ago

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.410
maybe, the only way
you could access that

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.730
was your local stockbroker.

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:19.930
And that was a pretty
high cost way to access.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.160
And then came
along mutual funds,

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.840
which was a much lower cost way
to access this wonderful asset

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.820
category.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:34.220
And just by being a mutual
fund, and passing along

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.210
the cost savings you got, by
aggregating all the customers,

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.640
was a tremendous advantage
for the customers,

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:44.720
and gave mutual funds a big leg
up on the local stockbroker.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.750
Then you take that
to a farther extreme,

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:50.930
and indexing came along.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.660
Just aggregating isn't
enough to add value anymore.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.450
That's not enough to charge
your active management fee.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.390
Because we can aggregate,
do it in a no-cost way,

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.290
pass the savings on to
you, and we will be better

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:06.490
than the average mutual fund.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:10.580
So then value investing says
well, we can one-up that.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.600
We'll just buy the
lowest quartile of P/Es.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.410
And that probably still worked
in the '80s domestically, maybe

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.760
in the '90s internationally.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.250
You just put a
portfolio together

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.350
of all the low P/E
stocks, you be patient,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.470
you hold them until they're
not low P/E anymore,

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.370
and that was enough to work.

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.000
Then the ETFs came
along and said,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.330
we don't need to pay stock
pickers to get low P/E stocks.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.600
We can get a computer program
to pick low P/E stocks,

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:40.210
we'll give that to
you for almost free.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:43.150
So to earn an active
management fee,

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:47.170
you've always had to stay one
step ahead of the computers.

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.960
And I think one of
the frustrations you

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.000
hear with a lot
of value managers

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.980
today is, what I did 20 years
ago isn't working anymore.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.960
I think that's
always been the case.

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.070
What worked 20 years ago very
rarely still works today.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.830
20 years ago you could
just buy low P/E, low price

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.090
to book value stocks.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.910
And that was enough
to be attractive.

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:13.100
Now you can do that
for almost no fee.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:18.350
And the computers
have gotten smarter

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:21.980
about combining low
P/E, low price to book

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:24.890
with some positive
characteristics, book value

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:27.510
growth, earnings growth.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:31.940
And so the simple,
obvious stocks

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.040
that look cheap generally
deserve to be cheap.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:39.390
And when I started at
Harris 30 years ago,

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.350
we were one of
the earliest firms

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:47.930
to do computer
screening to find ideas.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.420
And once a month,
we would pay to have

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:55.640
a universe of 1,500 stocks
rank ordered by P/E ratio.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.300
And as analysts, the
day that output came in,

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.340
we would all be
crawling all over it

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:05.020
to look at what the new
low P/E stocks were.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.400
Today, any of our
administrative assistants

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.180
could put that screen together
in a couple of minutes.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.660
And because it's
become so easy to get,

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.040
it's not valuable anymore.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.272
And I think it's probably
not just investing.

00:24:21.272 --> 00:24:22.730
That's through a
lot of industries,

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.210
as information becomes
more easily accessible

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.260
it loses its value.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:33.590
So today, the more interesting
ideas, to me, at least,

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.710
are these ideas where
a P/E ratio misses it,

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:40.310
or there's a non-earning asset.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:41.390
We talked about cash.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.420
We talked about
unrelated investments.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.850
We talked about income
statement investing,

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:50.120
where you're offering the
customer an unusual bargain

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.420
to grow scale and grow
the size of your moat.

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:57.350
And that's kind of evolved
into the technology area

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.350
today, because these companies
have become big enough

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:03.710
to think about what they might
look like five to seven years

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.300
down the road.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.000
And think, it's really
not much riskier

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.740
to try and guess what Intel will
look like five years from now

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.260
than it is to try and guess
what Procter and Gamble will

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.210
look like five years from now.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.000
All industries are
undergoing rapid change.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.760
And the idea that technology
is outside of my sphere

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.570
of competence because it
changes so fast, I think

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.460
has become an outdated idea.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.970
So we own a lot of
technology names at Oakmark.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.960
And most of them follow the
idea that there is a way

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.730
to look at the
assets kind of piece

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.150
by piece that gets you
to a core that you're not

00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:47.750
paying nearly as high a
multiple on as it appears

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.105
on the surface.

00:25:50.105 --> 00:25:51.980
SAURABH MADAAN: I see
that in your portfolio,

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.050
you not only have
technology companies,

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.870
but you also have the
traditional value investing

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:57.860
names.

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:01.550
I'm thinking, for example,
Citigroup and AIG.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:06.080
Could you, maybe for the
purposes of our audience,

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.950
in maybe your professor's
hat or teacher's hat,

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:12.440
and walk us through
one of these thesis

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.350
as to how do you analyze
it, in a way that maybe we

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:17.700
can all learn from.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:22.820
BILL NYGREN: So we felt
that the financial sector

00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:28.320
became very attractively valued
after the financial crisis.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.940
Obviously, the stocks had
been horrible performers.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.390
And there's always a
tendency of investors

00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:38.330
to look too much out the
rear view mirror instead

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:44.810
of trying to guess what lies
ahead through the windshield.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.579
And financial stocks
had been a disaster.

00:26:47.579 --> 00:26:49.370
So a lot of people
didn't want to own them.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:54.200
Even value investors, you'd
often hear something like,

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.710
I really made a mistake owning
the financials in 2007 and '08.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.600
I had no idea what
they were doing.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.800
They're too opaque.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.470
We're just never going
to buy them again.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:06.230
And that never really
resonated with us.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:09.960
To us, we didn't see the
housing crisis coming.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.390
I wish we'd been
smarter on that.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:12.620
We weren't.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.990
But if you think
about what banks do.

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:16.310
I mean, they take in deposits.

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.340
They generally lend mostly
against real estate.

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.870
If you knew real
estate prices were

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.290
going to fall by
20% or so, you'd

00:27:23.290 --> 00:27:24.860
know you don't
want to own banks.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:28.520
And it didn't matter what kind
of securitization happened.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.960
The main asset category that
they owned on a levered basis

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.410
suffered an
unprecedented decline.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:43.330
So we said you don't have
to be afraid of banks

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:45.520
if you don't think the
same circumstances are

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.170
going to recur.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:50.470
And on a price to
book value basis,

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:53.642
banks used to sell at two
times tangible equity,

00:27:53.642 --> 00:27:54.475
pretty consistently.

00:27:54.475 --> 00:27:56.320
They'd vary around that.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.260
They'd be cheap at 1-1/2, they'd
be expensive if they were much

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.220
more than 2.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.410
And most of them were
selling in the market

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:07.150
place at a large discount
to tangible book.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:11.440
So our interest was piqued,
because it was contrarian,

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:17.290
and the pricing was out of line
with historical guidelines,

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:20.620
and very much out of
line on the cheap side.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:26.080
And we started talking to
executives of those banks.

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:30.250
And you could see a
dramatic change in behavior.

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:34.270
That they realized
they'd made mistakes

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.550
going into the housing crisis.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.870
They were lending without taking
into account the probability

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:44.330
that the person they were
lending to would pay them back.

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:46.060
It was more just
saying, this house

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.477
is worth a million dollars,
we'll lend 800,000,

00:28:48.477 --> 00:28:50.560
and if they don't pay us
back, somebody else will,

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.270
we don't have to worry about it.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.520
But they're getting back to
good old fashioned lending

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.800
standards.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.390
One of the other
reasons banks had

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:03.190
gotten riskier was
the dollars of assets

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:07.090
that they had relative to the
dollars of equities, that ratio

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:09.370
just kept growing and growing.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:13.360
And very quickly, the banks,
partly of their own accord,

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.000
partly because of
regulation, dramatically

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.830
increased the amount
of capital they

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.860
had relative to the amount
of loans outstanding.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.623
So instead of 5% equity against
the loans, they were at 10%,

00:29:24.623 --> 00:29:27.290
so if you have twice
as much capital,

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:28.540
there's half as much risk.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:38.280
People were afraid that
with the regulation

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.960
that the companies
weren't ever going

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.650
to be able to get capital
out to shareholders.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:46.500
One of the things we heard
a lot as we were trying

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:49.650
to explore bear cases for
this industry was they're

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.480
going to get
regulated to the point

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.680
that they basically trade
like electric utilities.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:58.750
And we looked at it and said,
the average bank's at about

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:02.190
half of book value, the average
electric utility is at about

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.280
1-1/2 two times book.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.360
It wouldn't be so awful
if they started trading

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.340
like electric utilities.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.760
So we started to not be too
concerned about regulation.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.370
And thought, we're buying
at less than book value,

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:17.910
absolute worst case,
if overregulation

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:21.780
makes these companies not want
to be in these businesses,

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:23.510
they can stop making new loans.

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:25.900
Their loan book can run off.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.250
And in company after company,
as we started penciling out

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.130
what that would
mean for cash flows,

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.230
we said in this
downside scenario,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.390
we still come out
OK, given that we're

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.550
buying at such a discount.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:41.610
And on the upside,
if earnings get

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:45.840
back to where the companies
can earn 15% on equity,

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.430
and sell book and a
half or two times book,

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.120
there's very significant upside.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:53.070
So one of the things
that was important to us

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:55.650
as we started interviewing
management teams

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.440
and listening to presentations
that they'd made,

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.720
was that we were invested
with management teams that

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:04.170
were OK with growing
through shrinking.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:07.890
So taking capital and
reducing the equity base.

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.260
Because it's dangerous, if
you're financial, to go out

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.090
and just try and
grow your assets.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:16.140
When you really try and push
the accelerator down on growth,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:20.430
you often make mistakes
with who you lend to.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.800
But growth through
repurchasing your shares

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.060
at half a book value,
that increases the book

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.950
value of the
remaining shares, it

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.240
decreases the risk
profile of the company.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.010
So we're always
focused on trying

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:37.500
to invest with managements
that want to maximize

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:39.760
long term per share value.

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.820
And in this case, we
thought that meant

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.360
having a willingness
to repurchase shares.

00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.750
So we started investing
in the companies that

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:50.250
were repurchasing shares.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:53.970
That became a more
popular way for the banks

00:31:53.970 --> 00:31:56.360
to reinvest their capital.

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.260
So what started out as an
investment in JP Morgan

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:05.040
quickly became JP Morgan, Bank
of America, Citigroup, Wells

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.420
Fargo.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.520
And we didn't own all of them.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.660
But we owned most of the major
banks with an entry price

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.420
significantly under book value.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:23.250
And as this story progresses,
last year after the elections,

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.200
regardless of what you
think of the politics,

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:30.150
there was more confidence
in a growth outlook

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:31.930
that is good for banks now.

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:33.975
It means higher interest rates.

00:32:33.975 --> 00:32:36.240
It means higher
asset values, which

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.210
helps the loans that are
on their books already.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.330
Probably means less
regulation in terms

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:45.880
of being able to get capital
back to shareholders.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.750
And we've seen a tremendous
run in these names.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:52.800
But still, most of them are
selling at less than 150%

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.420
of tangible book.

00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:56.610
Most of them will still
see earnings growth

00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:01.550
if interest rates normalize
to a 2% or 3% inflation level.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.620
And most of them still have
significant excess capital

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.140
on the balance sheet
that either ought

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:11.130
to be valued by investors
through requiring a lower

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.520
discount rate, because these
are less risky businesses,

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:19.560
or could potentially be returned
to investors, which then, it's

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.160
dollar for dollar
that you realize

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.312
value for excess capital.

00:33:26.312 --> 00:33:28.770
SAURABH MADAAN: Some of them
also have deferred tax assets,

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:29.400
right?

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.500
BILL NYGREN: Right, the
deferred tax assets,

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.270
another non earning asset.

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:40.110
Along that theme, both deferred
tax assets and excess capital

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:44.370
really aren't generating much
today in the way of income.

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:46.080
So you miss that, if
you're just looking

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:50.610
at the banks selling at a
12 or 13 times P/E multiple.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:53.190
Now there's some risk
with the tax bill

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.190
that the House passed
yesterday that would take

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:58.800
corporate rates down to 20%.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.840
You might see write offs on some
of these deferred tax assets.

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.940
The flip side of that is the
financial industry in the US

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:12.210
is one of the highest taxpaying
industries, paying quite close

00:34:12.210 --> 00:34:14.340
to the statutory rate.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.639
And normally, it takes
a number of years

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:22.409
before a competitive industry
returns a change in tax policy

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:23.889
to the customers.

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:28.199
So even though a large
holding for us like Citi

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:31.050
would see several dollars
a share of book value

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:34.980
go away if the tax laws
end up getting passed,

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.170
like the one did
yesterday, we think

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:40.380
that would be more than made
up by the increase in their

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.100
after tax earnings, that
they would benefit from,

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.949
until the banks start competing
that away from each other.

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:49.420
SAURABH MADAAN: So
along those lines,

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.179
we talked about
tech companies, we

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:53.940
talked about financial
services companies,

00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:58.260
but you also have high quality
compounders in your portfolio.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.660
And I'm thinking companies
like MasterCard and Visa

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.090
for example.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.570
Talk to us a little bit, bill,
about a company like Visa

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:08.880
and MasterCard,
we know that most

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:12.240
of the transactions in the
world are still based on cash,

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:15.900
I think about 80-85%,
somewhere in that ballpark.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:18.960
So the market understands
the value and the growth

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.670
that is possible.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:25.690
But these are not selling
at low multiples right now.

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.530
So why do you continue
to hold these?

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.980
And will there come a
multiple in terms of valuation

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.920
where you will say that
yes, this is overvalued?

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.860
BILL NYGREN: Sure, going back
to her our previous discussion

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:41.050
about Netflix and can't
there be competitors,

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:45.840
even though card processing,
payment processing,

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.180
is just as much a network
business as companies like Visa

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:52.050
or MasterCard--
it's a great example

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:54.010
that they're not
fighting each other,

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:55.530
they're both fighting cash.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.230
And there are two big winners.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:02.370
The way we look at trying
to assign values here

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.830
is in any company,
we make a projection

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:10.060
out two years, all of
the financial statements.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.270
And then for the
five years following

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.450
that, we assign an
estimated growth

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.620
rate in operating
earnings for the company,

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:23.280
make an estimate of what
the cash needs or cash

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.910
production of the company will
be if they meet our targets,

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:31.860
and then get to a growth rate
in business value per share.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.560
And we say our crystal
ball gets too cloudy

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.840
after about seven
years for any company

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.210
to make much of a forecast
beyond that time period.

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:44.220
So the assumption is that at the
end of that seven year period,

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:49.540
companies sell at pretty
similar multiples to each other.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:55.500
We've made estimates, starting
with how much of world commerce

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:59.150
is being done by
cards today and what

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.040
an extrapolation of
those trends would likely

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.420
produce for revenue growth
for MasterCard and Visa.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.480
What kind of incremental
margins these companies

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.420
are capable of having, again,
if they aren't investing

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:15.210
in adjacent technologies.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:19.260
And based on that, and
just a mathematical model

00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:24.360
that we use, produce what kind
of premium to the normal P/E

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:28.110
this company would be
deserving of selling at today.

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.320
And despite MasterCard
and Visa selling

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.810
at pretty strong
premiums to the market,

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:36.420
they still haven't
gotten to that level

00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:38.920
that we would call fully valued.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.460
Now I would say we got
a little bit lucky here,

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.910
where the market gave
us a great opportunity

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:50.410
to buy these companies back when
regulation called the Durbin

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:50.910
Bill--

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:52.440
SAURABH MADAAN: Credit Card Act.

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.020
BILL NYGREN: --yeah, was going
to dramatically reduce what

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.450
they could get on debit cards.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.239
And both MasterCard
and Visa fell to prices

00:38:00.239 --> 00:38:02.280
that they weren't much of
a premium to the market

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.230
at the time we bought them.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:08.930
So we've benefited from business
value growth and stock prices

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:13.020
both growing at a
pretty similar slopes,

00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.790
with the stocks never
getting to a level

00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:18.210
that we would be
wanting to sell them.

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.640
Most of this time, they
haven't been cheap enough

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.280
that we'd say, if new
money came to us today

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:25.440
and we had to start a
portfolio from scratch

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.450
would we buy this company.

00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.110
But they've kind of stayed
between buy and sell targets

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.720
for an extended period of time.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:36.690
And as each year rolls
by, and our analysts then

00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:39.690
start to look at a new
year, the new year that's

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:43.824
seven years out, the confidence
hasn't wavered at all

00:38:43.824 --> 00:38:45.240
that these two
companies are going

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.420
to continue to dominate payment
processing as much as they

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.050
do today.

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:52.920
SAURABH MADAAN: So
let's put some numbers,

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.940
so that we get some ballpark
to what you just said.

00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:02.670
Let's say their revenues keep
growing double digits for five

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.520
years, and they keep
getting some operating

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.850
leverage in the business.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:11.300
So earnings grow at say
15%, for five years,

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:14.880
so that would mean the
earnings have doubled roughly

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.430
in five years.

00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:21.780
If the multiple
goes from 30 to 20,

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.520
because you say
after seven years

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:26.130
you're approaching
roughly market multiples,

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:29.880
you get 100% upside and
then 50% contraction

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.160
due to the multiple.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.910
That's net 50% in five years.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:38.250
Does that cross the hurdle?

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.320
How does one think about it?

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.560
Where would you say that--

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.240
and I'm just putting some
numbers to ask the question,

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.350
where would one make the
call, I'm going to sit in cash

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.110
and not stay invested.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:54.030
BILL NYGREN: So the
answer gets pretty

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.430
complex and quantitative,
but if there's ever

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:58.800
a group that wants to
walk through it that way,

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.140
it's probably this group.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.890
We start with the idea that
if you want to invest capital

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:08.280
at no risk for seven
years, the US government

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.640
bonds for US investors
is the way to do that.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.920
And if you do that today,
you're earning something

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:17.370
around 2%, maybe a little
bit less than that.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.440
To take the risk
of a normal equity,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:21.670
you need to earn
a premium to that.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.130
So we start, we
say the 2% level--

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.290
well, we actually make
an adjustment and say,

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.650
a 2% seven-year doesn't
really make sense

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:31.350
in a 2% inflation environment.

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:37.140
So we're going to pretend
that those bonds are at 3%.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:40.080
We don't want to be investing
based on an interest

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:43.870
rate for that bond that we don't
think is long term rational.

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.140
So if we say the
bond would be at 3%,

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:50.490
and we want about a 4% premium,
which is in line with history,

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.350
for stocks, we'd
say we want a stock

00:40:52.350 --> 00:40:57.210
to earn 7% a year to
call it fairly valued.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:00.990
And we want to sell
a stock at about 90%

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:03.300
of what we think
is fair and buy it

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:06.390
at about two thirds of
what we think is fair.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.850
So when we go through
that math of saying,

00:41:08.850 --> 00:41:12.660
based on our seven year
forecast for MasterCard,

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:17.010
that we think it makes
sense that it would sell

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:23.400
at 20 times pre-tax
earnings two years from now,

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.890
the math behind
that would say then

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.920
you would still earn your
appropriate risk premium

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:35.650
to the seven-year bond if
it today sold at that price.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:40.020
So on our math, something with
the growth characteristics

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.900
of a MasterCard or
Visa is worth something

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.444
on the order of
20 times pre-tax,

00:41:45.444 --> 00:41:46.860
even though the
rest of the market

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:50.390
sells it somewhere around
12 or 13 times pre-tax.

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:52.770
SAURABH MADAAN: Even five
years from now, you think.

00:41:55.112 --> 00:41:56.570
BILL NYGREN: Our
five-year from now

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.270
guess for the market
would be based

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:01.270
on a seven-year that's
at 3%, and would still

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:02.994
be at about that level.

00:42:02.994 --> 00:42:03.910
SAURABH MADAAN: I see.

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.801
Because these are high
quality compounders.

00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:07.300
You

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:09.216
BILL NYGREN: No, I'm
saying market would still

00:42:09.216 --> 00:42:10.790
be at about 12 times level.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:13.270
So if five years
from now we still

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:16.510
thought we had seven years
of runway ahead of us

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:20.280
for supernormal growth
at MasterCard and Visa,

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.260
then we'd still have a very
high relative multiple on it.

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:25.390
But the way our math
works today, we're

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:28.840
assuming that as each year that
goes by, that they're growing

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:34.270
15% or 20%, the years, eight
years out, nine years out,

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:37.140
those are normal growth years.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.340
And one of the reasons it's
been such a good holding for us,

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.950
and we've held it five years or
so, is as every year goes by,

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:49.300
and we start that you're
worried about disruption risk

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.270
from alternative payment
processing systems,

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:53.650
at the end of the
year, we end up

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:57.340
saying the moat that MasterCard
and Visa have is just

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.110
as strong as it
started at the year.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.870
So we don't have to
lower our multiple.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:05.590
And if the company's
growing 15% a year,

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:07.810
and you aren't
lowering your multiple,

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.760
your business value
is growing 15% a year.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.270
You're putting
yourself in a position

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:16.480
to get lucky if you buy
these companies that

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.972
have disruption risk, and then
that disruption doesn't happen.

00:43:20.972 --> 00:43:22.930
SAURABH MADAAN: Yeah, I
see what you're saying.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:23.925
Great, and thank you.

00:43:23.925 --> 00:43:25.300
I mean, this was
a great example,

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.600
just to sort of walk through
as to where you bought,

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:31.150
what was the motivation,
how you think

00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.340
about long term,
short term valuation,

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:37.060
and what happens in the course
of holding an investment, how

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.130
you make a decision.

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:42.880
So moving on from there, a
couple of related questions.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.770
And then we'll open
up to the audience.

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:48.430
I wanted to ask you,
who are some investors

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:51.190
that you personally
admire or look up to,

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:55.300
or that have been
influential for you?

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:57.820
BILL NYGREN: I would
start with what I jokingly

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:00.610
refer to as the usual suspects.

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:04.810
You talk to any value manager
and they're going to tell you

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:09.010
they were strongly influenced
by Warren Buffett, Benjamin

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:12.700
Graham, John Templeton.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:13.870
Those are my heroes.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:16.810
I've read almost anything
that they've written.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:21.130
And they have had a very
dramatic impact on my way

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:26.350
of thinking, on Harris
Associates, and Oakmark.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:30.730
I think value
managers especially

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:33.410
tend not to go a lot
broader than that.

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:36.880
And to me, that's a mistake.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.920
After you've read a few
books about Warren Buffett,

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.985
and you read the next
book, and maybe you

00:44:42.985 --> 00:44:45.850
learn what his breakfast
habits are, or what TV shows

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:49.390
he likes, but you really
have the foundation

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:52.550
for what's made him a
successful investor already.

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.907
And it's like comfort food.

00:44:53.907 --> 00:44:55.490
You know it's not
really good for you,

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:57.906
but there's something about
reading another Warren Buffett

00:44:57.906 --> 00:45:01.420
book that makes you feel
good as a value investor.

00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:07.366
And the investors who are
very different than us,

00:45:07.366 --> 00:45:11.720
I tend not to want to emulate
their style of investing.

00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:14.140
But I find I learn
more when I read books

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.660
about some of the
great hedge fund

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:21.520
managers, a Paul Tudor Jones,
and Michael Steinhardt, George

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.230
Soros.

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:28.670
And there's not nearly the
overlap of the circles,

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:31.850
like Berkshire Hathaway, and
the way we differ from them,

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:34.340
I mean there are
differences at the edges,

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:38.730
but it's a very similar
thought process.

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:40.760
The circle with
Michael Steinhardt

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:44.600
still overlaps, but
it's not nearly as much.

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:49.400
And I've never read a book about
one of those great investors

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.530
who weren't value
investors that hasn't

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:56.300
made me think about some detail
of our investing process.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:46:00.320
For example, Mike Steinhardt
was famous for never wanting

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:04.280
to make an investment until
he'd sat down with the person he

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:06.950
thought was the smartest
bear on the stock

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:08.325
and understood their case.

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.260
We try to do that in our
process at Oakmark, by whenever

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.780
somebody is presenting
a new idea to us,

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:20.110
we assign the task to
someone of saying your job

00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.180
is to now come into
the room and explain

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:24.040
why this person is wrong.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.460
And we want you to argue to the
best of your ability to prevent

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:29.680
us from making this investment.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:33.850
And hearing the two sides
argue with each other

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:36.010
is a much more
productive atmosphere

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.620
for learning about an
investment than just

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.570
hearing the bullish case.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:42.670
Paul Tudor Jones,
there's a famous picture

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:47.290
of him sitting at
his desk, and pinned

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:49.000
on to the bulletin
board behind him

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.170
is a sign that says
losers average losers.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:57.340
How many times have you
heard a value investor say

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.880
the stock's down 20% today, but
my estimate of business value

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.140
is only down 10%.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:06.130
So it's really cheaper
today than it was yesterday.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:10.640
One of the great things
about data analysis

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.780
having become so cheap,
and us having the history

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.350
that we have, it's really easy
to analyze our own history now

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:20.170
and be more data driven in
our own decision making.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:23.530
And we can look at and say, OK,
we've got 20 years of history

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:27.040
here, about 130 stocks
on our approved list,

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:28.990
what happened when this
fundamental started

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.330
to deviate from what
the analysts suggested,

00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:33.435
were those good
opportunities to add.

00:47:33.435 --> 00:47:34.810
And we looked at
it and said, you

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:38.560
know what, that was really
more of an indication

00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:41.110
that we were off
base in our analysis,

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:43.120
and it was going to
get worse after that,

00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:45.220
before it got better.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:49.680
And adding some
guardrails to our process,

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:53.190
of saying when things
start to go negative

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:54.741
on the fundamental story--

00:47:54.741 --> 00:47:56.490
we don't ever want to
be the investor that

00:47:56.490 --> 00:48:00.580
says if the stock falls
20% it's an automatic sale.

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.990
But if the fundamentals start
to deviate, and the story isn't

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:05.820
playing out the way
we thought it would,

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:09.150
the fundamental story,
we want to increase

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:12.120
the pressure on the
analysis, to make

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.240
sure more people in the
firm are thinking about it,

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.970
forcing more meetings
with the management team,

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:21.680
forcing more of a devil's
advocate thought process,

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:24.660
with the idea that one of
the most productive ways we

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.605
can add to our performance is to
get rid of our losers earlier.

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:31.760
I get teased.

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.340
We're not momentum investors
by any way, shape, or form.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:39.920
But I do believe there is such
a thing as fundamental momentum,

00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.210
that companies that
are performing well

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.520
are more likely to
continue performing well,

00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.810
and companies that
are performing poorly

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:48.944
are more likely to
continue poorly.

00:48:48.944 --> 00:48:50.860
SAURABH MADAAN: Newton's
first laws of motion.

00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:51.650
BILL NYGREN: Yes.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:54.420
So it's not a new concept,
but at Oakmark, it's

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.820
applying something that's
thousands of years old.

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:02.510
So you can take these nuggets--

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:05.210
George Soros, with his
theory of reflexivity,

00:49:05.210 --> 00:49:08.750
which was written up in
a book hundreds of pages

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:11.330
long that I find very
difficult to follow.

00:49:11.330 --> 00:49:14.960
But way, way
oversimplified, says

00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:18.980
that what's going on
emotionally in investors

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:21.890
can actually influence
the real economy.

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:26.660
And that psychology has a
real effect on the economy.

00:49:26.660 --> 00:49:31.670
And when direction changes,
a simple psychological change

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:36.540
can be enough to bring about
a real change in the economy.

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:41.070
When you go through tough
cycles like '08 and '09--

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:44.330
and people are
always saying, sure,

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:46.790
if things get back to normal,
then everything out there

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:48.960
is really cheap, and
the names you own

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:51.860
would be the right
basket of names to own.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:55.700
But what can ever change
to make things get better?

00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:59.930
Just thinking that things could
change to get back to normal

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:03.470
can be an impetus to start
that process happening.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.630
In the same way
that if you've gone

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:07.850
through an extended
recovery that's

00:50:07.850 --> 00:50:11.060
created tremendous
excess in the economy,

00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:13.820
just people starting to worry
that things go back to normal

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:17.330
could be enough to
slow the speculation,

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:20.744
slow price increases and
bring things back to normal.

00:50:20.744 --> 00:50:22.160
Those are things
you don't usually

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:25.670
read in books about
great value investors

00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:30.680
that I think can really help
refine a value approach.

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.370
And like I say, I think
I learn more reading

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:39.410
about how great investors
who weren't value investors

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:44.840
invested than I do by reading
the 200th book about value

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.554
investing.

00:50:46.554 --> 00:50:48.470
SAURABH MADAAN: That's
a very good suggestion.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.490
So final question is
what does your day, what

00:50:52.490 --> 00:50:54.110
do your routines look like?

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:55.670
What are some of
your reading habits?

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:58.490
And any advice you have
for those of us here,

00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:01.490
and people who are going to be
watching you on YouTube, how

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:04.220
they can be better investors.

00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:08.400
BILL NYGREN: So the alarm goes
off at 5:52 in the morning.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.850
That's so that I
can watch the top 10

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:12.950
plays of the day on
SportsCenter before I

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:17.740
get started on the
business part of the day.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.360
I read The Wall Street Journal,
New York Times business

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:26.870
section, Chicago Tribune,
CNBC's top stories of the day,

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:31.280
Real Clear Markets top
stories of the day.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:35.780
Do most of that before
I go into the office.

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.670
Do some of it while
I'm riding an exercise

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:39.380
bicycle in the morning.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.500
Always trying to multitask.

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.810
Try to get into the
market a good hour

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:47.657
before the market opens,
which is 8:30 Central time.

00:51:47.657 --> 00:51:48.365
We're in Chicago.

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:54.140
So that I can see if
investors have given us

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.570
new money to invest,
have taken money away.

00:51:56.570 --> 00:52:01.160
We have to figure out how
to manage cash flow changes.

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.630
Want to make sure
I've had a chance

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:05.510
to read the important first
call notes on the companies

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:09.370
we're invested in or
considering investing in.

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:15.170
And then most of the day at
the office, you see movies

00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:18.650
and they show pictures of what
asset management firms look

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:20.150
like, and you see
this trading room,

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:22.520
and people are on two phones,
and they're getting angry

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:24.335
and throwing things.

00:52:24.335 --> 00:52:25.876
Our office is more
or less a library.

00:52:25.876 --> 00:52:26.570
SAURABH MADAAN:
[INAUDIBLE] screens.

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:28.850
BILL NYGREN: Yeah, all the
screens all around them,

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:31.220
everything electronic flashing.

00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:33.950
You walk into our
offices, and it's mostly

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.600
people sitting at
a desk reading,

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.320
with a pile of papers
stacked on their desk.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.210
And most of the day is reading.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:44.030
And it's reading about
companies we're invested in.

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:45.860
It's reading about
companies that

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:52.280
are trying to challenge
those companies, disruptors.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.250
It's reading stuff
written by other investors

00:52:55.250 --> 00:52:57.890
that we admire of
companies that they own,

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:00.440
that we don't, trying to
see if we missed anything,

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:03.680
if we can learn something
from what they wrote.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.500
It's sitting around in a
room with other analysts,

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:09.620
bouncing ideas off each other.

00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:12.080
Which again, is one of
the great advantages

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:15.350
that we have at Oakmark,
is either direction outside

00:53:15.350 --> 00:53:18.920
of my door, I can walk all
the way around the office

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:21.260
and find another
value investor who's

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:24.620
got a slightly different
perspective on things,

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.930
who knows me well
enough, who knows

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:29.610
Oakmark's way of
investing well enough,

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:31.880
that we can really learn
from each other bouncing

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.400
ideas off each other.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.280
And you hear about
like the investment

00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:38.900
banking firms where
people are still

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:42.260
at their desks at midnight,
one of the nice things

00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:47.210
about reading being a big part
of what our job is, is you

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:49.380
can do that anywhere.

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:52.160
So I have had the
good fortune of being

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:56.180
able to have a lifestyle
that I'm home at dinner time

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.910
almost every night.

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:02.057
But I might be reading
an annual report

00:54:02.057 --> 00:54:03.140
before I'm falling asleep.

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:08.480
There's a tremendous blurring.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.160
It's probably true
in any industry

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:12.890
where people are really
passionate about what they do.

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:18.020
Tremendous blurring between
business time and private time.

00:54:18.020 --> 00:54:19.970
Might be at the
office and having

00:54:19.970 --> 00:54:23.210
a personal conversation
with my dad or somebody

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:24.620
else in the family.

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.900
And you can say is that
really fair to your employer

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.250
to be taking that time.

00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:32.420
But at home, I'm
watching a baseball game

00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:36.320
and reading annual
reports, or other reports

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.600
by other investors
that whole time.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.990
I go shopping and I
can't help but see

00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:44.720
what new products are out
and how they're priced

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.040
compared to old products.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:48.260
Or if you're in an
off price store,

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.720
that there's suddenly a
tremendous amount of inventory

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:52.852
from Nike, and
there wasn't before.

00:54:52.852 --> 00:54:54.060
And does that mean something.

00:54:54.060 --> 00:54:57.500
It's just, I think to be
a successful investor,

00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:59.810
it has to be something
you love so much that you

00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:01.850
can't ever really
turn it off, and you

00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:04.580
don't want to turn it off.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:06.890
You get enough
enjoyment from it.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:10.520
And it doesn't create
stress in a way

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:14.030
that you feel you need to
get away from it to relax.

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:15.762
So those are my days.

00:55:15.762 --> 00:55:17.720
And then every once in
a while, it's traveling.

00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:19.190
It's going out to
meet managements.

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:22.370
We like to sit across
the table from the CEOs

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:24.730
and CFOs of the companies
that we're invested in,

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:27.050
and hear in their own words
what's important to them,

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:29.740
what their goals are.

00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:31.940
I was out in New
York the past couple

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:34.190
of days meeting
with the managements

00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:38.020
of a lot of the cable TV
investments that we have.

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:43.400
We own QVC, the TV and
internet shopping network.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.550
Charter Communications,
recently meeting

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:48.260
with the management
and GE, which

00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:52.220
has been a breath of fresh
air, in terms of the change

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:54.500
at the company, but not
entirely pleasant for us,

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:58.410
because it's been a position
we've owned for a while.

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:03.110
But to us, there's no
substitute for the sitting

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:05.750
across the table and getting
a feel of what's really

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:07.740
important to these people.

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:10.719
And again, along the lines of to
earn an active management fee,

00:56:10.719 --> 00:56:12.260
you've got to be
able to do something

00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:15.590
that a computer can't do.

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:20.090
After you've interviewed
100 investment--

00:56:20.090 --> 00:56:23.150
100 corporate management
teams, you really

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:26.420
start to have an ability to
say these guys are really

00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:29.360
above average,
these not so much.

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:31.820
And you don't have to
be perfect with it,

00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:35.950
but if you can be better than
50/50 at how you bucket them,

00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:38.300
as above average
and below average,

00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:41.780
it can be a tremendous
addition to what's

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:45.592
largely a quantitative
approach to investing.

00:56:45.592 --> 00:56:47.550
SAURABH MADAAN: I think
your love, and passion,

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:51.320
and enthusiasm for
investing is very obvious,

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.450
and it's very contagious.

00:56:53.450 --> 00:56:55.940
Thank you so much for sharing
your thoughts with us.

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:58.315
If you we have any last minute
questions in the audience,

00:56:58.315 --> 00:56:59.200
we're open.

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.990
I'll just repeat the question.

00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:03.710
There was this talk about is
there a bubble in the market,

00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:06.140
everything seemed overvalued.

00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.670
Other people are making a
lot of money out of bitcoin.

00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:11.850
And what do we do right now?

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:13.670
BILL NYGREN: So we're
generally in the camp

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:16.490
that if you can't understand
how something is priced,

00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:18.790
it's better not
to talk about it.

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:22.010
But intellectually, I'm more
in the camp with Jamie Dimon,

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:25.010
that I have a very hard
time understanding why

00:57:25.010 --> 00:57:28.040
Bitcoin is valued
at whatever price

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:30.280
it ends up being valued at.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:35.330
And you're not going to find
it in the Oakmark portfolios.

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:41.540
I don't think markets today
are in bubble territory.

00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:44.960
P/Es are only slightly
higher than they've averaged

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.270
in the past 30 or 40 years.

00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:48.980
And I think with
interest rates as low

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:53.810
as they are, inflation as low as
it is, it makes sense that P/Es

00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:56.450
would be somewhat elevated.

00:57:56.450 --> 00:58:01.460
Not to mention the things like
all the technology companies

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:05.630
that are making so many
investments in areas tangential

00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:08.450
to their basic business,
that are depressing

00:58:08.450 --> 00:58:09.620
current earnings.

00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:14.420
And one of the statistics I put
in the last commentary we wrote

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:18.800
was that if the four FANG
stocks weren't in the S&amp;P 500,

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:22.470
the S&amp;P multiple would be
about a point and a half lower.

00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:25.400
Which when you're talking
about a multiple that's maybe

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.920
two or three points elevated
relative to history,

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.210
a point and half is a big deal.

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:32.120
And I don't take
the stocks out just

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.370
because they look
expensive on a P/E basis,

00:58:34.370 --> 00:58:38.870
but P/E is such a bad metric
for measuring the value

00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:41.180
of those four companies.

00:58:41.180 --> 00:58:43.970
So we don't think the
market's really elevated.

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:47.090
You know, the recovery's
nine years old.

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:48.920
But the magnitude
of the recovery

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:53.540
has been relatively trivial
compared to historic growth

00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:54.860
of the economy.

00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:57.920
Recessions come about to
correct excesses in the economy.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:01.670
It's hard to see those
excesses being created.

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:04.190
To me, the more fascinating
part of your question

00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:08.210
is how do you deal with
a bubble like 2000,

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:11.360
where a strict
discipline valuation

00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:14.780
approach to investing just
says none of these names

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:15.840
make sense to us.

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.100
We can't figure out the values.

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.120
And how do you keep
people invested with you

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.360
when you're holding the line
that says these names just

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:27.040
don't make sense.

00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.040
The Oakmark fund assets
peaked at about $10 billion

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:34.132
in 1997, '98.

00:59:34.132 --> 00:59:35.590
And even though
our net asset value

00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:40.060
had been about flat for
the following two years,

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.520
our assets were
down to $2 billion.

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:44.500
Because we refused
to buy anything

00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:47.920
in the technology space, people
took 80% of the investments

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:49.660
away from us.

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.534
And that's a tremendously
difficult time

00:59:52.534 --> 00:59:54.700
when you're running a
business and you've got people

00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.850
to employ, that you want
to have continue with you,

00:59:57.850 --> 00:59:59.800
and you're seeing your
revenues fall by 80%.

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:05.140
I remember at a
conference call I was on.

01:00:05.140 --> 01:00:09.370
One of the advisors who was
in the process of selling out

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:12.400
of the fund, was
pleading with me, saying

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.620
won't you please just
on one technology stock,

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.120
because if you buy
one of them, then

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:17.830
I can go back to my
investment committee

01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:19.930
and tell them that's OK.

01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:22.420
And I remember saying
to her, I said,

01:00:22.420 --> 01:00:25.270
if we could find one that
fit our value criteria,

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:28.120
we'd happily own
it, but we can't.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:29.934
And because of that we won't.

01:00:29.934 --> 01:00:31.600
I said, and I'll bet
you something else.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.180
There is going to be
a time in the future

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.970
that you're going to say
it's not that Oakmark's

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:41.740
incapable of buying technology,
but when technology is out

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:44.140
of favor, we're going to
own more than the market

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.830
weighting in it.

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:47.590
And I said, you're
probably going

01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:50.350
to be just as upset with
us then as you are now.

01:00:50.350 --> 01:00:52.360
Because we're investing
in something then

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:54.550
that would be unpopular.

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.480
And it's tough.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.580
But if you don't stick
to your discipline--

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:01.420
there was a Chicago
firm that was

01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:05.050
known more for growth
investing that was still

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:07.480
a pretty strong
fundamental value firm,

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:10.120
but they applied it
to growth stocks.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:16.100
And about February of 2000, they
threw in the towel, and said,

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.680
we've lost too many
of our investors,

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.660
we're going to start
buying these very high

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:21.610
priced internet names,
even though they

01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:24.580
don't work under the
way we used to invest.

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.140
So they didn't
ride the market up.

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:27.460
They rode it all the way down.

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.950
And it put their
firm out of business.

01:01:29.950 --> 01:01:33.370
You mentioned earlier, I was
named Morningstar Manager

01:01:33.370 --> 01:01:35.860
of the Year in 2001.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:39.220
It wasn't that we did anything
different in 2001 than we

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:42.760
did in 2000, or '99, or '99.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.870
It was the market suddenly
corrected valuation excesses.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.120
And the traditional
companies we'd

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.030
owned through this whole
period went up in price

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:56.110
significantly, while all the
tech names came crashing down.

01:01:56.110 --> 01:01:59.740
But it was the discipline
to say we're going

01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.950
to keep doing the same thing.

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:03.820
And we know if
we're fundamentally

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:07.950
right on the analysis, the stock
prices will eventually follow.

01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:10.840
And we're not going
to try and placate

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:16.360
investors who want to see us
invest in the current bubble.

01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:20.470
I remember being
on CNBC back then,

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:24.580
talking about how high priced we
thought technology names were.

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:28.792
And I hopped into a cab
on my way home from work.

01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:31.000
And I can see the cab driver
looking in his rear view

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.450
mirror, and he's like
I think I know you.

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.060
And I'm like--

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.900
I kind of got my head down, and
I'm like no, I don't think so.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.310
He was like, yeah, yeah, I do.

01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:42.121
I've seen you on TV.

01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:43.780
And I'm like maybe.

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.730
He's like, you're
that guy on CNBC.

01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:49.932
And my portfolio's
kicking your butt.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.390
And I'm like, you know what,
it's not that far to my house,

01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:53.890
why don't you just
drop me off here,

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:55.720
I'll walk the rest of the way.

01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.710
But when things
get that popular,

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:03.310
it's very rare that they end
up being good investments.

01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:06.740
And as long term
value investors,

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:09.460
we get a lot of comfort
from the history

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:12.130
of seeing bubbles
grow and bubbles pop.

01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:16.570
And the people who
whether those bubbles

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:20.860
well are the ones who had a
philosophy that grounded them

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:25.035
and they didn't change it to
reflect bubble level pricing.

01:03:27.254 --> 01:03:28.920
SAURABH MADAAN: Well,
thank you so much.

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.320
Really appreciate all the
time that you took being here.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.610
BILL NYGREN: Great, thank you.

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:34.730
Thank you all.
