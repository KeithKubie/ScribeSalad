&gt;&gt; Hi YouTubers, I'm Sophie from Cameroon.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.601
&gt;&gt; I'm Samantha from South Africa

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:06.920
&gt;&gt; I'm Tesama from Ethopia

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.330
&gt;&gt; I'm Patrick from Zimbabwe

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.720
&gt;&gt; I'm Apier from Ghana

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.710
&gt;&gt; There is one year to go before the kick-off
of the World Cup in South Africa. It's the

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.990
first time the World Cup has been held on
the African continent. But the question is,

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.840
would the whole continent benefit?

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.339

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:32.550
&gt;&gt; Become part of the debate of the 2009 African
Summit in Capetown this June.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.680
&gt;&gt; Thank you YouTubers.
