00:00:00.404 --> 00:00:02.873
- [Instructor] We are
asked, what is a reasonable

00:00:02.873 --> 00:00:07.785
estimate for the limit of g
of x as x approaches three?

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:10.510
So what we have here in
blue, this is the graph

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.929
of y is equal to g of x,
and we wanna think about

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.798
what is the limit as x approaches three,

00:00:17.798 --> 00:00:20.367
so this is x equals three here.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:21.630
So what you need to do is,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.108
think about what is the
limit of this function

00:00:24.108 --> 00:00:26.547
as we approach three from the left,

00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:27.542
and we're also gonna think about

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:28.956
what is the limit of this function,

00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:30.729
what does it appear to be from the graph,

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:33.109
as we approach this value from the right.

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:35.750
And if it looks like we're
approaching the same value,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.387
then that would be a reasonable
estimate for the limit,

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:40.005
and the reason why they
say reasonable estimate

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.403
is 'cause we're gonna do it by inspection.

00:00:42.403 --> 00:00:44.649
We don't have a lot more
information about the graph

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.762
to know for sure, but from the graph,

00:00:46.762 --> 00:00:48.864
we can come up with a reasonable estimate.

00:00:48.864 --> 00:00:51.106
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:52.106
on your own.

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:57.275
Alright, so let's think
about it in two parts.

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.665
Let's think about
approaching x equals three,

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:03.095
or let's think about the
limit as x approaches three

00:01:03.095 --> 00:01:07.262
from the left, as we approach
x equals three from the left.

00:01:08.365 --> 00:01:11.505
So as we approach x equals
three from the left,

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:15.005
our graph seems to be, our graph seems to,

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.054
if I just eyeball it,
seems to be approaching

00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:21.832
the value four.

00:01:21.832 --> 00:01:25.999
So from the left, it looks
like we are approaching four.

00:01:27.364 --> 00:01:28.717
Approaching, or let me write it this way,

00:01:28.717 --> 00:01:31.541
g of x approaching four.

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.791
G of x approaching four,

00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:40.886
as x approaches three from the left.

00:01:42.215 --> 00:01:44.044
Now let's think about it from the right.

00:01:44.044 --> 00:01:46.746
As x approaches three from the right,

00:01:46.746 --> 00:01:49.536
what does it look like
g of x is approaching?

00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:53.065
Well, it looks like g of x is
approaching negative three,

00:01:53.065 --> 00:01:56.998
as x approaches three from the right.

00:01:56.998 --> 00:02:00.165
So I could say, g of x approaching,

00:02:02.325 --> 00:02:06.492
approaching negative three
as x approaches three

00:02:08.474 --> 00:02:09.724
from the right.

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.463
And so we have two different values here.

00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:16.015
When we approach from the left,

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:18.418
it looks like g of x is approaching four,

00:02:18.418 --> 00:02:20.116
and when we approach from the right,

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:22.933
it looks like g of x is
approaching negative three.

00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:24.600
And so because of that, we would say

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.054
that this limit right over here,

00:02:26.054 --> 00:02:29.990
it's reasonable to say that
this limit doesn't exist.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.490
So I'll write, does not exist,

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:39.277
based on looking at this
graph right over here.

00:02:39.277 --> 00:02:41.802
And a good clue that it won't exist

00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:45.457
is the x value where we're
trying to find the limit at,

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:48.766
you see this jump in the
graph right over here,

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:52.969
it is discontinuous, it jumps
from one value to another,

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:57.136
which is a good clue that the
limit might not exist here.
