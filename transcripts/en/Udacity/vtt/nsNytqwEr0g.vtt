00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.100
In the last lesson we learned exactly how an individual

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.700
gene gets turned into a protein. This genetic code we

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.280
analogize to a book of recipes representing our genome.We want

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.690
to revisit this analogy for this lesson but we going to

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.070
think about it a little bit different. Instead of these

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.420
ingredents being used to make a single protein. We're going to take

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.070
each of these ingredients individually as a its own protein

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.550
to build a particular trait or even a whole human being.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.520
Let's get started. And, if we want to build

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:29.930
a human being the first thing I'm going to do

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.180
is take our ingredient which represents one protein.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.480
And then then I'll start measuring out one tablespoon.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.470
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay so this is one protein? That's right.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.430
&gt;&gt; Well, one human coming right up.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.030
&gt;&gt; Lauren, did you just pour all of the flour in the bowl?

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you said flour was in the recipe, and I'm assuming

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.650
it takes a lot of flower to make a human. We're huge.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.820
&gt;&gt; This is

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.360
true, but it's like a gene. You can't add the whole thing at once. You've

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.120
got to add the right amount at the right time to get the right produce.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.390
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm sorry, but I guess you're

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.440
right. There are over 20,000 genes in the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.100
human genome. If we added all of them all at once all at the same time,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.920
every cell would be identical. Because they'd all

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.760
have the same ingredients at the same time,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.220
and obviously that's not what we want. To

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.120
get different cell types at different times, we actually

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.150
need to add different ingredients at different times in different amounts. So

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.690
we must specify these ingredients, and we have to specify the amounts.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.350
&gt;&gt; Well where does the specificity come from.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.660
Like how does a skin cell know to

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.440
be a skin cell, and how does a brain cell know to be a brain cell?

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.670
&gt;&gt; The short answer is development. Development is a process

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.950
by which the right gene is added at the right time

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.750
to make the right cell type. It's how cell knows

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.450
to be a certain cell type out of the many thousands

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.810
it could possibly be, for example, the cells in your hand.
