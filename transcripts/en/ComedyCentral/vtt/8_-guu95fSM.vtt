00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:04.270
(cop show music)

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.775
- [Radio] Car 67,
come in car 67.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:10.710
- This is car 67,
- This is car 67,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.078 align:start size:81% position:19%
- we're code five,
- code five,

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:16.116 align:start size:97% position:3%
- nothing to report.
- we've got nothing to report.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.586
(saxophone)

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.991
(car horn honking)

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.330
- 1:14 a.m.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.831
- You don't have
to put this on it.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:34.501 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Moses falls asleep, hits
head on steering wheel,

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:39.139 align:start size:84% position:16%
honks horn, gets
slobber all over car.

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:40.807
- I think we can leave
that out of the report.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.042 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Why, you wanna do
everything by the book,

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.643
right, big guy? Huh?

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:46.312
Finished, written in stone.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.182
There ya go.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.652
What do ya see?

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.790
- Nothing, just a...

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.658
- Oh shit, he's breaking in.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:00:59.692
Come on, let's go.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:00.960
- You don't know that!

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.195
- He's peeking in
the window, Moses.

00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:03.663
- That doesn't mean
he's breaking in.

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.632
- Look at him.

00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:08.668
- [Moses] Okay, loitering,
maybe, public intoxication,

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.071 align:start size:94% position:6%
maybe, but I'm not wasting
my time on a loiterer

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.573
just because you're
uncomfortable with a,

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.508
certain type of person.

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:19.012
- Certain type of person?

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:21.147
Are you calling me what I
think you're calling me?

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.116 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You know good and well
that's what you were thinking.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:26.286
- No, I was thinking, his
actions are suspicious.

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:28.254 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm just saying, we
shouldn't jump to conclusions

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:31.324 align:start size:97% position:3%
just because this fine
gentleman is African American.

00:01:31.324 --> 00:01:33.259 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Oh, there's a,
there's a conclusion.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.295 align:start size:88% position:13%
There's a racist
conclusion right there.

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:37.897
How do you know he's
African American, huh?

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.365
He could be African Jamaican,

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.734 align:start size:84% position:16%
he could be African
Luxembourgian,

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.002
how do you know?
(glass shatters)

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.737 align:start size:75% position:25%
Oh, shit--
- No, hey, hey.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.240
He's probably drunk and has
to break into his house,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.875
because he doesn't a key.

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:50.877 align:start size:88% position:13%
Who in this car can
understand being drunk,

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:53.079
and breaking into your own home?

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.280
Chance?

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.949 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Now that was a pretty
cheap shot, Moses.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.584
I broke into my house
to prove to Theresa

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.452
that I've moved on, okay?

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:00.854
- [Moses] By the way, I
don't think it's weird

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:02.021 align:start size:88% position:13%
that a black guy dressed
like that would live

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.590 align:start size:84% position:16%
in this neighborhood,
there I said it.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.891
- [Chance] Why do you feel
you have to clarify that?

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:06.192 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Moses] I mean he's
probably a really

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.461
successful record producer.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.499
- Come on!

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Are you really gonna
shoot an African American,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.470
registered firearm owner,
protecting his own home?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.872
Okay, he is a patriot.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:19.873
- You know what I think?

00:02:19.873 --> 00:02:21.207
- Enlighten me, please.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:24.377 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I think you're worried
that you're a racist,

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:27.080
and if you arrest a black
man, it's gonna prove it.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.615
- [Moses] Okay,
I'm racist, sure.

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.017 align:start size:84% position:16%
Would a racist donate
to every single

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:33.953 align:start size:88% position:13%
black Kickstarter out
there, I don't think so.

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:34.888
(woman screams)

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:37.190
- Oh, okay, let me guess.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.893
That's his wife, and he's, uh,

00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:42.962 align:start position:0%
he's come home early to surprise
her, is that what it is?

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.398 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Or they're engaging
in some sexual roleplay.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:48.434
I mean, one time my wife
had me hide in the bushes

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:51.204
and surprise her on
her jogging route.

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:55.275 align:start size:94% position:6%
And then, I surprised her,
I surprised her again,

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.644
and then she surprised me.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:59.279
- Really?

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.880
That's pretty hot man.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.851 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah, it's, been a lot
tamer since the kids.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:08.621
(gunshot, woman screaming)

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.889
I voted for Obama!

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.157
- I didn't vote but I
live in a blue state!

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:12.659
- [Moses] You should
always try to vote!

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.662
You should always vote!
- Same thing, same thing!

00:03:16.896 --> 00:03:18.798
(girlish scream)

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:19.866
- What the hell man?

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:21.301
- You are under arrest.

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.869
You have the right
to remain silent.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.771
This has nothing to do
with you being black.

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:25.939
Anything you say, can and will--

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.373
- Honey, what's happening?

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:28.675
- Classic black sitcom.

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:31.010
- What the hell's going on?

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.313
- He was clearly breaking
into your house, ma'am.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:34.480
- No!

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.317 align:start size:88% position:13%
- We are into some
adventurous love making.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.053
I pretend to break in,
and she gets all nasty

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.388 align:start size:84% position:16%
and into it, it's
fantasy motherfucker.

00:03:42.388 --> 00:03:45.558
And then, you tackled
me right on my dick.

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.761 align:start size:88% position:13%
Feels all twisted,
like maybe he broke it.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.096
- You can't break a dick.

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:51.297
- You can break a dick.

00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:53.499
- You can break a dick?
- Very much so, yes.

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.202
(girlish scream)

00:03:56.202 --> 00:03:57.804
- Neighborhood watch, stay down!

00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.672 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We're cops, get
off of me you idiot!

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.374
- As far as I can tell, ya'll
just a couple of white dudes

00:04:01.374 --> 00:04:03.176
with guns up to no good.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.111 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Nobody holds up a
successful record producer

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.679
in my neighborhood.

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.615 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Record producer,
I called that.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:09.782 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Neighborhood Watch]
Keeping property values high,

00:04:09.782 --> 00:04:12.452 align:start size:84% position:16%
motherfucker.
- That's what we do.
