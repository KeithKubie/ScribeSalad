00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.210
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.211 --> 00:00:05.200
just before Friday,

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:09.400
Monday morning podcast and just checking in on you.

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.660
How's it going? As you can hopefully immediately tell,

5
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.630
especially after I just pushed that button. I uh, I forgot my book.

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.080
I didn't forget my recording equipment.

7
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:22.750
I'm having a problem with one of the chords.

8
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:26.410
I can't tell if the cord got stepped on and it's fucked up or the Jack to my

9
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:27.480
computer's messed up.

10
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.640
What I've learned in life to not force things because you just make a bad

11
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:34.690
situation a little worse.

12
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.150
So I'm just Kinda have to record this one. Uh, like this and maybe Monday,

13
00:00:40.151 --> 00:00:43.450
cause I'm on the road right now. I'm out here in Nashville, Tennessee,

14
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.090
Nashville, Tennessee,

15
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.150
home with the Grand Ole Opry and that fucking river that overflows and the,

16
00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:54.580
the evil look and build in downtown. Other than that, wonderful people,

17
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.610
great food and all that type of shit. Um,

18
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.470
I'm out here for one day and one day only.

19
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.030
I know you guys probably think, well, what the fuck bill,

20
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:07.170
you didn't advertise it on your goddamn website. Are you doing a stand up show?

21
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:10.140
I am not. What I am doing is a,

22
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:15.141
I'm doing a panel thing for F is for family with uh,

23
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.220
the Great Mike Price, co-creator co creator of the show from the Simpsons.

24
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.670
We're doing like a live thing where they show an episode and then we answered

25
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:24.960
some questions, um,

26
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.961
hosted by Russell Peters and it's going to be on XM Sirius.

27
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.610
I don't know what channel of course, cause I'm a moron,

28
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:36.190
but that's basically what I'm doing here. And then I go

29
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.180
<v 1>off to a Calgary tomorrow morning, Calgary, Edmonton, and then Seattle.</v>

30
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.520
So, oh, do I got some stories for you? I hope these levels are okay.

31
00:01:46.521 --> 00:01:51.170
I did my best with them. Um, this was my plane ride out to Nashville,

32
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:54.080
so we wrote all day. And then, uh,

33
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.810
I took the red eye out and um,

34
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.590
the dude who sat next to me on the fucking plane, God bless him,

35
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:04.680
but he's one of these guys, man, if he doesn't turn it around,

36
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.150
he's not gonna see 50,

37
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.410
because he was one of those guys who was abusing his body so bad.

38
00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:15.760
Like I can, like when I go go to guesses age, it's going to,

39
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.020
he was either like

40
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.670
<v 0>26 to 28 or like 37.</v>

41
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.370
I couldn't tell,

42
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.780
<v 1>but he looked as old as me. Um,</v>

43
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.380
he looked like he was, if he was my age, you're like, dude,

44
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.700
you've got like another two years.

45
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.780
Cause if you fucking did that to yourself for close to 48 years,

46
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:43.310
you would be done this fucking guy, man. Holy Shit. He put on a display.

47
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.510
All right. So you know it's late at night and take them right.

48
00:02:47.511 --> 00:02:51.290
I like I said 11:00 PM and I got the aisle,

49
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:52.850
he's got the window right.

50
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.970
And fortunately my Sciatica is almost right. Yeah. But

51
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.120
<v 0>gone away. And, um, I just been, you know,</v>

52
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:02.860
taking it easy and uh,

53
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.500
it's just sort of naturally working itself out while doing all the,

54
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.480
all the stretches and all that shit. So anyways,

55
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.580
he's got the fucking window seat and I'm thinking I'm being smarter than the

56
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.170
aisle thing because all right,

57
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.350
if I need to stretch I can just step out into the island and won't have to step

58
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:21.840
over anybody. Um, cause I fucked up last time I went to St Louis,

59
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.320
I flew southwest and I wasn't thinking,

60
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.810
I just went to the window seat and then I was trapped, you know,

61
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.310
on the other side of two other people.

62
00:03:29.311 --> 00:03:31.500
So this time I'm thinking I'm being smart,

63
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.850
but it turns out my back feels great and now all I want to do was go to sleep.

64
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.550
And this fucking guy, man, Holy Shit,

65
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.660
this guy was like crushing the fucking airport bar.

66
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.070
I don't know how many fucking Jack and cokes this guy drank,

67
00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:52.010
but he just kept going like that. The guy would, he would just go,

68
00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:54.440
can I get another one? And then the guy would bring it over and you'd be like,

69
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.710
my dude, thank you. Right somebody is, he said my dude,

70
00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.020
and then he would just be sucking these sinks down.

71
00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:03.560
And he was one of these fucking guys that was so out of shape.

72
00:04:03.561 --> 00:04:08.270
Like he snored while he was awake. You know what I mean? He,

73
00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:10.880
the noises this guy makes, right?

74
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.860
So after about, I don't know,

75
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:17.550
like fucking five of these things were in the flight. I'm starting to nod off,

76
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.480
he fucking goes to step over me.

77
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.600
Mountain of a man goes to step over me, you know,

78
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:29.040
which of course sorta wakes me up and he goes into the bathroom and I notice

79
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:32.460
he's wearing his socks. Fucking animal.

80
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.370
This guy is like trying to kill himself from all sides. You know what I mean?

81
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.210
Death comes from the mouth, but he's also trying to fucking speed it up.

82
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.780
Try to go into the express lane by bringing a little in through the fucking

83
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.450
pores of the bottom of his feet. People.

84
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.800
It's not your fault that you weren't raised right,

85
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:55.000
but you gotta look around in life. Okay. You gotta do the fucking math.

86
00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:00.070
I almost think, what do you think it's is grocer to,

87
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.100
to be in your bare feet or in your socks?

88
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:05.460
I know initially the bare feet has worked worse,

89
00:05:05.461 --> 00:05:10.110
but there's something about the socks just absorbing it and like, you know,

90
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.710
the next day if you put them on again after you took a shower,

91
00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:17.340
you still got the fucking shit and cause it's going into your feet no matter

92
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:21.390
what. One of the grossest things. So the entire fucking flight,

93
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.450
this guy has just pound and Jack and cokes. I mean he had,

94
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.200
he must've had like nine of them on like a a,

95
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.190
I don't know how long that flight is, like four fucking hours.

96
00:05:32.191 --> 00:05:35.400
And I'm trying to sleep and I can't get to sleep cause you know, he's a big guy,

97
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:38.290
he's a cool guy. He was trying to step over, you know, at one point I,

98
00:05:38.291 --> 00:05:42.990
I did that Vietnamese gambler squat and he's like, he goes,

99
00:05:42.991 --> 00:05:45.780
what are you doing? You're praying over there. You all right? And I said, no,

100
00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:49.920
I gotta I gotta Sadek nervous, you know, he goes, Oh man, that's sucks.

101
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.230
So I couldn't get mad at him cause he was friendly,

102
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:54.060
but every time he went to step over me,

103
00:05:54.061 --> 00:05:57.920
he'd fucking wake me up and then I'd look and he'd be going the bathroom just

104
00:05:57.921 --> 00:06:02.690
wearing new socks. And it just was driving me fucking nuts. So finally,

105
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.010
all I'm thinking is going, my God,

106
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.800
when this fucking mountain of a man goes down,

107
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.900
like he is going to Snore, like, uh,

108
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.890
I mean I've never had the displeasure of sleeping next to Terry Saragoussi,

109
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.260
whatever's Tony Saragoussi,

110
00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.200
but I imagined he was gonna sound like whatever that guy sounds like at like two

111
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:24.110
o'clock in the fucking morning. Right. But it was aware to stay.

112
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.770
He was snoring while he was awake, but when he was, when he went to sleep,

113
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:30.890
he didn't make a fucking sound. And uh, oh,

114
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:32.960
he kept dropping his fucking iPhone.

115
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.830
He had his shoes off and just the noises he was trying to make to try to pick it

116
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:39.830
up. It's like, why the fuck would you do to that? Do that to yourself,

117
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.490
these fucking people that treat their own bodies like a rental car,

118
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:44.570
I just don't understand it.

119
00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:48.350
It's like you can't return this fucking thing at the end of the weekend.

120
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:49.520
You got to keep it.

121
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.060
This is the vessel that's going to bring you around for your fucking life.

122
00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:56.390
You know? I mean, I should talk the way I fucking booze, but you know,

123
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.840
I still do my jumping jacks and I know a couple of cartwheels to keep the

124
00:06:59.841 --> 00:07:03.170
stomach down, you know. So anyways, the flight fucking ends,

125
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.610
my travel is all fucked up for whatever reason. And I'm,

126
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:12.830
I'm basically, by the time they booked my hotel,

127
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.880
everything was sold out. So I had a hotel for the night,

128
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:20.150
but I couldn't check in until three in the afternoon. So I go, you know,

129
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:23.660
so they booked me in another hotel and the person, you know,

130
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:28.100
the travel person goes, so you got to check in at this hotel, you know,

131
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:31.790
at five 30 in the morning and then check out at 12 and then check in for the

132
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:35.840
other places. That is like at 3:00 PM it's like, is that cool?

133
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.010
And I'm like, no, it's not cool. Like, do you ever travel?

134
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:43.730
Is that the way you set up your travel? Do you want to switch hotels?

135
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.390
You know, in the same fucking city you staying. But I mean,

136
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:49.520
I don't have any choice, so it's going to have to be cool.

137
00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.740
So I fucking take a cab over there.

138
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:55.130
I get to the place at like fucking five 30 in the morning. This is like planes,

139
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:57.980
trains and automobiles, right? I get there and they're like, ah,

140
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.950
what's an under? And I'm like, oh no. I'm like bill bird. They're like,

141
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:08.390
yeah, see I'm like William, Eh rumple fucking stills Gavin up.

142
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.490
Got It right. And the guy keeps going, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm like,

143
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:14.990
well I know it's not your fault.

144
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:18.590
So now it's like fucking five in the goddamn morning.

145
00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.530
I've got no place to stay. And he goes,

146
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:25.160
well the bellhop can take you over to the fucking waffle house, right.

147
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.630
Sorry if I make Mike know he's here,

148
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:29.210
I got to move this laptop around cause I want you to fucking hear this thing.

149
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:34.010
It's like, yeah, I'm sorry if you know. Sorry about that.

150
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:37.460
So the fucking to now, I'd like fucking f five 20 in the morning.

151
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.660
I got no place to stay till three in the afternoon. I'm fucking dead tired.

152
00:08:41.661 --> 00:08:45.620
I couldn't sleep because all fatty cakes over there was drinking the fucking a

153
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.800
jack and coke saw night's stepping over on me.

154
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:53.950
But this fucking piss and shit infested soak socks and now they don't have a

155
00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:56.940
room for me and now I'm to a waffle house. Right.

156
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.210
So I get to the fucking waffle house,

157
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.720
you know it fucking quarter to six in the morning,

158
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:07.080
half expecting to see Jay z finishing the end of that song.

159
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.780
You know that fucking thing.

160
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.530
Go to the waffle house then we're going to do it again. How the fuck did you,

161
00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.810
I guess he'd be walking out with them,

162
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.680
right the banger and then kick around at seven while Beyonce sings lemonade in

163
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:21.810
the background. I don't know what the fuck it is. Those two too. I,

164
00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:26.070
I don't pretend to know. I'm an old man anyways, so I walk in there,

165
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.370
bunch of fucking characters and uh, I'm Blair, he died.

166
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.600
I'm not even fucking hungry,

167
00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:36.870
but I know I can't just sit in there like some sort of vagrant soil or some eggs

168
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:37.820
in a fucking waffle.

169
00:09:37.821 --> 00:09:42.821
And I'm sitting there and this black guy in there wearing a suit and he's,

170
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.470
he's like an anomaly. I don't know how to, he's a black guy,

171
00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:49.550
but he isn't funny.

172
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.180
<v 4>It's very rare. It's like an obese Asian.</v>

173
00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:58.030
It's very rare that you see like obesity, just, you know,

174
00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.020
I don't know what food they eat over in Asia,

175
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.830
but I mean whatever that doing that,

176
00:10:02.831 --> 00:10:06.480
doing it right with all the vegetables in the third fried, those,

177
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:07.870
those people are phenomenal.

178
00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:12.010
<v 0>Okay. And always getting hope, right? He wants you very rare.</v>

179
00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:15.290
You meet a black guy who wasn't funny and this fucking guy is not funny. Any,

180
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:16.440
won't shut the fuck up.

181
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.820
He keeps telling jokes and he's laughing at his own fucking jokes and I just

182
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:21.091
want to,

183
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:26.091
I want to stab myself with my fucking waffle house fucking fork.

184
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.790
So at one point he just won't shut up.

185
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.150
And then finally one of the waitresses makes a joke. Well,

186
00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:35.950
the other way to see other way just goes, you know,

187
00:10:35.951 --> 00:10:38.380
don't be walking up behind me. You know, you don't want to, you know,

188
00:10:38.381 --> 00:10:41.650
you don't want to basically fuck with me. And then the lady goes,

189
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.640
and now she goes, I don't fight pregnant women. And she wasn't pregnant. Okay.

190
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:50.950
But admittedly it was a decent joke. The unfunny black dude in the suit,

191
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:56.530
you know, high pitch LAPP stands up, runs out of the waffle house,

192
00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.540
goes out to the front and does like a fucking three 60 turn.

193
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.570
And I immediately, the fucking, you know,

194
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:09.550
the road weary comedian and me going like, all right, dude, it was funny.

195
00:11:09.551 --> 00:11:12.850
It wasn't that fucking funny. And, uh,

196
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:14.220
<v 4>okay.</v>

197
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.800
<v 0>He comes back in and then I don't, I mean, I didn't know what the fuck to do.</v>

198
00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:19.350
I'm like, what the fuck am I going to do with myself? I can't go to sleep.

199
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:22.700
My phone's running out of batteries. I'm charging it there.

200
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.210
It was just a fucking nightmare. So, uh, I just started calling hotels.

201
00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:29.660
They're all fucking booked up. I don't know what's going on here in Nashville.

202
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:33.140
If there's some sort of fucking Banjo festival, I have no fucking idea,

203
00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.550
but there's no way, some Jesus Shit, you know,

204
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.020
or some, you know, democratic or Republican convention, I have no fucking idea,

205
00:11:42.021 --> 00:11:46.090
but I cannot get a room. So, you know, I'm like, what do I do?

206
00:11:46.091 --> 00:11:48.010
So I called in the opion Jimmy show,

207
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.500
I talked to them for a minute and then I was just like, what am I doing?

208
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:55.300
So I finally called the cat and I just went over to the hotel then I was

209
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:59.950
supposed to be yet. And they were like, and they were like, oh yeah,

210
00:11:59.951 --> 00:12:01.840
you know, somebody called said you, you know,

211
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.460
fucking last night if we could get you in. Unfortunately we cannot, blah blah,

212
00:12:05.461 --> 00:12:09.910
blah, blah, blah. So I at least checked my bags, you know,

213
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:13.390
I felt like a fucking homeless person when I was in the waffle house with the

214
00:12:13.391 --> 00:12:14.260
unfunny black dude.

215
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:19.261
And I had my fucking bags on the inside of myself as I sat in the booth,

216
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:22.120
made for two fucking people. But it was sitting there by myself. Right.

217
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:23.230
So I get to the hotel,

218
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:28.260
I at least checked in my bags and they had a fucking like a couch in the lobby

219
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:34.930
of this place. They go, we're already cleaning a room at this point,

220
00:12:34.931 --> 00:12:38.710
it's six 30 in the morning. And I'm like, great. Whenever you can get me in,

221
00:12:38.711 --> 00:12:42.580
if I gotta pay extra, I just don't give a shit. Right. So they say fine.

222
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:45.730
So I go over and I just laid down on the couch,

223
00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:50.230
put my hat over my eyes and I just pass out.

224
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.470
I'm talking like I wasn't even trying to be a gentleman.

225
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:56.110
I had both feet up on the fucking couch. I was like,

226
00:12:56.111 --> 00:13:00.880
this is my bed and I'm just sleeping there and I just keep hearing people's,

227
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:03.490
they're getting waking up, getting on with their day. Like,

228
00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.480
do you want to get some small things?

229
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.320
I hear they have such great eggs and all this shit.

230
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:10.250
And then the one point this guy walked by, you know,

231
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:14.950
it was fucking assholes who whistle a fucking, you know, I think I tweeted,

232
00:13:14.951 --> 00:13:18.940
nobody likes a whistler at some point. This fucking guy just came by whistling,

233
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.180
you know, just, it's just some random song. It's not even,

234
00:13:22.181 --> 00:13:23.200
it's not even a fucking song.

235
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:26.680
He's just whistling cause that's what the fuck he does. Um,

236
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.740
and uh, then I just completely,

237
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:34.120
I was just zonked out and then all of a sudden I just feel somebody pushing me

238
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.260
once twice and I fucking wake up and then they go, hey Mr [inaudible],

239
00:13:38.261 --> 00:13:40.510
your room's ready. I'm like thinking, oh thank God.

240
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:43.600
And I thought it was like seven 30 in the morning. I looked, it was like 10,

241
00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:47.410
15 if it's sleeping there, like a bum full, like four hours.

242
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.130
So I finally ended up getting my fucking room.

243
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.030
And uh, fortunately it was one of these rooms that has the great curtains.

244
00:13:58.031 --> 00:14:02.650
I was able to close them and it felt like midnight and I'm then I just fucking

245
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:04.510
crashed, woke up,

246
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:09.150
met some friends that I've met along the way on the road and uh,

247
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:12.280
took a drum lesson. Um,

248
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.860
I hate dropping names on this, but like,

249
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.740
they're one of my favorite bands out there right now.

250
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:20.260
Mute math is based out of here. And uh,

251
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.700
I got some lunch and Darren King actually gave me a little drum lesson.

252
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.430
I still stink, but it was fucking like,

253
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.610
I was beyond geeking out that I got to do it. So, um,

254
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.760
it was a bad day and I actually, uh,

255
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.520
ended up turning it around and uh,

256
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.670
I'll tell you what's funny is if you notice in the story, I never flipped up.

257
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.180
Bear with me, watch your ears. I gotta Click and drag this thing over.

258
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:45.820
Just hang on a second. I apologize. Here we go. Here we go.

259
00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:49.140
It's almost over and it's over. And I just realized,

260
00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:52.850
I have no idea how much time I'm doing here. The fuck does this mean here?

261
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:58.180
Four 47 448 448 one millimeters is just a metric system.

262
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:05.880
Where the fuck's the timer? How do I tell him at the time I'm doing all right.

263
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.890
You're just going to have to fucking deal with this. I apologize. Anyways. Um,

264
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.710
I've got this weird thing when like major shit happens. Like I don't, um,

265
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.860
I don't flip out like bigger shit like this.

266
00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.830
I don't flip out little shit bugs me.

267
00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.730
Like 20 minutes ago I'm going down in the elevator and we just hit every fucking

268
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.080
floor and every fucking floor is another person coming on a fucking full grown

269
00:15:31.081 --> 00:15:34.680
adult wearing their name, a name tag around their neck.

270
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:39.420
Like it's their first day of preschool and everybody knows everybody. Hey Carl.

271
00:15:39.421 --> 00:15:41.850
Like the shorts, you wear those to the meeting.

272
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.380
It crazy right down one more floor. Every fucking floor.

273
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:50.510
It's getting more and more packed and then I have to sit there and listen to

274
00:15:50.511 --> 00:15:55.430
office humor. Right? I'll tell you right now, if you think every once in awhile,

275
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.790
a random black dude in a suit in a waffle house isn't funny.

276
00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.390
Wait till you're in a crowded elevator with a bunch of people that sit in

277
00:16:02.391 --> 00:16:03.290
cubicles all day.

278
00:16:03.291 --> 00:16:07.310
They had their fucking name tags around their neck listening to their jokes for

279
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:12.020
eight fucking floors that I like. I was, by the time I got to the third floor,

280
00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:13.310
I was fucking livid.

281
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:17.240
I was so fucking angry that the people around me could sense it,

282
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.750
that when I went to get off the elevator, even women got out of the way.

283
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.830
So I'm not proud of that.

284
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.330
But you would think I would have flipped out at the big dude stepping over me,

285
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.670
or I would have thought this anyways,

286
00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:35.390
or I would've flipped out when my room wasn't ready. I would've flipped out.

287
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:38.660
You know? Even when I sent the text message to my travel person,

288
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.970
I didn't curse. I didn't say that they fucked it up.

289
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.470
I know somebody fucked it up.

290
00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:48.980
But I've learned in the past to not just slice the head off of the first person.

291
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:53.540
I just went very like, you know, I don't know what happened,

292
00:16:53.541 --> 00:16:58.100
but this is not acceptable. People knew I was coming here for two months.

293
00:16:58.130 --> 00:17:02.450
I don't understand. I've never had this problem before. This can't happen again.

294
00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.120
I am now on my way to a waffle house at five 21 in the morning with all of my

295
00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:09.790
bags. And I just, you know what, what else do you need? The fucking Sake, right?

296
00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.350
So anyways, it all ended up working out and uh,

297
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.780
I got some great food out here and uh,

298
00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:20.620
I ended up running into one of the, uh, cast members of Nashville,

299
00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:23.290
which is my wife's favorite fucking show, unfortunately,

300
00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:26.740
just got canceled and I ran into the Guy Charles Estin,

301
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.230
and he was the coolest fucking guy. And I was like, oh my God,

302
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:32.740
my wife loves you. Show is there any way I could get a picture? And he goes, no,

303
00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:36.250
put it on video. He goes, watch this. He goes, you do the intro.

304
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:40.550
He was so fucking cool. So I just was like, hey, yeah, woo. I'm in Nashville.

305
00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:43.430
I ran into one of the locals and then it turns into it's his face and he just

306
00:17:43.431 --> 00:17:45.350
goes, hey, thanks for watching the show.

307
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.810
She freaked out and I got some good points.

308
00:17:47.811 --> 00:17:52.811
So thank you to Charles for making my fucking a make it my married life a little

309
00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:56.580
easier. So, uh, so there you go. I don't know how much time that took up.

310
00:17:56.581 --> 00:18:01.290
According to a Garageband, I'm at 540 something.

311
00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.950
540 fucking of these.

312
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:05.060
<v 2>Okay.</v>

313
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.000
<v 0>Oh, they count in the little things. Was it 540 seconds?</v>

314
00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:12.110
My really supposed to do that math. Had I not done 10 minutes yet.

315
00:18:12.111 --> 00:18:16.580
600 seconds is 10 minutes. Oh Jesus.

Hey,

383
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:33.870
I've got to ask you guys a question here and I apologize for all the extraneous

384
00:22:33.871 --> 00:22:35.520
fucking noise, if that's the right word here.

385
00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:37.453
<v 5>Um,</v>

386
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.480
<v 0>I went into the, uh, the drug store out here,</v>

387
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:45.700
cause I forgot my Aleve to count to help my inflamed Sciatica here.

388
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:50.600
And um, sciatic nerve I should say. And um,

389
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:54.510
I went in there and this, this campaign,

390
00:22:54.511 --> 00:22:58.590
that red nose fucking fun thing, whatever. And it's all these,

391
00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.670
it's some sort of charity and it's all these fucking people.

392
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.630
Famous people wearing the red nose. So I'm going, what the, what is this?

393
00:23:06.631 --> 00:23:07.620
I keep seeing this.

394
00:23:07.621 --> 00:23:12.621
So I start reading the box and it says Walgreens will donate 100% of everything

395
00:23:13.561 --> 00:23:16.350
that they gain, collect or whatever.

396
00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:19.680
To this red nose camp, red nose fund.

397
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:23.310
100% is going to this red nose fund.

398
00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:28.320
So I'm like, all right, what is it? What is the fund?

399
00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.470
Nowhere on the box will it say what the fuck it is.

400
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.520
It doesn't say what it's raising money for. Nowhere on the box.

401
00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.320
So I asked the lady behind the counter and I go, so what is this for?

402
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.820
If I buy one of these red noses, what is this for? She goes, Oh,

403
00:23:44.821 --> 00:23:46.100
you one of these,

404
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.360
and it was like a little fucking gift certificate off of fucking chapstick or

405
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:55.160
something. I go, no, no, no, no. I don't like what I get. If I buy a red nose,

406
00:23:55.161 --> 00:23:59.360
like where does the money go? Who am I helping out? She goes, oh, I don't know.

407
00:23:59.361 --> 00:24:03.860
It's like my first day, and I just laughed. I was like, well,

408
00:24:03.861 --> 00:24:06.860
I'm going to just start the fucking green hat fund and everything's going to go

409
00:24:06.861 --> 00:24:09.830
to me. And she sorta like, I guess half ass laughed.

410
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.770
I should have told it to the black guy in the suit and the fucking waffle house,

411
00:24:12.771 --> 00:24:17.400
he would've ran out of the place then 15 cartwheels and come back in though.

412
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.800
That's not that funny. Um, I'm telling you man, that's the new,

413
00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:25.400
I'm not saying the red nose thing is a scam, but it's pretty fucking shifty,

414
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:27.420
pretty shady.

415
00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:30.740
Then I'm sitting and looking at all these celebrities and it's just the red nose

416
00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:34.340
fund and there's nothing on there. Same way the money goes,

417
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.320
you know, isn't it,

418
00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:39.410
shouldn't that red nose thing bring up a couple of red flags there?

419
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.600
I think that that's the new,

420
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.200
there's two new things going on in this country that are actually generating

421
00:24:45.201 --> 00:24:46.160
income for people.

422
00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:51.230
The legal selling of weed at the state level and um,

423
00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.430
nonprofits.

424
00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.460
Nonprofit is like the new hardware store.

425
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.850
Like back in the day you had to open a store and actually sell shit.

426
00:24:59.851 --> 00:25:04.440
And nowadays you can just start fucking come up with a mirror,

427
00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.860
a mirror. Now a ribbon, a fucking wristband,

428
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:12.450
a red fucking nose, have people dump ice water over their fucking head,

429
00:25:12.451 --> 00:25:16.440
whatever it is. You know, some of them are legit.

430
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.610
I got this feeling, most of them aren't. And I kind of feel like

431
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.210
if you're old like me,

432
00:25:23.211 --> 00:25:28.211
and you remember the late eighties when all those televangelists were on TV and

433
00:25:28.261 --> 00:25:32.850
they went to like this national fucking level and they just made hundreds of

434
00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.430
millions of dollars before it all just came out that it was just this giant

435
00:25:35.431 --> 00:25:39.480
fucking cash grab. I feel like all those fucking nonprofits,

436
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:44.000
it has to be going in that direction and how all these sports, uh,

437
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.300
sports leagues get in bed with all of these fucking people. Um,

438
00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:51.500
I dunno, maybe they have enough money,

439
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.410
maybe they have enough money to keep it silent. But uh, I don't know.

440
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.950
I'm kind of done. I give money to saint Jude's hospital. That's it.

441
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.050
Everything else, I just,

442
00:26:02.051 --> 00:26:07.000
I don't have the fucking time to figure out whether or not you're a fucking scam

443
00:26:07.001 --> 00:26:10.720
or not because I gave to that wounded warrior shit. I gave so many,

444
00:26:10.721 --> 00:26:12.580
I gave so much fucking money.

445
00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.700
I used to donate like 10% of the Shit I made in the advertising to those fucking

446
00:26:17.701 --> 00:26:19.740
people. And then people started sending me these,

447
00:26:19.741 --> 00:26:24.420
these articles and the next thing you know they get investigated and all that

448
00:26:24.421 --> 00:26:25.900
type of shit and I don't even, I didn't,

449
00:26:25.901 --> 00:26:28.680
I just stopped following the story and I just stopped giving them money cause

450
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.190
I don't know, I don't know. I don't know if it's true or not.

451
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:33.540
I don't even fucking want to know.

452
00:26:33.541 --> 00:26:38.541
But like I just feel like the future of helping people out is literally walking

453
00:26:39.061 --> 00:26:43.860
up to a wounded warrior. Like finding out where the fuck they live and be like,

454
00:26:43.861 --> 00:26:45.870
what do you need? Go out and get it.

455
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:49.770
Or you raised the money and then you give it to them. But then if I raise it,

456
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:51.480
then do I become one of those people and be like,

457
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:55.110
oh we have a little bit of overhead and all of a sudden I have some sick ass

458
00:26:55.111 --> 00:26:59.760
drum room and I just bring a fucking box of bandaids to a fucking veteran.

459
00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:03.740
I mean that's what seems like all these, I don't know. I'm,

460
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:08.750
I'm a cynical son of a bitch, but my new shit is I want to just, I'm,

461
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.450
I still love doing charities. I love doing benefits.

462
00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:16.870
I did one the other night for like a fucking, it was for like a private school.

463
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.050
It's like, it's a fucking private school. Like you guys don't need money.

464
00:27:20.051 --> 00:27:22.720
It's like, oh, it's for the people who can't afford it. It's like, is it,

465
00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.240
who knows what it is? You just saying what it is and then what?

466
00:27:28.241 --> 00:27:33.030
Then all of a sudden they, yeah. Who gets the money? Where does it go?

467
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:37.170
Where does that person go? Are they in Tahiti? Are they helping somebody out?

468
00:27:37.171 --> 00:27:41.040
Nobody fucking knows. It's brilliant. It's fucking brilliant. Um,

469
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:45.540
I hope that red nose things is on the label is on the labels on the level.

470
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:47.820
Sorry, I didn't get a good night's sleep. You know,

471
00:27:47.821 --> 00:27:50.700
those hotel couches and what they fucking used to be there.

472
00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:52.563
<v 5>Um,</v>

473
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.960
<v 0>I honestly have no idea how much time I've done here.</v>

474
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:59.530
I'm up to like 838 of these seconds here.

475
00:27:59.770 --> 00:28:01.150
I'm just going to say this seconds,

476
00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:02.973
<v 5>right.</v>

477
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:08.290
<v 0>Well, let's see if there's 600 seconds in 10 minutes.</v>

478
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:13.760
So that means there'd be 1800 seconds and a half. There's no fucking way.

479
00:28:13.761 --> 00:28:17.260
That's only a second. What if it's two seconds?

480
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.020
I've gotta be coming up. I'm going to say it's two seconds. Fuck it.

481
00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:21.920
It's two seconds.

482
00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.260
So all I got to do is just make it up to 900 and I got another 49 to go. Oh,

483
00:28:27.261 --> 00:28:30.080
it's fucking easy. Let's talk a little playoff hockey. Everybody.

484
00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:35.030
Anybody watch a, I keep missing just to how busy I am. I keep missing, um,

485
00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:41.170
that uh, that Tampa Bay Pittsburgh series, I caught the end of uh,

486
00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:42.850
uh,

487
00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:46.730
game three with the penguins were up and then they gave him a couple of right

488
00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:50.490
there threads to put it out of reach.

489
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.250
And I fucking sent a buddy of mine in Pittsburgh,

490
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.270
a text congratulating them because as much as I don't like what the penguins

491
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.540
cheap shot artists have done to the Bruins, uh, you know,

492
00:29:00.541 --> 00:29:03.360
I don't take it to the level that I don't want my friend's teams to win.

493
00:29:03.361 --> 00:29:06.300
So I said congratulations. And the second I sent it,

494
00:29:06.301 --> 00:29:10.800
Tampa Bay scored one and I felt like I jinxed up for half a second. But um,

495
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:13.080
I've been watching the blues and uh,

496
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:16.740
in San Jose shacks and a,

497
00:29:16.741 --> 00:29:21.741
this is fucking huge tonight for the blues because San Jose obviously adjusted

498
00:29:22.331 --> 00:29:26.500
to whatever the fuck the blues were doing in game one. And uh,

499
00:29:26.501 --> 00:29:29.950
so now blues have to adjust to whatever San Jose was doing because San Jose

500
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:31.263
Pretty uh,

501
00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:35.860
dominated pretty much wire to wire the last game.

502
00:29:35.890 --> 00:29:40.330
And uh, I dunno, it's making me nervous as a,

503
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.560
as a bandwagon blues fan, they obviously got to win this.

504
00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.960
That's such a stupid thing to say. It was a, it's just one, a big one. Bill.

505
00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:50.840
Should they not go down three games to one? You fucking dope.

506
00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:55.070
A big shout out to all the soccer fans over there in Europe that got so fucking

507
00:29:55.071 --> 00:29:58.160
annoyed at everything that I said that I shouldn't talk about. Uh,

508
00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:01.620
<v 1>um, sports over in Europe, uh,</v>

509
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.860
you guys all make a great point cause I don't watch them and I don't know

510
00:30:04.861 --> 00:30:06.390
anything about them. But, uh,

511
00:30:06.391 --> 00:30:11.391
what you failed to understand is how much I enjoy irritating the shit out of

512
00:30:11.401 --> 00:30:15.330
people that I'd never met before. So I stand by. What the fuck?

513
00:30:15.331 --> 00:30:18.660
I said you guys should have some sort of in the premier league,

514
00:30:18.661 --> 00:30:23.490
you should have a fucking play off play off the fact that somebody can win a

515
00:30:23.491 --> 00:30:28.491
fucking championship because another team came to like a tie and like that's it.

516
00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.253
Just imagine

517
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:37.320
every fucking movie about soccer is always this the big fucking game.

518
00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.460
Right? And then somebody comes down and scores a goal.

519
00:30:41.550 --> 00:30:46.480
It's not like the stars of the movie standing around waiting for somebody to

520
00:30:46.481 --> 00:30:47.314
fucking,

521
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:48.320
<v 5>okay,</v>

522
00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.610
<v 0>you know, we'll have a one one tie with somebody.</v>

523
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:54.980
<v 1>Is this sitting there and fucking street clothes or sitting in an apartment?</v>

524
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.390
<v 6>Okay.</v>

525
00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:01.390
<v 0>Doing Jello shots with each other. I don't know. I'm just fucking with you.</v>

526
00:31:01.391 --> 00:31:01.600
I know.

527
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.960
Remember that's the best of Solo movie victory ended them with them walking away

528
00:31:05.961 --> 00:31:08.540
from the game. Oh No, no. They were going to do it.

529
00:31:08.541 --> 00:31:11.150
They wanted to escape and then they came back because they wanted to beat the

530
00:31:11.151 --> 00:31:14.830
guys. And if that was actually based on anything real,

531
00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:16.210
<v 1>yeah.</v>

532
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.490
<v 0>Um, the game would have ended and then they would've won.</v>

533
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.310
They would have been brought back to the prison camp and they would've been

534
00:31:21.311 --> 00:31:22.060
beaten to death.

535
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.930
But instead what ended up happening was they came back and they,

536
00:31:25.931 --> 00:31:29.470
they beat the Nazis, these prisoners allied prisoners of war,

537
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.590
and then they fucking, uh,

538
00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.560
they just walked out with the crowd that stormed onto the field and gave them

539
00:31:35.561 --> 00:31:36.640
extra clothes and shit.

540
00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.470
<v 5>MMM [inaudible]</v>

541
00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.690
<v 0>I dunno, I'm sure it was based on a true story, but, uh,</v>

542
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.500
I've seen enough of the Germans and their respect for life outside of their own

543
00:31:45.501 --> 00:31:48.420
country. Okay. For people who are non German,

544
00:31:48.421 --> 00:31:50.610
I think that they would have just opened up on the crowd.

545
00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:53.590
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

546
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.650
<v 0>So I'm calling bullshit. That movie was called victory, by the way, by the way.</v>

547
00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.950
It was a great, it was actually really enjoy that movie,

548
00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.380
but it was when I first got cable, so who knows.

549
00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.333
<v 5>Um,</v>

550
00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.910
<v 0>anyways, is that, is that a half hour?</v>

551
00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:10.650
I'm up to 962 seconds or a 1800?

552
00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:11.630
I have no fucking idea. Yeah.

553
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.473
<v 5>You know what</v>

554
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.810
<v 0>I'm going to find out here because I'm going to have to do the Monday morning</v>

555
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:20.260
podcast like this one also. And uh,

556
00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.650
my timing will be a little bit better on the next one cause I'll know exactly

557
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:26.480
how much time I'm doing. I just don't understand why this would fucking thing.

558
00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.190
Wouldn't tell me how much time, but I'm not gonna start hitting buttons going.

559
00:32:30.191 --> 00:32:33.460
It's gonna be irritating to you if you listen to it on a fucking with

560
00:32:33.461 --> 00:32:33.850
headphones.

561
00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.300
<v 1>So anyways, that's it for the Thursday afternoon podcast.</v>

562
00:32:37.301 --> 00:32:38.720
Just checking in on your hope. You can see,

563

567
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:15.523

00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:38.223

571
00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.133
rainy,

572
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.820
depressing Monday morning here in Los Angeles.

573
00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:09.130
Um, probably days or rest or depressing out here because, uh,

574
00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:14.170
it's usually sunny and it's what you expect out here.

575
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.970
I feel like I'm going to go into a Karen Carpenter song, rainy David Monday.

576
00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.330
[inaudible] yeah. [inaudible] really?

577
00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:28.510
Is that a reason to stop eating? I don't think it is. Wow.

578
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.800
Wow. I just started off real mean did night well. Well Shit.

579
00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.210
Well who gives a fuck? It's a gloomy Monday and a I attacked a dead anorexic.

580
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.810
How do you like that? That's how I start the Monday morning podcast.

581
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:44.760
So there you go. If you're new to my page, um, I do one of these, um,

582
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.840
every Monday morning, cause I say Monday, oh, did I say run day?

583
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:53.220
Every Monday morning I do a podcast and I evidently I attack some,

584
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.260
uh, defenseless dead person. That's how I started off.

585
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:01.200
Only if it's overcast. If it was sunny, it would have,

586
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:04.680
I would have a completely different side. But basically,

587
00:36:04.681 --> 00:36:09.681
I do want to say these every Monday and I answer questions that some of my 14

588
00:36:11.671 --> 00:36:15.120
listeners send in. Um, lately I've been giving out advice.

589
00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:20.500
People's been asking me advice and sometimes I ask questions and uh,

590
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.990
hopefully in the end of it, uh, nobody learns anything. And you know,

591
00:36:24.991 --> 00:36:28.650
you've wasted 15 minutes of your life. That's what I'm trying to do.

592
00:36:28.651 --> 00:36:31.290
And speaking of wasting 15 minutes of your life,

593
00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.350
I am actually sitting in my apartment, my little villa,

594
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:38.790
and uh, really made me sound like at a pool. Boy, it didn't. Um,

595
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:43.910
my little villa here and I'm waiting for a plumber and uh,

596
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:46.320
you know, I don't want to judge the guy because I never met him,

597
00:36:46.321 --> 00:36:50.780
but this motherfucker sky was supposed to be here at nine o'clock in the goddamn

598
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.820
morning. All right? It's two minutes test the hour of 10 o'clock.

599
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:58.140
Now I don't know what time zone you live in, what world you're in,

600
00:36:58.141 --> 00:37:02.010
but in my little neck of the woods, 10 oh two, now it's 10 oh three.

601
00:37:02.011 --> 00:37:04.710
It just turned on my cable box. It's fucking 10 oh three 10.

602
00:37:04.711 --> 00:37:08.520
Oh three is not nine o'clock. And goddammit, I want some answers.

603
00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:13.500
I'm grabbing to ball my hand up into a fist and fucking pounded on my coffee

604
00:37:13.501 --> 00:37:16.320
table like a, like some,

605
00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.440
like that guy in the Spiderman comic books. Who's,

606
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:23.730
who's the guy at the daily planet? Jamison. Huh?

607
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:29.040
With his fucking a, it's such a weird way of going gray. Didn't he?

608
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.500
Just the side of his head turned white all the way around and then on top it was

609
00:37:34.501 --> 00:37:39.000
jet black and he'd always be chomping on a fucking cigar. You know, just,

610
00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:43.260
I don't want to tax Stan Lee, but you know, it's really, you know, I got it.

611
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:46.970
He's the boss. All right. What am I doing? Okay. All right, let's,

612
00:37:46.971 --> 00:37:49.860
let's fucking get back to this. Let's get down to brass tacks here. Okay.

613
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:51.390
Why am I waiting for a plumber?

614
00:37:51.391 --> 00:37:55.770
I'll tell you why I'm looking for a plumber because for some reason my sink,

615
00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:58.230
when the water comes out lately,

616
00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:02.610
it smells like swamp ass.

617
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:04.800
Um, I don't know what it is.

618
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:09.870
There's definitely a funk coming out of my sink and it's not coming out of the

619
00:38:12.451 --> 00:38:16.920
kitchen sink. So I've ruled out some sort of outside sources,

620
00:38:16.921 --> 00:38:19.290
obviously, you know, cause it was coming from the street,

621
00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:23.940
the main water waterline. I think every, it'd be fucking everything.

622
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.610
It'd be coming out of everything right now.

623
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:30.120
Do I have any plumber listeners out there? You know, can you help me out?

624
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:32.100
Because evidently this fuck is not showing up.

625
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:36.140
It's 10 oh four and he's still not here. See,

626
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:40.750
this is why the United States of America is starting to lag behind China and all

627
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.460
of them I've had in China, when you call a plumber,

628
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:47.530
48 of them show up at fucking eight 58 begging you. Then they have a wrench.

629
00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:48.701
You know what I mean?

630
00:38:48.701 --> 00:38:52.130
Somebody just fucking bites down the pipe and three other guys just start

631
00:38:52.131 --> 00:38:56.920
spinning the guy around, you know, but not in America.

632
00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:00.010
I got to wait for this motherfucker to show up. I'll tell you what sucks too,

633
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:03.100
is I don't know if they act stupid, but it just,

634
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:05.050
that that makes it hurt even more

635
00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.220
is when you can't figure out how to fix the sink.

636
00:39:09.221 --> 00:39:12.970
And then some guy comes up memorial boom pole, you know,

637
00:39:12.971 --> 00:39:16.240
with his fucking ass hanging out, he knows how to fix it.

638
00:39:16.241 --> 00:39:19.090
That's why I've started to become handy. Okay.

639
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:23.350
Because I actually sat down and I analyzed that the other day and you know,

640
00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:28.210
fixing a sink is not a gift. You know what I'm saying?

641
00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.060
It's a skill. It's something you learned inventing the sink. Okay.

642
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.390
Or the toilet like that. That guy, uh,

643
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.150
Eddie crapper or whatever his fucking name was. I know his,

644
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:43.150
his last name was crapper. Okay. And because of him,

645
00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:44.470
we don't have to shit outside.

646
00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:49.650
And what's what banks does he get his last name becomes slang for taking a dump.

647
00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:55.630
Tell me he didn't die. A bitter rich man. Jesus Christ. You know,

648
00:39:55.631 --> 00:39:57.550
some people man, it's just these, you know, they, they,

649
00:39:57.551 --> 00:40:00.790
they do such good and what do they get out of it? Huh?

650
00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:04.960
Jesus Christ. I mean, I bet you,

651
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:09.760
and your last name was crapper that every female in that family could not wait

652
00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:13.720
to get married and just get away from that Goddamn last name. I mean,

653
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:16.030
they probably took the first thing that came down the pike.

654
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.080
That'd be a great thing to Google and go check out the amount of women with the

655
00:40:20.081 --> 00:40:24.730
last name crapper that married the first trucker that fucking fingered him on a

656
00:40:24.731 --> 00:40:27.550
fucking Tuesday night. Jesus Christ.

657
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:30.190
Just because they were shameful of them.

658
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:35.220
Their maiden name was probably led to some sort of child abuse and alcoholism.

659
00:40:35.531 --> 00:40:38.780
And that's probably another reason why it's 10 oh six in the fucking plumber

660
00:40:38.781 --> 00:40:42.730
still living here. I really hope he shows up halfway through this. Okay.

661
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:47.140
Cause you guys have watched me give this guy a piece of my fucking mind and I

662
00:40:47.141 --> 00:40:51.120
won't curse either. So we can't leave. What is he doing? What could be what's,

663
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:53.980
what's he doing? Huh? He driving and you know he's got a van.

664
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.760
Do you know if you're a carpenter, you gotta pick up if you're,

665
00:40:57.761 --> 00:41:01.450
if you're a plumber, you got a van. You know,

666
00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:04.510
because in case it rains you can't have it go on the pipes and they get all

667
00:41:04.511 --> 00:41:08.410
rusted. I don't know why. What is he doing? Tenancy at the army, navy store,

668
00:41:08.411 --> 00:41:12.900
buying some more Dickies. You know that what they do is,

669
00:41:12.901 --> 00:41:14.800
what do they trade their underwear for? Their Dickies.

670
00:41:14.801 --> 00:41:19.390
So their fucking crack of their ass is hanging out 10 oh seven okay.

671
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:22.000
Anyways, yeah. So that's the deal. I started,

672
00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.860
I started to learn how to fix shit. Okay,

673
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:27.670
I'll fix the leaky faucet the other day, which is unbelievably easy,

674
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.710
but it makes no goddamn sense.

675
00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:33.060
You fucking take the handle off and there's this,

676
00:41:33.130 --> 00:41:37.280
this little rubber stopper with this spring in there and that's all it is.

677
00:41:37.281 --> 00:41:39.260
You take it out and stick the mother fucker back.

678
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:43.050
You stick a new one in there and magically it stops leaking. I don't get it.

679
00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.440
It's not like it's in the pipe. I have no idea why it works,

680
00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:50.630
but it works.

681
00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:54.130
And I went on the Internet within three seconds I learned how to do it. Okay.

682
00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.170
My ass wasn't hanging out of the back of my pants and I didn't charge somebody

683
00:41:57.171 --> 00:41:59.570
fucking $200 and I was on time.

684
00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.800
Damn motherfucker. Okay. So anyways,

685
00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:08.390
I do one of these things every single week and people ask me questions and I

686
00:42:08.391 --> 00:42:09.590
hide upcoming gigs.

687
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:14.000
Like the fact that I'm going to be at a, this week,

688
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:18.030
I'm going to be at as Amy's in Chicago and uh,

689
00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:21.320
it's actually downtown Chicago on the 14th and 15th.

690
00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.480
On the 16th I'll be in,

691
00:42:23.481 --> 00:42:28.280
in the Saint Charles and on the 17th I'll be in Vernon hills, Illinois.

692
00:42:28.281 --> 00:42:32.520
And I got to tell you something I really, really enjoy doing, uh,

693
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:37.940
this Gig at especially the downtown Chicago. So this nice small,

694
00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.350
and I mean it looks like a walk in closet. The place is so small and uh,

695
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:44.031
I dunno man,

696
00:42:44.031 --> 00:42:48.470
it's like an old school comedy club and all these old comedy photos,

697
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.780
they just left them up to like to take a fucking museum.

698
00:42:50.781 --> 00:42:53.690
I love the place and I always have great shows there. So,

699
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:58.640
and I'm going to the cubs game on the 15th Bay, be like my third,

700
00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:01.790
fourth time going to Wrigley field, you know.

701
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.610
And here I am pitching about a plumber.

702
00:43:04.611 --> 00:43:06.230
I really ought to count my blessings here.

703
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:10.790
Go into a fucking cubs game this week. Okay. And continuing on on the 29th,

704
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:16.360
May 29th through June 1st I'm making my triumphant return to a New York City,

705
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:20.510
Caroline's comedy club. Uh,

706
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:24.620
I got a whole brand new hour last time I was out there. I taped my, uh,

707
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:27.560
my one hour comedy special,

708
00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:32.030
which I have information about that I will be giving out later on in this

709
00:43:32.031 --> 00:43:36.740
podcast. Huh? Look at me. Look at me. Teasing it a little bit.

710
00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:41.240
Making you stick around. Huh? Don't roll your eyes at me. I know what I'm doing.

711
00:43:41.241 --> 00:43:44.120
I'm playing the fucking game. Uh,

712
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:46.910
let's see and what else we got here and then you go into June

713
00:43:48.410 --> 00:43:50.870
and I actually forgot about this date. I thought I had a couple,

714
00:43:50.871 --> 00:43:53.870
a couple of weeks off after Caroline's, but evidently not.

715
00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:57.320
I'm going right back out to Raleigh, North Carolina.

716
00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:02.960
Good nights comedy club. How the fuck did I have a date there, man?

717
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:07.340
I'm turning 40 on the 10th. I planned on coming home on the second,

718
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.940
getting into the fetal position, doing some crunches

719
00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.560
and not eating any carbs until June 10th when I turned 40 goddamn years old.

720
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.810
But now I have to fly across this country and go to Raleigh, North Carolina.

721
00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:27.950
The desolate, the frightening Raleigh, North Carolina.

722
00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:32.430
The what the fuck happened to the downtown area that you know,

723
00:44:32.431 --> 00:44:37.170
it's a beautiful part of the, the this, the of the state during the day.

724
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.790
Raleigh, North Carolina downtown. I'm not talking about NC state, NC state,

725
00:44:41.791 --> 00:44:42.990
that that place is nice.

726
00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.620
I actually went there for two semesters in 87 88 and if you want to know while

727
00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:52.360
we went there for two semesters, go online and Google Bill Burns,

728
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:57.060
fucking NC state a fucking transcript and you'll figure out why I left after

729
00:44:57.061 --> 00:45:01.110
that. But the downtown area, that's one of those downtowns where, you know,

730
00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:06.150
you could tell at some point in the past, the history, it was, it was a place,

731
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:10.260
it was hopping, it was jumping. They'll make a narrow moonshine down there.

732
00:45:10.261 --> 00:45:12.890
Right. And then they know what happened. You know what? I bet the wall,

733
00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:17.550
the dreaded Walmart. That's what happened. They built a Walmart, then they,

734
00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:20.550
then they made a mall, the Crabtree mall.

735
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:24.240
Is that what you guys go in the whole downtown area? Just,

736
00:45:24.241 --> 00:45:25.890
it's a fucking ghost town.

737
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:31.110
Past six oh one in the evening and I'm just left down there by myself,

738
00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:35.640
downtown in the fucking hotel. I hate it. I need people around me.

739
00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:40.530
I'm a city person. God Damn. People all fucking leave. And then I'm down there.

740
00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.690
I got to go out and hail the cab and all that stuff is just homeless people.

741
00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:46.660
It's like that fucking, what does that movie? 28 days.

742
00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.210
That's what I feel like I'm in. I'm still going to a Zombie movie.

743
00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:54.130
So if you're working downtown Raleigh and you're going to go to one of my shows,

744
00:45:54.131 --> 00:45:55.270
why don't you hang out at work?

745
00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.300
Just hang out at work and go straight to the clubs.

746
00:45:58.301 --> 00:45:59.650
When I walk out to get a cab,

747
00:45:59.651 --> 00:46:02.920
I can actually see another fucking human being that looks like they don't have

748
00:46:02.921 --> 00:46:04.930
hepatitis. All right.

749
00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:10.020
And the next Gig I had coming up this June 19th to the 21st I'm going to be at

750
00:46:10.991 --> 00:46:14.270
the punchline in Atlanta. Uh,

751
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:16.210
that's another one of my favorite comedy clubs.

752
00:46:16.211 --> 00:46:21.211
I bet that Janie's Caroline's good nights punchline Atlanta.

753
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:26.650
I like all of those clubs. I like all of them. They're just good clubs, good,

754
00:46:26.651 --> 00:46:29.620
clean fun. And I'm going to come in there with my potty mouth,

755
00:46:29.621 --> 00:46:33.490
June 19th to the 21st and uh,

756
00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:36.310
I don't know, I've been to Atlanta a lot lately,

757
00:46:36.311 --> 00:46:39.040
so I'm hoping that I'm going to start to build a following out there.

758
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.700
I always seem to get a good turnout and I got a whole nother new hour for you.

759
00:46:42.701 --> 00:46:44.940
You sons of bitches. And

760
00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:50.110
then after that you guys, you're on your own. Just go to my website.

761
00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:53.350
You can click on it right there. If you're looking at my mind space page,

762
00:46:53.351 --> 00:46:53.980
I manage.

763
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:58.980
I imagine most of you are secretly listening to this in your cubicle and you've

764
00:46:59.501 --> 00:47:02.740
probably reduced the window. Is that what you did?

765
00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:06.160
And now you sit there and looking at what are you look at in a cubicle? Huh?

766
00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:09.880
What are you looking at? Spreadsheet. Some sort of counting thing with,

767
00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:14.410
with assets and liabilities and you're rubbing your chin as if you're not

768
00:47:14.411 --> 00:47:18.940
listening to me. Huh? Well that's good. You know what?

769
00:47:19.150 --> 00:47:20.230
I think that's a good thing. You know,

770
00:47:20.231 --> 00:47:23.300
you should do today's take a magnet run right down the back of your bosses

771
00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.890
hardware, not as hardware, his fucking hard drive. That's what you do.

772
00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.930
And if he walks into the office right in the middle of you doing that,

773
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:35.080
what you do is you smile. They've opened smile,

774
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:37.300
which causes his defenses to go down.

775
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:41.770
And then you fling that magnet at him like a fucking Chinese star and you hit

776
00:47:41.771 --> 00:47:45.490
him right in the forehead. Now the great thing about knocking somebody out is,

777
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:49.660
um, as far as I know, as far as my experience with getting knocked out,

778
00:47:49.690 --> 00:47:52.030
is you forget the previous three minutes.

779
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:57.390
So as long as you fire that fucking magnet at him before the three minutes are

780
00:47:58.451 --> 00:48:01.600
up, he won't even remember what happened. But the key is,

781
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.840
is to do it in a manner before he can be like, you know,

782
00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.150
yell your name and say, what are you doing in this office? You know,

783
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.330
Jennifer fucking, whatever.

784
00:48:13.331 --> 00:48:15.670
I'm so bad at coming up with fucking

785
00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:21.390
God damn it. Jennifer will go with Sullivan that there's a,

786
00:48:21.391 --> 00:48:26.290
there's a fucking basic name. That's why I can't write scripts.

787
00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:30.550
The stories are always good. But my fucking name, you know the hero's name,

788
00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:35.560
Joe Smith. William the worst. Um, so I can never commit.

789
00:48:35.561 --> 00:48:38.620
Client never could come up with a good alias.

790
00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:43.210
What's your name? Bob. Bob.

791
00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:47.950
What Avenue? All right, Robert,

792
00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:50.890
why don't you get in the back of the fucking car? Man, I didn't do anything.

793
00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:55.990
All right, let's get on to the a have I ever been arrested? Yes.

794
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:59.740
Yes I have. Yes, I have. I innocent arrested, drinking and driving

795
00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:06.580
back into December of 1989 and if you'd like to hear more of the story,

796
00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:11.200
tune in next week. Um, I'll wait a minute. What did I say? Oh, I know.

797
00:49:11.201 --> 00:49:14.160
That's right. I'm going to tell you guys my DVD is coming out. Um,

798
00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.890
but first we're going to answer some of the, uh,

799
00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.350
some of the questions that people have asked me. Um,

800
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.200
here's a question I might've answered it before. OK. Podcast,

801
00:49:23.201 --> 00:49:26.170
question number one. A, this is how many,

802
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:29.350
I have actually went into some old emails and I found that a bunch of other ones

803
00:49:29.351 --> 00:49:33.700
so that I didn't get to. So who knows. Here we go. Question one. Hey Bill,

804
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.080
have you ever thought about going to Iraq to entertain the military?

805
00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:41.980
I served in the Gulf War and we liked having entertainers. Come see us.

806
00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:46.300
If you have a few have already gone. What was it like for you?

807
00:49:46.301 --> 00:49:49.330
You would fucking kill? Um, no I have not.

808
00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.420
I have not gone over there for the simple, you know,

809
00:49:52.421 --> 00:49:57.421
the only way I would go over there is if I went through six weeks of boot camp

810
00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:01.690
first like you did. And uh, you know, they gave,

811
00:50:01.691 --> 00:50:05.170
they taught me how to fucking kill somebody. You know what I'm saying?

812
00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:11.260
That's like not knowing how to swim and then doing a fucking, you know,

813
00:50:11.261 --> 00:50:14.950
entertain some people on a tugboat during, during choppy water.

814
00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.470
You know what I mean? That, that, to be honest with you,

815
00:50:17.471 --> 00:50:19.520
I would love to go to Iraq, but I'd love to go over there.

816
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:20.890
And when it was fucking peaceful.

817
00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:26.490
And I experienced the culture over there when there are no insurgence and a,

818
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:27.950
yeah, that's the thing. You know what I mean?

819
00:50:27.951 --> 00:50:31.940
I know they fly into the fucking base and I'm surrounded by a bunch of marines

820
00:50:31.941 --> 00:50:35.100
and that type of shit. But you know, I've just watched too many wills,

821
00:50:35.101 --> 00:50:38.750
Smith movies where he's the only guy left and I don't know how to fire a gun.

822
00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:44.450
So, uh, you know, I don't have that kind of balls like Bob hope would go,

823
00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:49.160
you know, he went all over Vietnam with like a fucking golf bag and an umbrella.

824
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:54.270
I guess he never died. Right. Maybe that should be a, you know, but you know,

825
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:57.830
chaos theory, I don't think he'd get killed on the base, but you know,

826
00:50:57.831 --> 00:51:01.130
I'd be one of those guys. Yeah. Fucking, you know,

827
00:51:01.131 --> 00:51:04.040
the plane I was in would get shot and suddenly everyone in the plane would

828
00:51:04.041 --> 00:51:08.420
survive. But I'd fall out the bottom through the Goddamn book.

829
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:12.470
I'll entertain the troops. Okay. I've done it a bunch of times,

830
00:51:12.471 --> 00:51:15.380
but I've done it over here. I, I don't, I don't do away games.

831
00:51:15.381 --> 00:51:20.060
I'm like Roger Climates when he played for the Astros. Okay. I'm on steroids.

832
00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:24.480
I'm cheating on my wife and I don't fucking pitch and I wreck.

833
00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:27.560
I'll be honest with you, I'm terrified to go over there. There you go. Okay.

834
00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:32.000
That's why you're a fucking marine and I'm a civilian and I respect you and uh,

835
00:51:32.001 --> 00:51:35.690
you know, I'll fucking, uh, you can listen to these podcasts in Iraq,

836
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:40.820
you know what I mean? What am I, what am I fucking Chuck Norris,

837
00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:45.650
me getting all defensive because I don't have the balls to go. Oh yeah.

838
00:51:45.651 --> 00:51:46.920
That's basically it. Yeah.

839
00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.610
I don't want to go over there and then somehow get kidnapped and ended up being,

840
00:51:49.611 --> 00:51:52.580
you know, rocking back and forth gently and an orange jumpsuit is there,

841
00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:53.150
you know,

842
00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:56.300
they're reading shit about our lot and then they saw my fucking head off and I'm

843
00:51:56.301 --> 00:51:59.480
really sitting there going like, you know what, why did I come over here?

844
00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:06.230
Um, okay, moving on. Question number one. That was one a.

845
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:07.543
Okay. Uh,

846
00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:12.880
did you do a voice on grand theft auto for there was a biker dude that sounds

847
00:52:12.951 --> 00:52:17.000
just like you. If it wasn't you, you got to check it out. Actually yes I did.

848
00:52:17.810 --> 00:52:18.780
I did do a,

849
00:52:18.781 --> 00:52:23.660
a voiceover on that and it was a big thrill to do that and I got to give a big

850
00:52:23.661 --> 00:52:26.010
thanks to uh,

851
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:29.210
to Laszlo for hooking me up and uh,

852
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:33.800
Jimmy Norton full hooking me up with the opiod Anthony show cause that's how I

853
00:52:33.801 --> 00:52:37.440
met Laszlo. And then I got in there to do the boys know. Boom.

854
00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:41.690
Um, so yeah, that works. Uh, question number two,

855
00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:45.890
I noticed you have strike force MMA and your top friends.

856
00:52:45.891 --> 00:52:49.750
I was wondering who are a couple of your favorite MMA fighters? Um,

857
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:54.140
that's just a friend I accepted and then I guess they switched their picture.

858
00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.810
Mixed martial arts. Um, I dunno, I do watch the, I watch,

859
00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:05.120
uh, what do I watch? I watch the UFC fights. I watch,

860
00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.750
uh, I watched their reality show, which of course,

861
00:53:08.751 --> 00:53:12.830
I can't remember the name of the ultimate fighter, this,

862
00:53:12.831 --> 00:53:16.370
this season where they have to fight their way just to get into the house.

863
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:22.250
And uh, what the fuck's his name there? The Junkyard Dog.

864
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.710
I'm getting them fucking confused with old time wrestlers.

865
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.240
Who's the guy who knocked out? Chuck Lidell,

866
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:32.280
the fucking guy who goes out and kicks the shit out of you.

867
00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:35.160
Where's the chain and Shit, you know, beats the fuck out of people.

868
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:39.750
Randy Jackson. Yeah. And then the other guy with the fucking,

869
00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.740
you don't want to fuck with me. Cauliflower ears. You know,

870
00:53:43.741 --> 00:53:45.220
I actually have a theory that if you just said,

871
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:47.480
you don't even need to get the black belt. If you just have some,

872
00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.310
somebody box your ears and you get those cauliflower ears,

873
00:53:50.311 --> 00:53:53.730
no one's gonna fuck with you in a bar because they just look at those fucked up

874
00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:57.330
ears, those exploded vegetable ears and they're just like,

875
00:53:57.331 --> 00:53:59.490
that guy could fucking snap my neck,

876
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:04.491
choke me out and give me the superman punch with the flying knee all at the same

877
00:54:04.651 --> 00:54:09.180
fucking time. Did I even answer the question? Who are some of my favorite ones?

878
00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:14.760
Uh, I'd like to match Sarah. I love the shit he talked about. Uh,

879
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:19.830
what's his face was Saint Pierre. That's the kind of shape I would like to be in

880
00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.930
for my 40th birthday. That evidentaly I'll be contemplating in downtown Raleigh,

881
00:54:24.931 --> 00:54:28.650
North Carolina. Alright. You know what, this podcast is starting to seem long,

882
00:54:28.651 --> 00:54:31.680
so let me, let me blow through these next fucking questions. All right.

883
00:54:31.681 --> 00:54:32.371
Number three, Bill,

884
00:54:32.371 --> 00:54:35.490
did you hook up with any of the stewardesses at the airport from last week's

885
00:54:35.491 --> 00:54:38.540
podcast? Oh yeah. I hooked up with all three of them and they,

886
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:41.670
we had a fucking force them right out in the open, you know,

887
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:46.590
and that didn't violate any new fucking Patriot Act. Now I didn't.

888
00:54:46.710 --> 00:54:50.940
And uh, thanks for bringing that up. Okay. I Dunno,

889
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:52.920
I was gonna go up and say what's up to him.

890
00:54:52.921 --> 00:54:55.650
But there was something about their blue pantyhose that just,

891
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:59.250
I really found it intimidating. Question number four. I was wondering,

892
00:54:59.251 --> 00:55:03.390
since you're such a big, such a bug sports fan, a big sports fan,

893
00:55:03.391 --> 00:55:08.010
what is your best sports memory from your childhood?

894
00:55:09.930 --> 00:55:13.640
Um, whoa. Fuck that. Let's go with something funnier then. Uh, how about, uh,

895
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.780
here's my best, uh, my best thought. Okay.

896
00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:19.830
Here's a good sports memory. When the, uh,

897
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:23.970
when the New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Raiders,

898
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:30.290
um, what was it, 1985. The year we get,

899
00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:35.010
we get destroyed in the super bowl. We were a wild card and uh,

900
00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:37.590
that's what we beat the jets. And then the next week we'd beat,

901
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:39.420
look at me with the memory, beat the jets,

902
00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:43.520
and then we'd beat the Raiders and I went down to the,

903
00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:46.320
the airport in Providence, Rhode Island.

904
00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:51.420
And it was like me and like only 70 other people at this point, you know.

905
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.060
And we met at all the players as they got off the plane,

906
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:56.790
all the old school guys, Julius Adams,

907
00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:01.290
I remember somebody reaching over and slamming him really hard on his shoulder,

908
00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:04.560
like hitting them way too hard. And he fucking looked at me like I did it.

909
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.030
And I was like, oh, it wasn't me. It was the guy behind me. But, uh,

910
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.730
that was the first time I saw a bunch of athletes up close. Uh,

911
00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:14.370
Tony Easten completely expressionless.

912
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:18.840
I remember he was wearing a butterscotch members only jacket, I swear to God.

913
00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:21.030
Um,

914
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:24.470
and he looked like he was on his way to home depot and right down I should've

915
00:56:24.490 --> 00:56:27.300
known that he was going to get crushed in the Superbowl. But, um,

916
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:30.430
I would say that, you know what, Bruins Games,

917
00:56:30.431 --> 00:56:32.500
the first Bruins games and went to the Boston Garden.

918
00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.090
They used to always go to Bruins.

919
00:56:34.091 --> 00:56:38.560
Canadians actually went to that bench clearing brawl. If you go on a youtube,

920
00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:42.070
it's the one where Chris Niland, uh,

921
00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:45.910
I was at the game where he hit Rick Middleton in the teeth with the stick.

922
00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:48.610
And then as he was walking off, that's why he walked off the ice.

923
00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:53.000
And then he pushed a 10 lensman who chased them down. And next thing you know,

924
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.160
it was a bench clearing brawl.

925
00:56:54.161 --> 00:56:57.430
And Terry O'Reilly and his suit was grabbing onto somebody and never in water.

926
00:56:57.790 --> 00:57:00.880
Quad. I was good time. All right. I'm just babbling here.

927
00:57:01.280 --> 00:57:04.450
I'll just wait for my plumber. 10 23 motherfuckers still not here.

928
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:10.270
Okay. Uh, wow. I'm getting bored with myself here. Number five.

929
00:57:10.810 --> 00:57:13.780
Uh, what do you think of the comedy genre? Anti humor.

930
00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:18.760
Like the type by Neil Hamburger and ted. I don't know those guys.

931
00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:23.460
I watched them and they seemed funny to me. You know, I dunno.

932
00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:27.400
It's not anti humor is it? I don't know who gives a fuck. Alright,

933
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:32.260
so I was watching one of these and who was throwing food at you?

934
00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:35.680
I already answered that. That's a donut. It's a donut hole.

935
00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:39.820
If you see the video on my page, it was a group of people. They were, uh,

936
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:42.160
advertisers. They all worked at the same place.

937
00:57:42.161 --> 00:57:45.940
I started trashing them and they threw a doughnut hole at me and evidently I

938
00:57:45.941 --> 00:57:48.790
didn't give a fuck. Um, number seven,

939
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:51.610
when you have these horrible thoughts about people,

940
00:57:51.611 --> 00:57:54.790
are you able to keep your face, stoic, mind, wrinkles up?

941
00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:59.740
And I don't notice until the person looks at me. If so, how do you play it off?

942
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.360
Um, no, I'm usually cursing like what I think is under my breath,

943
00:58:04.361 --> 00:58:06.280
but out loud and then they look right at me.

944
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:09.100
I literally walked through like an airport,

945
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:11.470
go and look at this fucking guy with fuck kind of shirt is that,

946
00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:13.930
and I think I'm kind of doing it in my head or whispering,

947
00:58:13.931 --> 00:58:17.140
but I'm saying it loud enough that they look right at me and then I look away,

948
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:19.960
which is pretty pathetic. Okay. Which is,

949
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:22.420
you know what this podcast is getting to static. It's way too long.

950
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.690
Let's get the thing. Okay. My DVD don't sell dog.

951
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:30.720
The big announcement is going to be coming out in September of 2008 and the my

952
00:58:32.651 --> 00:58:33.281
DVD,

953
00:58:33.281 --> 00:58:38.281
my a one hour special will also be shown on comedy central in September of 2008.

954
00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:45.460
So I have all summer to write some, uh, to write some new jokes,

955
00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:49.780
which I already have already got a whole new hour. So, uh, all right.

956
00:58:49.781 --> 00:58:52.270
This podcast, I mean minutes, just this. Yeah,

957
00:58:52.271 --> 00:58:55.480
this podcast is really fucking long and I didn't even get to half the shit I

958
00:58:55.481 --> 00:58:56.320
want to talk about.

959
00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:59.920
I want to tell you guys how I was back to drink and Budweiser.

960
00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:02.770
I've come full circle. Actually.

961
00:59:02.771 --> 00:59:06.460
I started off with Michelob light then and quickly went to Budweiser and then

962
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:08.530
throughout the years I switched to vodka.

963
00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:13.330
Then I ended up with fucking Johnny Walker Black and now I'm right back to

964
00:59:13.331 --> 00:59:15.750
Budweiser again. And uh,

965
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.550
I guess that was the moment after Johnny Walker Black where I was supposed to

966
00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.980
admit that I had a problem and stopped cold.

967
00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:25.850
But evidently I'm going to run the cycle all over again and go back and start

968
00:59:25.851 --> 00:59:30.400
dating some of the same psychos that I dated, you know,

969
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:31.011
next week.

970
00:59:31.011 --> 00:59:34.280
I'll tell you the story about me getting arrested for drinking and driving back

971
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:35.990
and fucking June, no,

972
00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:41.650
December of 1989 I was on my way back from Boston college to go watch the

973
00:59:41.841 --> 00:59:46.841
Patriots play fucking the Los Angeles rams cause I got season tickets.

974
00:59:47.301 --> 00:59:52.270
Who knew they were going to be five and 11? Um, anyways, so that's the posture.

975
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:56.690
You know what? It started off fucking, it started off strong.

976
00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:01.760
I was trashing the art of plumbing and then at dead Karen Carpenter,

977
01:00:01.761 --> 01:00:05.060
and then it just sort of tapered off. I, you know, I don't want to happen.

978
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.000
I shut up, fucking quit while I was ahead. But anyways,

979
01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:11.510
thanks to everyone who listens to these podcasts, I really appreciate it. And a,

980
01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:13.910
if you would actually, you know something, if you enjoy my podcast,

981
01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:17.270
could you please let people know about him because, uh, you know,

982
01:00:17.271 --> 01:00:20.030
I burn up a lot of minutes every week on my fucking cell phone.

983
01:00:20.031 --> 01:00:24.730
I'm getting brain cancer and I'm talking to like 15 people. And um,

984
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:25.940
I'd like to break 20.

985
01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:29.360
If I could get it up to 20 people before June 10th when I turned 40,

986
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:34.280
that would make me feel a whole lot better. All right? So, uh,

987
01:00:34.310 --> 01:00:38.810
thanks to everybody who, uh, who has been listening and,

988
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:43.730
uh, sorry, all the Karen Carpenter fans, I'm sorry to people who are plumbers.

989
01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.540
Actually, you know what? I'm not sorry. Okay. I'm not fucking sorry,

990
01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:48.740
because one of your,

991
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:52.970
I'll be sorry when some of you guys from the plumber's union have a little

992
01:00:52.971 --> 01:00:55.640
talking to, it's 10 20 fucking seven

993
01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.440
I started this podcast at 10 Oh three so did the 24 minute podcast.

994
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:05.210
I was hoping that the guy was going to walk in during the middle of it.

995
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.830
We could have a little reality show moment what he did,

996
01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.753
and you know what probably happened?

997
01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.380
He probably walked up half way through the stairs and hurt me pitching about

998
01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:16.520
fucking plumbers on my podcast. He didn't hear me talking to anybody.

999
01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:20.210
So you thought it was crazy or I was berating my wife,

1000
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:25.290
my non-existent wife. Oh God. Look at a gloom.

1001
01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:29.300
Look at the fucking gloom out the window. All right, that's it.

1002
01:01:29.301 --> 01:01:30.680
So please come out and see me,

1003
01:01:30.681 --> 01:01:35.030
a Chicago with Janie's this week or Caroline's in New York City at the end of

1004
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:37.670
the month or at a good nights in Raleigh, North Carolina,

1005
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:42.440
or the punchline in Atlanta, Georgia next month. All right, your motherfuckers.

1006
01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:47.210
I have a CD up on a iTunes called emotionally unavailable,

1007
01:01:47.211 --> 01:01:51.020
the expanded edition. Why don't you go there, buy it.

1008
01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:54.020
Buy for friend for plumber,

1009
01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:58.580
fucking break the CD and half stab him and his juggler.

1010
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.430
