00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 align:start position:0%
really good question I mean Nietzsche is
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.150 align:start position:0%
really good question I mean Nietzsche is
often<00:00:57.660><c> classed</c><00:00:57.899><c> with</c><00:00:58.079><c> the</c><00:00:58.260><c> existentialists</c>

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
often classed with the existentialists
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.310 align:start position:0%
often classed with the existentialists
right<00:00:59.370><c> and</c><00:00:59.640><c> so</c><00:01:00.180><c> one</c><00:01:00.510><c> of</c><00:01:00.539><c> the</c><00:01:00.780><c> tenants</c><00:01:01.140><c> of</c>

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
right and so one of the tenants of
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.290 align:start position:0%
right and so one of the tenants of
existentialist<00:01:02.070><c> there's</c><00:01:02.340><c> two</c><00:01:02.550><c> real</c><00:01:02.820><c> tenants</c>

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
existentialist there's two real tenants
 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.899 align:start position:0%
existentialist there's two real tenants
of<00:01:03.420><c> existentialism</c><00:01:04.339><c> there's</c><00:01:05.339><c> more</c><00:01:05.640><c> but</c>

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 align:start position:0%
of existentialism there's more but
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.660 align:start position:0%
of existentialism there's more but
obviously<00:01:06.659><c> we're</c><00:01:06.900><c> oversimplifying</c><00:01:07.680><c> but</c><00:01:07.920><c> one</c>

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 align:start position:0%
obviously we're oversimplifying but one
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.330 align:start position:0%
obviously we're oversimplifying but one
is<00:01:08.909><c> that</c><00:01:08.939><c> life</c><00:01:09.479><c> is</c><00:01:09.510><c> a</c><00:01:09.780><c> problem</c><00:01:10.320><c> it</c><00:01:11.220><c> isn't</c>

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
is that life is a problem it isn't
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.090 align:start position:0%
is that life is a problem it isn't
because<00:01:11.700><c> there's</c><00:01:11.880><c> something</c><00:01:12.090><c> wrong</c><00:01:12.240><c> with</c><00:01:12.780><c> you</c>

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 align:start position:0%
because there's something wrong with you
 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.249 align:start position:0%
because there's something wrong with you
it's<00:01:14.100><c> that</c><00:01:14.460><c> life</c><00:01:14.670><c> is</c><00:01:14.700><c> a</c><00:01:14.939><c> problem</c><00:01:15.479><c> and</c><00:01:15.630><c> so</c>

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 align:start position:0%
it's that life is a problem and so
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.870 align:start position:0%
it's that life is a problem and so
that's<00:01:16.470><c> often</c><00:01:16.740><c> contrasted</c><00:01:17.400><c> with</c><00:01:17.700><c> the</c>
