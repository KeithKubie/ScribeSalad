00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.110
So here is the pseudo code on the top right.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.820
And the first step therein is to create a path to an audio file.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.950
Now I will need AVFoundation to work with audio.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.628
So what I've done is imported that framework at the top of my code here.

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:18.540
Then I found an MP3 file of the movie quote I actually want to play from my app.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.880
This file currently resides on my desktop.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.640
By the way, it's also available for you to download in the instructor notes.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.120
To add this to our add what I will do is go back to Xcode,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.860
click on the file menu, and then click on Add Files to Pitch Perfect.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.920
And then simply add the MP3 file.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.790
Make sure this Copy items if needed box is checked.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.120
Okay, so now if you look in the Navigator,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.480
we've added the movie quote file to our project.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.860
I can drag it into the Supporting Files folder.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.450
All right, now that I have the MP3 file added to my project,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.390
I can get a handle on it inside viewDidLoad.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.160
Using the following piece of code.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.180
By the way, this code is also available in the instructor notes for you to use.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.666
So at this point I want you to use the Option key on your keyboard.

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:09.946
And try and figure out what these things called NSBundle, mainBundle, and

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:12.020
pathForResource are doing.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.940
Here is your question one more time.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.400
