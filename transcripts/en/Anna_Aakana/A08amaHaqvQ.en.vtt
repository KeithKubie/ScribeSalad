00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.503
Confidence. You either got it or
you don't, right?

00:00:02.503 --> 00:00:03.227
WRONG.

00:00:03.227 --> 00:00:07.061
You can achieve confidence through some
very simple, but weird feeling methods

00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:10.505
in which you consciously hold your mind
and your body in a different way.

00:00:10.505 --> 00:00:14.184
First of all, you gotta trick yourself.
"Fake it until you make it."

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:18.367
There's a reason why everybody says this,
and because eventually, you'll start

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:20.124
believing in your own "lie."

00:00:20.124 --> 00:00:23.198
Now, the second part, and the most
awkward feeling is

00:00:23.198 --> 00:00:25.000
changing your body language.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.761
No hands in pockets, no wandering crazy
eyes, no fidgeting,

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:32.092
Stand up straight. Pull your shoulders
back. Eyes ahead.

00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:37.914
We have a tendency to go inward. What you
need to do is very consciously go outward.

00:00:37.914 --> 00:00:41.122
I highly recommend reading "What Every
Body is Saying."

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:46.512
It's a book by a former FBI agent about body
language. And he teaches you "power poses"

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:51.024
that they typically teach to authority
figures to demonstrate dominance,

00:00:51.024 --> 00:00:53.427
and, you guessed it, confidence!

00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:56.264
Eye contact.
It's incredibly uncomfortable,

00:00:56.264 --> 00:01:00.294
but it can be a lot of fun. Challenge
yourself. Every time you and a stranger

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:04.946
make eye contact, force yourself not to be
the one who looks away first. I've gotten

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:09.844
into a LOT of fun staring contests trying
to challenge myself to do this.

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:15.284
Also, smile! Say hi to strangers. Talk to
people in line. It's so simple, but the

00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:19.012
more you do this, the more you realize
you have nothing to be afraid of!

00:01:19.012 --> 00:01:22.085
So as long as these strangers aren't
offering you candy that you're inclined

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:24.251
to accept, keep talking to them.

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.054
Most importantly,
get out of your own head.

00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:31.375
Just get outta there! I do this by
focusing on the other person. So when I'm

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:36.151
in a conversation with someone and I feel
self-conscious, I put ALL of my focus

00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:39.753
on them. What are they trying to say to
me? What are they trying to actually

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:44.691
communicate? And if you can put 100% of
your attention on the person in front of

00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:47.930
you, then there's none left to think about
yourself.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.253
Finally, when you talk,
(slowed) Slow. Down.

00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:55.752
(rapid) Not that slow. But when we get
excited, when we're performing, or when

00:01:55.752 --> 00:01:58.721
we're nervous, our voices tend to be
higher and faster. Which is interpreted

00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:01.460
as nerves. (Normal) You know, when you
see confident people,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.783
they walk and they talk and they act like
they have all the time in the world.

00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:10.343
And there's power in taking your time.

00:02:10.343 --> 00:02:13.120
There's no big secret to
achieving confidence.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.430
There are actual steps that you can take
to get there.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.145
It's like any other skill. You practice,
you work at it, and eventually,

00:02:21.145 --> 00:02:23.283
you've got the hang of it!

00:02:23.283 --> 00:02:28.492
And no one knows what you're thinking.
If you just walk and talk and act like

00:02:28.492 --> 00:02:33.146
you're comfortable in your own skin, the
rest of us will believe it.

00:02:33.146 --> 00:02:36.783
And you'll be a better person for it.
So good luck!

00:02:36.783 --> 00:02:41.238
Afflicted, Inc., my second short film,
should be out next week! Aah!

00:02:41.238 --> 00:02:44.740
I know I put a behind the scenes video
out for Emergency Call, which is our third

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.523
short film,

00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:49.691
and everyone was like "Where's Afflicted?"
And it's been in post-production, but it

00:02:49.691 --> 00:02:53.191
is finally almost done, it should be here
next week,

00:02:53.191 --> 00:02:55.145
I really hope you like it.

00:02:55.145 --> 00:02:59.375
I'm super proud of everything I'm doing
so far, and I feel like I'm getting better

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:00.819
and I feel like I'm learning,

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.738
and if I keep doing this for just 10 years
you know, I'll just be amazing!

00:03:04.738 --> 00:03:07.876
So, I'm having the time of my life.
Honestly.

00:03:07.876 --> 00:03:12.845
And I could just..jizz. Everywhere. Like,
"Thank you. Oscar. Oscar. Yes."

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:17.960
But speaking of how I can even afford to
do any of these creative dreams of mine,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.145
thank you so much to Audible for
sponsoring today's episode.

00:03:31.814 --> 00:03:37.814
They have 12. Audio. Karma sutra books!
So how can you not go?

00:03:37.814 --> 00:03:41.330
One thing I'm listening to right now is
The Tommyknockers by Stephen King,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.461
which I LOVE because I'm just fascinated
with aliens, like, fascinated with aliens.

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:50.154
But yeah, you can get that, or another
free audiobook of your choice

Stay awesome, Gotham!
CONFIDENCE!

00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.191
Hi, I'm Anna Akana, I have a Youtube
channel, currently.

00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:16.678
I initially started getting into Youtube
because I wanted more opportunities

00:04:16.678 --> 00:04:21.405
to act. As an actor, you wait around a lot
for auditions, for your agent to call,

00:04:21.405 --> 00:04:24.993
and I wanted to do something more,
and get better at storytelling.

00:04:24.993 --> 00:04:27.221
So that's how I ended up on the internet.

00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:30.406
So Afflicted, Inc. is the second short
of the year,

00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:35.095
it's about a company whose employees are
actually personified afflictions.

00:04:35.095 --> 00:04:37.389
So they visually look like monsters.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:48.812
