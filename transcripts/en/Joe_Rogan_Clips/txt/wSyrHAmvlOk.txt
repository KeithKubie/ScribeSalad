Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. Well that is the one area of your life where you've got some or furry in control and that's, yeah, that is what on the bow is like the, well I can stop myself being like, uh, uh, watching pornography. I can stop myself using drugs if I want to. Like, you know, we have some support and that's what that this book here, mentors, we should talk about you in only for a paragraph. You know what I mean? It's not too, it's not like, uh, like literary fellatio. It's as a small nod of your, uh, of your influence in impaction. I talk about how we have light and latent qualities within us that are sometimes hard to realize on, on without support. But if you find a mentor in an area where you're looking to improve, they can get kind of energized, awakened energies within you there on your own you wouldn't be able to use.

Speaker 1:          00:55          I had a really recent experience of it where I was sort of like freaking out about something. I spoke to like a, a mentor of mine and like the way that you sort of spoke to me was like sort of aggressive, like a sort of an aggressive, that's not going to happen. You are not afraid. And like it sort of woke up the part of me that's feels that way, that has that kind of, I would say sort of a male certainty are kind of grounded energy. He was able to sort of like direct at me and like in that moment in myself or but welded, I wasn't able to do it, you know, and needed to resource it externally in a moment. So this is how I sort of feel like your individual journey. I'm interested in how, because I'm guessing with your background in martial arts and stuff, men or ships seems pretty much stitched into that you must continually be looking at someone learning from someone, trying to equal them or whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          01:43          Yeah. The good part about that, as you get good at learning things and you get good at listening, you know, uh, as a martial arts student, you don't just listen, you listen very intently. You bow, you say, sir, you know, I mean there's a, there's so much discipline involved in the, the, the act of learning. Yeah. And so much reverence and respect for people to know more than you and appreciation. So, uh, that, that helped me with pretty much everything I ever wanted to learn. I just would listen very intently and I don't think, ah, maybe I could figure it out better. I will. I'm very good at listening to people that are good at things.

Speaker 1:          02:17          That's interesting. Did you first get into like, you know, I've picked up stuff over the various shows that, of yours that I've listened to, but would you say that your inaugural rural interest in martial arts came from kind of domestic distress and stuff? We have a difficult home life and, and not a good relationship with your Stepdad Mri.

Speaker 2:          02:37          There was that, but it was, was also moved moving more than anything. Anonymous does a nice guy, but it was stepped out. It's always a weird situation. You know?

Speaker 1:          02:47          No one likes the dynamic of someone having sex with their mother. I remember I had similar feelings about my [inaudible]. I don't want to like, no, of course I'm in a

Speaker 2:          02:57          bad way. Not just what was really hard was moving a lot and running into bullies. That was way harder than anything else. So there was a time in your life where you felt very presumably vulnerable. Yeah. Not grounded. Didn't have any friends. Constantly moving in new neighborhoods, meeting New People and uh, you know, and when you're a young boy, you're a teenage boy. Teenage boys are fucking dangerous. Yeah. Made it worse. They're the worst. You see a group of them. Now I'm talking about my country for 1314 years old are across the street. Yeah. Loneliness. Well, young boys are just, they're always looking to impress each other and the, the, they have these, if you want to find real toxic masculinity, it exists in teenage boys. Yeah. And it's mostly exaggerated, didn't men, the way it's described as mostly exaggerated in terms of the way the media talks about it, but in its purest form and teenage boys, they get together and they start light and frogs on fire and doing shit.

Speaker 2:          03:50          They do things because they want to like one up each other and they feed off of each other. Like what one boy would do is so different than what five boys would do, what five boys would do. It could be horrific, but with one boy would do on his own. It's very rarely there because what you know, you have to think about yourself and think about is this right? And you objectively analyze the way you're behaving and I'm like, um, yeah. People wouldn't be proud of me if I did it this way. When you're with five other boys and you're all rambunctious and fill with testosterone and piss and vinegar, you wind up doing crazy things. This is I, you know, when I hear something like that, it's difficult not to think that it's of course relative relative to us, the behavior of adolescent mouse is reckless and crazy. It's not impossible to conceive of an intelligent that would look at the behavior of adult human beings and think, oh my God. Yeah, all what's governing these people? What principals are they using right now? Like, what's the end goal to like what are you trying to accomplish with your life, with your existence, with your time?
