00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:14.409
Ask most movie fans, “What was the first
‘talkie’?”

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:18.270
The most frequent reply tends to be “The
Jazz Singer” starring Al Jolson.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.790
This is a “sort of” correct answer, but
not really.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.180
The earliest “sound” movies were made
by synchronizing motion pictures to phonograph

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.180
records.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.920
In 1926, (a year before “The Jazz Singer”)
Warner Brothers re-released the previously

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.730
silent film “Don Juan” with a soundtrack
recording done by the New York Philharmonic

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.730
Orchestra.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.910
Warner Brothers also released the first actual
all-talking, feature-length motion picture

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.080
in 1928.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.820
It was called “Lights of New York.”

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.960
The following year, Twentieth Century Fox
released “In Old Arizona,” the first all-talkie

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.730
feature with sound directly recorded on the
film.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.329
“The Jazz Singer” was actually a silent
movie with poorly synchronized musical numbers

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.580
and a few sentences of spoken words.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.390
One of the main reasons “The Jazz Singer”
is such a legendary film is because of its

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.930
star- the immortal Al Jolson.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.560
Jolson was, by all accounts, the “Elvis
Presley” of his time.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.710
At the time “The Jazz Singer” was released,
Jolson was one of the biggest stars in show

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.710
business.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.460
(As a sidebar, Jolson did make several films
after “The Jazz Singer,” but none came

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.650
close to it in popularity or historical significance.)

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.360
Many current movie fans are familiar, at least
somewhat, with Jolson and his show biz legacy,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.450
but he has few current-day fans.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.189
This is partly because Jolson’s schtick
was the “blackface” act, which is, to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.880
contemporary movie fans, beyond disgusting.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.070
Jolson in The Jazz Singer
Jolson in The Jazz Singer

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.370
“Blackface,” which is captured for posterity
in many films of the first half of the twentieth

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.280
century, is a sad reminder to most people
of the ridicule and mistreatment of African-Americans.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.340
Such a thing would be unimaginable today.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.170
Jolson didn’t always use “blackface”
in his act, but because most people of today

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.270
know him only by “The Jazz Singer,” his
reputation is often as a symbol of a very

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.340
backward time.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.229
Also, Jolson’s singing style, unlike Elvis’
or Frank Sinatra’s or Dean Martin’s, does

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.450
not hold up well.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.880
His songs seem rather hokey and schmaltzy.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.890
His singing style is clipped and choppy, not
melodic.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.860
His dance moves look rather silly and dated.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.860
Supposedly, Jolson was not a nice man in real
life either.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.330
Most of his fellow performers say he was deeply
insecure.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.380
According to his contemporary, Groucho Marx,
Jolson was so insecure he would leave the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.090
water faucet running in his dressing room
during his live appearances, so he couldn’t

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.500
hear the applause for the previous acts.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.140
During his Broadway appearances, Jolson would
often stop the show in the middle and say

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.030
to the audience, “Hey folks, do you wanna
hear the rest of the show or do you want to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.310
hear Jolie sing?”

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.420
The crowd would, inevitably, applaud and cheer
for the show to stop.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.690
At this point, “Jolie” (Jolson’s nickname)
would sing some songs to the wildly appreciative

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.690
crowd.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.690
One wonders how the rest of the cast of these
shows reacted to this.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.690
What an ego- to pull off a stunt like that-
and routinely yet!

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.260
Jolson really wasn’t such a great guy- or
was he?

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.470
No one is all-bad (or all-good).

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.740
In fact, Jolson was, ironically given the
perception today, an early crusader for the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.290
rights of African-Americans in show business.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.190
For instance, he was instrumental in helping
to promote black playwright Garland Anderson’s

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.819
work, which resulted in the first Broadway
production with an all-black cast.

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.379
He also attempted to have an all-black dance
team featured in a Broadway show at a time

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.160
when black people were banned from Broadway
productions.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.750
As black dancer Jeni LeGon said, “In those
times, it was a ‘black-and-white world.’

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.520
You didn’t associate too much socially with
any of the stars.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.819
You saw them at the studio, you know, nice—but
they didn’t invite.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.819
The only ones that ever invited us home for
a visit was Al Jolson and Ruby Keeler.”

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.470
In another instance, Jolson read that songwriters
Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake, neither of whom

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.820
he knew at the time, had been thrown out of
a restaurant because of their race.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.040
When he heard this, he tracked the pair down
and took them out to dinner and reportedly

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.200
told them, “He’d punch anyone in the nose
who tried to kick us out!”

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.959
As for his “blackface” persona which seems
to (almost literally) fly in the face of his

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.050
apparent true feelings on race, this persona
was often used as a means to introduce white

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.150
audiences to black culture, and also to make
fun of the general idea of “white supremacy.”

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.210
As such, when black audiences saw “The Jazz
Singer,” rather than boycott it, a Harlem

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.240
newspaper, Amsterdam News (today “the oldest
Black newspaper in the country,” according

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.739
to their website), stated that The Jazz Singer
was “one of the greatest pictures ever produced,”

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.680
and that, “Every colored performer is proud
of him (Jolson).”

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.440
Jolson also insisted on the hiring and fair
treatment of black people at a time when this

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.800
was an outlandish concept to many in America.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.290
(For example, at the time members of the KKK
are estimated to have accounted for about

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.599
15% of the U.S.’s voting-age population.)

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.569
He also crusaded for equal rights for African-American
as early as 1911, when he was 25.

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:20.350
Through his very controversial portrayals,
and advocating for black performers, Jolson

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.680
helped pave the way for the success of such
legends as Louis Armstrong, Ethyl Waters,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.580
Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.639
As the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture
stated, “Almost single-handedly, Jolson

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.840
helped to introduce African-American musical
innovations like jazz, ragtime, and the blues

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.339
to white audiences.”

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:39.800
Famed African-American jazz singer Clarence
Henry noted of Jolson, “Jolson?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.919
I loved him.

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.070
I think he did wonders for the blacks and
glorified entertainment.”

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.410
Beyond the controversy surrounding Jolson,
he was also the first performer to entertain

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.259
American troops in WWII.

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.589
A few years later, he was also the first to
do the same during the Korean War.

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:55.270
Yes, before Bob Hope!

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.659
His break-neck performance schedule in the
latter is also thought to have contributed

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.280
to his death soon after.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.550
In his later years, Jolson, for the most part,
led a contented life of semi-retirement.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.830
He remained a huge legend and icon.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.919
Even as late as 1948, with Frank Sinatra,
Bing Crosby, Dean Martin and other singers

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.630
on the scene, Jolson was voted America’s
“Most Popular Male Singer.”

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.630
Jolson’s life was also the subject of a
very popular film in 1947 called “The Jolson

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:16.630
Story.”

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.630
Interestingly, the film actually tries to
explain the reason why “blackface” style

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.630
singing was so popular with so many singers
of the earlier part of the century.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.630
While still a bit awkward in retrospect, the
tribute to Jolson and his legacy is quite

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.630
fascinating and often touching.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.630
One realizes that while the writers of the
film are trying to explain the reason for

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.630
“blackface” to the viewers, one also suspects
they are trying to explain it to themselves.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.630
Al Jolson died shortly after entertaining
the troops in 1950.

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.630
He left a wife and two newly-adopted children.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.630
Reportedly, black performers “lined the
way” at his funeral to pay their respects

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.780
to the man that had helped popularly introduce
white America to elements of black culture.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.440
In the end, Al Jolson is often seen today
as a “villain,” and it is perhaps an understatement

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.340
to say that even to his most staunch supporters,
Jolson remains a controversial figure.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:06:01.210
But it would seem the truth is that Al Jolson
was, much like us all, a mixed bag.
