00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680
One of the strangest things about relationships is that we're not free to feel attracted to just anyone.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.560
We tend to have very strong psychological types that we can't deviate from.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:19.580
All of us carry inside us very specific inner shopping lists, defining what the people we can love need to be like as characters.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.340
You might think these shopping lists would be focused around lovely requirements.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.920
Like that our potential lovers would need to be kind, understanding, friendly and from our age and social group.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.640
But the shopping lists are in fact often a lot weirder and darker.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.780
We may end up neglecting all sorts of potential candidates, dismissing them as boring or yucky or somehow just wrong

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.600
and heading straight to people whose characteristics are pretty awkward and not conducive to our happiness.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.620
For example, we may only be able to fall in love with people who are much less clever or responsible than we are.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.160
Or who are really unreliable, or who are selfish and self-absorbed, or sarcastic and mean.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.700
It can be very puzzling to those around us and to ourselves.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.280
Why on earth can't we settle down with people who are good for us?

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.240
That's because what we're looking for in love isn't necessarily someone who is nice, pure and simple

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.640
but someone who feels familiar.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.260
And a lot of us learned about love in childhood, at the hands of people who were, in a variety of ways, trouble for us

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.200
and who continue unconsciously to guide our love types.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.420
Our earliest caregivers give us templates of what it is to love and be loved

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.820
which can cause havoc with our chances of happiness.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.920
The trickiness in our love types tend to go in one of three ways.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.340
Let's imagine dad was cold or violent or abusive, or mom was belittling, unavailable or controlling.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.380
It was horrible, yet that ends up being what we look for in love.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.920
Why would we ever repeat something that was deeply uncomfortable?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.980
Well, because even though it was horrible, it was still a love relationship.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:04.340
There was abuse but also, let's imagine, a degree of familiarity, admiration, attachment and even tenderness.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.920
They may have been belittling, but it's what we got used to.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.900
And now, however illogical it sounds, it doesn't quite feel right unless it's kind of awful as well.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.640
It's not nice as such, but it feels comfortingly, compellingly familiar.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.600
Or, imagine the experience firsthand... what it was like to be made to feel terrible, to be humiliated and hurt.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.060
And then, weirdly, we may end up doing the same thing to someone else.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.380
Humiliating them in turn, bossing them about, going cold on them just when they're vulnerable to us.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.780
It's as if a primitive part of us thinks that the only way not to be abused is to be the abuser.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.260
Deep inside the child-like emotional self thinks, the person who did that thing to me was, in a way, the opposite of me,

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.440
and that must be the place of safety, and that's who I want to be in any relationship.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.560
When parents cause us trouble, we're often so keen to get away from it, we develop blocks around all kind of character traits they may have had

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.200
which might actually have been good and actually unrelated to the troublesome traits.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.420
So, for example, our father might have been belittling but highly intelligent.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.800
Now, regrettably, anyone intelligent can be seen hugely putting us off.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:24.760
Or we always felt our mother was somehow revolted by sexuality, ours especially, but she was really warm and cuddly.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.900
Now, sadly, anyone who is warm and cuddly is imagined to be punitive around sex

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.680
and hence feels wrong and has to be rejected.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.500
Our inner love maps are really hard to tease out.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.680
They certainly don't spell themselves out, so we have to make efforts to find out what they're dictating

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.300
so as to free ourselves from their demands.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.240
The investigation starts, as always, by trying to understand ourselves.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.800
What did I suffer from at the hands of my early caregivers?

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.520
Am I finding myself drawn to that in adults I fancy?

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.060
Am I causing trouble for people in ways I might have suffered from when I was young?

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.660
Am I putting off certain people because they have traits I associate with people who cause me difficulties as a child?

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.160
Might I in other people find the traits I like without the ones I fear?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.160
Emotional health means expanding on the number of people we're free to fall in love with.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.140
We learn about love in childhood,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.840
but we liberate ourselves from the traumas of childhood when we realize we can love in different ways,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.060
and get used to something that may at first be eerily and challengingly unfamiliar.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.460
Being happy with someone who is properly and deeply good for us.
