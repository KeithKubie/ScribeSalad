00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.969
Recall that we started the lesson with
this idea for multiplying polynomials.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.030
Convert to the value representation,
multiply the polynomials there,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.640
just by multiplying the corresponding
values, and then convert back.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.340
Rounding up to the nearest power of 2,
we might have written these

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.120
running times like so,
in terms of our parameter N.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.268
With the Fast Fourier Transform,
we were able to do the evaluation,

00:00:26.268 --> 00:00:29.854
not in quadratic time, but
on linearithmic time and log N.

00:00:29.854 --> 00:00:31.211
And even more remarkably,

00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:35.440
we were able to apply this same trick
to do the interpolation as well.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.220
We just had to pass in
the inverse of the root of unity

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.420
that we had used in the evaluation.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.289
The conclusion is that order N
polynomials can be multiplied in order N

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.950
log N time.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.710
Remember that polynomial multiplication
was just a convenient way to think about

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.920
the more general problem of convolution.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.080
Therefore, in general, convolving an N
long sequence with an m long sequence

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.590
takes time on the order of n+m
times the log of n+m operations.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.450
This is a truly remarkable and
powerful result.
