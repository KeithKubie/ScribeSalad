00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.100
Whether at school or at the office, the times
that you need your brain at its sharpest are

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.740
inevitably spent in cramped, crowded spaces,
where air flow is…

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.769
YAWN...No...must...keep..brain..awake!

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:24.770
Hey everybody, this is Matt Lieberman filling
in for DNews.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.890
Researchers and civilians alike have long
been aware of the harmful effects of high

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.300
levels of carbon dioxide on the brain.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.829
For example, an environment where the air
contains 100,000 parts per million of CO2

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.890
can render an adult unconscious.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.809
But few had considered what low amounts of
carbon dioxide could do to the human brain.

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.960
It turns out, even levels as low as low as
1,000 parts per million can reduce the brain’s

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.079
ability to focus and function properly, and
considering that we produce carbon dioxide

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.800
every time we exhale, that’s a big ol’
problem.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.760
The longer we stay in an unventilated space,
especially with multiple people, the higher

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.859
the concentration of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.119
Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory drew inspiration from a 2012 study

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.230
in Budapest, the first on record to examine
the negative effects of small environments

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.930
with CO2 levels of 3000 parts per million.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.960
Now, the prevailing theories in the field
of human concentration were focused exclusively

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.010
on the effects of volatile organic compounds,
or VOCs, on the human brain.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.190
These are gases emitted from building materials
and personal care products found in a work

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.190
environment.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.560
However, they never accounted for the level
of carbon dioxide that can build up in a crowded

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.210
space over time.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.640
So what’s a researcher with a scientific
itch to do?

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.670
Give it a good, long scratch with a sweet
little study.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.330
Check this out: Berkeley’s William Fisk
collaborated with SUNY Upstate Medical University’s

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.050
Usha Satish to see how well a small group
of participants -- 22 to be exact -- could

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.520
perform a test called the Strategic Management
Simulation in an environment containing 600,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.620
1000, and then 2500 parts per million of CO2.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.180
What is the Strategic Management Simulation?

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.990
It’s a series of hypothetical scenarios
that participants must develop strategic responses

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.990
for.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.290
Think Dungeons and Dragons without the dungeons,
dragons, or dice.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.420
Or swords or magic.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.240
Participants in the SMS were then graded on
nine different criteria, ranging from Focus,

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.010
Initiative, Information Usage, and Basic Strategy.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.200
The results are striking, to say the least.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.629
The impact of CO2 at 2500 parts per million
on the human brain is the equivalent of a

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.280
blood alcohol level of .08, the legal limit
to drive in the majority of the US.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.980
So how common are environments containing
2500 ppm or more of CO2?

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.019
Well, Fisk told Vox.com that the majority
of offices are below 1000 ppm, but a crowded

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.790
conference room can easily exceed the 2500
threshold in the span of 30 minutes.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.319
But of course these findings need to be replicated
on a larger scale to be authenticated.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.040
Until then, however, let’s all crack a collective
window, shall we?

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.360
So what do you think about the effects of
Carbon Dioxide on the human brain?

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.019
