ALVARO VIDELA: I'm Alvaro.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.030
I'm a writer, a developer.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:03.990
And this is how I code.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.040
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.520
I like to work next to my
personal library, going

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.950
from book to book,
spreading them

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.620
on the floor, over
the bed, over my desk,

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.360
trying to find great ideas for
either writing a nice article

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.660
or for writing my code.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.775

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.470
When trying to solve
programming problems,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.020
it's nice to find the
right framing metaphor that

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.810
can help you and guide you
and provide you a vocabulary

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.100
to understand the problem.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.300
Think about data replication
in distributed systems.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.670
If you think of that
as gossip, then you

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.652
have a very nice way to
explain how replication works.

00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:43.860
But there is not really a
good mathematical framework

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.580
for that.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.490
But if you think of
replication as epidemics,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.470
there is a whole
theory of epidemics

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.290
behind mathematics
that can help you think

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.060
and reason about that problem.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.920
You can work your little magic.
