00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.870
Your brain is bathing in about half a cup
of fluid, with up to 24mL being made an hour…

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.650
but your skull is pretty firm and doesn’t
expand… soooo where does all this fluid

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.650
go??

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.590
Much like how buildings drain excess fluids
through pipes that lead into a sewage system,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.480
our bodies also have a network of vessels
for moving things, like fluids, around.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.000
It’s called the lymphatic system, and while
this network seems to run all throughout the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.270
body, it hadn’t been observed around much
of the brain in humans… until recently.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.160
Using magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI,
clinicians injected a dye-like substance to

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.289
help them visualize the pooling of liquid
in human and marmoset brains.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.880
In MRIs of both species, they saw evidence
that fluid leaked out of the blood vessels

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.309
surrounding the brain…..

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.780
And collected into what seemed like lymphatic
vessels!

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.390
This is a big deal, because we didn’t know
where these lymphatic vessels were or if they

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.710
were even THERE.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.170
Now we know they’re part of the outermost
layer of connective tissue surrounding the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.030
brain-- called the dura.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.800
This finding will open up so many more avenues
of research….

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.440
Imagine that you didn’t know where any of
the pipes were in your home, or that you couldn’t

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.290
even find the toilet, really…If something
were ever going wrong, you wouldn’t be able

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.410
to find the source of the problem and Sparing
you the detailed description - it’d be a

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.410
stinkin’ mess.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.080
And we’ve gone years without being able
to fully identify this path of waste out of

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.440
the brain, and this might be relevant to degenerative
diseases related to aging.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.850
Like Alzheimer’s disease, where toxic by-products
build up in the brain instead of getting removed.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.030
But that’s just one avenue -- the lymphatic
system does so much more than remove waste.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.140
In other parts of the human body and in rodent
brains, the lymphatic system helps traffic

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.480
immune cells between the blood and different
tissues.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.530
Interestingly, while the blood vessels directly
supplying blood to the brain have a protective

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.110
layer called the blood brain barrier controlling
what gets in -- the arteries and lymphatic

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.600
vessels OUTSIDE the brain don’t have the
same gating system.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.500
This means that they are an easier entry point
for dysfunctional immune cells to get on the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.020
highway to the brain.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.390
This has been observed in other parts of the
human body, and also in rodent brains, but

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.850
this study didn’t get that far.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.280
Instead, it showed the lymphatic vessels were
PRESENT in the dura, that fluid COLLECTED

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.440
in them, and that it drained out of the brain.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.870
BUT, future studies will focus on whether
immune cells can also travel into the brain

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.370
via these vessels.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.650
Because if they can, the researchers hypothesize
these newly located lymphatic vessels might

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.019
be incorrectly trafficking immune cells around
the brain in diseases like multiple sclerosis.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.159
There are still lots of mind-blowing questions
to ask about the lymphatic system surrounding

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:32.400
the brain, but hey, at least we know how our
heads won’t literally explode from all the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.400
fluid in em!

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.820
Thanks for watching, Julian has a great video
about the Blood Brain Barrier and how it works

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.392
And it’s awesome. You can watch it here.

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:44.159
Oh and one last thing: Previous
studies in mice found that there’s an increase

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.100
in fluid flow during sleep -- so perhaps these
lymphatic vessels are working extra duty to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.759
pump out toxins while we slumber and maybe
that’s why sleep is so important?
