00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:47.930
time maybe a factor of thousand and then
the amplitude of the pulse will decrease

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940
the amplitude of the pulse will decrease
 

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.330
the amplitude of the pulse will decrease
also a factor of thousand then you take

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:50.340
also a factor of thousand then you take
 

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.950
also a factor of thousand then you take
the pulse and send it through the

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:51.960
the pulse and send it through the
 

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.560
the pulse and send it through the
amplifier the pulse is increased in

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:54.570
amplifier the pulse is increased in
 

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.900
amplifier the pulse is increased in
amplitude and finally in the finals that

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:56.910
amplitude and finally in the finals that
 

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.570
amplitude and finally in the finals that
you compress the pulse so that it has

00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580
you compress the pulse so that it has
 

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.270
you compress the pulse so that it has
the same duration as your importance but

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:02.280
the same duration as your importance but
 

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.020
the same duration as your importance but
now with a much higher intensity and

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.030
now with a much higher intensity and
 

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.280
now with a much higher intensity and
here you can see the development of

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:07.290
here you can see the development of
 

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.530

the CPI technique basically every four
 

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.380
the CPI technique basically every four
or five years the pulse intensity

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:15.390
or five years the pulse intensity
 

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.160
or five years the pulse intensity
doubled and this gave a possibility for

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.170
doubled and this gave a possibility for
 

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.010
doubled and this gave a possibility for
a rather wide range of applications both

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:22.020
a rather wide range of applications both
 

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.620

but I think that it's somewhat I guess

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:39.380
but I think that it's somewhat I guess
 

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.380

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360
in chemistry engineering so this
 

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.570
in chemistry engineering so this
development has just started and we can

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:07.580
development has just started and we can
 

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.549
development has just started and we can
expect much more to come that's exciting

00:19:09.549 --> 00:19:09.559
expect much more to come that's exciting
 

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:12.700
expect much more to come that's exciting

individual interviews but maybe some of
 

00:19:31.399 --> 00:19:32.740
individual interviews but maybe some of
you would like to ask something while

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:32.750
you would like to ask something while
 

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:39.440
you would like to ask something while
we're all here no

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:39.450
we're all here no
 

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:44.000
we're all here no
please did you talk to all of this

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.010
please did you talk to all of this
 

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.810

nearest Lawrence yes we did there was a

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:46.820
nearest Lawrence yes we did there was a
 

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.220
nearest Lawrence yes we did there was a
bit of a problem with one of the phone

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:49.230
bit of a problem with one of the phone
 

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.570
bit of a problem with one of the phone
connections and that's why we were

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:50.580
connections and that's why we were
 

00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:52.550
connections and that's why we were
delayed for five minutes but we spoken

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:52.560
delayed for five minutes but we spoken
 

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:56.840
delayed for five minutes but we spoken
to all of them and doctor Ashkan told us

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:56.850
to all of them and doctor Ashkan told us
 

00:19:56.850 --> 00:19:59.210
to all of them and doctor Ashkan told us
that he may not be able to give any

00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.220
that he may not be able to give any
 

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.670
that he may not be able to give any
interviews because he's very busy with

but would you be able to give us an idea

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:41.850
but would you be able to give us an idea
 

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:43.940
but would you be able to give us an idea
of the percentage of women that are

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:43.950
of the percentage of women that are
 

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:49.310
of the percentage of women that are
nominated for these prizes we have not I

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320
nominated for these prizes we have not I
 

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.670
nominated for these prizes we have not I
don't have the statistics here in front

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:52.680
don't have the statistics here in front
 

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.090
don't have the statistics here in front
of me it's it's a small percentage

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.100
of me it's it's a small percentage
 

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.310
of me it's it's a small percentage
that's for sure and that's why we're

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320
that's for sure and that's why we're
 

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.620
that's for sure and that's why we're
taking measures to encourage more

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:03.630
taking measures to encourage more
 

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.680
taking measures to encourage more
nominations because we don't want to

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:06.690
nominations because we don't want to
 

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.880
nominations because we don't want to
miss anyone let me point out that these

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:10.890
miss anyone let me point out that these
 

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:13.280
miss anyone let me point out that these
measures that we have been mentioning in

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:13.290
measures that we have been mentioning in
 

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:16.790

I mean I can I we cannot give you the

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:43.230
I mean I can I we cannot give you the
 

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:45.590
I mean I can I we cannot give you the
percentages of course but let me just

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600
percentages of course but let me just
 

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.170
percentages of course but let me just
point out that the percentage reflects

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:48.180
point out that the percentage reflects
 

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.190
point out that the percentage reflects
the number of women in science back if

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200
the number of women in science back if
 

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.210
the number of women in science back if
you go back to

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:53.220
you go back to
 

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.580
you go back to
thirty years so the number has been

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:55.590
thirty years so the number has been
 

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.580
thirty years so the number has been
increasing steadily over the years but

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:58.590
increasing steadily over the years but
 

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.770
increasing steadily over the years but
the number of nominations rather reflect

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.780
the number of nominations rather reflect
 

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.220
the number of nominations rather reflect
the percentages as they were saying two

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:04.230
the percentages as they were saying two
 

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:08.149
the percentages as they were saying two
or three decades back in time thank you

00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:08.159
or three decades back in time thank you
 

00:22:08.159 --> 00:22:11.960
or three decades back in time thank you
good point if there are no more

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:11.970
good point if there are no more
 

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.260
good point if there are no more
questions thank you very much now the

00:23:55.140 --> 00:24:15.680
 
yes that would be your betters work

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:15.690
yes that would be your betters work
 

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:59.310
yes that would be your betters work
remember

00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320
 
 

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.409
 
that's lotion member of the Nobel

00:25:02.409 --> 00:25:02.419
that's lotion member of the Nobel
 

00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:06.669
that's lotion member of the Nobel
Committee for physics inventions were

00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679
Committee for physics inventions were
 

00:25:06.679 --> 00:25:11.379
Committee for physics inventions were
awarded today it was about the tools

00:25:11.379 --> 00:25:11.389
awarded today it was about the tools
 

00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:14.200
awarded today it was about the tools
made of life sounds actually like

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:14.210
made of life sounds actually like
 

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:17.529
made of life sounds actually like
science fiction can you say something of

00:25:17.529 --> 00:25:17.539
science fiction can you say something of
 

00:25:17.539 --> 00:25:20.379
science fiction can you say something of
the history behind the optical tweezers

00:25:20.379 --> 00:25:20.389
the history behind the optical tweezers
 

00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:24.340
the history behind the optical tweezers
for example I think that author Ashkan

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:24.350
for example I think that author Ashkan
 

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:27.190
for example I think that author Ashkan
very soon after the first laser had been

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:27.200
very soon after the first laser had been
 

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.430
very soon after the first laser had been
constructed realized that suddenly there

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440
constructed realized that suddenly there
 

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.759
constructed realized that suddenly there
was available a tool of light or the

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:33.769
was available a tool of light or the
 

00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:35.979
was available a tool of light or the
totally different quality than you had

00:25:35.979 --> 00:25:35.989
totally different quality than you had
 

00:25:35.989 --> 00:25:39.399
totally different quality than you had
earlier and he started to think about

00:25:39.399 --> 00:25:39.409
earlier and he started to think about
 

00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:43.419
earlier and he started to think about
how can one use his tool to manipulate

00:25:43.419 --> 00:25:43.429
how can one use his tool to manipulate
 

00:25:43.429 --> 00:25:49.629
how can one use his tool to manipulate
objects and he realized that by thinking

00:25:49.629 --> 00:25:49.639
objects and he realized that by thinking
 

00:25:49.639 --> 00:25:53.049
objects and he realized that by thinking
about this he realized that just take a

00:25:53.049 --> 00:25:53.059
about this he realized that just take a
 

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:57.609
about this he realized that just take a
small micro sized transparent sphere it

00:25:57.609 --> 00:25:57.619
small micro sized transparent sphere it
 

00:25:57.619 --> 00:26:00.279
small micro sized transparent sphere it
should be possible even if the radiation

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:00.289
should be possible even if the radiation
 

00:26:00.289 --> 00:26:03.310
should be possible even if the radiation
pressure from the laser is very small it

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320
pressure from the laser is very small it
 

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.950
pressure from the laser is very small it
should be possible to manipulate such a

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960
should be possible to manipulate such a
 

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.109
should be possible to manipulate such a
sphere and indeed he was correct and

00:26:08.109 --> 00:26:08.119
sphere and indeed he was correct and
 

00:26:08.119 --> 00:26:13.869
sphere and indeed he was correct and
already 1970 he had demonstrated this so

00:26:13.869 --> 00:26:13.879
already 1970 he had demonstrated this so
 

00:26:13.879 --> 00:26:16.029
already 1970 he had demonstrated this so
that but and of course that was a long

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:16.039
that but and of course that was a long
 

00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:19.539
that but and of course that was a long
development one development that that

00:26:19.539 --> 00:26:19.549
development one development that that
 

00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:21.489
development one development that that
went into the direction of manipulating

00:26:21.489 --> 00:26:21.499
went into the direction of manipulating
 

00:26:21.499 --> 00:26:24.210
went into the direction of manipulating
atoms something much smaller than than

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:24.220
atoms something much smaller than than
 

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.060
atoms something much smaller than than
microsites feared but he also wanted to

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:28.070
microsites feared but he also wanted to
 

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:30.070
microsites feared but he also wanted to
think about something much more complex

did they want to develop such things and
 

00:28:29.649 --> 00:28:31.620
did they want to develop such things and
I think there are several reasons I mean

if you saw the curve I did that was the
 

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:37.019
if you saw the curve I did that was the
sort of a plateau over 15 years and as a

higher and higher intensity where you

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:45.190
higher and higher intensity where you

really start to not only talk to the

00:28:48.990 --> 00:28:49.000
really start to not only talk to the
 

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.560
really start to not only talk to the
molecule or atom but really to seriously

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:52.570
molecule or atom but really to seriously
 

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.470

influence it and this is something that

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480
influence it and this is something that
 

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:59.159
influence it and this is something that
really started with the invention of the

00:28:59.159 --> 00:28:59.169
really started with the invention of the
 

00:28:59.169 --> 00:29:00.899
really started with the invention of the
CPA technique because then you get

00:29:00.899 --> 00:29:00.909
CPA technique because then you get
 

00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:03.899
CPA technique because then you get
pulses or sufficiently high intensity so

00:29:03.899 --> 00:29:03.909
pulses or sufficiently high intensity so
 

00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:06.570
pulses or sufficiently high intensity so
that when interacting with atoms and

00:29:06.570 --> 00:29:06.580
that when interacting with atoms and
 

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.460
that when interacting with atoms and
molecules it was no longer a small

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:08.470
molecules it was no longer a small
 

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:10.789
molecules it was no longer a small
perturbation but it was a drastic change

00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799
perturbation but it was a drastic change
 

00:29:10.799 --> 00:29:13.440
perturbation but it was a drastic change
of the electron shell of the atom and

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:13.450
of the electron shell of the atom and
 

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.230
of the electron shell of the atom and
this then led to strong field physics

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240
this then led to strong field physics
 

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.470
this then led to strong field physics
and out to second metrology in physics

then you're on the wrong wrong track you

00:33:09.390 --> 00:33:09.400
then you're on the wrong wrong track you

should choose the topic first then look

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:12.220
should choose the topic first then look
 

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:14.970
should choose the topic first then look
for people that are doing this and try

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:14.980
for people that are doing this and try

admittedly but

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:19.850
admittedly but
