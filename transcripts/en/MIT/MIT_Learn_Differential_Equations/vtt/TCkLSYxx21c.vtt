00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.250
GILBERT STRANG: OK?

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.420
Now, finally, a
nonlinear equation.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.470
Growth, but it's-- the growth
is cut off by competition--

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.940
slowed down my competition.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.100
Let me show you the equation.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.960
In a way, it's the
simplest nonlinear equation

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.470
I could think of.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.420
We have the usual
dy/dt equal ay.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.275
That would give
exponential growth.

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:28.760
The growth would go on forever.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.500
But then, as y
gets large-- if we

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.630
think of y as the population,
so the growth is exponential

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.130
when the birth rates higher than
the death rate, and we grow.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.170
We have-- and that's
what's happening.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.220
But our world population is
not growing pure exponentially,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.550
forever.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.970
And this is a simple
term, a simple model not,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.370
very accurate, but it's
the right place to start.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.040
For competition, when
you have too many people,

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.560
somehow the
multiplying y times y

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.110
gives you a number of
interactions of all the y

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.740
people with themselves.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.270
And those interactions--
that competition slows down

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.410
the growth, and so the
coefficient there is negative.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.990
We want to solve that non-linear
equation and learn from it.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.420
And it's called the
logistic equation.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.520
That's-- it's got to
be a famous example.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.850
And it has a neat trick that
allows you to solve it easily.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.700
Let me show you that trick.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.250
The trick is to let z--
bring in a new z as 1/y.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.530
Then, if I write
the equation for z,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.410
it will turn out to be linear.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.450
So you see, I'm always
hoping, and here succeeding,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.120
to get back to a
simple linear equation.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.120
And this device happens
to work for this problem.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.490
We need, in the end,
a more systematic way

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.490
that would work
for other problems,

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.850
like there could be
some constant term

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:37.120
there from harvesting, from
the changing the equation.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.990
Let me go with this one.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.610
So what's the equation
for z then, dz/dt.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.730
The derivative of that,
that's y to the minus 1

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.400
is minus 1 y to the minus
2 times dy/dt, right?

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.120
The derivative of y
the minus 1 is minus 1,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.940
y to the minus 2 times
the derivative of dy/dt.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.555
But now dy/dt is ay
minus by squared.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.450
And what do I have?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:33.460
I've got a, with a
minus, ay over y squared.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.520
That will be z.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.910
So that's minus az.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.916
Minus minus giving me a plus b.

00:03:41.916 --> 00:03:46.040
y squared over y squared
is just a constant.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.170
Look at the equation for z now.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.260
Couldn't be better.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.170
dz/dt is minus az
and plus a constant.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.290
And we know the solution
to that equation.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.240
So I can write down the
solution to that equation.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.160
And I will.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.240
Then, I just take y to
be 1 over that solution.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.860
Maybe, I'll just write
y straight ahead.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.470
I'll just write the
answer y, which is 1/z.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.570
And z is the solution
to this equation.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.600
And let me see.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.710
So I'm going to
have an exponential,

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.190
but it's going to be-- the
exponential e to the minus at

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.400
is going to show up in z.

00:04:38.337 --> 00:04:39.420
And they'll be more there.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.110
It will show up in z.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.030
And then when I do
1/z to get back to y,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.660
that exponential is going
into the denominator.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.910
That's what's new.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.370
That's what's new.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.620
Let me get the
whole thing correct.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.270
I have a a.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.390
Otherwise, these are constants
d here and b goes there.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:10.155
And I just have to tell
you what the d is there.

00:05:10.155 --> 00:05:13.665
d is going to involve the
initial value, y of 0.

00:05:13.665 --> 00:05:18.680
At time 0, we start
somewhere, y of 0.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.350
And we'll begin to grow.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.030
We'll grow.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.050
But with the slowing down
term keeping us back.

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.520
And, in the end, it
can't grow forever

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.470
because that term becomes
bigger than that one.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.200
If y went on and on increasing,
then it can't happen.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.360
So it really is--
it can only increase

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.780
while this is
positive, and that's

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.170
only positive below that line.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.900
Here's what the curve does.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.740
It goes upward, but
then it has to-- it

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.780
can't cross that line
because above that line,

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.090
for big Y-- above
that line for big Y

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:12.950
this negative term means
that the slope is negative.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:19.380
If I started with a big
number, I'd have to come down.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.030
But can I just
draw that picture?

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.250
But it's really between
here-- between these lines

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.660
that I'm thinking the
world population is.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.390
So it started way back at
some time minus infinity.

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.830
And it-- whatever.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.700
It came up to time 0.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.210
This is t equals 0,
starting population.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.930
And, of course, t equals
0 could be the year 2000.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.500
We can move the time
axis as we want.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.660
So t equals 0 might
be the year 2000.

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.240
Our population is
still increasing,

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.450
but it won't go on forever.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:06.050
And it will slow down and
approach this limit a/b--

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.920
approaches a/b.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.220
So that number a/b is totally
special for this equation.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.350
And let me think
about that part.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.490
And we give a name
to this curve.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:27.440
It's often called
a logistic curve.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.270
That's OK.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.260
But I like the name S curve.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.810
It's an S curve.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.000
In some way-- or
a Sigmoidal curve.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:45.540
In some way, it looks a bit like
an S, a very stretched out S.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.490
So that-- and you see
why-- do you-- just

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.300
takes like-- look here.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:58.640
As t goes to infinity,
this becomes 0.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.690
When t gets large, this
exponential is gone.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:05.470
And I just have a
or b at the limit.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:13.810
When t is minus infinity,
way back at starting time--

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:17.220
when t is minus infinity,
that's a giant number.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.470
This is-- I'm dividing
by a giant number.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:20.740
I'm at 0.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.820
So way back at time minus
infinity, it started from 0.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:32.020
Those two possibilities ,
y equals 0 and y equal a/b,

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:37.340
are the key things to
see for this equation.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.110
So I'm going to
take a few minutes

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.400
to see where do those come in.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.860
Those are steady states.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.480
Let me use that word and
show you what I mean.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:09:01.250
Steady states, critical
points, for my equation dy/dt.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.530
Let me write the
logistic equation again.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:13.970
A steady state is a value of
y where the derivative is 0.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:14.900
Nothing happens.

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.520
It just sits there.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:19.250
So if that is 0--
so a steady state--

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.840
let me use those capital
Y for a steady state.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.370
Those are just numbers.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:34.130
They are the numbers where this
is 0, ay minus by squared is 0.

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:40.670
You see that if
I start out at y,

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:44.350
at capital Y, a steady
state, that is 0.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.490
The derivative is 0.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:47.540
I stay there.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.120
And there are two possibilities.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.330
If I start-- this gives me
two possibilities, right?

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.930
What are the solutions
to this equation?

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:02.160
This gives me y equals 0
is one solution clearly.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.150
Or y equals-- let's see.

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:10.676
If this equals that,
I could cancel a y.

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:18.030
y would be a/b, exactly
the two in the picture.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:20.740
If I start at 0, I stay at 0.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.690
No population.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.200
Nothing can happen.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:31.010
But if I move a little away,
if I get two people, we grow.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.400
We grow exponentially
for awhile,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.100
but then the by squared term
takes it-- gets in there,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.570
slows us down.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.930
And we slow down, and
we reach this a/b.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:50.180
If we had started at a/b,
we would have stayed at a/b.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:56.700
So that S curve
picture is really

00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:58.810
a nice graph of the solution.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.710
Here is the solution at
steady state, going nowhere.

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:09.220
There is a solution at
steady state with population,

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.720
competition, and cooperation are
balanced, and nothing happens.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:22.010
Otherwise, whenever we have S
curves, then they don't cross.

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:26.350
Depending where we're--
depending on the initial value,

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.710
we'll get beyond one or
other of these curves.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:34.420
And they all go up to
that carrying capacity,

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:37.530
that limiting population, a/b.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:43.850
So the final take home
message about this equation

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:51.370
is, as an example of
equations with steady states,

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:57.900
this steady state
is called unstable

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:03.250
because if we start near
y equals 0, we take off.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.120
If we start near y equals
0, we start growing.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.260
We leave that steady state.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:13.450
This steady state
is called stable

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:20.190
because if we're near a/b, we
get closer and closer to a/b.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.260
I'll do the example.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.380
This will be one example
of a general problem.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:37.480
dy/dt is some function of y.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.520
It's a right-hand side
that depends on y.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:46.410
That will be our next
video, to understand

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.400
those equations dy/dt
is f of y and notice

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.030
that they're not linear.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:56.210
But we can solve
for steady states.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:00.820
A steady state will
be when f at y is 0.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:02.570
Then, nothing happens.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:05.140
But is that steady state stable?

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.480
Or is it unstable?

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.020
That's the crucial thing
for all applications.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:15.480
Are we settling down to
something acceptable?

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:19.370
Or are we blowing up to
something impossible?

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.020
That's the next video.

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.750
Thank you.
