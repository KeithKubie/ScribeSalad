00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.680
We're told to find the x- and
y-intercepts for the graph of

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.030
this equation: 2 y plus
1/3x is equal to 12.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.400
And just as a bit of a
refresher, the x-intercept is

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.240
the point on the graph that
intersects the x-axis.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.110
So we're not above or below
the x-axis, so our y value

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.910
must be equal to 0.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.330
And by the exact same argument,
the y-intercept

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.290
occurs when we're not to the
right or the left of the

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.070
y-axis, so that's when
x is equal to 0.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.580
So let's set each of these
values to 0 and then solve for

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.340
what the other one has
to be at that point.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.080
So for the x-intercept,
when y is equal to

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.400
0, let's solve this.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.720
So we get 2 times 0, plus
1/3x is equal to 12.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.530
I just set y is equal to
0 right there, right?

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.800
I put 0 for y.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.870
Well, anything times 0 is just
0, so you're just left with

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.760
1/3x is equal to 12.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.120
To solve for x, you can think of
it as either dividing both

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.410
sides by 1/3, or we can multiply
both sides by the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.020
reciprocal of 1/3.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.720
And the reciprocal of 1/3 is 3,
or you can even think of it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.185
as 3 over 1.

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:19.890
So times 3 over 1.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.250
And so we're left with 3 times
1/3, that just cancels out, so

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.690
you're left with x is equal
to 12 times 3, or

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.550
x is equal to 36.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.340
So when y is equal
to 0, x is 36.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.520
So the point 36 comma 0 is on
the graph of this equation.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.360
And this is also the
x-intercept.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.640
Now, let's do the same thing
for the y-intercept.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.060
So let's set x equal 0, so you
get 2y plus 1/3, times 0 is

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.320
equal to 12.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.600
Once again, anything
times 0 is 0.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.470
So that's 0, and you're just
left with 2y is equal to 12.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.009
Divide both sides by 2 to solve
for y, and you're left

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.640
with y is equal to
12 over 2, is 6.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.636
So the y-intercept is when
x is equal to 0 and

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:20.650
y is equal to 6.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.770
So let's plot these
two points.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.780
I'll just do a little hand-drawn
graph, and make it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.180
clear what the x- and the
y-intercepts are.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.150
So let me draw-- that's my
vertical axis, and that is my

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.630
horizontal axis-- and we have
the point 36 comma 0.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.660
So this is the origin right
here, that's the x-axis,

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.670
that's the y-axis.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.750
The point 36 comma 0 might
be all the way over here.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.270
So that's the point
36 comma 0.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.460
And if that's 36, then the
point 0, 6 might be right

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.210
about there.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.940
So that's the point 0, 6.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.390
And the line will look
something like this.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.810
I'm trying my best to draw
a straight line.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.360
And notice where the line
intercepted or intersected the

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.330
y-axis, that's the y-intercept,
x is 0, because

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.190
we're not to the right
or the left of it.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.750
Where the line intersected the
x-axis, y is 0, because we're

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.300
not above or below it.
