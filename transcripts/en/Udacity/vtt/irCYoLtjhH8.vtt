00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.840
Angela, how many times do you actually
launch Sunshine during the day?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.770
&gt;&gt; Probably about 100, I mean,
we are working on it right now.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.660
&gt;&gt; No, no, I mean to check the weather.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.910
&gt;&gt; Oh, maybe three?

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.680
&gt;&gt; Do you really feel like
Sunshine's making you amazing?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.760
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; That's the problem,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.940
remember the Android creative vision,
make me amazing?

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.820
&gt;&gt; Right,
that's why we added those notifications.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.550
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.440
Notifications are a great way of
bringing Sunshine to the users,

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.990
making it just a normal
part of their day.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.320
&gt;&gt; The students spend all that
time building a content provider.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.890
We should show them how useful it is,
and

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.070
have them leverage it,
to build a widget.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.810
&gt;&gt; Great idea Dan,

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.790
I actually have a bunch of ideas on
how to bring Sunshine to the users.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.628
&gt;&gt; So then, what are you waiting for?
