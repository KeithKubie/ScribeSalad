00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.110
Fifty percent of high school students don’t
go on to higher education.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.150
Of the 50 percent that do, 43 percent of them
don’t graduate.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.210
Of those that do graduate the average graduation
time is six years.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.240
The average age of a current college student
today is about 25.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.170
And I think 25 percent of college students
today actually have a child.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.699
So if you ask me those statistics suggest
two things.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.190
The current system is not producing what it
was designed to produce for the types of people

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.660
that go, the number of people that go and
what they need.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.010
And it has not kept up with the modern world
in terms of how it makes itself available

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.239
and what it charges students to be able to
get what they need.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.719
So it’s a combination of availability; It
doesn’t seem to work for the majority of

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.860
students, because the number one reason that
students don’t go on to further education

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.520
or drop out of college, it’s a combination
of two things which essentially means the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.610
same thing: It’s too expensive, or they
can’t get the classes at the time of day

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.610
they’re available.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.640
And that’s because: of the 70 percent of
kids that go to state schools, 40 percent

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.360
of them work 30 hours a week or more.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.790
All of this is to say that schools are no
longer programmed at the right time.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.690
They take too long.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.360
They’re too expensive, and what they program
is incomplete.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.910
It’s not necessarily bad.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.560
our view is the education system needs to
evolve to the way we do everything.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.070
Everything we do today comes to us (rather
than us go to them).

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.550
An example, today we would never wait out
in the rain for a car and hope that we can

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:46.550
get a cab.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.720
We’ll just hail Uber and it comes and it
takes us exactly where we want to go.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.090
Today we wouldn’t go rush home to watch
a TV show at eight o’clock on a Thursday

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.090
night.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.880
We watch it on the device we want to watch
it, when we want to watch it, when it’s

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.740
convenient for us.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.490
Only education continues to require you to
come to it, pay a fortune to do it, and have

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.039
it be a choice between eating or reading or
learning and earning.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.420
And so what Chegg is trying to do is reverse
it, is try to say let’s use what the internet

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.420
does best.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.140
Let’s make it online, on demand.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.500
Let’s make it personalized.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.340
You do it the way you want to do it, not the
way it’s taught singularly to everybody.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.480
Adaptive which means when we watch what you
do and we learn about you, let’s actually

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.890
adjust how we teach you or what we teach you,
what we give you more of and what we give

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.960
you less of based on your actual abilities.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.530
And then let’s make it exceptionally affordable.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.130
And if we do that you’d be amazed how many
students need to learn, want to learn, are

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.560
willing to learn.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.740
So we think that the modern university system
has become too expensive; incomplete programming,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.240
inconvenient locations, inconvenient time
of day for the modern workforce which doesn’t

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.690
have the time to do both.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.980
So even if you look at for-profit colleges
they were a mess because they became a scam

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.420
for a lot of people.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.440
But if you realize 3.6 million people at one
time were actually taking it, you realize

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.240
the demand was there to be able to learn in
your own environment in your own way.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.240
Why?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.480
Because the average person was a 30-year-old
woman who could not leave her family or her

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.920
workforce, or in some cases both.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.570
So I just think that the modern education
system needs to acknowledge who the modern

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.250
student is, what the demands on that modern
student are—there’s more of them, they’re

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.569
more broke, they have more diverse needs.

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.240
They enter the system with different education,
different backgrounds, different financial

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.890
situations, and no “one size fits all”
is going to work anymore.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.610
And so what we’ve got is we’ve got a lot
of schools – now we’re not talking about

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.680
the top 50 or 100 schools.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.910
Those schools have huge endowments.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.070
They’ll be protected for a long time and
they’ll probably continue to be able to

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.340
teach the smaller part of the population that
can take four years.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.640
But the ramifications are—well, here’s
a question for you.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.530
Why is there something called a four year
school?

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.160
Why does college take four years?

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.330
That’s a random number.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.820
Why does a certain course take two years?

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.410
That’s a random number.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.330
It has to do with how many classes they’re
willing to program that you’re able to take.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.530
Not how long it takes you to learn the material.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.980
Ninety-five percent of the time that you’re
at a four year college you’re not in a classroom

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.060
in any way, shape or form.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.330
In today’s world we binge watch everything
that we want.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.930
You can binge watch entire series, albums,
learn anything you want.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.930
Why can’t you binge learn your education?

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.980
If you’re willing to put in the time at
nights, weekends, days, whatever it is and

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.450
learn and master the subject, why can’t
you finish when you’ve learned the things

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.010
you’re supposed to learn in order to get
you a job?

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.300
So the ramifications are colleges are going
to have to take less time to get somebody

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.340
from learning to earning.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.990
There is no reason why it should take four
years.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:11.300
Very little of the population has the time
or the finances to delay earning by four years.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.470
Only a small subset do.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.160
And so I think the ramifications are you’re
going to see fewer colleges, you’re going

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.360
to see them combined, more of them are going
to have to get online.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.120
They’re going to have to expand their curriculum
to include job skills, and I think you’re

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.419
going to see a resurgence of institutions
that primarily serve people online.

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:35.150
Not because—a teacher can make the argument
there’s nothing better than one-on-one in

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.280
a classroom.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.590
That may be true.

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.020
That may be true for a lot of kids.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.770
It’s certainly not true for everybody.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.070
But it’s also 100 percent not available
to anybody.

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.820
Nobody gets to learn one-on-one in a classroom
anymore.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:54.791
And so our opinion is it’s unfair to say
“Because this is the best way, we’re not

00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:59.930
going to do the other way” when 90 percent
of the people have no access to the best way.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.050
So if education is really going to grow, it’s
really going to proliferate, it’s got to

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.050
be online, increasingly.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.800
It’s got to be on demand.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.610
It has to be multimodality.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.610
Some people learn by taking tests.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:11.990
Some people learn by watching videos.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.240
Some people learn by human intervention and
human help.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.860
All of those ways need to be available.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.729
There’s no benefit in teaching somebody
who learns this way, this way over here if

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.330
that’s not going to work for them.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.740
And when you look at the scores 43 percent
drop out, they drop out with $7,000 to $9,000

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.740
in debt.

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.050
The ones that survive have $37,000 in debt.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.790
So I mean you just look at the math and ask
yourself, do you want to put your kid into

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.080
that system?

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.540
The answer has to be no.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.770
Why are we taking the most valuable people,
the future of this country and delaying their

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.360
ability to be productive in the workforce,
delaying their ability to make money, and

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.170
saddling them with debt larger than anything
else they may do in their life (with the exception

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.900
of buying a home), and doing it at 18 years
old?

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.430
To me it just sounds unfair and unfortunate.
