00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.120
- [Instructor] A zucchini
squash was peeled

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.000
and cut into six identical cubes.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.740
After being weighed, each cubed was soaked

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.260
in a different sucrose
solution for 24 hours

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.480
in an open container and
at a constant temperature

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.460
of 21 degrees Celsius.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.060
The cubes were then removed
from the sucrose solutions,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.820
carefully blotted on paper
towels and weighed again.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.830
The percent change in
mass due to a net gain

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.210
or loss of water was
calculated for each cube

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.640
and the results are
shown in the graph below.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.960
I put the graph to the
right right over here.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.420
A straight line is drawn on the graph

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.070
to help in estimating results from other

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.650
sucrose concentrations not tested.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.470
Using the straight line
on the graph above,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.260
calculate the water potential in bars

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.630
of the zucchini squash
at 21 degrees Celsius.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.790
Give your answer to one decimal place.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.170
So pause this video and see
if you can have a go at it.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.420
Alright, now let's do this together.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.600
So we have our six
cubes of zucchini squash

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.950
and we have each of these data points

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.310
are the data for each of those cubes.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.780
So for example, this
data point shows a cube

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.730
that was put into a solution that contains

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.590
no sucrose and when it
was put into a solution

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.770
that contains no sucrose,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.240
it gained 20% mass and that mass would be

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630
from the water going into the cube.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.490
So one way to think about it is

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.640
it got put into a solution,

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.580
and so you had a net inflow of water

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.570
into that sucrose cube, enough
to increase its mass by 20%.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.450
This second data point right over here,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.795
it was put into a solution that is

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:49.640
.20 moles per liter of sucrose

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.290
and that also had an increase of mass

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.400
but it was a smaller increase of mass.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.430
And then we can go all
the way to the extreme

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.430
right over here where
we had a zucchini cube

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.290
put into a solution that
had a lot of sucrose in it,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.440
one mole per liter, and there,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.940
you have a net outflow of water.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.380
It deceased the cube's mass by 30%.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.870
So how do we figure
out the water potential

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.870
of the zucchini squash?

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.560
Well one way to think about it is

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.140
we could figure out the water
potential of zucchini squash

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.190
is if we put it into a solution

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.660
that has a certain sucrose concentration

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.880
and if we have no net
inflow or outflow of water

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.680
in either direction, that
means that the zucchini squash

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.890
and the sucrose solution
have the same water potential

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.400
and we see that happening,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.220
at least we can interpellate
it right over here

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.130
because if we just follow that line,

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.840
it looks like if we were
to put our zucchini cubes,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.740
our zucchini squash cubes
into a sucrose solution

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.890
that is, this looks about, let's see.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.500
This would be .3, so let's just call that

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.500
0.36 molar solution, 0.36 molar solution.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.380
Well, then it has the same water potential

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.810
as that solution because
you have no net inflow

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.400
or outflow of water.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.720
So the zucchini squash water potential

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.940
is going to be the same
as the water potential

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.940
of a solution of sucrose
that has 0.36 moles per liter

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.470
so we just have to figure out
the water potential of that.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.590
Well, the water potential formula we know

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.140
and we've seen this in other videos

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.540
is equal to our solute potential

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.740
plus our pressure potential.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.560
We know that these are open containers,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.200
so the pressure potential is going to be 0

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.470
and so we just need to figure
out the solute potential

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.780
of our sucrose solution
with this concentration.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.140
Well, we know our solute potential

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.300
is going to be equal to negative I,

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.430
where this is the ionization constant.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.130
For every molecule of sucrose,

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.100
does it disassociate into
when it gets put into water?

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.730
Well, sucrose doesn't disassociate it,

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.420
so it would just be one times our molarity

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.740
times what's sometimes
called a pressure constant

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.620
but it's really the same thing as

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.510
a universal gas constant you
might have learned in chemistry

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.050
times the temperature in Kelvin.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.350
So this is going to be equal to negative,

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.950
I already said that this I is one

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.930
because the sucrose just stays sucrose

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.260
when you put it in water, so negative one

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.260
times 0.36, I'll write
the units, moles per liter

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.570
times R and if you're doing
something like an AP test,

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.810
they actually give you these formulas

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.317
and they even give you R
as being 0.0831 liter bars

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.540
per mole Kelvin and then times
the temperature in Kelvin.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.670
Well if we're dealing
with 21 degrees Celsius,

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.450
we just add 273 to that,
so times 294 Kelvin

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.350
and now we can just
get our calculator out.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.350
Negative one times .36
times .0831 times 294

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.070
is equal to if I round
to one decimal place,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.883
it's gonna be negative 8.8.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.240
Negative 8.8 and the
units work out as well.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.640
Moles cancel with moles,
liters cancel with liters,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.538
Kelvin cancels with Kelvin,
and we're just with,

00:05:26.538 --> 00:05:30.640
left with negative 8.8 bars.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.683
And we are done.
