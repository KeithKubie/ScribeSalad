ELENA ALBERTI: In
thinking about what

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.440
was the most impactful
takeaway from this course,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.980
I really realized that the
most important part for me

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.740
was the self-reflection,
and kind of delving

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.940
into what I thought my
racial identity was,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.000
as I am multiracial.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.370
So I just kind of identify
with different things

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.970
at different times, and
seeing how that actually

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.377
fits my personality and
what that means for myself.

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:28.210
What about you guys?

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.740
DANA VIGUE: Yeah,
going off of that,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.200
as another multiracial
person, I started

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.500
to realize as we engaged with
the social scientific theory

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.730
behind the way
people code-switch,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.800
that there is a
science behind it.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.280
And it's not arbitrary.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.630
It's not chaotic.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.390
It's part of a
larger social system

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.540
with institutionalized
expectations for the way people

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.130
engage with one another and
other institutions in place.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.270
And understanding
that we're sort

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.620
of following by an unspoken
set, and occasionally very

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.170
vehemently spoken
set of rules, when

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.150
we do that-- when we
identify differently

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.480
in different circumstances--
was something I hadn't actually

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.770
explicitly realized.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.251
ELENA ALBERTI: Mhm.

00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:12.250
LORRAINE WONG: I agree
that the self-exploration

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.712
and the self-reflection was
the most important takeaway,

00:01:15.712 --> 00:01:17.920
I think, that I could get
personally from the course,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.830
in addition to all the
academic readings that we did--

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.250
all of the engagement with
the outside world that we did.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.900
I think, in order to be
able to change the world,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.610
first we have to
understand ourselves.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.280
And it helped me do all of
that, and navigate the tensions

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.140
between how I am
read and how I am,

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.452
and trying to figure
out those differences.

00:01:40.452 --> 00:01:42.160
COLIN GODWIN: I think
what I most enjoyed

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.750
about the class was, outside
of the self-awareness,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.390
increasingly reading
into the patterns

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.580
that we see in
society, and how that

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.700
influences how we see others.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.300
A really impactful
part was when we

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.620
delved into why creole and
other developing languages

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.292
are considered to
be lesser languages.

00:02:01.292 --> 00:02:03.500
And how there wasn't really
much science behind that.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.874
It was more just
cultural leading

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.930
of whites being
superior to blacks

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.710
and the preservation of
slavery through another form--

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.245
through both the disparagement
of Creole and African-American

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:15.744
English.

00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:16.990
ELENA ALBERTI: Bouncing
off that as well, I

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.070
think another
important part was,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.020
I mentioned before,
the multiracial aspect.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.980
But in class, Dana.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.070
You were talking about how one
of the more ant parts was also

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.690
talking about how historically
under-represented groups or--

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.670
I forgot the exact
terminology you used--

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.030
can form alliances.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.370
And how there are similarities,
but also dissimilarities

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.690
between how the groups work.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.410
And I think classes
like these allow

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.142
you to discuss people in general
who are in those situations,

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:45.100
but also allows you delve
into the nitty-gritty

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.082
like you're talking
about with Creole.

00:02:47.082 --> 00:02:49.390
DANA VIGUE: Yeah,
I was surprised

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.090
how much a class
entitled Black Matters

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.910
dealt with things that
you would never identify

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.050
as a specifically black issue.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.490
And we ended up talking about
populations that are not read,

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.260
or may not identify, as black.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.580
And that was relevant.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.570
These were not tangentially
related political issues

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.160
or social issues or
economic injustices.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.950
And I started to see how
black issues and black matters

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.310
and black experiences are
really not something that

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.310
can be studied in
isolation, and play

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.950
into larger global networks.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.210
ELENA ALBERTI: Mhm.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:30.010
COLIN GODWIN: Yeah, because
a lot of themes in the course

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.390
were centered around the
mechanisms of oppression

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.120
instead of what the oppression
of a particular group.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.570
So it was really nice
having those case studies

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.903
inside of immigrant populations
and American populations

00:03:37.903 --> 00:03:38.858
as well.
