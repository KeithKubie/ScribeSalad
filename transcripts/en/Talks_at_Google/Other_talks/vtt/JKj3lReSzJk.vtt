LOGAN URY: So my
name is Logan Uri.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.030
I'm here visiting Seattle
from the Mountain View

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.960
office, where I work as
a behavioral researcher.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.400
And I am so glad
that we can welcome

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.290
Doctor John Gottman and
Doctor Julie Schwartz Gottman

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.340
here today.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.026
So, thank you so much
for joining us at Google.

00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:19.150
We're thrilled to have you.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.816
I've been a fan of
yours for many years,

00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:22.442
I'm so glad that you're here.

00:00:22.442 --> 00:00:26.120
And this is our fourth event in
our series on modern romance.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.717
So, first I'll
introduce the Gottmans

00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:29.300
and then I'll ask
them some questions,

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.000
and then we'll invite you all
up at the end to ask questions

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.840
at this podium at the mic.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.070
So, first we have
Doctor John Gottman.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.110
He is world renowned for his
work on marital stability

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.890
and divorce prediction.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.210
He's conducted forty years
of breakthrough research

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.120
with thousands of couples.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.830
He was recognized as one of
the top 10 most influential

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.455
therapists of the
past quarter century

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:54.230
by the Psychotherapy Networker.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.220
He's also the author of 190
published academic articles,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.230
and the author or co-author
of 40 books including

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.069
a bestselling "The Seven
Principles for Making Marriage

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:08.420
Work," "What Makes Love Last,"
and "The Relationship Cure."

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.760
He's also the co-founder
of the Gottman Institute

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.330
with his wife, and
he's professor emeritus

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.790
of psychology at the
University of Washington,

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.500
where he founded the love
lab to research couples.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.640
Now, Doctor Julie
Schwartz Gotttman

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.200
is the co-founder and president
of the Gotttman Institute.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.425
She's also highly recognized
as a clinical psychologist, who

00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:32.370
has worked with distressed
couples, abuse and trauma

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.140
survivors, substance
abusers and their partners,

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.820
and cancer patients
and their families.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.860
She's also the co-author of
the immensely popular "The Art

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.970
and Science of Love" weekend
workshops for couples,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.230
and the author of
four books including

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.440
"Ten Lesson to
Transform your Marriage"

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.270
and "Baby Makes Three."

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.880
Wow, those are
quite introductions.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.180
JULIE GOTTMAN: Yeah

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.646
LOGAN URY: So, thank you
so much for joining us,

00:01:56.646 --> 00:02:03.560
and [APPLAUSE] So,
for those people

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.890
in the audience who aren't
as familiar with your work,

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.890
I want to start
at the beginning.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.840
Who are the four horsemen,
and why is their presence

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.340
so dangerous for couples?

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.930
JOHN GOTTMAN: No, you take it.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.888
JULIE GOTTMAN: No, you.

00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:17.721
[LAUGHTER] OK.

00:02:17.721 --> 00:02:18.220
All right.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.400
So--

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.790
JOHN GOTTMAN: She
got the microphone.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.530
JULIE GOTTMAN: Is this on?

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.155
LOGAN URY: Yes.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:26.460
JULIE GOTTMAN: All right.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.180
So the four horsemen--
how many of you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.301
have heard of the four
horsemen of the apocalypse?

00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:32.800
Yeah?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.570
Heard of it?

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:34.230
OK.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.770
So these are the big
predictors of demise

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.890
in relationships,
for really destroying

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.150
the path of relationships.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.830
The first one is criticism.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.240
Which is, talking
down to your partner,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.176
blaming your partner for a
problem in a relationship.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:00.600
Blaming the problem on a
personality flaw, basically.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.030
Telling your partner they're
lazy, they're a slob,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.610
they're a jerk.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.820
All of those lovely words
that we hat to hear, right?

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.760
The second one is contempt.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.880
And contempt is even worse.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.560
Contempt is criticism
but from a place

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.380
on high, superior position.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.075
So, it's sort of like
this, do you remember

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:26.400
when you were a teenager?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.720
Do you remember when your
parents said terrible things

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:29.530
to you?

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.090
And you would go [SIGH].

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:33.900
Remember that expression?

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.290
That's an expression
of contempt.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.500
So if you see that in your
partner, that's trouble.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.690
Sarcasm, abuse.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.850
Kind of abusive put-downs.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.670
You're such a bitch.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.280
That kind of stuff, not said
lightly, really is contempt

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.360
and what we've learned
about contempt,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.456
was that it was the
worst predictor,

00:04:00.456 --> 00:04:04.310
the most powerful predictor
of relationship demise.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.830
And not only did it predict
relationships going down,

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.990
the number of
contempt expressions

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.970
that a listener
heard in 15 minutes

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.200
predicted how many infectious
illnesses the listener

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.780
would have in the next month.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:22.880
Isn't that incredible?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.450
So, it's frightening.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.670
So, contempt actually erodes
the immune system as well as

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.550
the heart, the relationship.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.710
The third horseman
is defensiveness.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.540
And defensiveness
is usually either,

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.130
I did too pay the
bills, you know,

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.350
kind of that righteous
victim thing?

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.480
Or counter-attack.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.330
Oh yeah, well, you didn't
pick up the dry cleaning.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.890
The counter-attack.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.120
Defensiveness is the
hardest one to eliminate.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.620
How many of us have
been defensive?

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.100
Like all of us, right?

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.970
So John and I are
continually still working

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.590
that, after 30 years.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.780
It's tough.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.530
So defensiveness is a
response to feeling attacked,

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.880
that's why we get defensive.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.070
The fourth one we
call stonewalling.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.970
And this was my darling's
brilliant research

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.880
break-through, one
of them, one of many,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.940
which related stonewalling,
which means completely shutting

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.560
down in the middle
of a conversation,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.660
and not giving any response
at all, no head nods,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.670
looking away,
usually, looking down,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.360
and, you know, hoping the
ogre sitting across from you

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.080
will go away.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.290
That's stonewalling.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.260
And why John discovered,
was that typically,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.590
when people were stonewalling,
their heart-rates

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.810
were above 100 beats a
minute, just sitting there.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.720
Sometimes it would be as
high as 140 beats per minute,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.330
really high.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.810
Meaning, they were
in fight or flight,

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.720
that [INAUDIBLE]
physiological arousal,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.430
and that was leading
them to stonewall.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.850
That's our fourth, and
it's a problem [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.940
There you go.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.312
Now you can go out and
destroy your relationships.

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.815
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:22.440
LOGAN URY: That's a
great introduction.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:23.856
So, John, I read
a story about you

00:06:23.856 --> 00:06:26.070
that I really
liked, when you met

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.990
the young, unimpressed publisher
of "The Seven Principles

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.100
for Making Marriage
Work," and he said,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.290
tell me one thing in
the next 30 seconds

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.040
that I can do to improve
my marriage right now.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.890
Can you please share
that story, as well as

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.710
your favorite advice
for couples who want

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.360
to improve their relationships.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.890
JOHN GOTTMAN: Yeah,
it was a great moment,

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.960
because I was trying to convince
Random House to invest money

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.340
in marketing the
book, and he was

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.442
unimpressed with the
videotapes I presented.

00:06:54.442 --> 00:06:55.900
So he said, tell
me one thing I can

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.270
do to improve my marriage
in the next 30 seconds.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.920
I said, well there's a
lot of things of the book,

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.230
but if I had to pick
one, I would say

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.390
it's honor your wife's dreams.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.775
And this guy sat
up, put on his coat,

00:07:11.775 --> 00:07:15.050
and walked out of the
meeting. [LAUGHTER] I thought,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.390
I blew that one.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:17.720
He's the head of marketing.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.770
So, I found out later that
he actually went home, took

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:27.130
the subway to Brooklyn,
and he walked in

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.760
and his wife was there.

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.670
She said, did you get fired?

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:32.540
He said, no, no.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:36.572
I came home to find out
what your dreams are.

00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:39.121
Because he didn't have a clue.

00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:41.370
So they had a great conversation
that afternoon and he

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.777
decided to put money in
marketing the book after that.

00:07:44.777 --> 00:07:45.276
[LAUGHTER].

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:45.670
LOGAN URY: That's so beautiful.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:47.880
And what's your advice for
people in the audience for what

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.580
they can do?

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.237
Maybe not in thirty seconds,
to improve their relationship?

00:07:52.237 --> 00:07:53.820
JOHN GOTTMAN: You
know, I really think

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.270
Julie hit the nail on the head.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:59.960
Because when I thought
about it, the work that's

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.680
required in relationships, and
we can prove mathematically

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.270
that relationships are
systems that require energy,

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.349
they're dissipative
energy systems.

00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:14.015
And if anybody's
interested in the math,

00:08:14.015 --> 00:08:17.070
you could look it up in
the book that I recently

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.480
published on it.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.230
But based on the math model,
now, you have to do work,

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:24.310
or the relationship
deteriorates over time.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.760
And I think the work
really is down-regulating

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.590
your own defensiveness.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.710
Which means that when your
partner is angry with you,

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:37.270
or disappointed in you, you've
hurt your partner's feelings.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.639
Instead of reacting really
quickly, and saying, bullshit,

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:41.820
I didn't do that.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:44.110
Or, it's your problem.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:49.280
You really way to beat, and
then when you speak you say,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.380
OK I'm listening, talk to me.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.840
And I think that's the work.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.790
It's really hard work.

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:57.510
And we still work at it.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.290
So it doesn't ever
get, really, easier.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.080
No one ever feels joyful about
their partner's disappointment

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.690
or anger with them or having you
hurt your partner's feelings.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.950
It's just something that
happens all the time.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.900
But, people come to our
couples' weekend workshop,

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.550
and they're always
thinking, this is great,

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:21.586
you know, I'm glad I'm here,
because she really needs this.

00:09:21.586 --> 00:09:25.550
[LAUGHTER] You know, I'm
fine, but she really needs

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.890
a lot of communication work.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.090
But they're always surprised and
horrified that the work really

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:36.367
is work you have
to do on yourself.

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:38.450
LOGAN URY: So, you talked
being a better listener,

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.340
but I also read your
criticism around

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.510
how some people think
active listening is

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:44.310
the cure all for marriages.

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.220
What are some other
misconceptions around what

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.290
can help save a marriage?

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.150
JOHN GOTTMAN: Part of the
reason that active listening is

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.790
a mistake, the idea that
every time Julie says

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.920
something, if I'm listening
I paraphrase what she says

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:05.320
and summarize it, is that nobody
can listen to a person who's

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.800
attacking them.

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.850
You know, there has
to be responsibility

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:12.060
not just on the listener,
but on the speaker as well.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.900
So we talk a lot about
softened start-up, about how

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.220
the masters of the
relationship really

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.580
think before they
present an issue,

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.090
and they try to really calm
their partner down and say,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.590
hey, this isn't
a big deal, baby,

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:28.750
but, here's what I really need.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:30.400
Rather than the
horseman, they're

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.090
pointing their
fingers at themselves,

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.780
and saying this is what
I'm feeling and here's

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:39.600
a recipe for be successful
with me, instead of pointing

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.480
the finger at their partner and
saying, you are so, you know,

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:45.880
and all that.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.500
JULIE GOTTMAN: Yeah,
let me add to that.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.570
One of the big
misconceptions about how

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.090
to be in a good relationship is,
first of all don't get angry,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.120
anger is a bad thing.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:02.890
And the reality is that anger
is not a bad thing, it just is.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:06.660
It's organic, it's part
of our brains hard wiring.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:11.090
It's and organic think
that needs to be expressed,

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.380
but how it's
expressed is they key.

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:17.460
So, as were talking
earlier, it can

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:22.060
be expressed through criticism
and through contempt, or more

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:26.190
a description of, I'm
frustrated, I'm furious,

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.680
then about what, not about who.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.580
So, I'm upset that the
kitchen is still a mess.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:38.070
The kitchen a is still
a mess is the situation

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.240
you're angry about, it's not a
personality flaw of a partner.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.110
And then, saying what you mean.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.300
It's so important to
say what you mean.

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.940
And what you do need,
rather than what you don't.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:53.123
I need you stop being a jerk.

00:11:53.123 --> 00:11:55.490
Is your partner going
to want to hear that?

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:57.010
I don't think so.

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.740
So, you know, I need you to
be kind to me when I'm being

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.150
interviewed in front of a
million people. [LAUGHTER] So,

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.188
there's-- hear that?

00:12:07.188 --> 00:12:11.835
[LAUGHTER] So
expressing your needs

00:12:11.835 --> 00:12:14.707
is also a really
important thing to do.

00:12:14.707 --> 00:12:15.915
LOGAN URY: So what about sex?

00:12:15.915 --> 00:12:18.014
How important is sex
to your relationship.

00:12:18.014 --> 00:12:18.930
JOHN GOTTMAN: Oh, boy.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.470
JULIE GOTTMAN: Our
favorite topic.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.928
LOGAN URY: Isn't that
the name of your website?

00:12:22.928 --> 00:12:23.710
Got sex?

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:26.348
JULIE GOTTMAN: I'm not going
to-- [LAUGHTER] We didn't think

00:12:26.348 --> 00:12:30.130
of that, I mean, it took a
25 year old to think of that.

00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:36.390
[LAUGHTER] So, should
we talk about sex?

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.090
JOHN GOTTMAN: OK

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:43.780
JULIE GOTTMAN: So, sex is in
important in a relationship,

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.875
it's a way of expressing
fondness, admiration,

00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:52.410
love, cherishing the person,
but an important thing is

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:54.910
that it needs to be personal.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:57.450
Needs to be personal, sex.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.060
So what we're
talking about there,

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.700
is blending emotional intimacy
with physical intimacy.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.320
So, lots of people
are doing hook-ups,

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.040
everyone's doing
hook-ups these days.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:10.590
That's impersonal sex.

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:13.560
You don't know who
your having sex with.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.410
So, what are you actually doing?

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.030
Well, you're kind of
doing mutual masturbation,

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:21.870
you're stimulating each other.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.230
So, that's not what
preserves a relationship.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.860
What preserves a
relationship is really

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.890
understanding what
turns your partner on,

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.280
understanding how
your partner wants sex

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.870
to be initiated, in a way
that's comforting to them,

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:45.940
and how a person can refuse
sex without destroying

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.500
the ego of the
other person, right?

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.530
So having those
discussions about sex,

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:55.410
openly and honestly,
is one of the things

00:13:55.410 --> 00:14:01.022
that can really help strengthen
the physical relationship.

00:14:01.022 --> 00:14:02.480
JOHN GOTTMAN: I
need to take notes,

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.485
because my wife is
talking about sex.

00:14:04.485 --> 00:14:10.560
[LAUGHTER] So, you know there
are a lot of misconceptions

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:14.570
about this, and one of the
most common misconceptions

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:19.320
is that too much intimacy
destroys eroticism.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.336
Well, familiarity
breeds contempt.

00:14:21.336 --> 00:14:23.210
LOGAN URY: I just read
"Mating in Captivity."

00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:25.293
JOHN GOTTMAN: "Mating in
Captivity," good example.

00:14:25.293 --> 00:14:29.520
Esther Perel says, don't wear
that flannel nightgown ladies,

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.910
because it'll turn
your partner off.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:36.950
Wear that sexy negligee
and be mysterious.

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:41.090
Now, don't really share all of
your secrets with your partner,

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.410
have some mystery.

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:48.430
And do not cuddle, cuddling is
the death knell for eroticism.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.120
And she advises her
clients not to cuddle,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:55.690
and in fact she has
advised her clients

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.820
to ask for money for sex.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:03.560
[LAUGHTER] Making sex
impersonal is her recipe

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.740
for increased eroticism.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:08.530
Well, we actually have
good data on this now.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:13.190
From 70,000 people who reported
about their intimate sexual

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:17.080
relationships online, from
24 different countries,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:22.650
and in fact everywhere on the
planet, the opposite is true.

00:15:22.650 --> 00:15:26.840
Couples who kiss one another
good bye when they go to work,

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.740
turns out that there's
a study in Germany,

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:35.010
if men kissed their wives
goodbye versus men who don't?

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.790
Those men who do kiss
their wives goodbye

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.650
live five years longer.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.810
So what are they tapping into?

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:47.420
In all of these
countries, sex is the same

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.610
and romance is the same.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.770
So people who have
great sex lives, kissed

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.220
one another passionately for no
reason at all, hug each other.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:01.670
They cuddle, they give surprise
gifts, compliments, flowers,

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.780
and they do the kinds of
things that really Ester Perel

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.540
is saying not to do.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.910
And furthermore,
most of us really

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.762
know how to get underneath that
flannel nightgown very easily.

00:16:12.762 --> 00:16:14.653
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:14.653 --> 00:16:15.986
JULIE GOTTMAN: I don't wear one.

00:16:15.986 --> 00:16:19.388
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:19.388 --> 00:16:20.890
LOGAN URY: So
you've done research

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:23.320
into relationships and
marriage for the last 40 years.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.150
And obviously there's been
big changes in this phase,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.460
such as many more
women in the workplace,

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.490
and many more people meeting
through online dating.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.950
So, through the years of
your research, what's changed

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.934
and what's stayed the same.

00:16:38.934 --> 00:16:40.850
JULIE GOTTMAN: That's
an interesting question.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:49.920
I think part of
what's changed, is

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:55.780
that the percentage of women
that are having affairs

00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:57.460
has gone up.

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:03.300
Because in the '50s and early
'60s when data was collected,

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.510
this sort of data was collected
back then, women didn't work.

00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:10.480
Women were at home drinking
coffee with their neighbors,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.765
and the neighbors were all
other women staying home

00:17:13.765 --> 00:17:15.329
with the kids like they were.

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.700
So they didn't
really have access

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.300
to other partners
outside their spouse.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.390
Now, with women having
entered the workforce,

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:27.300
there's lots of access,
and so their percentage

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:31.480
of-- the ones that are
having affairs are going up.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.900
But at the same
time, you know what's

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:40.540
interesting is that people
still want the same thing

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.870
for the most part.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:47.840
Most people still want a
committed relationship.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.300
They still want
things, they still

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.760
want something
that's long-lasting.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:57.878
They want their partner
to be a close friend.

00:17:57.878 --> 00:18:01.600
They want, you know maybe
this is a little different,

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:06.204
they want equality in terms
of the roles that each plays,

00:18:06.204 --> 00:18:08.200
in terms of all
the daily activity,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.270
taking care of the
house, the kids, etc.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.270
So there is more
equality, especially

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.120
in the younger
generation, who've

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.555
been raised with those values.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:27.696
And there's balance I think
to some degree, between men

00:18:27.696 --> 00:18:32.420
and women and whose
career path you follow.

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:34.650
There's more
flexibility in that.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:38.300
So men are following women's
career paths sometimes too, as

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.397
opposed to the other way around.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.640
What do you think, dear?

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.340
JOHN GOTTMAN: Well I would say
that the biggest thing that's

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:55.540
happened at least in
the last 60 years,

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.880
is the erosion of
trust in our culture.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.180
And Robert Putnam in
the book "Bowling Alone"

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.160
talked about this
on a societal level.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:12.020
And you see since 1960 in
the United States of America,

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.400
a big decline community.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.710
People are more
alone and lonely,

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:21.240
they don't join
organizations, and probably

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:24.710
the best indicator of
this is the disparity

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.020
between what the poorest
people in a culture

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.560
and what the richest
people in a culture earn.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.180
And this has been
growing enormously.

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:37.495
So that earlier in the
United States, in the '50s,

00:19:37.495 --> 00:19:39.990
a CEO of major
corporations would

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.330
earn 25 times what the
average worker earned,

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:47.050
and now CEOs are
earning 350 times what

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.790
the average worker is earning.

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.150
And if you look,
even internationally,

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:55.320
this erosion of
trust is reflected

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.140
at all levels of society.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.800
So these indicators
of how much do people

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.025
trust other people, just
as a very simple question

00:20:03.025 --> 00:20:05.360
that sociologist
ask on the phone,

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.060
is related to the
overall health of people,

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.920
longevity, school achievement
of children, crime.

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.290
And the statistics are
really quite dramatic,

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.340
both within the United States
of America and internationally.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.420
But on an interpersonal
level, we've

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.530
also seen an erosion of trust.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.540
So that now, the major
thing that people

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:31.790
want when they select a
partner, is trustworthiness.

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:34.890
That's the quality
they're looking for.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:37.540
And I think Julie's right.

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:41.440
We want to be with
somebody who's

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.420
really going to be
with us for a lifetime

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.210
and going to cherish us.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:48.540
And will take care of
us when we're sick,

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.320
be with us for
richer or for poorer,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.350
just like the wedding
vows, but now it's

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:55.860
even more important
to find somebody

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:01.240
who will really stay the
course with us and we rely on.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.482
JULIE GOTTMAN: May I add
just one more thing Logan?

00:21:03.482 --> 00:21:04.440
LOGAN URY: Yes, please.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.980
JULIE GOTTMAN: I think one of
the biggest negative impacts

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.690
of the past ten years or
so is internet pornography.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:16.880
So we are seeing, within
the clinical [INAUDIBLE],

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:22.260
we are seeing huge impact
of internet pornography

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.260
on couples.

00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.120
On course, there was
always "Playboy" magazine

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:33.820
or something, but it's never
been as accessible, as secret,

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:36.640
as easy to hide.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.150
And so millions, and
millions, and millions,

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:43.580
and millions of people are
going on internet porn.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:48.120
And the effect of that,
when people really

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.610
use it frequently, is that
it changes their expectations

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:56.330
of sex with their partner.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.400
They want the sex
with their partner

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:03.780
to look like what they're
watching on the computer.

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.420
And of course, it's impersonal
sex that they're watching.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.290
And I've seen some of
the carryover of that

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:17.766
into relationships, that
really can be very disastrous.

00:22:17.766 --> 00:22:19.640
LOGAN URY: Well, that
was fascinating and not

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.840
what I was expecting, so
I really appreciate it.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.550
And I would love to
talk more about trust,

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.900
and how people can
build trust, and then

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:29.130
after a betrayal,
which I think you say

00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.692
is one of the biggest issues
in the end of a marriage.

00:22:31.692 --> 00:22:34.485
How can people repair
trust, without necessarily

00:22:34.485 --> 00:22:36.890
breaking up?

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.291
JULIE GOTTMAN: What
do you want to know?

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:39.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:41.775
LOGAN URY: Yeah, what are the
foundations of building trust,

00:22:41.775 --> 00:22:43.120
and how do you repair it?

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:47.330
JOHN GOTTMAN: OK, so
here's one of the places

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.970
where mathematics
really illuminates

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.510
the nature of relationships.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:54.970
And the mathematics that's
important is game theory.

00:22:54.970 --> 00:23:01.900
And game theory is this idea
that when people interact,

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:07.930
it's as if they were selecting
from a set of strategies

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.800
in order to maximize some metric
that has to do with pay off

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:14.170
or utility.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:18.520
So it's like, Julie and I are
interacting, and each of us

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.820
are selecting what we're
going to do with one another

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.470
for some purpose.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:30.680
And, turns out that when
you solve various games

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.680
and find a solution, that there
are two possible solutions

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.120
that you come up with.

00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.240
One is called the
Von Neumann solution.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.040
and the Von Neumann
solution is basically

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.130
selecting the best of the worst.

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.880
So, you think about
the relationship

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.450
and you go, well let
me cut my losses.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.535
I don't want to expect much
from this relationship, so let

00:23:53.535 --> 00:23:55.870
me figure out how
not to get hurt.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.010
You interact that way.

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.070
That's one way of
solving any game.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:04.030
Another way is called
the Nash solution,

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:07.094
and John Nash won the Nobel
Prize for this solution.

00:24:07.094 --> 00:24:08.510
And here, what
you're trying to do

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.470
is get to the best
for both people.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:13.910
And so, the metric
you're trying to maximize

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.150
is not only your own
benefit, but your partner's

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:17.990
benefit as well.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:21.160
So trust is really
having a metric

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.160
where you care as much
about how your partner does,

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:27.170
as you do about
how you're doing.

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:29.480
Where you care about
your partner's feelings,

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.600
your partner's needs, as much
as you care about your own.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.570
And that's how you build
trust, is really the idea of,

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.110
I have my partner's back.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:41.290
Which is, I know that when
Julie and I are negotiating

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.656
some decision we're
trying to make,

00:24:43.656 --> 00:24:46.280
and I have one point of view and
she has another point of view.

00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.100
That she's thinking
not only of herself,

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.040
she's thinking also about
me, and how I'm going to fare

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:55.760
and what's good for me, and
I'm thinking about that as well

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:56.530
for her.

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:59.790
We're going to arrive at the
Nash equilibrium, the Nash

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:00.290
solution.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:02.080
Well, how do you arrive at that?

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:07.640
And what our research tells us,
is that the way to build trust

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.950
is to be there as
a great listener

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:14.150
when your partner is upset.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:19.900
That negative emotions are the
magic moments for connecting.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:22.000
So, not what you
would you think.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.590
It's just really that
couples who build trust

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.940
appear to have a motto
in which they're saying,

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:34.570
baby when you are in pain,
the world stops and I listen.

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:35.580
I care.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:38.552
I care about what you feel,
I care about what you nee,d

00:25:38.552 --> 00:25:39.760
and that's what builds trust.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:46.360
JULIE GOTTMAN: And let me
add a little bit to that,

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.700
and then talk about
how we recover

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.200
when there's been betrayal.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.890
So part of being trustworthy
is when your partner turns

00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:01.670
towards you, for anything,
just a bid for attention,

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:06.750
or a need of some sort,
they're really tired,

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.400
they want you to do a little
extra housework or something.

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.850
When do you do?

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.230
Do you turn towards
them and say, sure.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:16.750
Yeah, I'll take care
of that for you,

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:20.820
or do you simply ignore them.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.480
If they are call
your name and you're

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.820
right in the middle
of reading something,

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:25.550
or you're doing your
e-mail what do you?

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:29.980
Do you stop your
email and say, yeah.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:32.960
Or, do you keep
doing your email?

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:39.630
Or do you say, stop interrupting
me, I'm finishing my work,

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.480
which is turning against, right?

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:47.760
So, there's a huge
difference in building trust

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.715
in terms of turning towards,
versus turning away,

00:26:50.715 --> 00:26:54.240
where we don't respond at
all, versus turning against.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:57.870
So, the more you can turn
towards your partner,

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.210
the deeper the friendship
is, the more your partner

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.570
trusts you to be there for them.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:07.640
And the more your
partner may also

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.560
be willing to give back to you.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.200
So, it deepens the trust
system between the two of you,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.470
which is wonderful.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:19.780
OK, so let's talk about betrayal
and what leads up to betrayal.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.600
The heart of what
leads up to betrayal,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:28.950
which we've seen in our work,
is people avoid conflict,

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.190
isn't that interesting?

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:32.820
So, John was saying something
wonderful a moment ago,

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.920
which is, negative
moments are magic.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.980
They are opening a door
to greater intimacy,

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.100
because if you process,
if you actually

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.690
talk about those
negative emotions

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.380
you may be having, even
about your partner, or about

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.110
something else, your
partner is learning what's

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:52.690
important to you.

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:57.230
Your partner is learning
what you really need,

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:58.350
what you really feel.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:02.234
They may be learning more
about baggage from your past

00:28:02.234 --> 00:28:04.570
that you brought into
this relationship.

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:06.380
It's all important.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:14.240
So, you don't avoid conflict
if you want to build trust.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.840
If you do, what starts happening
is the resentment builds up,

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:19.786
right?

00:28:19.786 --> 00:28:20.910
You're unhappy about stuff.

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.360
You are not talking about
it, you get more, and more,

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.980
and more unhappy.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.030
And the more the
resentment builds,

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:33.700
the more distance
grows between you,

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.790
and then eventually you
grow quite lonely, right?

00:28:36.790 --> 00:28:39.990
Because you've been looking
to your partner for a deeper

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.580
connection, and it ain't there.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.490
So, what happens?

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:49.660
You start comparing your partner
to somebody else, somebody

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:54.550
at work who you just had
this lovely conversation

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:58.085
with at the popcorn bin.

00:28:58.085 --> 00:28:59.293
You guys have popcorn, right?

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.340
And that's a lovely
conversation.

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.360
And you think, God that person
was so warm and so friendly

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.730
and so outgoing, and you start
comparing the partner at home

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:16.150
to this one.

00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:18.360
And it's those
negative comparisons,

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.815
my partner wouldn't
do that, my partner

00:29:20.815 --> 00:29:22.900
wouldn't smile at me like that.

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:26.401
The negative comparisons
then lead you

00:29:26.401 --> 00:29:30.970
towards confiding
in that person,

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.840
and then eventually
talking to that person

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.490
about your
relationship, et cetera.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:38.120
And they're going aw,
poor dear, poor dear,

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.540
and being sympathetic.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.080
And before you know
it, there's bonding

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.690
and eventual infidelity.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.890
So, that's one common path.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:51.040
How do you recover?

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.735
Well, first of all,
you don't lie about it

00:29:54.735 --> 00:29:56.300
in the first place.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.990
It's got to be open.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:02.100
If a person is deceiving and
lying about having an affair,

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:04.480
it's a double betrayal.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.710
One, going outside of monogamy,
if that's your agreement,

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.400
and two, lying about it.

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:14.630
So, what needs to
happen in terms

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.400
of the recovery-- and we're
going to be doing a research

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.780
project on this,
and typically this

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.620
needs to happen in therapy, it's
very hard to do without some.

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.940
First, the person
whose been betrayed

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:32.100
needs to be able to
ask all the questions

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.390
they have about the
affair, and the betrayer

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:38.830
needs to be able to
answer those questions.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.950
But, what's also
important is that person

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.600
whose being betrayed
typically suffers

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.900
from post-traumatic
stress disorder.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.990
You guys have all heard
about that, right?

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:52.690
In relation to combat vets
or maybe abuse histories.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.270
Same thing happens
with an affair,

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:57.880
that's what you're
causing your partner.

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.820
So they become hyper-vigilant.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:06.630
They are constantly suspecting
an [INAUDIBLE], another affair.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:10.000
They are waking up at
night with nightmares.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.900
They're having intrusive
images in their mind,

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.970
of you with the person, which
they don't want to have,

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:20.080
but they're having
anyway, and their emotions

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.350
are spiking all over the place,
they're having big explosions.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:25.360
That's all PTSD.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.570
So that needs to be explained.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:34.180
And then, the person who's
done the betraying really

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:40.282
needs to be able to here the
feelings of the person who

00:31:40.282 --> 00:31:42.220
has been betrayed.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.320
So, the betrayer needs to hear
the feelings of the betrayed.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.790
Really hear them.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:50.560
But, here's where
therapy comes in.

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:56.700
Therapy needs to
somewhat coach the person

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:01.220
who's been betrayed, to not
use contempt and criticism

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:05.580
to express the anger and pain.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:10.310
As that process slowly
winds down, which it does,

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:15.100
then you look at rebuilding
marriage number two.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:18.620
Because an affair
destroys marriage.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.700
But you can still build
marriage number two,

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.880
by opening up how to do conflict
in a much better way, how

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.980
to turn toward the
other person, how

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.270
to express honest admiration.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:34.290
And over time the
relationship is rebuilt,

00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:37.040
and oftentimes it's
stronger than ever.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:40.340
So people definitely
do recover from affairs

00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:42.490
if they get some help

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:43.620
LOGAN URY: Thank you.

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.330
So, I want to shift
gears a little bit.

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.030
You two are the
experts on marriage,

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.990
and this has been a bit
year for gay marriage.

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:52.370
And in all the
research that I study

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.770
on the relationships and
marriage, so much of it

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:56.770
is focused on
heterosexual couples.

00:32:56.770 --> 00:32:59.130
I know you've done some work
in the lesbian community.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.130
Can you talk a bit
about any differences

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:05.210
that you see with gender
roles or any other changes

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:07.700
in a gay relationship?

00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:10.330
JOHN GOTTMAN: My colleague
Bob Levenson and I

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.390
studied committed gay
and lesbian couples

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:18.370
for a dozen years, and we
found the same principles apply

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.850
to gay and lesbian
committed relationships

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:25.270
as to heterosexual
married couples.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.730
There were some
differences qualitatively.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:32.160
One really
interesting difference

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:37.740
was that most heterosexual
couples in the subcultures

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:40.460
in the United States,
except for Latino

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.240
and Hispanic subcultures,
are very embarrassed

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.190
talking about sex, even when
there's no camera there,

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.750
with one another.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:52.790
And are very indirect
in what they asked for.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:56.470
They don't have a way of
initiating sex, a formal way

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:58.110
of talking about it.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:01.097
And so gay and
lesbian couples are

00:34:01.097 --> 00:34:03.180
very different than
heterosexual couples that way.

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:07.280
They're little very open
and very direct in talking

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.409
about what they need sexually.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.110
But the overriding
the difference

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:15.110
was that gay and lesbian couples
were a lot nicer to each other

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:17.600
than heterosexual couples.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.250
They were gentler in the way
they presented their conflicts,

00:34:22.250 --> 00:34:24.380
and they were less
defensive, and there

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:27.900
was more of a sense of humor.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.530
And we know that there's
a lot more sensitivity

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:36.820
in gay and lesbian couples
to power differentials

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.389
in the relationship
and a desire--

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:42.130
maybe because there is
less choice, only 10%

00:34:42.130 --> 00:34:46.210
of the population
is gay or lesbian.

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:48.120
Because there's less
choice, I think,

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:52.949
they're more willing to
have an equal relationship,

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:55.750
even if there are differences
in income or education,

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:59.634
to really make sure that there's
not that power differential.

00:34:59.634 --> 00:35:01.050
LOGAN URY: Do you
predict anything

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.008
will change as it goes
from committed long-term

00:35:03.008 --> 00:35:05.870
relationships to
official marriage?

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:09.270
JOHN GOTTMAN: Yes, I really do.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:13.270
I think the difference
is that they will feel,

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:17.182
gay and lesbian couples will
feel more a part of society,

00:35:17.182 --> 00:35:21.625
rather than defensive
about who they are.

00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:25.340
They'll really be
accepted, they'll

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:30.730
be really are treated as equals.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.050
JULIE GOTTMAN: Yeah, let me
add to that a little bit.

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.840
Less positive note.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:43.010
But first, I did the
first study in the country

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:48.640
on when daughters were
raised by lesbian mothers,

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.574
how did they turn out compared
to the daughters of hetero

00:35:51.574 --> 00:35:53.090
moms.

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.840
And this was back in 1980.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:00.790
When kids were in
custody situations

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.237
with the hetero parent,
when the mom wanted to go

00:36:04.237 --> 00:36:06.750
live a lesbian lifestyle.

00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:08.500
And the kids were
being taken away

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:14.690
from the mother, every single
time, because she was lesbian.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:18.771
And they would often be given
to a heroin-addicted father,

00:36:18.771 --> 00:36:20.420
an alcoholic grandfather.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:24.160
They'd be given to anybody else,
but taken away from the mother.

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:27.530
So the study that I
was fortunate to do,

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:32.560
and very supported
by many lesbian

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.670
moms and their daughters,
showed that, of course,

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.640
the daughters, who
are now adults,

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:42.710
were actually doing better,
having been raised by lesbian

00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:45.310
moms, in terms of
social adjustment,

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:48.590
and there were no differences
in gender-identity and sexual

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:49.090
orientation.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.700
It was exactly the same.

00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:55.610
So now, the thing that
I'm beginning to hear,

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.552
which really me
frightens me, which

00:36:57.552 --> 00:36:59.010
you guys might want
to be aware of,

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:05.590
is that as gay marriage
has now become the law,

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:09.482
there are groups in America
who are trying to roll back

00:37:09.482 --> 00:37:12.242
the laws about gay adoption.

00:37:12.242 --> 00:37:17.370
Because the research
that I and many others

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:22.620
did at that time, allowed
gay parents, lesbian parents,

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.620
or gay and lesbian
couples to adopt kids.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:29.230
Well, now they're
trying to roll it back.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:34.990
So, there's still tension
this issue despite the fact

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:37.685
that, hooray, gay and
lesbians can now marry.

00:37:37.685 --> 00:37:40.260
LOGAN URY: That's
really interesting.

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:42.050
JULIE GOTTMAN: And
subsequent research

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:46.950
to Julie's landmark study,
has replicated that effect

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:49.920
and show that gay
and lesbian couples

00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.850
are every bit as good parents.

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:55.690
And in fact, my
personal experience,

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:59.350
sort of trailing along as a
spouse when Julie give talks

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.820
for concerned gay
and lesbian parents,

00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.490
was that they were
much more concerned

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:08.990
than heterosexual parents that
will then be terrible parents,

00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:13.090
and they really go for
parental education classes

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.270
and workshops.

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:15.910
So, I think just
the opposite is true

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:18.970
and I think it's worthwhile
raising this alarm.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.420
LOGAN URY: The
kids are all right.

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.210
JOHN GOTTMAN: Yes, they are.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.340
JULIE GOTTMAN: Kids are great.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:24.120
LOGAN URY: So, I've been
wondering this for a long time.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.980
You're famous for your ability
to predict a couple's success

00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.700
rate for staying together in
a next three to five years

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.810
with more than 90% accuracy.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.440
So, as you're doing
research, and you

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:36.720
see a couple that's really,
the four horseman are present,

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:38.240
there's all these issues.

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.250
Do you say anything to them?

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.250
Do you say better watch
out or don't get married?

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.400
JULIE GOTTMAN: (SINGING)
You better not cry.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.440
It's the season.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.939
LOGAN URY: And then
I was wondering,

00:38:47.939 --> 00:38:49.980
are you ever at a coffee
shop or on an airplane

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:51.980
and you hear a couple,
do you ever go up to them

00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:55.276
and say, listen-- [LAUGHTER]

00:38:55.276 --> 00:38:56.984
JULIE GOTTMAN: Wait,
I get to talk first.

00:38:56.984 --> 00:39:02.980
[LAUGHTER] See that's how--
he accepts influence, that's

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.886
another really important
thing, in terms

00:39:05.886 --> 00:39:08.210
of successful relationships.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:11.100
JOHN GOTTMAN: That's
enlightened self-interest.

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:18.910
JULIE GOTTMAN: First of
all, no we don't do that.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:22.554
Otherwise, we'd never get
invited to dinner. [LAUGHTER].

00:39:22.554 --> 00:39:27.400
[INAUDIBLE] out in the public--
our invitations drop down

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:27.990
[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:32.500
So, you don't typically
do that, because these

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.510
are group statistics.

00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:36.630
They're all group
statistics, so there's always

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.790
exceptions in group statistics.

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.460
On the other hand,
I have to tell you

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:45.940
a story, which is we have
one child, one daughter,

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:48.580
we were really old when
we had her, so any of you

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.835
who have old parents, know
that your parents will dote all

00:39:51.835 --> 00:39:55.660
over you, and hover
and protect you,

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.720
So when our daughter was
two, John put her in front

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.300
of the t.v. with videos
from the lab, and said

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.230
what you think about how
that father, what do you

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.695
think about those two?

00:40:09.695 --> 00:40:12.050
Are they doing okay or not?

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:17.410
And we've been doing that with
her, poor thing, [LAUGHTER]

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:20.360
we not only set up the college
fund but a psychotherapy fund.

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:25.410
[LAUGHTER] She's the daughter
of two psychologists, so.

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:29.080
Yeah, we rarely tell people
they should split up,

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.900
but every now and
then we do, when

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:37.840
there's definite abuse and
no clear path for change.

00:40:40.576 --> 00:40:42.450
JOHN GOTTMAN: Sometimes,
it's really painful,

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:49.375
like we did this study of
couples having first baby,

00:40:49.375 --> 00:40:52.100
and we followed them
from a couple of months

00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:55.770
after the wedding, and
we found that 2/3 of them

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:58.460
had a big drop in
relationship happiness

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.020
in the first three years
of the baby's life.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.280
You know, 2/3 of them.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.150
And when Julie and I
designed this workshop,

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:10.090
two day workshop called
"Bringing Baby Home,"

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.740
we could reverse that
trend for almost 80%

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.410
of the couples in just two days.

00:41:16.410 --> 00:41:17.620
We could do that.

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.735
And we were at a
restaurant recently,

00:41:19.735 --> 00:41:25.300
and I saw this young couple
and they had a new baby,

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.560
and they all also had
about a five-year-old girl,

00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.710
and they weren't
speaking to each other

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:33.750
throughout the whole
dinner, and the glances

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:36.040
were pretty negative.

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.920
And I was just dying
to go over to them

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.110
and say, would you
take our workshop,

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:43.260
[LAUGHTER] because
you can avoid all

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:48.940
of this pain in such a short
time, and prevent this misery.

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:52.410
But I don't feel I can do
that, go over to somebody

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:53.010
and say that.

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:54.060
But I would really--

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.351
LOGAN URY: It's like you have
a superpower-- [LAUGHTER]

00:41:56.351 --> 00:41:57.979
JOHN GOTTMAN: Yeah, right.

00:41:57.979 --> 00:41:59.770
LOGAN URY: So I have
so many more questions

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.811
I'm going to just ask one,
so that we can open it

00:42:01.811 --> 00:42:04.155
up to the audience afterward,
but in my own personal

00:42:04.155 --> 00:42:06.530
research, in talking to people
about their relationships,

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.072
the question I get the
most is, how do I know

00:42:09.072 --> 00:42:10.280
if I'm with the right person?

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.770
And when do I settle down?

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:13.800
And are my standards too high?

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.390
And through you, I discovered
to research of Don Baucom

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.391
about realistic versus
idealistic standards.

00:42:20.391 --> 00:42:22.640
I was wondering if you can
talk about this, especially

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.580
for people in the audience or
on YouTube who are thinking,

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.830
am I'm with the right person?

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:28.090
Or, how do I find
the right person?

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:29.590
JOHN GOTTMAN: You
know, every couple

00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:32.670
of months when I used to
watch "Oprah Winfrey," there'd

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:36.430
be this depressed
psychiatrist on,

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:40.920
as an expert on relationships,
I think his advice was always,

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:42.870
lower your
expectations, you know.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:47.090
And he said, don't expect
anything from people,

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:50.620
because it's really going to
be bad if you expect something,

00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:51.900
you'll always be disappointed.

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.108
This guy looked so depressed.

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:58.180
But you hear this advice
over and over again,

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:01.710
don't expect anything, because
high expectations are the death

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.310
knell of relationship.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:06.910
So Don Baucom, at the
University of North Carolina,

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:11.040
spent a decade studying this,
and he found just the opposite.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.730
That when people expect
to be treated well,

00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:16.240
that's what they get
in relationships.

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.740
And when people have
lowered their expectations,

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:21.960
so that they're OK
being treated like dirt,

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:23.470
that's what they get.

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:27.330
So his advice was
have high expectations

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:31.897
and expect to be treated well,
and bail out a relationship

00:43:31.897 --> 00:43:33.230
if you're getting treated badly.

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:38.380
JULIE GOTTMAN: One of
the things that I really

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:44.050
love to tell folks is,
how does your partner make

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:47.740
you feel about yourself?

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:53.335
So if, when you're with that
partner, you feel handsome,

00:43:53.335 --> 00:43:58.780
you feel beautiful, you feel
smart, and you feel cherished.

00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:02.780
You feel like your
partner really

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:09.310
respects you, that's a sign that
the relationship is a good one.

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:13.354
If, on the other hand, you feel
insecure, you feel nervous,

00:44:13.354 --> 00:44:14.020
you feel scared.

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:18.407
You feel like, God was that
a stupid thing I just said?

00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:24.290
How come they're not responding?

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.070
Why are they always
looking away?

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.410
Why are they looking
at the other people

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:29.900
instead of looking at me?

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.885
Those kinds of questions
indicate to you

00:44:33.885 --> 00:44:39.060
a big question mark in terms
of whether the relationship is

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:40.249
really working for you.

00:44:40.249 --> 00:44:41.040
JOHN GOTTMAN: Yeah.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:43.490
Let me tell a story.

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:47.930
I was talking to somebody
in a shop, this shopkeeper,

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:50.989
and she said I'm now really
in a good relationship,

00:44:50.989 --> 00:44:52.530
but I used to be in
this relationship

00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:55.400
where the guy always
said to me, why

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.160
do you have to laugh so much?

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.910
And why do you have
to laugh so loud?

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.020
Can't you think
before you laugh?

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:04.150
[LAUGHTER] That was
his message to me.

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:07.850
And she said, when I
was thinking about it,

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.420
nobody thinks before they
laugh, they just laugh

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:11.840
or they don't laugh, right?

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:15.550
And I'm now with somebody who
just loves the way I laugh,

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:20.440
and I'm with this guy
and he's just perfect.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.940
LOGAN URY: That's
a beautiful story,

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:23.595
and I'm also really
happy about what

00:45:23.595 --> 00:45:25.310
you said about keeping
high standards,

00:45:25.310 --> 00:45:27.175
because I think this
community, especially,

00:45:27.175 --> 00:45:30.020
is one where people are
going to hold off until they

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:31.180
find the right person.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.210
And I think it's
a great reminder

00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:33.876
that you shouldn't
lower your standards,

00:45:33.876 --> 00:45:37.540
even if your family and
friends are telling you to.

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:41.026
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:41.026 --> 00:45:43.470
JULIE GOTTMAN: Spoken
like a strong young woman.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:44.364
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:44.364 --> 00:45:46.280
LOGAN URY: We'll see how
my boyfriend and I do

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.495
at your workshop. [LAUGHTER]

00:45:48.495 --> 00:45:50.616
JULIE GOTTMAN: We'll
be watching, you know.

00:45:50.616 --> 00:45:51.450
LOGAN URY: So I
want to make sure

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:53.510
that people in the audience
have a chance ask questions.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:55.180
There's a mic right
here, so please

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:59.620
feel free to come up to the
podium and ask a question.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:00.420
Don't be shy.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:06.040
If you're able to make your way
up or I'll pass the microphone

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:06.540
back.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.706
AUDIENCE: I could yell, too.

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:11.860
JULIE GOTTMAN:
We've got one here.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:12.380
Or not.

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.419
LOGAN URY: Thank you.

00:46:14.419 --> 00:46:16.460
AUDIENCE: I'm actually a
counselor in Washington,

00:46:16.460 --> 00:46:19.380
I see couples and individuals,
adult individuals.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:22.330
And one of the things that I've
shifted in my practice now,

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:27.660
is that I'm seeing more arranged
marriages in my practice,

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.315
and it feels like it's a whole
different ball of wax, doing

00:46:30.315 --> 00:46:31.190
counseling with them.

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:33.400
And I'm wondering, have
you done any research

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.920
on arranged marriages versus
one where, here in the US,

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.839
we get to select?

00:46:39.839 --> 00:46:41.630
JOHN GOTTMAN: But we
haven't systematically

00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:44.550
studied arranged marriages, but
there is quite a big research

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:49.030
literature on this,
and I just want

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:51.230
to say that the same
principles apply.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.130
That respect and
affection is what

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:55.200
makes those relationships work.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.970
Now, arranged marriages
are very different when

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:02.260
they're in the community that
has arranged the marriages,

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:04.520
because then there is a
lot of social support,

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.620
and sociologists have found
that it's not religiosity

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:11.220
or any of that, that
determines the greater

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.050
stability of arranged
marriages, but that

00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:16.020
continued social support.

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:19.300
So, if a couple has an
arranged marriage in Calcutta,

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.310
then they moved to Seattle,
a very different kind

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:23.400
of situation.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.840
And they're at some
peril, because they

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:30.390
don't have that community of
support that intervenes when

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:32.635
he loses his job,
or they're running

00:47:32.635 --> 00:47:36.220
through some difficult times.

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:40.154
JULIE GOTTMAN: On
the other hand,

00:47:40.154 --> 00:47:45.790
one has to be pretty careful in
terms-- I've done a lot of work

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:51.040
with arranged marriages as
well, and one of the things

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.590
to look out for, in terms
of that community support--

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:56.700
is because the marriage
has been arranged,

00:47:56.700 --> 00:48:00.650
the people who arranged it
have great investment in it

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:02.920
continuing.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:07.110
And in the event that there is
some domestic violence, which

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:11.020
I've seen a lot of, they do
not want to support, typically,

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.106
the wife to leave.

00:48:14.106 --> 00:48:16.840
And they want her
to stay, and they

00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:19.850
tell her to put up with it, it's
been put up for generations,

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:20.650
oh well.

00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:22.904
It's OK, be a good wife.

00:48:22.904 --> 00:48:25.548
And that is a problem.

00:48:25.548 --> 00:48:26.298
JOHN GOTTMAN: Yep.

00:48:26.298 --> 00:48:27.423
JULIE GOTTMAN: Big problem.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:41.589
AUDIENCE: Hi so-- [LAUGHTER]
so I read several of your books

00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:42.672
and I really enjoyed them.

00:48:42.672 --> 00:48:44.130
But I notice a lot
of your research

00:48:44.130 --> 00:48:45.840
is focused on long term couples.

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:49.590
For people who are single,
or just starting to date,

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:55.330
do you have any books that you
recommend or that you wrote?

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:57.270
JULIE GOTTMAN: So,
part of the problem

00:48:57.270 --> 00:49:01.160
is that there has been
this much research

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:04.685
on dating and single
people, and how

00:49:04.685 --> 00:49:07.370
to make a good relationship.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.550
So all of the
internet stuff, I mean

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:14.260
there is no research
that backs it up.

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:17.350
And so we need to
do that research,

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:18.970
we would love to
do that research,

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:21.000
we have talked about
doing that research,

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.440
we don't have the money
to do that research.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:29.540
But, it's a very valid thing to
be looking at because people,

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.840
especially if they're coming
out of divorced homes,

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:36.440
and many are, don't know
what to look for in terms

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.430
of a decent relationship.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:40.920
So, good question.

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.920
JOHN GOTTMAN: You know,
one of the things that's

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:47.590
so interesting about research on
relationships at the beginning,

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:51.100
selecting somebody, is that
the research is just awful.

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:57.280
And part of the problem is
that these matching services

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.570
are using the wrong algorithm.

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:02.670
They're trying to help
people find their clone,

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:05.120
and find somebody
just like you, has

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.420
the same interest,
the same philosophy

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:10.150
of life, the same personality.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:14.900
And for what we know
about, how pheromones

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.880
work in initial
selection-- people

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:20.710
select t-shirts that's
smell good, based

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:22.770
upon the pheromones there.

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:27.950
They're selecting their
genetically more diverse

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:28.770
person.

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:31.080
On the major
histocompatibility complex

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:34.420
they're selecting people
who are different from them,

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:35.700
very different.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:38.940
So, we've got the
wrong algorithm there,

00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:43.410
and that's just an
indicator that we really

00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:46.600
don't know how to help
select the right mate.

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:52.230
But I think that the guide is to
find somebody who really likes

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:54.780
the way you laugh,
thinks you're funny,

00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:58.100
and really enjoys your company
and you enjoy their company

00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:02.521
and that's really the best
guide we have at the moment.

00:51:02.521 --> 00:51:04.520
LOGAN URY: I'd love to
hear this guy's question.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.970
[LAUGHTER] It better
be really great.

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:08.550
No pressure.

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:10.800
AUDIENCE: One thing I find
interesting about your work

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.000
is that it's based on data.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.210
Like it was quoted earlier
that during the stonewalling,

00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:23.330
the beat rate went
up 100, 140, and that

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.950
made me really curious,
is that conducted

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:27.210
in a laboratory setting?

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:31.880
Are couples then put
in a Tetris situation,

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.530
in a lab and then studied?

00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.800
JOHN GOTTMAN: We've studied
them in several ways.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:42.610
One is a standard
kind of situations

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:45.370
that are designed
to elicit conflict,

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:48.520
or having them talk
about how their day went

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.150
after they've been apart
for at least eight hours.

00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:54.810
But in the love lab I built
at University of Washington,

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:57.610
couples just hang
out for 24 hours

00:51:57.610 --> 00:51:59.670
and the videotape
is just rolling,

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:01.200
no instructions at all.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.970
So we watch them
having dinner, we

00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:05.740
watch them reading
the newspaper,

00:52:05.740 --> 00:52:08.350
cleaning up after
dinner, stuff like that.

00:52:08.350 --> 00:52:11.250
So, there you can just
look at everyday moments,

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.350
and they're wearing
Holter monitors,

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:16.660
so we're looking at their
heart rate, electrocardiogram,

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:19.130
and when they urinate,
we take a urine sample.

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:20.740
That measures stress hormones.

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:22.470
We take blood from that too.

00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:24.127
But-- [LAUGHTER]

00:52:24.127 --> 00:52:26.043
LOGAN URY: There's no
cameras in the bathroom.

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:32.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah, my
name's Craig, I'm here

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:34.760
with my wife of more than 28
years, we've been married.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:36.800
JULIE GOTTMAN: Yay!

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:40.175
AUDIENCE: But you mentioned
at the very start, the four

00:52:40.175 --> 00:52:41.340
horsemen.

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.570
And I can think of many
times in our relationship

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:46.857
when all four have been
present, stampeding

00:52:46.857 --> 00:52:53.260
through the room, causing hate
and destruction and everything.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:59.390
Yet, we've still
managed to continue on.

00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:03.215
And I was wondering, if the
presence of the four horsemen

00:53:03.215 --> 00:53:06.530
is always there, and you're
just trying to keep them at bay,

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:09.660
or is it trying to
not ever live them

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.430
exist in your relationship?

00:53:11.430 --> 00:53:13.370
I guess I'm a little
confused there,

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:17.320
because we should've broken
up many, many years ago,

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.840
because of the horseman's
presence for so many times?

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.319
But at the same time, we seem to
have survived past that and yet

00:53:24.319 --> 00:53:25.360
they're still there, so--

00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:26.210
JULIE GOTTMAN: Right oh.

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:26.780
Right.

00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:29.600
I mean, they are
for us too, right?

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.270
So, you know we're
all human beings.

00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:34.910
And as human beings, we
do have moments where

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.970
we are not editing ourselves.

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:41.677
Have you guys ever
heard of Cokie Roberts?

00:53:41.677 --> 00:53:42.510
You know who she is?

00:53:42.510 --> 00:53:45.720
She's at NPR, fabulous
political commentator.

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:50.430
And she and her husband, who
is a senator from Tennessee,

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:52.210
wrote a book about
their marriage.

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:54.640
And one of the things that
they said, that was wonderful,

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.440
is a sign of a good
marriage is how many teeth

00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:59.728
marks you have in your tongue.

00:53:59.728 --> 00:54:04.400
[LAUGHTER] So, what we saw
in our research though,

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:09.290
is that, just by having high
expectations for your marriage,

00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:12.570
there is also our
concept of what

00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:14.740
is that good enough marriage.

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:17.360
Good enough, right?

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.470
So that doesn't mean perfect.

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:23.550
Nobody really gets
away in their marriage

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:27.470
without having the incidents of
being critical, or defensive,

00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:30.920
or even contemptuous, whatever.

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:35.540
We all will slide into
that from time to time.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:39.670
This is a very critical
culture we've grown up in,

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:41.620
so we come by it righteously.

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:45.090
We know where criticism
looks like, most of us.

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:48.730
And so it comes trippingly
to the tongue when

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:50.410
we're angry about something.

00:54:50.410 --> 00:54:54.900
So, what we saw though,
is that the couples who

00:54:54.900 --> 00:54:59.590
were successful, had a
little bit less of it,

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:01.890
but they still did
it from time to time.

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:04.530
But they made repairs.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:06.690
They made repairs.

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:10.140
After they were critical,
after they were contemptuous,

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:13.320
after they were too
defensive or stonewalling,

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.860
they would go back and
say, you know what?

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:22.260
I really hated how I just put
you down half an hour ago.

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:25.650
I want to apologize
for that, and they

00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:28.550
might have a conversation
about, what was going on

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:32.040
with you when that happened?

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.240
And what we've seen
in our clinical work,

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.380
it's one of the tools that we
give in our couple's workshops,

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:46.350
that you too will get to learn,
is that when couples can go

00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:49.860
back and process a
regrettable incident,

00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:54.020
a bad fight they've had, as if
they were sitting in the upper

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.450
balcony of the theatre
looking down on the stage.

00:55:56.450 --> 00:55:59.960
And saying, what the heck
happened during Act One?

00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:04.190
And understand, from your
partners point of view,

00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:05.795
what their partner
was feeling, what

00:56:05.795 --> 00:56:10.190
their partner was receiving,
and do that in both directions.

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:13.130
Really listening to
the other person.

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:16.710
And then owning responsibility
for whatever they contributed

00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:19.130
to that regrettable incident.

00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:23.490
It's a beautiful way
of, again, taking

00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:25.330
something regrettable
that's happened

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:27.320
and turning it into magic.

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:31.060
Turning it into understanding
the other person's

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:34.830
inner-life in a much deeper way.

00:56:34.830 --> 00:56:37.700
LOGAN URY: I think we have time
for one more quick question.

00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:41.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming here.

00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:43.490
For those of us who
have young children

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:47.660
but aren't able to attend
your two day workshops,

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:49.850
what are some of
the things that are

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.930
specific to couples
with young children,

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:55.710
both in terms of the problems
that they experience,

00:56:55.710 --> 00:56:58.975
and also in terms of
strategies that they can use?

00:57:02.410 --> 00:57:08.120
JOHN GOTTMAN: Sure, one of the
things that is very important

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.850
is that, when you
become a parent,

00:57:11.850 --> 00:57:16.620
you've made a huge
philosophical leap.

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:20.760
I'm sure you experienced this
when you became a father.

00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:26.050
That you become infinitely
vulnerable, right?

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:29.970
I mean, no question
that you'd stop a mac

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:32.860
truck to save your kids' life.

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:37.000
Automatically, you know that
if something bad happened

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.800
to your kid, it'd be disastrous.

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:42.480
And you've immediately
joined the family

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.890
of man, the family
of mankind, humanity.

00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:49.480
And you become so
vulnerable, and you're

00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:54.250
able to love at a level that
is beyond what you imagined.

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:59.420
So, it's a huge change, and
loving this creature together

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.730
with your wife,
with your partner,

00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:04.520
is a very powerful bond.

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.070
And a part of what we
teach in this workshop

00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:10.230
is how to listen to babies.

00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:14.370
How to understand babies operate
on a completely different time

00:58:14.370 --> 00:58:18.180
scale from us, much slower.

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:22.000
And if you can slow down
and be you with your baby,

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:27.510
and enjoy the fact that there
was no toy on the planet

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:31.070
that is as interesting to
your baby as your face,

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:34.770
and there's no music as
interesting as your voice

00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:35.910
to that baby.

00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:38.650
And it's a hell of a lot of
fun to be with that child,

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:40.730
and spend time with that child.

00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:46.750
And I'll tell you one really
quick story, which is-- OK,

00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:48.095
and then you get to talk.

00:58:48.095 --> 00:58:53.580
[LAUGHTER] We were talking
to a [INAUDIBLE] reservation

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:57.580
one time, and we're talking
about the importance

00:58:57.580 --> 00:59:01.650
of listening to children,
and they were saying well

00:59:01.650 --> 00:59:03.620
people have been
telling us, speakers

00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:05.970
have been telling us to
tell stories to children.

00:59:05.970 --> 00:59:09.230
Stories about our culture
and our people, and you're

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:10.680
telling us to listen.

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.620
And I ask people,
how many of you

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:15.450
remember what it was
like to be a kid?

00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:16.945
And some hands went up.

00:59:16.945 --> 00:59:19.230
And I said, of those
of you who remember

00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:22.670
what it was like to be
a child, how many of you

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:27.640
had an adult who treated you
with respect and kindness

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:29.000
and listened to you?

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.240
And only a few hands
stayed up, and I

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:34.010
said would you be willing
to share your stories?

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.060
And all those people
talked and wept

00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:41.110
as they talked about the fact
that my grandmother, when

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:44.070
I walked into her room, she
would brighten and sit down,

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:46.525
drop what she was
doing and listen to me,

00:59:46.525 --> 00:59:51.560
and celebrated me and found me
interesting, and respected me.

00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:54.330
So I think that's really
what I would recommend

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:59.411
as the key thing, is to learn
how to listen to your child.

00:59:59.411 --> 01:00:00.160
JULIE GOTTMAN: OK.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:02.030
So let me ask you
something, are you sleep

01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:05.200
deprived or is your partner?

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.560
AUDIENCE: Yes, and yes.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:09.068
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:09.068 --> 01:00:11.490
JULIE GOTTMAN: OK then,
let me just mention

01:00:11.490 --> 01:00:17.130
to you that sleep deprivation
is a biggie for young parents,

01:00:17.130 --> 01:00:24.960
and after 30 days, typically,
of interrupted night's sleep,

01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:30.510
people will-- almost everyone
will show many, many signs

01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:33.050
of clinical depression.

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:37.055
What that means is
that young parents tend

01:00:37.055 --> 01:00:39.930
to be more irritable with one
another, a little bit more

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:44.040
withdrawn, more exhausted,
conflict goes up.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.940
Aren't you glad
you had children?

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:49.880
[LAUGHTER] You know,
wonderful moments too,

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:55.420
but the work has tripled, and
you're exhausted all the time.

01:00:55.420 --> 01:00:59.320
So, part of what
we really recommend

01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.760
is not only listening
to your kids,

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.520
but listening to each other.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.630
So having, if you can
have what we call a little

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:08.730
ritual of connection.

01:01:08.730 --> 01:01:12.010
Which means, a time of
connecting with your partner

01:01:12.010 --> 01:01:15.160
that you can really count
on, that's predictable.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:20.600
If you can have a stress
reducing conversation

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.295
in the evenings, even
when you're exhausted,

01:01:23.295 --> 01:01:24.890
of how was your day, dear?

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.680
Tell me about your day.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.560
And each of you can
whine and complain

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:32.820
to each other, that is really
useful, where people are just

01:01:32.820 --> 01:01:38.640
empathizing with one
another to stay connected.

01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.240
Because when you're
so busy, parents

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.540
find they don't have much time
to just talk to each other,

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.480
hang out with each other.

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:50.295
So it's really important to
build in rituals of connection

01:01:50.295 --> 01:01:51.704
to do that.

01:01:51.704 --> 01:01:56.725
That are talking about things
other than, did you call

01:01:56.725 --> 01:01:58.210
the plumber.

01:01:58.210 --> 01:01:59.660
So, that's one.

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:04.740
Another is, if at all
possible, have a date night.

01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:08.240
Have a date night, where
you go out once a week.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:12.150
Even when the kids are
little you can do that.

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:15.500
And, that third, if
you can possibly,

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.030
it depends on how old your
kids are, once in a while,

01:02:19.030 --> 01:02:20.610
have an overnight.

01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.860
You know, just, all you'll
do to is talk about you kids.

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:28.330
Know that, but you
won't be interrupted

01:02:28.330 --> 01:02:29.813
while you're doing that.

01:02:29.813 --> 01:02:31.540
Which is a good thing.

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:36.720
And, they can get
our book. [LAUGHTER]

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.900
JOHN GOTTMAN: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:40.540
JULIE GOTTMAN: So, our book
has all of this, but anyway.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:45.600
So, staying connected with your
partner is super important,

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:48.770
and building in those
rituals of connection, where

01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:52.510
you can really count on talking
to each other is wonderful,

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:54.530
helps the marriage.

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:55.774
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:02:55.774 --> 01:02:56.940
LOGAN URY: Well, that's all.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:58.880
That's it for time,
but thank you so much,

01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:03.622
this was really a dream
of mine [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:03.622 --> 01:03:05.369
[APPLAUSE]
