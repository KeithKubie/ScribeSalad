are very powerful and important ideas in

are very powerful and important ideas in
 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.830
are very powerful and important ideas in
some ways those are the ideas that

second thing I would say is that I think

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430
second thing I would say is that I think
 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.900
second thing I would say is that I think
it is a serious mistake and there's been

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910
it is a serious mistake and there's been
 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.960
it is a serious mistake and there's been
a certain amount of this to be

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970
a certain amount of this to be
 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.630
a certain amount of this to be
dismissive of modernity and all this

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640
dismissive of modernity and all this
 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.790
dismissive of modernity and all this

did everything I don't minimize at all

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220
did everything I don't minimize at all
 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.130
did everything I don't minimize at all
the seriousness of the problems that we

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140
the seriousness of the problems that we
 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.100
the seriousness of the problems that we
are facing but imagine that all the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110
are facing but imagine that all the
 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.640

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650
lending that took place in California
 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.880
lending that took place in California
took place from California banks that

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890
took place from California banks that
 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.800
took place from California banks that
were allowed only to lend in California

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810
were allowed only to lend in California
 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.920
were allowed only to lend in California
think about how much larger a problem we

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930
think about how much larger a problem we
 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.130
think about how much larger a problem we
would have of failed institutions if

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140
would have of failed institutions if
 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.110
would have of failed institutions if

the risk across different parts of the
 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.229
the risk across different parts of the
country think about how much worse these

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239
country think about how much worse these
 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.600
country think about how much worse these
problems of interest rate fluctuations

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610
problems of interest rate fluctuations
 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.539
problems of interest rate fluctuations
would have been if as in the old days

would have been if as in the old days
 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.319
would have been if as in the old days
you had banks writing 30-year mortgages

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329
you had banks writing 30-year mortgages
 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.910
you had banks writing 30-year mortgages

in the 80s and 90s the institutions went

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.330
in the 80s and 90s the institutions went
bankrupt so I think it's important to

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340
bankrupt so I think it's important to
 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.610
bankrupt so I think it's important to
understand that a modern financial
