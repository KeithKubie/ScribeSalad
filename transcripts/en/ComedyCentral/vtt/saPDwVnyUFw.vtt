Earlier today,
Apple fans were blindsided

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.538
by a terrible announcement.

00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:07.441
The new iPhone 7 won't have
traditional headphone jacks!

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:09.610
Goddamn it!

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:11.278
What the (bleep)!

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:13.146
Goddamn it!

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.249
(Bleep) on a stick.

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:18.685
-What the (bleep)!
-Yeah! -Yeah!

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:20.654
-(cheers and applause)
-(bleep)

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:24.191
-That's one of the old ones.
-Okay. -RAJSKUB: Is it okay?

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.325
Oh, my God, is it okay?

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.326
It's fine. It's fine.
It's totally fine.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.528
-It's okay.
-It's all right.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:28.896
Look, you got the insurance.
You're good.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.430
-Chris, what are you doing?
-This confirmed everyone's

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.599
worst fears
that the iPhone would eliminate

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.668
that tight sweet headphone hole
and replace it

00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:38.539
with new wireless air pods
that you definitely won't lose

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:40.541
in the cushions of your couch.

00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:42.609
They are, to be fair,
including a dongle

00:00:42.643 --> 00:00:44.044
that can adapt
to the old headphones,

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:46.180
but who wants
to ruin their slim new phone

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:47.481
with some big fat dongle

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:50.517
that flaps around in the wind
like an asshole? Not me.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.686
I already got one of those.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.388
This new development comes in...
-(laughter)

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:55.689
Thank you.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.425
This new development comes
in spite of a petition

00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.460
that 300,000 irate
iPhone users signed

00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:02.629
to stop Apple
from killing the headphone jack.

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:04.298
Here's a thought about this.

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:07.234
Um, you-you-you...
you could just not buy it.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:11.104
-Uh... you don't have to.
-(laughter)

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:13.307
-(applause and cheering)
-Not an option, Chris.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.108
You're right. On the other hand,
you totally have to buy it.

00:01:15.142 --> 00:01:17.110
Yeah. I will.

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:19.413
Uh, comedians,
what's another petition

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:22.916
fans might sign against Apple?
James.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.685
I'm not a Trump fan,
but I do believe that we need

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:26.620
to make cell phones great again.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.422
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:29.590
-(cheers and applause)
-HARDWICK: All right.

00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:30.591
Thank you.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.326
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:34.127
-HARDWICK: Yeah.
-There should be a petition

00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:37.464
to ban anybody with a cracked
screen from holding a baby.

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.433
(laughter)

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:42.269
You had one job!

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:43.971
You had
one job!

00:01:44.004 --> 00:01:45.839
I have to tell you,
my son almost drowned,

00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:47.274
but I stuck him in rice after.

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:48.308
-(Goldberg clucks tongue)
-(laughter)

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:50.143
RAJSKUB:
Um...

00:01:50.177 --> 00:01:50.244
No problem.
