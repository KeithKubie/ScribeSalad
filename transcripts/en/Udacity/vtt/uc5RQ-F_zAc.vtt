00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.770
The top three things I would recommend
any game developer do, is to first get

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.200
analytics and make sure you're measuring
all the important things for your game.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.700
Then determine which mix of monetization
methods is most appropriate.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.309
It will really vary accordingly,
depending on the type of game that you

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.340
have as well as a number
of other factors.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.010
And finally, to use those
analytics to optimize accordingly.
