00:00:01.686 --> 00:00:02.961
- [Voiceover] In this
video, we're gonna begin

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:05.870
the derivation of the LC Natural Response,

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.267
the response of an
inductor capacitor circuit.

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:11.274
This is a difficult derivation,

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:13.904
but it really pays off in the end.

00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:15.498
There's a really fun surprise at the end,

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:19.415
and that is, this is
where sine waves are born.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.901
We're gonna end up with sine
waves at the end of this.

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:26.936
And that's a really nice
result because these are

00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:31.103
everywhere in electronics,
and in the natural world.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:33.334
We're gonna start out by saying,

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:37.098
we're gonna put some charge
on this capacitor here.

00:00:37.098 --> 00:00:40.274
And we're gonna have the
current in this circuit, i,

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:43.274
we're gonna have that start at zero.

00:00:44.781 --> 00:00:46.991
So i zero is zero, but this is the current

00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:50.096
through the circuit, and
that means that current

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:52.179
exists over here as well.

00:00:53.237 --> 00:00:56.154
Let's put a switch in this circuit.

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:06.584
And we're gonna close that
switch at t equals zero.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.602
So we have one variable as
i, and the other variable

00:01:10.602 --> 00:01:13.672
we're gonna use is v, and
v is this voltage here,

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:15.672
after the switch closes.

00:01:17.474 --> 00:01:19.557
So we wanna find i and v.

00:01:25.112 --> 00:01:28.921
And for this we're gonna
focus on finding i.

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.778
Once we find i it's
straightforward to find e.

00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:33.754
So this is gonna be our
independent variable,

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:35.004
is the current.

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:37.541
So let's begin the analysis.

00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:41.514
At the moment, t equals zero,
the charge that exists here

00:01:41.514 --> 00:01:43.593
is gonna start flowing in the circuit,

00:01:43.593 --> 00:01:47.654
and both voltage and current
are gonna start to change.

00:01:47.654 --> 00:01:48.910
So let's write some expressions,

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.936
let's start out by writing
some things that we know

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:54.572
are true about our two components.

00:01:54.572 --> 00:01:56.572
And we'll start with the capacitor.

00:01:56.572 --> 00:01:59.011
So we'll start by writing an
expression for our capacitor,

00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:01.081
and there's a little sign
flip that happens here,

00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:03.097
so we gotta be a little bit careful.

00:02:03.097 --> 00:02:07.264
So if I have v on a capacitor,
and i in a capacitor,

00:02:09.833 --> 00:02:13.666
I would say that i
capacitor equals c, dv, dt.

00:02:21.735 --> 00:02:24.973
Now if we look here, vc
is the same as v here,

00:02:24.973 --> 00:02:28.568
positive sign at the top,
positive sign at the top,

00:02:28.568 --> 00:02:32.462
negative sign at the bottom,
so vc and v are the same.

00:02:32.462 --> 00:02:35.414
But i, we have to be careful,
i is in the opposite direction

00:02:35.414 --> 00:02:39.581
of the current that I picked
for independent variable,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.260
so that's upside down.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.346
So i, there's a negative
sign we get to flip here,

00:02:47.346 --> 00:02:49.513
equals negative c, dv, dt.

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:57.821
So that's the IV equation
for our particular circuit.

00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:01.879
We have that little extra negative sign.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.686
And now I wanna write the
integral form of the capacitor

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:10.103
IV equation, which is v equals one over c

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.959
times the integral of idt.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.012
And remember our minus sign.

00:03:22.012 --> 00:03:24.892
This is the important
minus sign to bring along.

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:28.286
Okay so let's do the
voltage across the inductor,

00:03:28.286 --> 00:03:32.453
the inductor voltage is same
variable v, is L, di, dt.

00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:41.986
So there's no extra minus sign here.

00:03:41.986 --> 00:03:45.048
This is assigned according
to the sign convention

00:03:45.048 --> 00:03:46.965
for passive components.

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.244
So now we have an expression
for v on the capacitor,

00:03:53.244 --> 00:03:56.284
and we have an expression
for v on the inductor,

00:03:56.284 --> 00:03:58.768
and we know that that's the same voltage.

00:03:58.768 --> 00:04:00.328
So let's set these two things together,

00:04:00.328 --> 00:04:03.328
so we can say that L, di, dt, equals

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:12.586
minus one over c, times
the integral of idt.

00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:18.228
All we did was set the
two identical voltages

00:04:18.228 --> 00:04:20.015
equal to each other.

00:04:20.015 --> 00:04:21.648
And now I'm gonna manipulate this a bit,

00:04:21.648 --> 00:04:24.981
it says that L, di, dt, plus one over c,

00:04:28.984 --> 00:04:31.651
the integral of idt equals zero.

00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:36.756
We just gathered terms on one side,

00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:40.006
and we said the other side became zero.

00:04:44.488 --> 00:04:46.074
Now since I'm not used to having integrals

00:04:46.074 --> 00:04:47.953
inside equations, I'd
rather have derivatives,

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:50.621
since I have some experience
with differential equations,

00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:54.708
let's, if we take a derivative
of this whole equation,

00:04:54.708 --> 00:04:56.913
so here's what we're gonna do.

00:04:56.913 --> 00:04:58.774
We're gonna take a derivative
with respect to time,

00:04:58.774 --> 00:05:01.136
of this whole thing here,

00:05:01.136 --> 00:05:05.053
and that gives us, we
get the second derivative

00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:08.576
of the first term, so we get L,

00:05:13.571 --> 00:05:17.238
second derivative of i
with respect to time,

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.317
plus one over c, and then,

00:05:23.328 --> 00:05:26.067
the derivative of the integral of idt,

00:05:26.067 --> 00:05:30.553
turns into just i, and
the derivative of zero,

00:05:30.553 --> 00:05:32.386
on this side, is zero.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:39.168
So this is now the differential
equation for the LC circuit.

00:05:40.928 --> 00:05:42.391
And it's called, it has a name,

00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:45.558
it's called a second order homogeneous

00:05:55.347 --> 00:05:57.930
ordinary differential equation.

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:00.799
It's a differential
equation because it has

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:03.749
derivatives in it, it's
homogeneous because it only

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:08.650
has derivatives of i with
respect to t and nothing else.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.270
The indicator is that this
side is equal to zero,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.676
there's no forcing term
over here on this side.

00:06:13.676 --> 00:06:16.013
So when you can write
the equation this way,

00:06:16.013 --> 00:06:18.424
we say it's homogeneous.

00:06:18.424 --> 00:06:20.213
And it's called a second order equation,

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:24.275
because it has this second
derivative right here.

00:06:24.275 --> 00:06:27.571
So now we've set up our
second order homogeneous ODE,

00:06:27.571 --> 00:06:31.008
and in the next video,
we'll go about solving this.

00:06:31.008 --> 00:06:34.258
We're gonna go through it step by step.
