00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.290
Meredith is solving the
following problem for homework,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.730
2 times the quantity x plus
4 squared is equal to 242.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.980
She completes the problem
as seen in the steps below,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.772
and they give us the
steps right over here.

00:00:11.772 --> 00:00:13.313
When she gets to
school the next day,

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.470
her teacher tells her that
the answer's x equals 7

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.430
and x equals negative 15.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.400
She only got x equals 7 here.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.569
In what step did
she make an error?

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:23.110
So this first step
right here-- and I

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.200
encourage you to
pause this video

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.783
and try to figure
this out on your own

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:28.020
before I work through it.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.270
So this first step, let's see.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.630
She got rid of this 2 by
dividing the left-hand side

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.440
by 2, and she
appropriately divided.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.530
Well, you can't just
do that to one side.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.905
You have to do
that to both sides

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:37.390
in order to hold this equality.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.280
So she divided 242 by 2 as
well, so that is correct.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.990
Step one makes sense.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.960
And then she just
wanted-- instead

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.440
of this being an
x plus 4 squared,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.020
she wanted it to be an x plus 4.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.520
So she attempted to take the
square root of both sides.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.760
She said hey, look.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.610
The square root of x plus
4 squared is x plus 4,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.500
and the square
root of 121 is 11.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.790
And this is where she made
a small but very, very,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.350
very, very important mistake.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.150
Because if something
squared is equal to 121,

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.580
that means that
something could be

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.030
the positive or negative
square root of 121.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.560
This thing that we're
squaring could be positive 11,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.320
because positive
11 squared is 121,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.900
or x plus 4 right over
here could be negative 11,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.669
because negative 11
squared is also 121.

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.710
So this right over here,
this should say x plus 4

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.790
is equal to the positive or
negative square root of 11,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.760
and so that's why she missed out
on one of the solutions right

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.260
over here.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.930
So she messed up in step two.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.970
She should have taken
the positive and negative

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.300
square root.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.130
So, we got that right.
