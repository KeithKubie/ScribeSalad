LIZ SCHWAB: Hello,
good afternoon.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.870
Thank you for coming.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.310
Welcome to Google.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.650
For those joining
via YouTube, thanks

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.780
for joining us and sorry we're
running a few minutes late.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.870
My name is Liz Schwab.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.390
I work on the
Community Affairs team

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.470
here in our Cambridge office,
and we're thrilled to have,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.700
today, the third events in our
Thought Leader series here.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.850
Joining us again is Kara Miller
from WGBH's Innovation Hub.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.490
And with her today is Nigel
Jacob from the Mayor's Office

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.750
of New Urban Mechanics and Kent
Larson from MIT's Media Lab

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.759
Changing Places group.

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:00.050
So we're excited to talk
about innovative cities today.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.370
Kara, the stage is yours.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.740
KARA MILLER: OK, so we're
really excited to talk

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.540
about this topic of cities,
where they're going,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.395
how they're doing
innovative things.

00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:13.770
And I'm just going to throw
the first thing to you, Kent.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.600
We were talking about
this a little bit

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.730
before we came up here.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.580
There's this massive migration,
in many parts of the world,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.520
to cities.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.037
We now have more than half
the people in the world living

00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:27.120
in cities, which is kind
of this incredible thing,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.480
these little sort
of dots on a map.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.580
How is that changing
us in how we live?

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.900
KENT LARSON: Well, we're
becoming an urbanized planet.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.250
Europe and the US, by the
way, are heavily urbanized.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.910
And 90% of the population
growth from here

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.130
on out will take
place in cities.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.430
So we have to focus on cities.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.000
I think it's a
great thing in that,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.870
if you talk to most young
people, increasingly,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.210
they want to live in the city.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.240
They want to live
in neighborhoods

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.920
where they can live and work
and play and shop and go

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.170
to bars and great restaurants
right in the city.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.040
We had a conference at Harvard
last weekend about India.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.510
And it's a little
different there.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.860
That's where women find
opportunities in education,

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.570
and people can find
employment and opportunities

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.180
and leave the kind of
problems of rural life.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.940
So there are a lot of pressures
forcing people to the city,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.280
and, I think, in most cases,
they find better lives there.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.480
KARA MILLER: Nigel,
one of the writers

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.020
who's talked about people
moving to the city-- and this

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.020
is in America, too, the
increasing draw of cities.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.310
Alan Ehrenhalt once
said to me, you

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.550
know, you've got a generation
of people who grew up,

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.280
who sat in the suburbs, watching
"Seinfeld" and "Friends" and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.470
"Sex in the City," and they
were like, wait a minute,

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.230
I want to live like that.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.470
So you do see the sky-rocketing
home prices in cities

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.910
all over the place.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.670
What kind of pressure does
that income increased interest

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.160
in cities place on
you if you're actually

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.400
part of city government?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.350
NIGEL JACOB: Sure, so I think
lots of different pressures--

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.510
I'll say that the
urbanization is happening

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.160
not only in terms of
suburbs into cities,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.430
but also internationally.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.120
We're seeing people
that are moving

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.390
from the country, the sort of
rural setting in one country,

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.790
coming to Boston or to New
York, or what have you.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.589
And in one way or the
other, the challenge,

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:42.630
if you're in a leadership
position in the cities,

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.860
is to figure out how do create
a policy environment that

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.260
is supportive of those things.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.430
There's still a lot of
unanswered questions

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.360
around urbanization.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.950
A lot of people, maybe not
that don't skew as young,

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.615
there are negative
connotations with density.

00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:03.990
Because urbanization, especially
with a city like Boston,

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.670
which is physically so small,
this wave of urbanization

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.990
will have to lead to density.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.960
And if you live in
a part of the city,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.500
and you believe that
your parking spot is

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.472
your god-given right
and that there's

00:04:18.472 --> 00:04:20.680
going to be 100 people moving
into your neighborhood,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.596
that's going to be a
really tricky discussion.

00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:25.620
So you know it means that, as
a leadership, how [INAUDIBLE]?

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.862
How do you facilitate a
negotiation or a process

00:04:30.862 --> 00:04:32.320
of engagement with
the public where

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.952
there is a real
dialogue happening,

00:04:33.952 --> 00:04:36.160
and it's not just the
traditional kind of lip service

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.420
that's been done around
civic engagement.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.600
KARA MILLER: Kent,
Mayor Bloomberg,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.800
former mayor of New
York, famously was like,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.800
let's try these
micro apartments,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.730
put people in smaller spaces.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.380
But even if there's
a lot of interest,

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.360
let's say, amongst 20-somethings
in living in Manhattan

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.400
or Brooklyn or downtown
San Francisco or Cambridge

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.650
or Boston, even if
there is that interest,

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.404
do you really get to the
point where you're 32,

00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:08.070
and you've got a couple of kids,
and your like, 700 square feet,

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.900
that's totally fine?

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.000
Or will a sort of
younger generation,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.520
like many generations
before them,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.960
say, you know what, no, I want
a yard, 2,000 square feet?

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.510
KENT LARSON: Well,
I'll address that,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.410
but I think you need
to start with density.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.870
As what Nigel mentioned, I think
a lot of it is about density.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.860
And density is
neither good nor bad.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.770
It depends how you do it.

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.110
And so if you can increase
the density in cities,

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.360
you have a lot of good things.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.040
You have greater GDP, higher
income, better restaurants,

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.510
more cultural
activities, et cetera.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.500
Or you can have traffic
congestion and pollution

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.170
and loss of contact with
nature and crime and disease.

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.730
So it's neither good nor bad.

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.870
Density he is tricky
because of traffic.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.670
If you're dependent on
private automobiles,

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.690
the neighborhoods right.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.106
Increase the density, you're
going have a lot of problems.

00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:14.390
So moving away from that, but
to get to your micro unit issue.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:20.590
It's really in our mind a way
of increasing the density-- one

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.670
strategy, so you have the
good stuff without the bad.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.360
It's not that everyone is
going to live in a micro unit

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.240
all their life.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.620
But market-rate
housing, like what's

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.170
being proposed here in
Kendall Square, for example,

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:37.190
is really good at one
little, narrow segment

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.760
of the population-- rich people.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.800
It doesn't provide housing
for graduate students

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.850
or junior faculty or young
professionals or families

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.290
or elderly people.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:52.600
And one thing I really
appreciate about Mayor Walsh

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.560
is he has a housing
initiative to increase

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.030
the density of housing for
those people not served

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.190
by market-rate housing.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.392
And micro units is one really
interesting way to do that.

00:07:04.392 --> 00:07:06.100
KARA MILLER: When you
talk about density,

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.850
what does that
mean on the ground?

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:10.850
It sounds like it means
maybe getting smaller?

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.290
And I assume it means
building up, right?

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.110
And not having like
a bunch of buildings

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.850
that are only a
few stories high.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:19.320
KENT LARSON:
Density, in my mind,

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.470
you define it broadly
as residential density,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.770
but it doesn't necessarily
mean more bulk.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.910
It can mean just using
space more efficiently.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:33.336
It's density of
enterprises, of companies,

00:07:33.336 --> 00:07:34.710
and hopefully
they're in balance,

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.815
so you have live
and work in balance.

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:40.840
It's density of third
places and shops and cafes.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.320
So you can define
density broadly.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.880
I think that we tend
to-- I'm an architect.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.240
And you look at what
architects build

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.850
tends to be a
very-- particularly

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.380
the high-end building-- a very
poor utilization of space.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:59.290
And you talk about apartments.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:02.080
It's really kind of silly to
have a bedroom and a living

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.865
room side-by-side.

00:08:03.865 --> 00:08:05.490
You don't use a
bedroom during the day.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.130
You don't use the
living room at night.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:10.850
If you stack them and
just did a transition,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.470
you could make both bigger
and both better in half

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.140
for 2/3 of the space.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.996
You look at many of the
spaces in office buildings.

00:08:20.996 --> 00:08:22.620
They're underutilized
most of the time.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.203
Even the Media Lab, we complain
about not having enough space,

00:08:25.203 --> 00:08:28.004
but it's just a poor
utilization of space.

00:08:28.004 --> 00:08:30.170
So I think we can do a lot
better without increasing

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.255
the bulk.

00:08:31.255 --> 00:08:32.630
NIGEL JACOB: So
one of the things

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:38.140
that's happened, I think, in a
socioeconomic sense for people

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:43.240
living in cities, there was
a time in America's past,

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.340
in sort of the
post-World War Ii era,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.260
where prosperity was equated
to house size and the number

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.340
of cars and so on.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.660
And that's just gone,
for the most part,

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.530
for a certain age demographic.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.890
And so I think
increasingly, people just

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.380
don't want-- they don't see
the two-car garage as being

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.380
a symbol of prosperity.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.430
Because we're still a very
symbolic social species,

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.670
and we always want
to give out those

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.020
signals that I'm prospering,
but cars are no longer

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.590
seen as that signal.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.070
Now there are large houses.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.010
So I think that
what's interesting

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:18.330
is figuring out how do
we capitalize on that

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.210
and sort of change the nature
of dialogue that happens

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.310
in communities around
what level of density

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:25.595
their comfortable with.

00:09:25.595 --> 00:09:27.970
KARA MILLER: You spend your
days thinking about problems.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.110
Like, here are the
problems with cities,

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.370
and how do we solve them, right?

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.760
Traffic and cars have
come up several times.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.890
We've only been talking
for a few minutes.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:41.376
Is the car and traffic
your number one problem?

00:09:41.376 --> 00:09:43.000
Are there other things
you put on that?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.800
Like this is the top.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.680
These are serious
problems in cities.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.090
NIGEL JACOB: The sort of traffic
and cars are a big problem.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:55.180
But I would say issues related
to education, making sure

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:59.200
that children graduate school
on time, get into college,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.140
like those kinds of more
intimate, personal kind

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.140
of issues, the things
that impact people's lives

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.100
most directly, I would
rank0 at the top.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.620
I would say that cars
and infrastructure,

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.010
or cars and transportation
and infrastructure,

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.550
for once you get going.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:19.440
And they tend to be either
a choke point or an enabler

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.120
for the growth of communities.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.590
KARA MILLER: OK, so let's
look at some of the stuff

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.380
that you guys have
been working on.

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.880
And people listening here and
people listening on YouTube,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.110
if you have questions,
you can tweet them.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:37.810
Mark monitoring
them at @ihubradio.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.620
You can also, if you're
listening at Google,

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.579
you can use the Dory to
submit those questions.

00:10:42.579 --> 00:10:44.453
And if you're in the
audience, think of them.

00:10:44.453 --> 00:10:45.664
We've got microphones here.

00:10:45.664 --> 00:10:47.080
We will soon go
to your questions.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.680
So the first thing
here we want to look at

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.500
is something that you're working
on, Kent, at the Media Lab.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.320
And this speaks to
this idea of like how

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.290
do you make a city a little
bit more self-sufficient?

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.660
How do you make
good use of space--

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:08.840
what you were talking
about in terms of density.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.430
So putting a farm in a
city-- talk a little bit

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.280
about some of your
experiment here.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.330
KENT LARSON: So we
come at this project

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.960
from different directions.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.820
On the one hand,
it's about jobs.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:24.250
It's about bringing clean
manufacturing into the city,

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.500
increasing the
diversity of jobs.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.130
We pick this, in large
part, because if you

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:38.480
can grow fresh produce
in the city efficiently,

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.970
increase people's
relationship to their food,

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.840
like in medieval city--
I mean, you know, food

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.760
was all around you-- and
develop a product that's

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.790
consumed locally-- so you
produce and consume locally.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.470
It's like the perfect
manufacturing.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.440
By the way, we think we
can get to doing this

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:02.970
with 10% of the water, 60%
of the fertilizer, ultimately

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:06.130
less energy, particularly if
you consider the supply chain.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.530
Right now, we're flying
vegetables in from Mexico.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:14.080
Here you can grow food--
high-quality food,

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.900
pharmaceutical purity,
no pesticides, maybe two

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.570
or three times the
nutrient value-- right

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.430
in the city in a visible way.

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.730
Everybody wins.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.830
KARA MILLER: Is it
is it realistic,

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.070
and is a cost-effective
to put it

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:34.270
farms in a kind of a high rise
building, which is basically

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.880
the image that you have here?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.040
KENT LARSON: Well,
we'll have real metrics

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.250
when we complete the
studies that we're doing.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:45.650
But this is on the facade
of the Media Lab building.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:50.110
So we did it there to
collect all the data

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.370
so we can answer that
question definitively.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.560
I do think that it
is cost-effective,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.530
if you factor in that about
half of the vegetables that

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.750
come from remote area spoil
in transit, and much of it

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.990
rots on the shelf,
and it's picked when

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.390
it's green so it doesn't spoil.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.860
And if you can recycle
the water and not

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.640
have it evaporate and go into
the ground table, et cetera,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.990
then I think the
numbers will prove out,

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.480
particularly for really,
high-value, desirable

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.220
vegetables that require a lot
of refrigeration, for example,

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.020
to ship.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.610
KARA MILLER: OK, let's
look at the next one here.

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:37.430
So this is a project that
you're working on, Park Boston.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.450
I'm hoping this
is going to mean I

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.100
don't have to look for
parking anymore and circle

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.640
the block forever.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:44.539
What's your aim here?

00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:46.580
NIGEL JACOB: Sure, so I
just want to say a couple

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:49.140
minutes about who we are.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.740
So I co-run a group at Boston
City Hall called the Mayor's

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.060
Office of New Urban Mechanics.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.880
Our job is to be
the experimentalists

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.970
in local government.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.500
And so we're always looking
for experiments, prototypes,

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.750
that we can role out into
the world that will actually

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.874
push the envelope in terms
of the kinds of services

00:14:05.874 --> 00:14:07.530
that the city delivers.

00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.110
And one of the things that
we hear loud and clear,

00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:13.840
we've all talked about
this, is that the parking

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.989
is a horrible
experience for anyone

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:18.030
driving through the city.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.360
Transportation, generally,
is a big problem.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.550
And so the way that
New Urban Mechanics

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.340
would go about
addressing this issue

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.710
is to focus on the
user experience first.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.960
I mean, the system needs
to be changed radically,

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.980
but that will require
months and possibly

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.750
years to kind of overhaul the
Boston infrastructure to be

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:37.950
truly 21st century.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.510
But in the meantime, there's
lots of like tweaks and hacks

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.180
that we can introduce
into the system

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.300
to change people's
daily experience.

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:50.540
And so Park Boston is an
app that we rolled out

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:51.740
late last year.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.740
And the intent is to make
it as easy as possible

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:55.020
for you to pay for parking.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.200
So unfortunately,
it doesn't magically

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.310
do away with the
parking problem,

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.480
but it is a small
step in the direction

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.600
of turning the parking
experience into one that

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.845
isn't bad and doesn't want to
generate anger and road rage

00:15:08.845 --> 00:15:11.170
and that kind of thing.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:12.910
KARA MILLER: Do
you think that some

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.990
of the stresses on
cities-- we certainly

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.450
saw it in Boston this winter.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.390
We got this tremendous
amount of snow,

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:23.280
put a lot of stress, not only
on traffic, which it certainly

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:25.930
did, but also people
couldn't get anywhere

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.320
via public transportation.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.610
That was really
hard to do, as well.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.140
Do you think at
the stresses that

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.000
are being put on cities, by
the fact that they're really

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.910
popular now, is something
that government is really

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.160
struggling to keep up with?

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.840
NIGEL JACOB: I certainly
think that any kind of stress

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:48.590
to the system government
will either recoil from it

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:51.110
or respond more positively
see it as a challenge.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.550
And so I would say
Mayor Walsh has

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.260
been very clear that this is
an opportunity to push change.

00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:59.300
So we are trying,
as much as we can,

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:03.130
to use this as an opportunity
to rethink snow operations

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:05.750
and to rethink the kinds
of information and data

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.130
and technology that we put
in the hands of people that

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:12.420
are actually out there
driving those snow plows,

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.000
rethinking the way that we
melt snow, rethinking the way

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.830
that we get rid of it.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.790
It's interesting.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:22.760
Like one of the big
concepts now for thinking

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.000
about the application
of technology to cities

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.940
has been this concept
of the 'smart' city.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.350
And I've never heard
snow operations

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.800
in the smart city's concept.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.030
It's always about blinking
lights and sensors and so on.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.010
But it's never about how
do you get rid of snow

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.545
faster, better, cheaper,
more effectively in a way

00:16:40.545 --> 00:16:41.545
that the anger everyone.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:48.450
KARA MILLER: I know, and that's
a major, major challenge.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:52.820
Kent, when you look
at these issues,

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.840
and you think about what we
were talking about a little bit

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:00.690
before, this sort of divergence
between the people who once

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.050
lived in cities-- if you
went back 40, 50 years

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.489
and looked at who
lived in cities,

00:17:04.489 --> 00:17:06.280
it was often the people
who couldn't afford

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.130
to live out in the suburbs.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:13.599
Do you see those people, who
once lived in cities, not being

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:15.579
able to find a
place in the cities

00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.069
because the jobs in
cities have changed

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:21.349
and the affordability
issues have changed?

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:26.026
And we see those people, then,
moving out to the suburbs.

00:17:26.026 --> 00:17:27.359
KENT LARSON: Well, you see that.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:30.090
We work a lot in Europe.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.740
We have a relationship
with Hamburg and Andorra.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.370
And I think in Europe
they do a much better job

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:40.900
of dealing with those
issues, with public policy,

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:46.370
and making sure that you
have equity in cities.

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.070
It's a tricky balance.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.970
Because if you leave
it to the market,

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.100
you will have gentrification
and people without means

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:56.350
will have to leave.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:58.350
And to a certain
extent, that's just

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.140
the natural flow of things.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:04.080
But it reaches a point where
it kills innovation in city.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.270
It kills interaction.

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:08.210
Cities are all about
creative interactions

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.560
and strong social ties that
leads to an exchange of ideas,

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:17.440
which, if you're lucky, leads
to Google's being formed

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.480
and innovative companies.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.810
What's happening in many
cities in the US and Europe--

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:26.360
and London's that way-- all
of the people, the creatives,

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.530
are leaving the city, and you're
left with mainly rich people

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.790
in corporate offices,
and I think that really

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.420
does kill innovation.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:36.650
And, by the way, cars
kill innovation, too.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:41.090
KARA MILLER: It's
interesting, a great tech

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.750
mind, who is the CEO of a
company, a fairly small company

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.750
but not super small, was
complaining to me one time

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.300
and saying, you
know, I used to be

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.850
out-- he used to be in
Central Square in Cambridge.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:54.340
And then this
company got too big,

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.060
and he was going to move
it out to the suburbs,

00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:58.476
because that's what he had
done with his previous company,

00:18:58.476 --> 00:19:00.280
and everybody loved that.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.920
And multiple engineers
came to him and said,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.130
if you move this company
out to the suburbs,

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.447
I am not working here anymore.

00:19:06.447 --> 00:19:07.905
And he was like,
well, then I guess

00:19:07.905 --> 00:19:09.160
I'm keeping it in the city.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:11.057
And he moved to the
Innovation District,

00:19:11.057 --> 00:19:12.890
and he was kind of
griping to me and saying,

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.970
you know, when I
first worked here,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.800
you could get a
sandwich at lunch.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.205
Now the lines are so long.

00:19:19.205 --> 00:19:21.205
You could get out of here
at the end of the day.

00:19:21.205 --> 00:19:23.470
Now the traffic is so bad.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.830
So you said the
creatives are leaving

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:28.390
and the rich people are left.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.022
What kind of jobs-- I'm
interested in hearing

00:19:31.022 --> 00:19:31.730
from both of you.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.420
What kind of jobs are coming to
the city, and what kind of jobs

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.320
are leaving the city?

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.250
KENT LARSON: Well,
it depends what city.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.870
I mean, around here
it's tech jobs.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:43.030
KARA MILLER: Are coming.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.571
KENT LARSON: They're coming,
and that's what you mostly find.

00:19:45.571 --> 00:19:49.020
But there are
cities now that are

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.400
focused on clean manufacturing
coming back into the city.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.570
There are tremendous
opportunities for that.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:58.380
I think we had this loss of
those kind of jobs to China.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:04.560
I think technology and increased
standard livings in China,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.110
a lot of things, are
enabling those kind of jobs

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.662
to come back.

00:20:07.662 --> 00:20:09.620
And a lot of those can
come back into the city.

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:14.100
Because rather than
dirty, noisy factories

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.090
that have to be out
of the city, you

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:19.990
have clean, high-tech
manufacturing

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.360
that can come into the city.

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.590
And the urban
agriculture, for us,

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.370
is just what we
picked as an example

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:30.810
of a great clean
manufacturing opportunity.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.810
But there are many
things-- prototyping,

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:38.284
fab labs, small runs
of complex parts,

00:20:38.284 --> 00:20:39.325
technology manufacturing.

00:20:39.325 --> 00:20:41.910
There are all kinds of things
that can come into the city.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:46.070
It takes good public
policy to encourage that.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.120
I don't think
anything that we're

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.640
talking about can be solved
by design alone or technology

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.500
alone or public policy alone.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.540
It requires all three of
those to come together

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.025
in a very creative way.

00:20:58.025 --> 00:20:59.400
NIGEL JACOB: So
one of the things

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.360
we've begun to see over
the last several years

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.630
is a broadening of the
definition of innovation

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.060
as it relates to the economy.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.180
So I think increasingly,
when you look at cities,

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.320
it's not just the additional
high-tech sort or the biotechs.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.600
We're seeing the food industry.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.230
There's a lot of
innovation there.

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:20.730
There's these
culinary accelerators.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.600
There's a lot of different
flavors of innovation

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:29.650
out there, and the question
is-- if you consider the greater

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:32.380
Boston area, you
consider Kendall Square,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.590
Boston's Innovation District,
the Longwood Medical area,

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:36.460
and so on.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.960
Clearly, those are
centers of innovation

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:41.250
that have worked well.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.770
The question is, how do
you learn the lessons,

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:46.280
or extract the lessons,
from those places

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:48.500
and bring them to
the rest of the city?

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.770
And so this is one
of big questions,

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:54.520
I think, facing the concept
of what does a neighborhood

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.450
innovation district look like?

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:01.560
That borrows elements of
what's happened in the seaport,

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.330
but it doesn't encourage just
straight up gentrification.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.830
So what we're not
talking about here

00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:09.850
is how do we bring
start-ups into like Dudley

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.770
Square, or something
necessarily, and force

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:12.510
those people out.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:15.130
But it's how do we encourage
the people in that neighborhood

00:22:15.130 --> 00:22:17.160
to start forming
small businesses that

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.680
are in the innovatation--

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:20.180
KARA MILLER: NIGEL
JACOB: To be part

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.990
of that growth that happens.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.220
I'm going to put you
both on the spot here.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.652
You travel around a lot.

00:22:25.652 --> 00:22:27.110
You've seen a lot
different things.

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:32.210
Tell me one or two of like
the coolest things that you've

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.900
seen in cities in other
parts of the world

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:37.630
or are maybe other parts of
the country that you think,

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:39.060
wow, we show that here.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:40.365
It can be just like a gadget.

00:22:40.365 --> 00:22:44.610
It can be a building, or
it can be broader idea.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.172
Do you have one, Ken?

00:22:46.172 --> 00:22:47.880
KENT LARSON: Well,
there are lot of them.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.669
I love going to be older
cities in Europe, particularly

00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:52.710
the centers, because they
evolved before the car,

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:59.330
and they really are these
compact urban neighborhoods.

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.520
I spend a lot of
time in Helsinki.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.910
And they have a
great project there.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:08.370
It's called Kutsuplus,
I think it is.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:12.050
You can look that up--
its weird Finnish name.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:16.760
All it is, it's a
shuttle-on-demand system.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.140
It's dynamically routed.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:23.110
They're increasingly moving away
from fixed route buses or trams

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:24.950
on track.

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:31.040
It's like a multi-passenger
Uber system in a sense,

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.300
except it's more
sophisticated, because based

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.690
on the calls for
pickup, at your doorstep

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:41.760
and at destination drop off,
it will dynamically route

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.300
the shuttles.

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.940
And it's all based on
advanced algorithms

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.840
and predictive demand modeling.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.780
And I think it points the way
towards very agile, lightweight

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.610
systems providing
better services

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:01.610
and getting away from
heavy, expensive centralized

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:03.200
infrastructure.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.420
NIGEL JACOB: Yeah, one
of my favorite examples

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.490
is Barcelona for
lots of reasons.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:09.650
I mean, there's a ton of
innovation happening there

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.990
and has for quite awhile.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.852
But one of the elements I've
always found fascinating there

00:24:13.852 --> 00:24:15.310
is that they've
essentially created

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:22.720
a program in which technology
developers, startups, companies

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.930
large and small can actually
test their technology

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.252
essentially on the city.

00:24:28.252 --> 00:24:30.210
So when you think about
all the technology that

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:32.418
exists in the streets,
everything from traffic lights

00:24:32.418 --> 00:24:37.150
to the physical roads,
this is all technology.

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:40.360
And what they've done is to
create a process and program

00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.710
in which someone with
a new piece of tech,

00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:44.560
whatever that happens
to be, can install

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.220
into the physical
environment to gather data,

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.890
to improve the people's
experience if the city

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:50.450
and so on.

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.450
And I think it creates this
dynamic environment, where

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:58.380
the city itself evolves in a
way that encourages innovation

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.360
to happen on the city itself.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.470
So it's not just the city
as a backdrop for innovation

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.300
of innovative companies, but
it's also the city literally

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.290
as the laboratory for trying--

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:09.800
KARA MILLER: That's fascinating.

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.133
I'm going to have-- but right
before we go to questions,

00:25:12.133 --> 00:25:13.590
I'm going to have,
Kent, you talk

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.550
about-- partially
because it's cool,

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:21.760
because it's like a giant
LEGO model, this model

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.050
that you've created
at MIT, but it also

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:26.870
shows you something about
how we behave in cities.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:28.425
So talk about what this is.

00:25:28.425 --> 00:25:30.550
KENT LARSON: Well, this a
model of Kendell Square .

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.758
It actually was an animation.

00:25:31.758 --> 00:25:34.450
So you'd see things moving if
we were playing the animation.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:37.790
But one of my
frustrations, coming

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.310
from the world of
architecture and planning,

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:45.760
is the master plans
are developed.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.130
Usually great graphics,
nice architecture, but you

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.322
don't have a clue how they
will actually function.

00:25:50.322 --> 00:25:51.280
How will people behave?

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:53.310
What's the impact on traffic?

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:55.550
Where will people hang out?

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.020
Where are the high crime areas?

00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:00.350
What's the impact on public
health, on and on and on.

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.580
We think that we
can get to a place

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.910
where we can model the
city three dimensionally.

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:08.270
In this case, we're using
augmented reality video

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:14.000
projectors to project simulation
onto that three-dimensional

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.210
model to actually, in a
data-driven, evidence-based

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.960
way, understand
how it will happen,

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:25.700
how all these urban innovations
will impact people in all

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:29.629
the other aspects of life.

00:26:29.629 --> 00:26:31.170
I think we can get
to the point where

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:34.280
we can actually score designs.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:37.730
So I think some of like what's
planned for here in Kendall

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:40.700
Square, I don't think it will
work very well, frankly-- not

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.600
enough housing.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.920
It contribute to the innovation
potential of Kendall Square.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.050
The Volpe Center, with this
huge area in Kendall Square,

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:54.480
that really needs to
be carefully designed.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:58.490
And if it's developed to
the highest and best use

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.490
of the land
financially, it will not

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:06.670
work as fostering and
enabling innovation

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:10.240
in what should be the greatest
innovation hub in the world,

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.400
I think.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:13.500
We need to have these tools.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.910
So we're in the
early phases of this.

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:18.580
But it's all about
understanding the data,

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.620
using that to inform
the interventions,

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.077
and then simulating the
impact with algorithms.

00:27:24.077 --> 00:27:25.910
KARA MILLER: Now, is
what we're seeing here,

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.520
like is the blue people driving?

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.694
KENT LARSON: OK,
this was a study what

00:27:31.694 --> 00:27:34.110
would happen in Kendall Square
if you got rid of all cars,

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:38.140
you got rid of all parking,
you got rid of all turn lanes,

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:41.860
and you went to shared-use
autonomous vehicles.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:46.700
And we've looked at what happens
with private cars, what happens

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:48.700
with autonomous private cars.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.447
Things actually get worse.

00:27:50.447 --> 00:27:51.780
I think that's it's big setback.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.405
KARA MILLER: When you have
your self-driving car.

00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:54.110
KENT LARSON: Oh, it's terrible.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:55.610
KARA MILLER: Not a
good thing, which

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.340
is interesting because so
many people you talk to,

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.100
roboticists, they
all say, it's coming.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.816
And I mean, you kind of see it.

00:28:02.816 --> 00:28:04.440
A lot of cars already
are self-parking,

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.830
where they parallel
park by themselves.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.650
KENT LARSON: It is coming.

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.762
It will have a major impact.

00:28:10.762 --> 00:28:11.970
KARA MILLER: Negative impact.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:13.803
KENT LARSON: It's not--
well, it will either

00:28:13.803 --> 00:28:18.260
be a tremendous negative impact
or a tremendous positive impact

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:21.340
or somewhere in between,
depending how it's implemented.

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.160
Private autonomous
vehicles, I think,

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.350
will kill innovation in cities.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.870
Shared-use autonomous
lightweight electric vehicles

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:31.020
could have a tremendous
positive impact.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.180
KARA MILLER: And is the reason
that the individual autonomous

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.227
vehicles are potentially
negative is because people turn

00:28:38.227 --> 00:28:39.810
them into their
office, like who cares

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:41.810
how long you're on the
road because you can just

00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:42.790
write emails.

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.081
KENT LARSON: That they can
encourage sprawl because you

00:28:45.081 --> 00:28:46.270
can move farther away.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:52.040
It can increase trips
because you might

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.780
take the car into the office.

00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:55.700
It goes home, picks
up your husband,

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:57.620
goes home, picks up your kids.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.900
You go to a fancy
restaurant downtown.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:02.220
You don't want to
pay $40 for parking.

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:04.220
You just send it spinning
around the block.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:04.890
KARA MILLER: Send the car home.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.260
KENT LARSON: And everybody
at the restaurant--

00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:07.110
I mean, on and on.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:09.720
Unless you have really good
public policy in place,

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.310
it will have a big
negative impact.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.220
KARA MILLER: That's fascinating.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.860
It's like a dimension I think
people don't think quite enough

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:15.520
about.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:19.790
So let's take some questions
here if you have them.

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:21.740
There are a couple of mics.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:27.090
And, as I said, if you are
not here, if you're a Googler,

00:29:27.090 --> 00:29:28.650
you can send your
question via Dory.

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.090
If not, you can tweet it.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:32.173
LIZ SCHWAB: So I'll get
us started with a question

00:29:32.173 --> 00:29:33.300
from the Dory.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.200
The tech industry,
including Google,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.920
are often considered partly
to blame for rising income

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.370
inequality in cities.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:43.145
How can we, companies and
cities, help to mitigate this?

00:29:43.145 --> 00:29:44.520
KARA MILLER: Yeah,
either of you.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:46.144
I mean, there's been
a lot of attention

00:29:46.144 --> 00:29:48.837
on this in San Francisco close
to Google's headquarters.

00:29:48.837 --> 00:29:50.420
NIGEL JACOB: I mean,
it's a tough one.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:52.632
I think though,
earlier on, we were

00:29:52.632 --> 00:29:54.090
talking with the
idea of how do you

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:57.660
engage communities in a real
dialogue about what density

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.160
means.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.620
And I think it's the same
thing in this case as well.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.500
When you've got sort
of these companies

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:07.230
that will have a large footprint
in an urban center in terms

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:10.680
of numbers of people
and also the strain

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:13.120
on the transportation
infrastructure,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.410
there are ways for
those companies

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.620
to have conversations with
the community and understand--

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.190
and the way that they also
design those buildings,

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:26.320
so they're not these
hermetically sealed kind

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:29.250
of blocks that are just drop
in the middle of a community,

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:33.500
but encouraging
ground level mixed-use

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.000
and making it open
to the community.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.360
I think there are
effective ways of doing it.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:42.020
And so I think that, honestly,
engagement with the community

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.220
is really the way forward
for those companies.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.720
KARA MILLER: Want
to get in on that?

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.740
KENT LARSON: Well, I think
that's exactly right.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.930
Companies should
be good neighbors.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.810
They should do the right
thing for the community,

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.650
and they have the
resources to do it,

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:59.890
and they should be helped by
the government to do that.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.600
I mean, you increase the
density of all the properties

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.840
in Kendall Square, but you
impose good public policy

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:08.205
so you get the positive
benefit for the people

00:31:08.205 --> 00:31:10.700
that are living there, as
well as the people that would

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.630
like to come into the area.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:16.530
And address traffic
problems with these systems,

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:18.400
et cetera, et cetera.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.930
I think everybody can come
out ahead financially,

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.665
and you can achieve equity.

00:31:25.665 --> 00:31:27.040
KARA MILLER:
Question right here.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:29.920
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm carless
in Cambridge and like it.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.390
But I've noticed
in my area there's

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:33.720
been a lot of development
and discussion about,

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.770
well you have to run
traffic reports as far as,

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.050
if housing needs
to provide parking

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:40.160
to be built and approved.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.010
And there's been flyers
lately or waivers

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:46.770
about not having to anymore if
it's close to public transit.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:50.090
And I understand
that and the growth

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:52.970
and close to public transit
and the intent behind it,

00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:56.510
but I've done some research and
I can't find a straight answer

00:31:56.510 --> 00:31:59.520
on will those people
still be able,

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.470
who agree to live
in those units,

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:05.280
still be able to get
on permit parking?

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.470
And if they can, I feel
like it kind of takes away

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:12.270
this protection to
promote carlessness,

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:14.330
like I am and I love.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.960
And it just kind of
goes by an honor system,

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.024
and it kind of takes away
that safeguard, and I'm sorry.

00:32:20.024 --> 00:32:20.940
I'm being opinionated.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.430
What do you think?

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:26.130
NIGEL JACOB: I think there's a
lot of room here to experiment.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:28.060
I think that we've
often seen parking

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:30.190
as, again, a god-given right.

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.080
And I think there
are ways of treating

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.424
it more like a
community commodity

00:32:34.424 --> 00:32:35.340
that we have to share.

00:32:37.319 --> 00:32:38.860
If you look around
the country, there

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.401
are different attempts
at doing this.

00:32:40.401 --> 00:32:42.400
In some cases,
maybe, do you want

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.410
to pay for a resident
parking permit?

00:32:44.410 --> 00:32:46.040
In some places,
that's admissible.

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.270
In other cases, that's
totally off the table.

00:32:48.270 --> 00:32:51.530
I think that the
biggest challenge

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:54.500
that cities face right now is
that the world is changing.

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:56.840
And so the way that we
think about public policy

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.916
and regulation has
to change as well.

00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:01.790
We need to move out of
this world in which it

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.640
is you come up with a codified
set of policies that exist now,

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:09.471
and that maybe in 30 years,
you'll reexamine them.

00:33:09.471 --> 00:33:11.470
We need to be, especially
around transportation,

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:15.874
where there are known resources
and sort of pros and cons

00:33:15.874 --> 00:33:18.540
that we can experiment with, and
so you can sort of choose zones

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:20.020
where you decide,
well, you know what

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.030
we're going to do over here?

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.696
On Sundays, we're
going to do something.

00:33:22.696 --> 00:33:25.340
Or over here, three
days a week, we

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.574
will make these roads one way.

00:33:28.574 --> 00:33:30.490
There's lots of things
that we can do and then

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:33.074
learn from what works and then
have that drive the discussion.

00:33:33.074 --> 00:33:34.740
KARA MILLER: And New
York has done that.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:37.250
Some said, we're going to
shut down, whatever, Broadway

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.083
or whatever, and we're
going to have a fair.

00:33:39.083 --> 00:33:41.066
And you know and
at certain times

00:33:41.066 --> 00:33:42.690
traffic is rerouted
in a different way.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.370
People's lives are oriented
in a different way.

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:48.010
People can walk down these main
thoroughfare that normally they

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:49.660
wouldn't be able to.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.821
Has that worked, that
kind of experiment?

00:33:51.821 --> 00:33:53.320
NIGEL JACOB: Yeah,
those experiments

00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.580
have been very successful.

00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.660
I mean, sometimes they fail.

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.362
But I think that one of the
advantages of something-- I

00:34:00.362 --> 00:34:01.570
don't know if you can see it.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:05.371
But like, the LEGO
model-- what's it called?

00:34:05.371 --> 00:34:06.370
KENT LARSON: City Scope.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.911
NIGEL JACOB: City Scope-- one
of the advantages of City Scope

00:34:08.911 --> 00:34:12.929
is that it allows a community
to take essentially policy

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:16.260
impact out of the realm
of the guesstimate.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.830
I think it will
do such and such.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:20.380
Whereas this can give people
a much more specific sense,

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.179
and intuitive sense, as far
as if there are these changes,

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:24.830
what can we expect
from the community?

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:27.080
Like, what would it be like
to walk in that community?

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.960
Am I dodging cars, or is it
sort of a leisurely stroll,

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.560
and so on?

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.320
KENT LARSON: So one project
we're really excited about,

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.736
because it gives
us an opportunity

00:34:33.736 --> 00:34:36.760
to work with these
guys in the city,

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:38.659
we have a grant from
the Barr Foundation,

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:41.179
and we will be testing
a process where

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:45.420
you engage with the community
about what their community

00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:46.540
might be in the future.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:49.650
And rather than quibbling
about whether that building's

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:53.400
too tall, you start with, what
kind of community do you want?

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.900
What kind of vibrancy
on the street?

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.150
What kind of people
should live here?

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.980
Do you do want a grocery
store and a pharmacy?

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.736
Well, that might require
an increase in density

00:35:03.736 --> 00:35:05.610
to get the number of
people that will support

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:08.110
that, where they will come in.

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:12.070
But do that just in
terms of quality of life

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:13.500
and the vision
for the community.

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.530
Then you work backwards
into the zoning.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.960
Most of the time, the
zoning ordinance--

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.720
I mean, we're talking about a
really antiquated, primitive,

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.580
crude system.

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.455
NIGEL JACOB: At best.

00:35:25.455 --> 00:35:27.640
KENT LARSON: At best, and
we should throw most of it

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.580
out and start over.

00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:32.350
I think you could develop
a zoning ordinance that's

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.050
more of an algorithm
than prescriptive.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:39.380
It's absolutely crazy that
you have a micro unit that

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:45.220
requires a parking space
to be associated with,

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.390
even if the marketing studies
show that person's not

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:48.497
likely to drive.

00:35:48.497 --> 00:35:50.330
KARA MILLER: Well, then
you realize, I mean,

00:35:50.330 --> 00:35:52.400
if you have a ton of
micro units in a building,

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.040
you very quickly run out
of space if people are just

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:55.835
ringing the block.

00:35:55.835 --> 00:35:58.085
There's only so much space
ringing the block for cars,

00:35:58.085 --> 00:35:59.430
right?

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:03.240
KENT LARSON: Right, so the city
of Cambridge, or any community,

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:08.070
could decide well, OK, if you
are agreeing of signing a lease

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.670
to live in this building,
that does not entitle you

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:13.650
to a parking permit.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.260
KARA MILLER:
Question right here.

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.460
AUDIENCE: I understand
that in December, Boston

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:21.650
was chosen as one of the
100 Resilient Cities Effort

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:23.100
by the Rockefeller Foundation.

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.930
That doesn't necessarily mean
that is resilient, but more

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:29.330
that it has some good
challenges and some people who

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.820
are thinking about that
within the city structure

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.800
and ready to take some actions.

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.030
Could you comment on this
concept of flexibility

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.620
to withstand shocks and so on?

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.370
NIGEL JACOB: Sure, and
that's a great one.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.260
So resilience is
a concept that has

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:46.490
been talked a lot of over the
last several years for cities.

00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:52.179
As everything from climate
change to a flaky stock market,

00:36:52.179 --> 00:36:52.720
making sure--

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:53.940
KARA MILLER: Like snow.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.040
NIGEL JACOB: Yeah, snow
would be a good example.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.530
Ensuring that are cities
are resilient to these kinds

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:01.090
of shocks to the
system is increasingly

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.450
a core part of how we have
to think about our future.

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.780
And so that can mean
many different things.

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:08.200
It's not just about--
at one point, that

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.080
was equated to sustainability.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.260
But there's so much
more that goes into it.

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.650
There's everything from
looking at the distribution

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:21.470
of resources-- how far I'm
sourcing things from-- to also

00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:22.320
issues of equity.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:28.880
A city that has a history of
a lack of equity, like Boston

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.925
does, how do we think about
the people's sense of safety

00:37:33.925 --> 00:37:34.675
in a neighborhood?

00:37:34.675 --> 00:37:37.216
Because that will determine a
great deal as far as if there's

00:37:37.216 --> 00:37:39.270
any shock to the system,
will that neighborhood

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:42.250
dissolve into chaos and looting?

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:44.880
So it's in our
interest to figure out

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:48.980
what are the elements that
go into a safe city that's

00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:52.229
sustainable, that's equitable,
in which people can work

00:37:52.229 --> 00:37:54.770
their way up to the middle class
if you're not there already,

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.085
and then beyond--
all those things.

00:37:57.085 --> 00:37:58.114
It's a hard one.

00:37:58.114 --> 00:38:00.030
But I think that Boston
is going to be-- we're

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:02.150
going to starting
our perspective,

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.150
looking at some of
our historical issues

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.742
around equity.

00:38:04.742 --> 00:38:07.200
KARA MILLER: I don't know if
we have another question right

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.110
now, but if we
don't, I want to go

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:12.630
to, I think it's the fifth
slide, Street Bump, yeah.

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:16.550
So this is a really
cool app that you guys

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:19.900
created in the Office
of New Urban Mechanics.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:23.190
Talk a little bit about,
basically, finding potholes.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.440
NIGEL JACOB: Sure, so one
of the things that we've

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.130
been interested-- so again,
a lot of what we focus on

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:31.180
in New Urban Mechanics
are hacks that

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:35.320
get at your day-to-day
experience of the city.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:40.330
And so if you are
driving, bumpy roads

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:41.930
can have all kinds
of repercussions

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:45.540
on sort of traffic flow and
also people's level of anxiety

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:46.290
and anger.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.320
So it's in our
interest to not have

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:50.020
people experiencing road rage.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:54.150
And so the idea was for
the last several years,

00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:57.790
we've been running another app
that we had great response to.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.970
It's called Citizens
Connect, and it's really

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:03.195
become a primary
channel for residents

00:39:03.195 --> 00:39:04.820
telling the city
things that need to be

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:06.244
fixed-- so potholes and so on.

00:39:06.244 --> 00:39:08.410
But one of the pieces of
feedback we started getting

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.460
was what it was even easier?

00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.410
So right now, the app
is pretty simple to use.

00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:16.010
But essentially, you can't
be driving and doing this.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:18.145
Please don't drive and
use Citizens Connect.

00:39:18.145 --> 00:39:20.020
But you have to stop
and do something, right?

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.900
See the pothole or the graffiti?

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:23.820
Well, what if it was
even easier than that?

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.450
What if there was
something running

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.710
on your phone that was gathering
data from the accelerometers.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:30.840
So that's the idea
behind Street Bump.

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:35.730
It's an app that you choose
to download, obviously.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.760
And when we think about
this piece of technology,

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.380
because we are a
government, there's

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:42.660
a different level
of design thinking

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:43.860
that has to go into it.

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.470
So, for example, having this
thing run in the background,

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.830
when we started talking
to potential users,

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:53.690
they very quickly
got freaked out there

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:55.190
would be this
government app running

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:57.770
in the back on your phone, and
maybe forget that it's there,

00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:58.770
then it pops up one day.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:39:59.311
It's a great.

00:39:59.311 --> 00:40:04.560
Instead, the idea was we
really see this technology

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.910
as a new kind of volunteerism.

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:08.650
We've been calling
it data volunteerism.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.720
And the idea-- or
data donation rather.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.556
And the idea here is that as we
go about our day-to-day lives,

00:40:15.556 --> 00:40:17.430
we're gathering data
all the time, obviously,

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.660
with all the devices that
we have all over our bodies.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.600
And what if you could
use some of that data

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:26.672
to make society better, to
make everyone else's experience

00:40:26.672 --> 00:40:28.380
better So that's the
idea of Street Bump.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.000
It's still in the R&amp;D phase.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.560
We're doing a bunch of sort
of data mining R&amp;D on it.

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.690
But the idea is that
it becomes a new kind

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:43.100
of volunteer channel for people
as they move through the city.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.055
So the idea is that you're
running the app on your phone

00:40:46.055 --> 00:40:50.250
and driving around the
city-- maybe driving less.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.630
And whenever the algorithm
detects something

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:56.080
that needs fixing, it'll
ultimately send that issue

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.246
into the city to be fixed.

00:40:57.246 --> 00:40:58.495
There's an automated back end.

00:40:58.495 --> 00:41:00.310
So that's sort of
the short story.

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:01.685
KARA MILLER: But
it's interesting

00:41:01.685 --> 00:41:04.200
that you tapped into an
accelerometer that's already

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:08.110
in everybody's phone to record
when you dip into the pothole.

00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:12.900
And then you don't send
trucks around looking to fill

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.150
potholes, like where are they?

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:16.510
They already know, kind
of, where they are.

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.190
NIGEL JACOB: The
traditional a way

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:18.790
of doing this, you
should see this.

00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:20.104
You should Google this.

00:41:20.104 --> 00:41:21.770
They have mischaracterized
the industry,

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.570
and I apologize, industry.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:25.760
But essentially, they
were these trucks

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.711
that used to drive around.

00:41:27.711 --> 00:41:29.460
So maybe this is
trailing edge technology,

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.690
but I like this story anyway.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:34.880
Essentially, they would
have this metal bar attached

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.710
to the back of the
truck, and they were

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:39.070
chains connected to that bar.

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:41.950
And as it was driving
over the road,

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:43.550
the chains would
be on the ground.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.740
And so as you're
driving, obviously,

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.060
the bumpier the road,
the more the chains

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.270
would be jumping up and down.

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:52.990
And there was an acoustic
coupler attached to the bar.

00:41:52.990 --> 00:41:56.070
So the noisier that the chains
were, you knew the worse

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.100
the road was.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.716
And I was like, that's clever,
but that seems like old school

00:41:59.716 --> 00:42:00.216
technology.

00:42:03.094 --> 00:42:05.010
And then, of course,
when you do those things,

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:07.060
they're not cheap,
and it gives you

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:10.292
a moment-in-time view as to
what's happening in the city.

00:42:10.292 --> 00:42:11.750
Here we're looking
at how do we get

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:16.220
a much more kind of real-time,
up-to-date, by-the-minute sense

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.979
as to what the quality
of the roads are.

00:42:18.979 --> 00:42:21.270
KARA MILLER: I don't know if
there's any more questions

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:23.839
out here or on the Dory.

00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:24.380
Is there one?

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.305
OK.

00:42:26.305 --> 00:42:28.180
AUDIENCE: So this was
touched on a little bit

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.950
already with Helsinki
and Barcelona,

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.580
but maybe you can
elaborate, if you so choose.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.510
What global cities are on the
cutting-edge of innovation,

00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:38.074
and what are they doing?

00:42:38.074 --> 00:42:39.490
NIGEL JACOB: I
mean, there's lots.

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:41.130
I think any city
that's experiencing

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:44.320
any kind of rapid
urbanization has

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.590
to be working in different ways.

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:49.810
On the high end,
we always end up

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:52.250
talking about a city
like Singapore that

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:55.160
has a great, incredible latitude
in terms of how they think

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:56.890
about the physical
infrastructure

00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:00.740
if the city and the amount of
resources they can put into it.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.390
And so they're doing
incredible things

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.290
around their built environment.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:08.110
The challenge for those of
us in this part of the world

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:11.800
is how do we retrofit
cities to be innovative.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.920
And oftentimes, the tools
that we have at our disposal

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.420
are just very
different, and they're

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:19.990
much more around
policy hacks that

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:24.020
can drive interesting
development projects and so on.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.650
And so certainly, I
would say, New York.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:29.820
The example you gave
is a perfect example.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:32.260
That's not a technology thing,
but it's a positive thing,

00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:34.009
and it can have big
impact in terms of how

00:43:34.009 --> 00:43:36.480
people experience the city.

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.150
I would say cities like Rio are
doing really interesting things

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:42.637
in how they think
about capturing data.

00:43:42.637 --> 00:43:44.970
KARA MILLER: Actually, I was
just going to ask you about

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:47.136
Rio, and I don't know if
Singapore's doing this too,

00:43:47.136 --> 00:43:50.000
but my sense is
in China, in Rio,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.656
and other places that now when
things are built-- and, I mean,

00:43:52.656 --> 00:43:55.030
China's a good example because
they're just like building

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.350
massive cities all
the time from scratch,

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:01.950
which must people aren't--
there putting tons of sensors

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:06.440
throughout, so that you can have
a like master control center

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:08.550
and have a sense of there's
stress on that bridge.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:11.020
Let's go fix it before
the bridge collapses.

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.667
Kent, is that
widespread-- this idea

00:44:13.667 --> 00:44:15.250
of like putting
sensors inside things,

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:18.600
so that you can sit
somewhere in a room

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:21.690
and look at the state
of all these sensors?

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.860
KENT LARSON: That's the
conventional smart cities

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.340
approach-- put a lot of sensors
out, have an early warning

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.480
system, have a control
center, like in a power plant,

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.360
and you can fix the problems.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:36.010
You can optimize traffic.

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:39.300
And that that's all
really good, but I

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.350
don't think it's sufficient.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:45.310
They're looking at optimizing
throughput on cars.

00:44:45.310 --> 00:44:48.750
We'd much rather
get rid of cars.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:51.750
I think that you talk
about the cities that

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.590
are doing a-- Singapore
has be on the list.

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:56.090
I love Hong Kong
and the way they've

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:59.610
managed density and proximity
and diversity and the issues

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.040
that we're looking at.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:05.800
But the most impressive work
that I have experienced,

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.490
I think, are in the older
cities in Northern Europe.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:14.660
It's Copenhagen and Amsterdam
and Helsinki and Hamburg.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:15.780
Et cetera.

00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:18.640
They're sophisticated.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.410
They have good public policy.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:23.280
They have a more of
a socialist attitude

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.210
so they deal with
issues of equity.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:28.040
And they're very
sophisticated with respect

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:30.070
to technology, a very
educated society.

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:33.700
So I think that's where things
will get prototyped and tested

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:36.440
in living labs.

00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.770
But a lot of the ideas
are coming from the US.

00:45:38.770 --> 00:45:40.510
That's where they're
getting tested.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:42.330
And I think,
ultimately, they'll be

00:45:42.330 --> 00:45:46.320
deployed at scale in the
Middle East and in China.

00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.150
They'll probably build
all the technology

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.560
and sell it back to us.

00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:53.400
KARA MILLER: Look
forward to that.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.900
One final question
for you-- so let's

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.765
say you got a few minutes
with President Obama.

00:46:00.765 --> 00:46:03.130
He was like, I don't
have much time.

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:04.630
I have to get my
security briefing.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:08.700
But tell me-- I'm willing
to try to do one thing,

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:14.960
and it can be crazy, out there,
whatever-- one thing to make

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.710
cities more innovative and
dynamic, what would you

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:20.590
like me to do?

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.570
Whoever wants to
start, what would you--

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:23.361
KENT LARSON: Do it.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:28.300
I think I'd focus on housing.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:33.270
I think that's where the
innovation is most needed,

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:37.890
because you won't have the
kind of diversity and equity

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:40.550
in a city unless you
address the housing problem.

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:44.120
And I'm very impressed
with Mayor Walsh's housing

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:44.620
initiative.

00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:47.650
We're working together
on that right now,

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.050
and I think we have
some really good ideas.

00:46:50.050 --> 00:46:52.894
I think everything else
can come along afterwards.

00:46:52.894 --> 00:46:54.310
KARA MILLER: That
means more homes

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:57.390
in the city, denser,
figuring out ways

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:01.247
to make people happily
live in small places

00:47:01.247 --> 00:47:02.080
and a lot of people.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:07.050
KENT LARSON: And there's
an advanced technology play

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:12.770
at multiple dimensions to
make the experience of living

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:18.620
in a small space fantastic,
and transformable elements

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:20.660
so they're almost magical.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.280
And that requires all
kinds of new technologies.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.530
NIGEL JACOB: But that will
work only if the housing is

00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.830
affordable, and middle
class families can actually

00:47:28.830 --> 00:47:30.472
buy those homes or
rent those homes.

00:47:30.472 --> 00:47:32.930
And so thinking not only about
the construction techniques,

00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:36.270
but like the innovative
models around financing

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:38.450
and that sort of thing
will also be important.

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:41.507
I would say, if I had some
advice for the President--

00:47:41.507 --> 00:47:42.965
I don't know if
this is necessarily

00:47:42.965 --> 00:47:45.400
a thing for the
President-- but when

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.320
we talk about
cities in this way,

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:51.680
I think we often do
so with the mindset

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:53.220
that there's
inherent competition,

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:55.580
that the primary force
at work between cities

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.960
is that of competition.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:48:00.230
And I think it is
true a certain degree,

00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:01.990
but it's also very artificial.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.720
And I think that cities have far
more to learn from one another

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:06.970
then we have to sort
of be poaching things

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:07.930
from each other.

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:10.370
And so I think that
all these things

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:12.920
that we've been talking about,
finding more effective ways

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.350
for us to work together and
to collaborate, to share

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:19.410
innovations, to share risks
in different kinds of projects

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:22.646
is a direction that we need our
cities to be moving towards.

00:48:22.646 --> 00:48:24.270
KARA MILLER: So
Pittsburgh's good ideas

00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:27.247
get imported to Boston, and
then they get imported to LA.

00:48:27.247 --> 00:48:28.330
NIGEL JACOB: That's right.

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:30.810
In many cases, one of
the interesting things

00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:34.520
that we've seen, in the
case of immigration,

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:35.930
the models have just changed.

00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:37.840
Where 100 years
ago, people would

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:40.200
leave their country of
origin, come to the New World,

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:45.130
say, and their interaction
with their country of origin

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:46.390
was very limited.

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:48.840
They might send letters back.

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.080
But nowadays, it just doesn't
work that way anymore.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.190
People are often
trinational, binational,

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:58.480
where they are spending part
of their year in one country

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:02.620
and then another in the new
country or in the new city,

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:03.457
in particular.

00:49:03.457 --> 00:49:05.540
And they're even changing
how the access services.

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:07.480
They might access
financial services--

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.940
they might do all their
banking in Sao Paolo,

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:12.390
but they do all their
health services in Boston.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:17.470
And so we need to be looking
to these sort of city networks

00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:21.944
as really the source of where we
can be looking for innovation.

00:49:21.944 --> 00:49:24.110
KENT LARSON: Yeah, building
on that, the other thing

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:31.030
I'd ask Obama to
focus on is right now,

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:33.530
the wheel is being reinvented
all different places

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:35.060
all over the world.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.890
There are mechanisms for
cities to share best practices,

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:41.010
but I think we need
a platform that

00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:49.620
is shared for design
tools that are shared,

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:51.610
solutions that are
shared, that are

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:55.220
linked to three-dimensional
models and databases,

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.190
simulation tools.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:01.100
So when Nigel tries
something in Boston,

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:04.320
they can take the same
idea, and it's not just

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.380
a vague kind of
best practice, it's

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:12.890
actually the solution embodied
in data and algorithms

00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:16.340
and in all the other
things in public policy

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.810
and financial models, et cetera.

00:50:18.810 --> 00:50:22.720
And I think we're
in the dark ages.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.250
We're sharing reports
and scribbles.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:30.180
Let's share real solutions.

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.570
KARA MILLER: Kent Larson
from MIT's Media Lab,

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:36.280
Nigel Jacob from the Office
of New Urban Mechanics at City

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.750
Hall, thank you both so much.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.670
This was a great
discussion, thank you.

00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:44.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.210
And thanks to
Google for hosting.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.070
Thanks to you for coming
out and for your questions.
