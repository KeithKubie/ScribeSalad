00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
When we hear that a couple live 11 time zones apart,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.880
and can afford to come together only once in a long while,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.660
it's natural to offer sympathy for the pain.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.180
We should more fairly envy them for their luck.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.200
Whatever our longings may indicate, it's simply a lot easier to love

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.960
when someone isn't there.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.800
Far from an unfortunate necessity,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.940
living apart should be recognised for what it truly is:

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.100
An advantage.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.540
So much goes right when we live a long way away.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.200
Online, or over the phone, we never assume that the other person

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.080
should be able to read our minds without us ever having explained

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.800
what's actually in them.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.960
We accept that we will have to describe our days

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.000
as well as our desires in words and pictures.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.840
We can't help but do that thing that holds couples together:

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.460
communicate.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.940
We accept that the other can live without us, and therefore

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.080
make the effort to be the sort of people that someone would freely

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.520
choose to be with.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.160
We work at it.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.380
We can benefit from what jealousy otherwise prevents us from admitting

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.740
how much it helps us to feel like desirable, potent people,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.540
to be able to go out and flirt with someone else for a while

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.240
without too many questions being asked.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.220
In other words, how profoundly loyal a whiff of surface disloyalty helps us to be.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.480
A part we appreciate is a strange quirk of our minds, but we only haven't noticed what's missing.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.240
The money we don't have, the weather we long for, the car we don't yet own.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.000
Yet, once anything is securely in our possession, it disappears.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.820
We only see in the sense of notice what isn't there.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.940
The best way to lose ownership of something is to own it.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.740
And the surest way to forget your partner exists maybe to ensure they're beside you every night.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.420
When we're apart, we can sample the gentle suffering of loneliness

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.460
over the intense rage of suffocation.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.700
We never have to find out how much it can tarnish love to be with someone

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.080
who has a different idea of a cutlery drawer or the correct way to suspend a towel.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.400
Too often, when we cohabiting, we locate the difficulty of our relationships

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.480
in a very erroneous place.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.980
We think that it's the wrong person we've mistakenly got together with.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.900
Rather from keeping in mind, that we're with a pretty right person

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.800
trying to do an exceptionally tricky thing:

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.140
share a home.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:47.160
It may in the end, strangely, just be a lot easier to love than to share a bathroom.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.780
Our love stories are suffering from a mistaken cultural hierarchy.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.660
Just as the book is often wrongly thought more important than the essay,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.660
so the live-in relationship is to readily assumed to be superior to the long-range version.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.280
And yet, without ever meaning to do so, the long distance relationship may simply,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.080
despite all its evident challenges, throw up some of the absolutely ideal conditions

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.220
for true love to thrive.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.580
We should be wise to imbibe the few of the lessons life normally only teaches us

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.760
when they're in Sydney, and you're in Vancouver,

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.740
and carefully import them into our lives.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.680
Even with the people unfortunate enough to be right next to us.
