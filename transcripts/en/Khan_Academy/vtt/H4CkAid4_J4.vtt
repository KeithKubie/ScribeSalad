00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.457
- [Instructor] We are asked,

00:00:01.457 --> 00:00:03.927
"which of the following describes a good

00:00:03.927 --> 00:00:07.980
"that is likely to have
the most elastic demand?"

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.150
Choose one answer.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.700
So pause this video and
see if you can answer that.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.300
All right, so the first
choice right over here,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.350
they talk about "a luxury
with many substitutes."

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.390
So we already talked about,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.680
when you're dealing with substitutes,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.012
if there's a lot of substitutes,

00:00:22.012 --> 00:00:25.770
that makes the quantity demanded
very sensitive to price.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.060
So this would make it more elastic

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.770
to have many substitutes.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.120
More elastic.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.590
And then the fact that it's a luxury.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.270
It's not something that people need,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.650
this would also make quantity

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.810
more sensitive to price, generally.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.110
So we would also say more elastic.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.840
So this is looking like a good candidate,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.467
but let's check the other options here.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.670
"A necessity with few substitutes."

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.130
Well, this is the opposite.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.350
If it's a necessity, this
would be more inelastic,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.120
or less elastic.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.200
Less elastic.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.497
And few substitutes,

00:00:58.497 --> 00:01:00.760
if you have a change in
price for that thing,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.350
people say, well, I still
have to buy that thing,

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.783
I can't substitute it with other things.

00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:06.450
This would also be less elastic.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.130
And remember, we're looking
for the most elastic demand,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.117
so we can rule this one out.

00:01:11.117 --> 00:01:14.200
"A broadly defined good such as food."

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.010
Well, we just talked about that.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.800
If we're talking about food,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.330
and there's a price change in food,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.804
well, we need food,

00:01:21.804 --> 00:01:25.470
so our quantity demanded
might, would not likely change,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.100
or our percent change in quantity

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.150
would not likely be that much.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.630
This would be fairly inelastic.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.977
Rule that one out.

00:01:32.977 --> 00:01:36.860
"Goods that make up a
small share of the budget."

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.240
Well, this goes back to
that example with bubblegum.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.300
If bubblegum goes from
25 cents to 30 cents,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.250
we might not care so much.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.450
Versus if a car goes
from $25,000 to $30,000.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.335
So the small things that we might not care

00:01:50.335 --> 00:01:52.550
about price changes so much,

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.450
if we don't care so much
about price changes,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.400
that would imply less elasticity,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.557
so that definitely would not
be the most elastic demand.

00:01:59.557 --> 00:02:01.297
"Goods that have to be bought

00:02:01.297 --> 00:02:03.810
"under a short time constraint."

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.400
Well, a good example is that it's raining

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.570
and people need umbrellas right now,

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.010
in, you know, the next five, 10 minutes,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.710
and there, they wouldn't necessarily

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.700
be so sensitive to price,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.090
so this is going to be less elastic,

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.250
and so once again, we would rule this out.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.460
If we had a long time frame,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.930
well, then people might be able

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.068
to shop around for substitutes

00:02:26.068 --> 00:02:28.930
and then things might get
a little bit more elastic.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.090
They would be more sensitive to price.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.683
So we definitely like, in
this scenario, choice A.
