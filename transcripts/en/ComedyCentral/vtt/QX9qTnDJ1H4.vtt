00:00:01.168 --> 00:00:02.903
There's been a lot of talk
lately about the one percent,

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:05.506
a group of privileged elites
who control a huge chunk

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:06.907
of the nation's wealth.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.375
But America's
a very big country,

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:11.278
and way at the other end
of the economic spectrum

00:00:11.311 --> 00:00:14.314
are the shoeless mountain folk
who are skeptical of plumbing

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:17.384
and worship the sun and moon
as powerful deities.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:21.054
Well, an eye opening
new CNN poll hammers home

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:23.690
just how staggeringly uninformed
Americans can be.

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:26.126
Reporter Raffi Williams
noted on Twitter that,

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.862
when asked their opinions
on Democrats and Republicans,

00:00:28.896 --> 00:00:33.500
one percent of Americans
had never heard of either party.

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.202
-(laughter) -Once percent.
One percent of Americans.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.470
-U.S.A.!
-RHODES: Yeah.

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:39.873
ALL (chanting):
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:42.876
What is that?
What are things?

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.845
-What are things?
-(laughter)

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.446
-Shouting words.
-HARDWICK: Shouting things.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.815
So, you do a little quick math,
and you go, "One percent.

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.584
Well, it's not that crazy,
one percent."

00:00:50.617 --> 00:00:52.419
It's roughly 2.4 million people

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:57.057
who have never heard
of either political party!

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.592
But they know the whole
In-N-Out secret menu.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:00:59.993
-HARDWICK: Oh, yeah,
they know... -Nail it.

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:01.995
-They know what animal style is.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:03.764
Give me a double-double
and a double bill.

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:05.365
-(applause and cheering)
-They know protein style.

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.934
-America!
-HARDWICK: Yeah.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.436
But it also means that there are
two and a half million Americans

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.138
being raised or held captive

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.440
in dirt-floored basements
right now,

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.976
who still somehow manage
to respond to political polls.

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.711
Do you see the irony?

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.112
'Cause they don't know
the parties,

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.314
but they'll respond
to the polls.

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:22.015
So, comedians,
what are the top election issues

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.551
for this other one percent?

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:27.955
-Kevin. -We got to get these
damn raccoons out of here!

00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:29.156
-(applause and cheering)
-Yeah, wherever they are,

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.357
just get the raccoons out.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.559
-Flula.
-A constitutional amendment

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:35.028
that declares
that eating ain't cheating.

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:36.697
(laughter)

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.867
-(applause and cheering)
-HARDWICK: Well... yes. -Nice.

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:46.106
Erica Rhodes.

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.575
I ain't got
no election problems.

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.675
-I get hard just fine.
-HARDWICK: Yeah, all right.
