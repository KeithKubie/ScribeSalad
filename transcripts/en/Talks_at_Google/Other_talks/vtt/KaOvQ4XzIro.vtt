00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.240
&gt;&gt;Hertz here to speak to us, as part of our
2010 physically fit initiative.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.280
Uh, Fred is a well known bay area lawyer who
specializes in legal and financial issues

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.910
pertaining to same sex and unmarried straight
couples.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.349
He has appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show,
the Today show, NPR's talk of a nation.

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.439
He's regularly quoted as an expert in these
regards.

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:33.210
In publications like the New York Times, Harpers
Magazine, the New York Observer, the Advocate,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.860
Out magazine and other publications.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.380
He's a graduate of the University of California
Berkeley school of Law and has been practicing

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.310
in the Bay area in Oakland since 1990.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.050
Fred: No, 1982

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.530
&gt;&gt;1982. All right. Good to know.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.380
He is the author and co-author of several
books.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.830
And please join me in wel -- in welcoming
him to Google.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:55.830
Thanks.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.180
[Applause]

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.490
Fred: Thank you so much.
It's, it's a real pleasure to work at a place

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:11.540
that is gay friendly and unmarried friendly
and non-traditional family trendy.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.300
I have to say that I'm a regular Googler and
my last little, little episode, I was commenting

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.830
on the prop 8 trial about same sex marriage.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.190
And about 2 weeks ago, just 'cause I thought
I was gonna get a question, I googled "Is

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.930
Vaughn Walker gay?"

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.090
He's the judge who's handling the prop 8 case,
and I think accurately so.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.510
There were only 2 entries, 'cause up until
two weeks ago, there only were 2 blog sites

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.549
that commented on it.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:50.180
And then, obviously your machines have been
hard at work because a week later when a San

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.570
Francisco Chronicle article outed the judge,
and I asked the same question, I think there

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.060
were like 12,000 entries, over a 1 week period.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.210
So, just thought I'd let you know that your
work helps many of us out there.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.660
I'm the author, or co-author of three NOLO
press books.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.900
NOLO is a publishing company that's been around
for 38 years, dedicated to teaching people

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.349
how to handle legal issues themselves.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.930
And, we have a legal guide for lesbian and
gay couples that this year is in its 30th

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.010
anniversary, 15th edition.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.480
It's been continuously published for now 30
years.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.000
We also have a book for straight unmarried
couples called Living Together: A Legal Guide

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.540
for Unmarried Couples.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.360
And then my newest book, which is called Making
It Legal, is all about all the issues just

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.319
of marriage, domestic partnership and civil
union.

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.640
And we have that one for sale here at a discount
of $20.00, autographed copy and also some

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.310
coupons if you want to order it.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.180
The other books are available at the NOLO.com
website.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.379
So, what I wanna talk about in about 35-40
minutes are the issues of being unmarried

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:15.220
or domestically partnered, or married both
for opposite sex and same sex couples.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.290
And talk about the financial issues, the legal
issues and a little bit on the political issues.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.700
Now one of the reasons that this fits into
a financial fitness talk is that one of the

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.269
core issues is, about marriage is about money.

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.239
And what I try to, try to explain to people
all the time is that I'm not talking about

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.319
the right to marry.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.050
That's a political cause that I strongly favor.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.440
What I'm talking about is the choice to marry.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.349
Whether you are straight and have the right
to marry, or whether you're in a gay or lesbian

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:57.269
relationship and you have the right to marriage
equivalent, or marriage in California.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:05.200
And while people say it's not romantic, in
fact the major consequence of marriage or

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.580
state registration is financial.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.409
And when someone said to me recently, "Well
that's not very romantic.",

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:14.430
I said, "Wait a second.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.100
Isn't taking care of the person you love romantic?

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:27.470
Isn't making sure that the person you love
has a house if you should die romantic?

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:36.020
And isn't setting financial limits so that
you don't break up because of money conflicts

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.310
romantic?"

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:44.070
I actually think that's part of romance is
caretaking and issues of money and property

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.360
are about caretaking.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.100
OK, so, oh and the other thing which Jeff
and I were talking about earlier today is

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.570
that one of the most interesting studies that
have come out around marriage is that married

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.440
people tend to save more.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.770
Now, there's always a causation problem here.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.350
Maybe it's just these boring conventional
savers who tend to get married.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.300
You know, and these unmarried people are just
risk takers, but we don't think so.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.620
We think it's actually that when you have
someone else who you are responsible for,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.310
or who can mess up your life, you actually
pay attention to them in a different way.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.199
So, I was noticing one of the signs from the
financial fitness talks about credit score.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:42.050
Well if your spending habits are going to
wreck my credit score, I may pay more attention

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.210
to your spending habits than I would otherwise.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:54.040
Or if your credit card debt is gonna cause
me to lose our house, I may start caring more

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.740
about your credit card debt.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.919
I jokingly said that now that gay couples
can enter into marriage or its equivalent,

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.990
people are gonna start asking a different
set of questions when they meet somebody in

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.830
a bar, you know.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.720
I don't think gay couples were, gay people
when they were cruising in a bar were asking

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.389
about credit scores or bankruptcy history
the way straight couples getting -- straight

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.830
people getting married, or their mothers might
ask.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.520
So, first, what are the issues particular
to straight unmarried couples?

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.900
So here the real issue is on the whole, do
you want to marry or not?

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:36.330
And what's important to know is that as an
unmarried couple, and this

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:44.240
is true for gay or straight, you have no financial
merging unless you do it voluntarily by owning

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.389
a house together or buying a car together
or taking out a loan together.

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:53.289
There is something which is called palimony
or Marvin claims.

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:59.500
And that comes out of a case from 1978 where
Lee Marvin's girlfriend sued him.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.770
What's great is this is, this is one of these
little legal insider things.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:08.910
Why is it that the lead case about unmarried
couples is called Marvin vs. Marvin?

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:12.699
It's because she wanted people to think she
was married to him, so she took his last name

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:14.729
even though they never married.

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:21.520
But, in that case, the court said that in
California, a partner can sue his or her girlfriend

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:29.660
or boyfriend or ex if they can prove a contract,
even oral, or other forms of equitable claims.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:36.850
But what's important, the take away for this
is, it is a ticket to a courthouse, but it

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.449
is not a winning ticket.

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:48.169
The rules for unmarried couples are so stringent
in terms of actually winning a claim that

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:51.229
almost no claimants ever win.

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:56.920
So what's important to know as an unmarried
straight couple is you own what's in your

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.920
name.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.060
Your boyfriend or girlfriend owns what is
in his or her name.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:07.130
If you do co-own a property, it's gonna be
presumed 50-50.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:11.460
And you can make a claim based on an oral
agreement, but don't count on it; you need

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:13.020
a written agreement.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:20.360
And in the living together book, we have sample
ingredients -- sample, sample agreements on

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.940
owning a house together, owning a car together.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:29.740
And the other piece to know is that again,
unless there's an agreement, and presumably

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:37.379
a written agreement, in an unmarried couple
situation, neither will owe alimony or spousal

00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:41.089
support to his or her ex upon breakup.

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:47.480
So, when you're thinking about your future,
when you're thinking about your retirement,

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.199
if you are an unmarried couple, you really
have to think about it as an individual.

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:56.249
And the fact that you have loved someone,
cared for them and maybe even helped them

00:08:56.249 --> 00:09:02.199
in their career is not going to get you anything
if you break up later on.

00:09:02.199 --> 00:09:07.970
So you have to think about your own retirement,
your own savings, and your own debts.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:16.249
Now there are a few places that allow unmarried
straight couples to register as domestic partners.

00:09:16.249 --> 00:09:18.709
But in general it doesn't get you any benefits.

00:09:18.709 --> 00:09:24.579
Unless your particular employer or city gives
you benefits.

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:31.449
So, for example, Google as I understand it
does give benefits to unmarried straight couples.

00:09:31.449 --> 00:09:35.279
So as long as you're at Google, you'll get
that benefit.

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:42.470
But if your boyfriend works down the block
at Hewlett Packard, you will not have a share

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:50.579
of his stock options just because you're a
Google domestic partner and getting health

00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:54.949
insurance benefits.
What's interesting is that the state law that

00:09:54.949 --> 00:10:02.619
allows what we call marriage equivalent does
allow older straight couples to register.

00:10:02.619 --> 00:10:06.230
This is one of these anomalies where people
like, whoa, w-w-wait.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:11.331
Why is it that in order to state register
you either have to be same sex or if you're

00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:16.569
opposite sex, you can register if you're over
the age 62.

00:10:16.569 --> 00:10:19.250
Anybody want -- there's nobody, is there,
probably nobody in this room over the age

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:20.250
of 62.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:22.779
But does anybody know why there's that distinction?

00:10:22.779 --> 00:10:23.879
&gt;&gt; Social Security.

00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:25.721
Fred: And what is it about Social Security?

00:10:25.721 --> 00:10:28.050
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]

00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:35.819
Fred: But it's specifically to preserve your
widowed benefits or divorce benefits.

00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:39.889
There's one of the rules, one of the benefits
of marriage -- you all are much too young

00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:42.940
to worry about this -- is that if you're the
 …

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.940
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.660
Fred: [Chuckles] you look young.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:51.389
If you are the low earner in your family -- the
housewife traditionally -- and your husband

00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:57.049
predeceases you, one of the Social Security
rules is you can take your husband's Social

00:10:57.049 --> 00:10:58.049
Security.

00:10:58.049 --> 00:11:02.839
The idea is if you're the stay-at-home mom
or dad and your husband dies, you're counting

00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:09.049
on his Social Security as a retired couple,
you can elect to take your spouse's Social

00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:10.049
Security.

00:11:10.049 --> 00:11:12.519
You can't take both, but you can take the
high earner's.

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:16.610
Well, if you remarry, you lose that privilege.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:22.209
So the reason why older couples were grant
 -- were allowed in to state register is so

00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:26.619
they could get some of the state benefits
of domestic partnership, and not lose their

00:11:26.619 --> 00:11:31.089
widow or divorcee benefits under Social Security.

00:11:31.089 --> 00:11:34.629
It's a very small crowd, not many people do
it.

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:40.939
OK, so the key issues again for straight couples
are: Are we going to marry or not?

00:11:40.939 --> 00:11:47.420
The other thing to know, and this is true
for both gay couples -- or will be true whenever

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.609
there's federal recognition even though there
isn't now -- is that the tax treatment is

00:11:52.609 --> 00:11:54.149
very, very different.

00:11:54.149 --> 00:11:58.540
Now, what's important to know, and I'll, I'll
just bring this up 'cause it comes up in the

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:04.889
decision making of straight unmarried couples
is that on the whole, there's a tax penalty

00:12:04.889 --> 00:12:10.400
while you're together and a tax benefit when
you die or break up.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.619
I find this very interesting.

00:12:12.619 --> 00:12:15.509
We think we have this pro marriage policy.

00:12:15.509 --> 00:12:21.269
Actually the way in which straight couples
that are married really benefit is when they

00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:22.939
get divorced.

00:12:22.939 --> 00:12:24.779
They actually pay a penalty while they're
married.

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:26.249
That's kind of interesting.

00:12:26.249 --> 00:12:32.009
And the reason there is this penalty is that
if you are married, your incomes generally

00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:37.600
are combined and for federal purposes, it
can push you into a higher tax bracket 'cause

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:45.040
you're part of a $300,000 a year couple as
opposed to if one person is making 250 and

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.670
the other person is making 50.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:50.309
That $50,000 earner's gonna be in a low tax
bracket.

00:12:50.309 --> 00:12:58.609
But once he becomes part of a $300,000 couple,
they're each in the $150,000 tax bracket and

00:12:58.609 --> 00:13:00.790
higher federal taxes will result.

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.730
It's not so much an issue on the state of
California taxes because there's not the bracket

00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:08.059
shift like there is for federal.

00:13:08.059 --> 00:13:15.009
On the other hand, should you go through a
divorce or have a death, the survivor or the

00:13:15.009 --> 00:13:23.040
divorcee will be able to get benefits whether
it's spousal support or inheritance tax free.

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.749
Whereas if you're not in a federally recognized
marriage, you will start suffering some serious

00:13:28.749 --> 00:13:31.579
tax problems upon divorce.

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:39.280
So ironically, on the whole, what I ask when
people ask me from a tax point of view, should

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:47.639
I marry, I will say, "Yes you should, because
it will come in really handy if you get divorced."

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:51.639
I don't like to say when you get divorced,
people don't like to hear people talk like

00:13:51.639 --> 00:13:52.639
that.

00:13:52.639 --> 00:13:53.639
So I say, "If you get divorced."

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:57.579
I can say when you die, because people accept
that.

00:13:57.579 --> 00:14:00.799
So, that's the core issue for unmarried couples.

00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:03.189
Oh and one last thing about unmarried couples.

00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:08.369
One of the things I work with a lot is the
transition for unmarried to married.

00:14:08.369 --> 00:14:13.509
And one of the complexities -- and this is
especially true in California, but it's also

00:14:13.509 --> 00:14:22.529
true in Washington State -- that if you get
married, your premarital life is run, is controlled

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:29.569
by non-marital law and you post-marital life
is controlled by marital law.

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:34.480
Which can lead to a lot of confusion if there's
subsequently a divorce.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:41.939
So if you save money for 10 years unmarried
and then get married, the unmarried savings

00:14:41.939 --> 00:14:46.879
will not be shared, the marital, post marital
savings will be shared.

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:52.859
If you're ten years unmarried, and ten years
married, you will be entitled to alimony based

00:14:52.859 --> 00:14:54.459
on the ten years of marriage.

00:14:54.459 --> 00:14:58.639
But if you wanted to make a claim for the
earlier ten years, you would have to make

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.509
it under a palimony claim.

00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:09.350
And so for couples that have bought houses,
or earned money, or received stock options,

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.569
the date of marriage can have a huge effect.

00:15:12.569 --> 00:15:20.110
Now this is having a big issue for gay couples
who now have the right to enter the marital

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:25.769
system, but it's an issue for straight couples
who may choose to marry at a certain time

00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:26.769
or not.

00:15:26.769 --> 00:15:33.040
And it can have very significant consequences
in the event of a dissolution or death.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:37.209
OK, so that's the opposite sex couples specialty
section.

00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:43.359
Now let me talk about some of the issues that
are particular for same sex couples.

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:52.239
Now, California, the best way I can describe
it is that there is this room of state marriage.

00:15:52.239 --> 00:15:57.919
And it's a room that gay couples weren't allowed
to enter at all until 2005.

00:15:57.919 --> 00:16:03.609
And starting in 2005, same sex couples who
either had previously state registered, or

00:16:03.609 --> 00:16:11.029
newly state registered could enter the room
of marriage via domestic partnership.

00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:15.079
And once they got into that room, it was the
same as being married.

00:16:15.079 --> 00:16:21.549
Not the same social dignity, not the same
cultural legitimacy, but in terms of the technical

00:16:21.549 --> 00:16:24.609
legal rights, they are the same.

00:16:24.609 --> 00:16:28.850
Then to go through the last 5 years in about
2 minutes.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:36.790
We had the marriage door open in June of 2008.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:40.559
And then couples could enter the marriage
room through the front door of marriage.

00:16:40.559 --> 00:16:45.079
And, in fact, there was this little legal
fiction which is that if they had entered

00:16:45.079 --> 00:16:51.069
in the domestic partnership door, they could
actually momentarily step out and reenter

00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:52.069
through the marriage door.

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:59.850
And end up in the same room they were in before.
And they could also get married in Massachusetts

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:01.790
and other places and it would be honored.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:09.600
And then within about 5 months, the marriage
door closed, that was Proposition 8.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.640
And again what's important is you could still
enter through the back door, but not the front

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.640
door.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.640
There's a lot of interesting controversy.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:24.189
I'm the, I'm the like, I'm not, I'm not so
interested in the social dignity issues as

00:17:24.189 --> 00:17:27.980
I am in the legal technicalities because that's
my specialty.

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:32.240
I once said in a group of people, "I don't
care if I sit in the back of the bus as long

00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.870
as the bus takes me where I'm going."

00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.019
It was not well received.

00:17:37.019 --> 00:17:44.649
But what's -- and the reason I say that even
humorously is to say, "You do need to understand

00:17:44.649 --> 00:17:49.230
that domestic partnership does take you into
the marriage room."

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.909
And I say that also because there are a lot
of same sex couples who think because it is

00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:58.909
not given the social and cultural dignity,
it doesn't have the legal consequences.

00:17:58.909 --> 00:18:04.539
And let me just say, if you're the high earner
who's breaking up with your boyfriend who

00:18:04.539 --> 00:18:11.509
now is claiming half of your net worth, you
will learn what it means to be married quite

00:18:11.509 --> 00:18:12.539
quickly.

00:18:12.539 --> 00:18:17.340
So then, now there have been several challenges
to proposition 8.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.710
Unfortunately the California Supreme Court,
which just a year earlier had said there was

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:27.290
constitutional right to marry, a year later
kind of forgot about what they had said and

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:32.179
said, "Well, domestic partnership is really
enough, and it's ok if the voters take it

00:18:32.179 --> 00:18:33.179
away."

00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:37.799
I don't think that was a well reasoned decision,
I think it was a political cop-out.

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:42.620
And now there are 2 avenues of attempts to
undo proposition 8.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:47.370
There is going to be a proposition on the
ballot, but it will not be on in 2010.

00:18:47.370 --> 00:18:51.980
I think it's now close enough to the deadline
that I can say that the people who are advocating

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.760
to get it back on the ballot by 2010 have
not gotten enough signatures to get on the

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:57.760
ballot.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760
But it will be on in 2012.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:03.809
And then there is the proposition 8 federal
case which has been fascinating because it's

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:10.309
an attempt to use the federal constitution
to undo proposition 8.

00:19:10.309 --> 00:19:14.500
And under constitutional law, if there can
be greater protections under federal law,

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.889
they would trump the state rule.

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:20.899
Let me say, there's been a lot of talk of,
"Oh my god this is gonna end up in the US

00:19:20.899 --> 00:19:22.789
Supreme Court and it's gonna be doomed."

00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:26.570
I don't think it's ever gonna get to the US
Supreme Court.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:31.120
And I'll say this and I, you know, I may be
wrong, I've been wrong on a lot of these issues

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.120
before.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:37.389
But I think in this instance, if prop 8 is
thrown out, I don't think it's going to be

00:19:37.389 --> 00:19:42.880
because the court finds that there is a national
federal right to same sex marriage in every

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.299
state of the country.

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:49.940
I think what's more likely they would say
is that because California courts legalized

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:56.060
same sex marriage, it was wrong even under
the federal constitution for the voters to

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.230
take it away.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:03.220
And if the court rules that narrowly, then
it would only be a state issue, it would be

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:08.799
ruled on by the 9th circuit, and the US Supreme
Court wouldn't have to take the case.

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:14.690
The other is if by the time it gets to the
Supreme Court, proposition 8 has been overturned

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:19.379
in 2012 by the voters hopefully, there'll
be nothing for the court to rule on.

00:20:19.379 --> 00:20:22.899
So I actually predict it won't get to the
US Supreme Court.

00:20:22.899 --> 00:20:24.370
We'll see in a couple of years.

00:20:24.370 --> 00:20:30.269
So the last piece about the prop 8 problem
had to do with, well what does that mean for

00:20:30.269 --> 00:20:33.210
people who marry out of state?

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:34.210
Gay couples.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:39.950
So, the prop 8 case that the Supreme Court
[Inaudible] people are ruled on did not issue

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:40.960
a ruling on this issue.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:44.110
It was very maddening to people like me who
are trying to advise clients.

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:48.289
They actually said in a footnote, we're not
ruling on it 'cause nobody asked us to.

00:20:48.289 --> 00:20:51.169
Not quite true, but that was the cop-out that
they took.

00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:56.570
Well fortunately the California state legislature
and Mark Leno from the state senate got a

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:58.760
bill passed which says two things.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:06.549
One is that couples that married out of state
or out of country before prop 8 passed, will

00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:08.700
be considered married.

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:15.200
And couples that marry out of state or out
of country after prop 8 passed will have all

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.639
the rights and duties of marriage, but not
its designation.

00:21:19.639 --> 00:21:23.110
This is one of these pieces of legislation

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.799
Like why didn't they call me ahead of time?

00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:28.320
Because I know what it does mean.

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.241
It means that if you choose to go to Iowa
or New Hampshire or Canada and get married

00:21:34.241 --> 00:21:39.269
 -- whenever there is a rule that applies
to married people, it will apply to you.

00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:41.230
You have to go through divorce court.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:43.659
You're entitled to inherit if there's not
a will.

00:21:43.659 --> 00:21:44.970
You have to pay alimony.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:49.059
All those rights and duties count, but not
its designation.

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:52.940
I'm obsessed like – well, what do you put
on the deed to your house?

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:57.530
Bill and Steve, who got married in Massachusetts
[Audience Laughs] and have all the rights

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:02.741
and duties of marriage, but not its designation,
as community property.

00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:07.549
I mean, what do you put on -- when the bank,
when you apply for a loan and it says are

00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:13.740
you married, single, -- I don't think they
have an "other" form.

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.159
What I said is, "Write it all out and let
Bank of America worry about it."

00:22:18.159 --> 00:22:20.529
But its gonna be very confusing.

00:22:20.529 --> 00:22:23.710
My fav -- There's all these discussions going
on -- what are you gonna call this?

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:30.049
For those of you who are literary minded,
if you remember Henry James was a 19th century

00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:31.049
novelist.

00:22:31.049 --> 00:22:34.009
He wrote a lot about these closeted lesbians
in Boston.

00:22:34.009 --> 00:22:37.549
And they got to use the term "Boston marriages".

00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:41.009
So I like the idea of calling who entered
into a Boston marriage.

00:22:41.009 --> 00:22:45.830
Somebody else suggested SLAM, Something like
a Marriage.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.830
[Laughter]

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.649
Fred: You know, you could come up with a name.

00:22:50.649 --> 00:22:53.789
But you can now do that.

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:58.820
So in California, if you're a gay couple and
you want the rights and duties of marriage,

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:03.799
you can either state register, or you can
go out of state and marry.

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:08.110
We're actually encouraging people to state
register even if they go out of state and

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:12.230
marry so that they will have clarity in the
state of California.

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:14.409
It's a little clearer for property and other
issues.

00:23:14.409 --> 00:23:17.440
Now, just to give an update on other states.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:26.179
Right now, we have full same sex marriage
in Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts,

00:23:26.179 --> 00:23:31.191
Iowa, and within a month we will probably
have Washington D.C.

00:23:31.191 --> 00:23:35.970
The thing that's confusing about Washington
D.C. is that they did pass marriage, but it

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:42.529
has to go through a 30 day congressional hold
where anybody in Congress can try to overturn

00:23:42.529 --> 00:23:43.529
it.

00:23:43.529 --> 00:23:48.070
We don't anticipate there will be any, and
what's important to know is it's 30 congressional

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.370
days.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.889
And actually Congress doesn't actually get
together all that often.

00:23:52.889 --> 00:23:59.129
So even though it passed December 12th, they
have -- Congress has not met for 30 days yet.

00:23:59.129 --> 00:24:01.840
It's anticipated to be about March 5th.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.130
So when that happens, then that passes and
there's no congressional override, then there'll

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.889
be marriage in Washington D.C., which is I
think kind of cool.

00:24:09.889 --> 00:24:14.771
You've got Washington D.C. where the federal
government is; you've got Iowa, actually a

00:24:14.771 --> 00:24:20.450
very progressive state; you've got New Hampshire
which is not thought of as a very progressive

00:24:20.450 --> 00:24:22.499
state -- having marriage.

00:24:22.499 --> 00:24:24.340
We then have marriage equivalent.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:29.080
And we had a lot of struggles within the book
about how to call these different states.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:34.200
So, I've now called it marriage, marriage
equivalent and marriage lite.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.669
And we have this in the chart in the book.

00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:40.870
The marriage equivalence are the states where
you can enter the room of marriage, but not

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.809
its designation.

00:24:42.809 --> 00:24:46.350
It's domestic partnership on the West Coast
or civil union on the East Coast.

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:50.809
And those states are Washington State, Oregon,
California and Nevada.

00:24:50.809 --> 00:24:58.740
Good to know you can rush off to Las Vegas
and have a domestic partnership commitment

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:01.499
ceremony in the Elvis Chapel.

00:25:01.499 --> 00:25:07.159
And then it also is New Jersey on the East
Coast and now Maine which had marriage but

00:25:07.159 --> 00:25:11.980
then was taken away by a vote.
Washington D.C. was going to have -- I mean

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:17.519
Washington State, excuse me -- was going to
have marriage, but it got pushed out by the

00:25:17.519 --> 00:25:18.519
ballot.

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:21.710
But the marriage equivalent did survive.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.659
So those are the states that have the marriage
equivalence.

00:25:25.659 --> 00:25:27.280
New York is a really interesting state.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:34.999
New York does not offer marriage or domestic
partnership, but they, for, on the whole recognize

00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:37.549
marriages or partnerships from out of state.

00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:40.460
The one area where they don't is around taxation.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.200
They still tax people single because that's
something that has to be changed by statute.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:50.950
But as to property and kids, New York is pretty
much a recognition state.

00:25:50.950 --> 00:26:00.159
Let me also just say that the other 37 or
so states do not recognize marriage or domestic

00:26:00.159 --> 00:26:01.159
partnership.

00:26:01.159 --> 00:26:04.240
There are a few states, New Mexico, Maryland
that are kind of iffy.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:10.259
The reason why this is so important is that
if you live in one of those 37 states, or

00:26:10.259 --> 00:26:17.230
you move to one of those states, chances are
at the moment if you're an opposite sex couple,

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.799
you're unmarried; you're still unmarried.

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:24.190
If you're a same sex couple, your marriage
or domestic partnership will not be recognized.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:29.399
And that's very important in terms of property
or estates or powers of attorney if you should

00:26:29.399 --> 00:26:33.049
live, move to a non-recognition state.

00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:39.249
OK, so what are the key financial and legal
issues that couples should be thinking about

00:26:39.249 --> 00:26:41.990
when deciding whether to enter the room of
marriage.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:47.500
So obviously there's a lot of emotional and
social issues of -- are you a couple?

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.279
Are you recognized by your family?

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:52.279
Are you recognized by your church?

00:26:52.279 --> 00:26:58.649
I completely honor the importance of those
issues; it's just not my territory.

00:26:58.649 --> 00:27:05.230
So, I want to just park those out there, acknowledge
them, and go talk about the more concrete

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:10.950
issues and less spiritual issues of money,
property, deaths and the like.

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:16.480
So, what's important to know is that marriage
creates an economic unit.

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:24.950
Being married means you are in an economic
partnership with your spouse.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:30.389
And, when they go up, go out every day and
as I said -- mentioned in one of the books,

00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:35.470
one goes to the office, and the other goes
to the mall.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:39.889
They are each doing it on behalf of this economic
partnership.

00:27:39.889 --> 00:27:47.549
And so that income that was earned at the
office and that debt that was racked up at

00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:49.879
the mall are shared.

00:27:49.879 --> 00:27:53.879
And they are shared at the moment they are
incurred.

00:27:53.879 --> 00:28:01.869
So for example if you're the non-working spouse,
you don't have to thank your husband or wife

00:28:01.869 --> 00:28:08.820
for giving you half of his earnings; it actually
is half yours the minute it's earned.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:14.570
And you don't have to ask your spouse to pay
half of your credit card debt, 'cause it was

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.490
his the minute it was incurred.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:24.230
The concept -- and I actually find it kind
of, both appealing and problematic -- is that

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:25.909
you're a team.

00:28:25.909 --> 00:28:32.299
And the team goes out every day and hunts,
or gathers or spends as the case may be.

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:34.889
And you do it as a team.

00:28:34.889 --> 00:28:39.889
And the whole concept of it, obviously if
you think about it historically, it was actually

00:28:39.889 --> 00:28:44.559
designed to protect the non-working partner,
generally the woman.

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:50.679
So she didn't have to ask her husband for
money; it was half hers the day it was earned.

00:28:50.679 --> 00:28:55.789
Now, what I just described is the rule in
what's called the community property states

00:28:55.789 --> 00:29:01.570
which are basically the states that come from
Mexican or Spanish heritage.

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:05.890
Wisconsin actually adopted it, but all the
other community property states are in the

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:07.220
Western United States.

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:12.200
And this is actually the Spanish rule of marriage
that got passed to Mexico that got passed

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.200
to California.

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.369
And it's called community property.

00:29:15.369 --> 00:29:22.100
And it says you form a community or a partnership
when you marry, and it's all a team.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:29.369
If you live in the other 35 or so, or 38 states
in this country, this is not the rule.

00:29:29.369 --> 00:29:35.860
The rule is you each keep what's yours, but
if there's a divorce, the judge can pull from

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:40.750
either person's pot as is needed at the time.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.379
So it's important to know this distinction.

00:29:42.379 --> 00:29:47.690
Community property states it's 50-50 even
if one person has inherited wealth and the

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:48.809
other one doesn't.

00:29:48.809 --> 00:29:54.360
If you're in a non-community property state,
the division is based more on what your financial

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:58.749
needs are at the time of a dissolution.

00:29:58.749 --> 00:30:07.370
The other principal concept of a marriage
or a legal partnership is that you are taking

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:18.549
on an obligation that can extend beyond the
marriage in both directions – past and future.

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:23.509
The idea is that you are taking on this economic
partnership.

00:30:23.509 --> 00:30:29.659
And so, for example, if my earnings, or what
I thought were my earnings are actually community

00:30:29.659 --> 00:30:37.529
property, my boyfriend, now husband's, creditors
can come after my earnings, 'cause remember

00:30:37.529 --> 00:30:40.409
my earnings are now half his.

00:30:40.409 --> 00:30:47.990
So even for the debts incurred before I met
him, his creditors can come after what I think

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.879
of as my earnings.

00:30:49.879 --> 00:30:54.070
This goes back to this question of the different
sorts of questions you should be asking the

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.179
people you meet.

00:30:55.179 --> 00:31:02.769
I now have said, my new test is you should
be watching the mail of your intended for

00:31:02.769 --> 00:31:06.929
at least a year, although I now just realized
I'm assuming that bills come in the mail.

00:31:06.929 --> 00:31:07.929
[Laughter]

00:31:07.929 --> 00:31:09.889
Fred: Obviously I'm outdated.

00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:13.330
Because I used to say that if you're getting
dunning notic -- if your boyfriend is getting

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:18.309
dunning notices, and you're kind of looking
over his shoulder at the mail, you should

00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:22.980
be able to see to what extent you're looking
to marry a deadbeat.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.950
On the other hand, now I realize if it all
comes through the internet, maybe you need

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:31.049
to be looking at your boyfriend's internet
for the next year.

00:31:31.049 --> 00:31:36.919
The other piece of it is that should there
be a dissolution, you can be on the hook for

00:31:36.919 --> 00:31:42.119
support and payment of debts after the relationship
ends.

00:31:42.119 --> 00:31:49.669
Now, a lot of people think that is really
a crazy idea.

00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:57.299
Imagine this: you support your partner for
10 years; he leaves you and then you have

00:31:57.299 --> 00:31:59.460
to support him for another 5.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.429
It's like whoa, whoa, wait a second.

00:32:01.429 --> 00:32:05.780
But the concept behind it is actually quite
important, it's important that people understand

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:06.780
it.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:13.169
It is that while people are together, they
make decisions as a couple.

00:32:13.169 --> 00:32:19.429
Somebody might say, "Oh, you, since you're
working at Google, I'll become a school teacher."

00:32:19.429 --> 00:32:25.009
"Since you're working at Google, I'll become
an artist."

00:32:25.009 --> 00:32:32.159
Well, 10 years later, if there's a breakup,
that artist, that school teacher is very vulnerable.

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:37.419
The other, which again if you ask a lot of
couples breaking up, they will often disagree

00:32:37.419 --> 00:32:38.429
about this.

00:32:38.429 --> 00:32:46.929
But the, again the fiction or the myth is
that to be a high earner, you gain from the

00:32:46.929 --> 00:32:50.690
love and support of your partner.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:54.610
Again, and we're going back to a family, a
hetero-normative tradition.

00:32:54.610 --> 00:33:02.379
But the idea is that corporative executive
wouldn't have been able to get up in the morning.

00:33:02.379 --> 00:33:07.269
Obviously you, I, as I saw today you have
laundry and food service here, but traditionally

00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:08.909
those were provided by wives.

00:33:08.909 --> 00:33:16.239
And so, the, the corporate executive could
work the 12 hour day because his or her spouse

00:33:16.239 --> 00:33:21.559
was taking care or raising the children, or
taking care of the house or doing these things.

00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:30.419
And as anybody with kids and a complicated
life can tell you, having two overworked parents

00:33:30.419 --> 00:33:31.980
is crazy making.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:39.169
And so the idea is that the high earner is,
in part, a high earner because of the love

00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:41.690
and support of the spouse.

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:47.759
And therefore it's only fair, even after a
break-up that there be some financial help

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:50.179
to soften the blow of the dissolution.

00:33:50.179 --> 00:33:55.820
So there actually is a valid policy reason
for these rules.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.889
Oh one thing I forgot to mention for unmarried
straight couples.

00:33:59.889 --> 00:34:03.009
California does not have common law marriage.

00:34:03.009 --> 00:34:07.549
Common law marriage is the notion that if
you live together and act married for at least

00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:14.179
a certain number of years, you can be sort
of drifting into the marriage rule even though

00:34:14.179 --> 00:34:16.309
you never got legally married.

00:34:16.309 --> 00:34:20.119
California does not have that; there only
are about 7 states that do.

00:34:20.119 --> 00:34:24.720
So, you should never assume that just 'cause
you cohabit for a certain number of years,

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:27.389
you are treated as married.

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:32.510
OK, so, the last topic I wanna talk about
in this beginning time, then I'm happy to

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:40.139
take questions or talk further is what does
it mean to be in a same sex marriage or domestic

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:44.849
partnership now that we still have federal
non-recognition?

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:52.299
14 years ago, there was a law passed called
the Defense of Marriage Act.

00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:56.899
You can think to yourself as to what it was
being defended against.

00:34:56.899 --> 00:35:01.819
But it said that the federal government does
not recognize same sex marriages or partnerships

00:35:01.819 --> 00:35:03.339
of any kind.

00:35:03.339 --> 00:35:09.640
So, now that there is state marriage or its
equivalent, a same sex couple that enters

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:15.170
into a marriage or its equivalent is still
going to be federally single.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:23.160
Now, for anyone who is in the financial world
or the insurance world or the legal world,

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:27.910
this is a real brain teaser and twister.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:33.781
I jokingly have said to people in this field,
"Every night before you go to bed say 'California

00:35:33.781 --> 00:35:36.790
married, federally single'."

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:40.849
And if you say it every night before you go
to bed, after about 3 months, you start having

00:35:40.849 --> 00:35:44.369
these folds in your brain where you can process
it.

00:35:44.369 --> 00:35:50.730
The reason why it's so hard is that everything
from financial planners to tax accountants

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:56.280
has always said, "Well married people have
community property, unmarried people don't

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.309
have community property."

00:35:58.309 --> 00:36:04.619
Well now we have federally unmarried people
who have community property.

00:36:04.619 --> 00:36:11.400
And for anyone who is in a state registered
domestic partnership or a same-sex marriage,

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:16.819
doing anything that intersects with the federal
government is horrendously complicated.

00:36:16.819 --> 00:36:23.281
So, for example, and, and I have to say that
it's a lot easier now than it was two or three

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:29.840
years ago, and, because even people liken
to it have figured out a tax program for gay

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.840
couples.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:37.450
The problem is is that the entire state tax
code is built on the federal tax code.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:42.410
And throughout the state tax code, and if,
if you fill out your tax returns, it says

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:46.930
take line 42 from your federal tax return.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:52.260
Well, the problem is if you're state married
and federally single, what do you do?

00:36:52.260 --> 00:36:58.440
Well, in a word what you have to do is create
two federal sets of returns -- one is single,

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.150
one is married.

00:37:00.150 --> 00:37:09.089
Use the dummy return you created as married
to create your state return, and do your single

00:37:09.089 --> 00:37:10.349
for the federal files.

00:37:10.349 --> 00:37:11.829
But that's just the beginning.

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:14.190
Let me give an example I'm dealing with right
now.

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.290
Just, this is your little brain teaser of
the day.

00:37:17.290 --> 00:37:26.190
Couple gets divorced.
Bill is buying out Steve's half of the house

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:27.190
that they own.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:31.230
They've owned it for 20 years, there's a whole
lot of appreciation.

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:35.020
Well, under state law, they're considered
married.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.849
So, it is an exempt transaction -- meaning
Steve doesn't have to pay any taxes on the

00:37:39.849 --> 00:37:41.950
money he gets from Bill.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:46.059
But Bill does not get a step up in basis.

00:37:46.059 --> 00:37:52.710
So when Bill sells the house in 10 years,
he has to pay taxes not only on his half,

00:37:52.710 --> 00:37:59.590
but on Steve's half as well because his basis
which is used to calculate housing does not

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.590
go up.

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:06.339
And this would be true for a straight unmarried
couple under state law as well.

00:38:06.339 --> 00:38:10.599
I'm sorry, under state, under, under federal
law as well because they're an unmarried couple.

00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:15.530
But in California, Bill and Steve are treated
as married under state law.

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:21.430
Well when it comes to the federal law, they're
not considered married.

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:26.780
So if Steve gets more than $250,000 which
is the residential exclusion, he now has to

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:29.950
pay capital gains on that money.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:37.530
But the money that Bill paid to Steve, he
can use as an increase in his basis in the

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:42.860
house so that when he goes to sell the house
5 years from now, he pays less capital gains.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.260
Follow that?

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:51.619
So that means that when Steve, when Bill goes
to sell the house for 5 years, 5 years from

00:38:51.619 --> 00:39:00.220
now, his state tax analysis is to what capital
gains he own -- owes is completely different

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.970
than his federal capital gains.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:08.640
Well, every accountant in town has, if you
have an accountant and they keep track of

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:13.140
these things, they don't keep track separately
for federal and state.

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.911
They just have a basis for the house.

00:39:14.911 --> 00:39:18.770
Well, you now have a federal basis that's
different than your state basis.

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:25.780
Another example is if Bill and Steve agree
that they're gonna wait 5 years before they

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:31.460
sell the house 'cause they want the market
to go up, but Steve moves out; he will lose

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:36.910
his federal exclusion from taxes because under
federal law, you have to sell within three

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:37.950
years of you moving out.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:45.140
But if you were straight and divorced, there
is a rule that says if your deferral of the

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:52.750
house sale is in your divorce decree, the
three years doesn't start running.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.369
So, the consequences are different state and
federal.

00:39:55.369 --> 00:40:00.079
Well those are just a couple of the examples
of how complicated this is.

00:40:00.079 --> 00:40:02.640
But federal recognition is not just about
taxes.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:09.520
It also means you don't get to get this widower's
benefit from your Social Security, because

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:11.280
you're not in a federally recognized marriage.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:19.150
It means you don't get to petition to bring
in your fiancée or fiance from a foreign

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:22.559
country because you don't have that benefit.

00:40:22.559 --> 00:40:29.710
And when you talk about children and the issues
of parentage, you, from a federal stand point,

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:38.190
unless you have adopted your partner's child,
you won't be considered the legal parent of

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:44.200
your partner's child which can have all sorts
of consequences in terms of Social Security

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.130
and immigration and things like that.

00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.970
Let me just say there is one good ruling on
Social Security on this.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:57.099
But in general, you're not in a recognition
state.

00:40:57.099 --> 00:41:11.260
Now, that dilemma of the lack of federal recognition
spills into all sorts of things: I.R.A. rules,

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:15.510
home loan rules, credit card liability rules.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.530
Almost all of these are federally regulated.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:23.539
So whenever you deal with the federal government,
you're not gonna be in a recognized relationship

00:41:23.539 --> 00:41:26.849
which can create all sorts of problems.

00:41:26.849 --> 00:41:32.920
And this problem is only gonna change when
the Defense of Marriage Act is repealed by

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.741
Congress which might happen in the next 3
or 4 years.

00:41:36.741 --> 00:41:43.220
I don't think it's gonna happen in the next
1 or 2 years, and also could happen by a court

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.559
throwing it out.

00:41:44.559 --> 00:41:49.349
And there is a court case in Massachusetts
seeking to do just that.

00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:55.359
So let me stop at this point and before we
wrap up and talk about financial planning

00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:57.420
and legal issues.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:02.680
Any questions people have about any of the
things we've talked about or questions about

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.941
things I haven't talked about?

00:42:03.941 --> 00:42:15.240
[Pause]

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.240
Yes.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.240
[inaudible question]

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.770
Fred: Yes. Please use the mike because there
are people listening to this through an audio

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:22.920
connection.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:27.190
&gt;&gt;So, I'm currently living with my girlfriend,
and we're talking about getting married.

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:31.750
And she's a PH.D and she has a tremendous
amount of academic debt.

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:37.321
If we get married, would I be on the hook
for that academic debt as well because it

00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:38.960
was incurred before marriage?

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:44.799
Fred: Yes, well the answer is your income
would be on the hook.

00:42:44.799 --> 00:42:51.170
If you have savings, or stock options that
you acquired before marriage, that would be

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:55.970
your separate property, and her creditors
could not come after that.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:43:03.750
So if you have assets or savings, or stock
now, you'd wanna keep it insulated and not

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:05.410
co-mingle it.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:12.910
But if you married, your post marital income
is community property, just as hers is.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:19.150
And her creditors, including the student loans,
could come after your income as well as hers.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:20.150
Yes.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.200
There's one way out of this, and I didn't
mention this earlier.

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:29.599
Is that many of the marriage rules can actually
be opted out of through a pre-nup.

00:43:29.599 --> 00:43:36.270
And so a prenuptial agreement or a preregistration
agreement, you can actually do an agreement

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:42.000
in your situation where you would agree or
she would agree that your income is separate

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:45.400
property and not community property.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:54.130
And if you actually did such an agreement
and completely abided by it -- means no shared

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:59.890
savings, no shared credit cards -- you each
pay half of the mortgage out of your separate

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.500
checking accounts.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:07.900
If you have such an agreement and you maintain
it, then her creditors could not come after

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.910
you.

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:13.059
On the other hand, if you got divorced, she
couldn't come after you either 'cause what

00:44:13.059 --> 00:44:15.119
goes around comes around in that way.

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.799
So it can be protected in that way.

00:44:16.799 --> 00:44:19.100
&gt;&gt; Well we already have a shared credit card,
so that's gonna be hard.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:20.100
[Laughs]

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:21.100
Fred: Well you'd have to stop that.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:26.410
You could stop that.
But yes, in the absence of a pre-nup, your

00:44:26.410 --> 00:44:28.770
income can be tapped by her, her creditors.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:35.609
And let me just also say, I regularly counsel
couples to, say, have a big party, have a

00:44:35.609 --> 00:44:37.490
commitment ceremony.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:44.089
But look, if right now you have the privilege
of your income not being tapped by her creditors,

00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:47.460
why give them your income voluntarily?

00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:53.019
It may make sense to defer marriage or do
a pre-nup to avoid that problem.

00:44:53.019 --> 00:44:57.569
&gt;&gt; But I couldn't do a pre-nup just, just
against that debt.

00:44:57.569 --> 00:44:58.760
Fred: No, no, you can't say.

00:44:58.760 --> 00:44:59.760
[Laughter]

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:04.089
Fred: You can't say, it's all shared unless
B of A comes after you, yeah.

00:45:04.089 --> 00:45:12.270
&gt;&gt; Hi, you mentioned that there was talk in
the recent past of people dissolving their

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.609
registered domestic partnerships when they
could get married.

00:45:15.609 --> 00:45:18.970
Can you, can you expand on why people were
doing that, or if that's inaccurate?

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:20.961
Fred: Oh I didn't say they were dissolving
their domestic partnerships.

00:45:20.961 --> 00:45:25.680
I said they were in registered domestic partnerships
and they were also getting married.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.680
&gt;&gt; OK

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:32.000
Fred: You don't -- In California, and it's
true in Washington as well, you can marry

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.480
the same person you're domestically partnered
to.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:39.530
It merely reaffirms the rights you already
had.

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:44.150
You don't have to dissolve your domestic partnership
as long as you're marrying the same person.

00:45:44.150 --> 00:45:48.470
If you have a state registered domestic partnership
and you want to marry someone else, then you

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:49.839
have to dissolve it or it's bigamous.

00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:56.180
&gt;&gt; I have, I have heard of talk through the
grapevine of instances in which people have

00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:00.590
dissolved their registered domestic partnership
before they got married.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:01.821
Fred: To the same person.

00:46:01.821 --> 00:46:02.821
&gt;&gt; Yes

00:46:02.821 --> 00:46:07.130
Fred: Well there are some people who did because
they were offended by the stigmatization of

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.359
that second class status, A.

00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:14.920
And there were people who wanted to limit
the time period because they've been registered

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.380
for 5 years and now they were gonna be married.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:22.780
And they didn't want their marriage, the marriage
rules to apply retroactively.

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.760
So they dissolved their domestic partnership
and then got married.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:26.760
&gt;&gt;OK, OK.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.380
Fred: The one thing that actually is tricky
let me mention.

00:46:28.380 --> 00:46:31.730
This is actually one difference between domestic
partnership and marriage.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:38.859
Domestic partnership has this archaic, sort
of artifact of an old system where if you

00:46:38.859 --> 00:46:45.300
have no debts, almost no assets, no kids and
have been together less than 5 years, which

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.980
as I say applies to probably about 2 couples.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:53.890
You can dissolve your domestic partnership
by simply filing a piece of paper with the

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:58.230
Secretary of State, and you don't have to
go through the court dissolution process.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:02.200
There is no marriage equivalent of that.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:07.069
So, that is one area where some people are
dissolving their domestic partnerships when

00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:13.359
they still qualify for that, and then later
marrying because it cuts off the time period

00:47:13.359 --> 00:47:16.260
controlled by marital law.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.260
Yes?

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:25.970
&gt;&gt; If you have a legal domestic partnership
or civil union for a same sex couple, or a

00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:31.770
marriage, whatever your state permits, and
then you go to another state that has something,

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:36.930
but it's not exactly the same thing, it’s
a civil union or a marriage or a domestic

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:39.640
partnership, what kind of transferability
is there?

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:44.859
Fred: The answer is it depends on the state
you're coming from, the state you're going

00:47:44.859 --> 00:47:47.289
to and the week that you ask me the question.

00:47:47.289 --> 00:47:55.480
So for example, New Hampshire now recognizes
marriage and domestic partnerships.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:02.810
Massachusetts recognizes marriages but not
domestic partnerships, or civil unions although

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:06.589
there's a case to try to get them recognized.

00:48:06.589 --> 00:48:11.710
New York now recognizes some and not others.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.260
California now recognizes out of state marriages;
Nevada doesn't.

00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:20.500
It's, I really mean it when I say -- it's
week by week, month by month.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:26.170
There is no singular rule, and that's one
of the problems of having this patchwork of

00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:29.960
systems is the confusion around portability.

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:35.640
And so, and the answer I also have to say
is what's true today may not be true tomorrow.

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:45.039
So if you're moving to another state, I don't
know what's gonna be valid in that state and

00:48:45.039 --> 00:48:49.049
you may move to a state that doesn't recognize
it now but three years from now does.

00:48:49.049 --> 00:48:54.059
So, we really, we're gonna be in a stage of,
state of flux until there is something singular

00:48:54.059 --> 00:48:56.140
called marriage.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.140
Yes.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:58.140
&gt;&gt;Hi, If you...

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.259
Fred: Can you pull the mike down a little
closer?

00:49:00.259 --> 00:49:01.259
&gt;&gt; Oh, ok I'm sorry,

00:49:01.259 --> 00:49:06.550
It… as a same sex couple, if you have both
your domestic partnership and marriage…

00:49:06.550 --> 00:49:07.550
Fred: Yes.

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:09.720
&gt;&gt;As far as like for employer benefits.

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.720
Fred: Yes?

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:16.270
&gt;&gt; Would it matter to change your status from
domestic partnership to marriage, or it doesn't

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:17.359
matter at all or…?

00:49:17.359 --> 00:49:18.400
Fred: Well, here's the answer.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:25.109
In, in California with very, very few exceptions
it won't matter.

00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:27.490
But let me give you one example where it does.

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:30.391
One of the odd distinctions between marriage
and domestic partnership.

00:49:30.391 --> 00:49:35.359
In marriage, you don't have to live together
to be married.

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:37.799
You can have a long distance marriage.

00:49:37.799 --> 00:49:39.849
You can marry someone in prison.

00:49:39.849 --> 00:49:42.010
You don't have to live together.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:45.839
In fact, traditionally you weren't supposed
to live together until you got married.

00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:52.320
Well, when domestic partnership first got
passed in 1982, 1984 in Berkeley, there was

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:58.300
great fear primarily around people with AIDS
pretending to be partnered with somebody to

00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.520
get health insurance.

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:06.060
City councils were obsessed with this idea
that everybody with AIDS was gonna find somebody

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.460
and pretend to be partnered with them.

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:14.840
And so there was a residency requirement put
into that domestic partnership, and it has

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.089
lingered now for 28 years.

00:50:17.089 --> 00:50:18.980
It's still in the domestic partnership.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:25.790
So, for example, if you weren't living with
someone, but you were still in a relationship

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:31.270
with them, it's possible your employer could
terminate your domestic partner coverage on

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:34.020
the grounds that you're not living together.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:37.150
Whereas if you were married, there wouldn't
be that requirement.

00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:38.680
That's a small example.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:43.660
The other issue is, and when we talked about
this, Jeff and I talked about this earlier

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.079
and with Bennett.

00:50:45.079 --> 00:50:51.880
There's some employers that are providing
better benefits for domestic partners than

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.150
they are for married.

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:58.740
Because, for example, when it comes to issues
like COBRA, the federal government does not

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:07.720
require COBRA benefits for divorcing married
people -- I, I mean divorcing same sex married

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:08.720
people.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:12.039
But some employers are providing them for
domestic partnership.

00:51:12.039 --> 00:51:15.130
So there could be these little tiny areas.

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:20.529
There also might be some, well, let me correct
myself.

00:51:20.529 --> 00:51:24.569
At the moment, under state law there's no
difference.

00:51:24.569 --> 00:51:30.799
In the next few years, if there is federal
recognition, it is possible that there will

00:51:30.799 --> 00:51:35.670
only be federal recognition for married couples,
not for domestic partners.

00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:39.990
Because under the current proposal for the
repeal of Defense of Marriage Act, they didn't

00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:43.670
want to create a new federal category.

00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:49.290
So in that case, if there's a repeal of DOMA
and there's federal recognition, and you wanted

00:51:49.290 --> 00:51:55.900
to have, to be free of the double taxation
for domestic partners benefits insurance or

00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:00.940
you wanted to have an I.R.A. roll over, for
that you would have to get married and domestic

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.420
partnership wouldn't count.

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:05.869
So the answer is at the moment I don't think
it's a difference.

00:52:05.869 --> 00:52:11.070
It may become a difference in the future.

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:12.390
[pause]

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:17.380
Well let me just wrap up by saying that these
decisions are not easy.

00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:26.620
And, the one thing that makes it easier for
opposite sex couples is at least there is

00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:31.359
national recognition, if you do get married.

00:52:31.359 --> 00:52:34.970
And there is federal recognition if you do
get married.

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:41.029
And other then a few minor changes in marital
law, the law today is probably gonna be the

00:52:41.029 --> 00:52:43.329
law a year from now.

00:52:43.329 --> 00:52:51.450
For same sex couples, the rules are differed
from state to state; they're different from

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:57.549
state to federal; and they are gonna be different
from year to year, if not month to month.

00:52:57.549 --> 00:53:04.320
And so for the same sex couples, and we talk
about this a lot in the book, you need to

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:10.020
think about what's most important to you now,
what's most important to you in the state

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:16.970
you live in now, and make a decision based
on what's most important to you now, knowing

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:21.390
that as the law changes, or your life changes,
you may need to change your plans.

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:28.680
Let me also point out that for transgender
couples, the laws are even more complicated

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:35.319
because your legal gender from state to state
may be different based on what the state laws

00:53:35.319 --> 00:53:38.400
are and what stage of transition you're in.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.940
And so whether you're treated as an opposite
sex couple or a same sex couple if one or

00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:50.359
both the partners have gone through a sexual
transition can be even more complicated.

00:53:50.359 --> 00:53:56.480
But let me just end by saying the right to
marry is not the duty to marry.

00:53:56.480 --> 00:54:01.869
And that while everyone gay and straight should
fight for the right to marry, the question

00:54:01.869 --> 00:54:09.220
of whether marriage for you and for this particular
person you're considering marrying, whether

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:17.510
that is right for you is an individual decision
that you need to make carefully, slowly and

00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:20.430
with the knowledge that we try to provide
you in our books.

00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:24.520
So thank you very much, and I hope you'll
buy a book or two and thank you for coming.
