00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.038
- [Tutor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.038 --> 00:00:04.866
is draw a connection between the idea

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:07.114
of opportunity cost of producing a good

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:10.338
in a certain country and
comparative advantage

00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:13.255
between countries in a certain good

00:00:14.697 --> 00:00:18.149
and below, right over
here we have a chart,

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:20.784
that shows production possibility curves

00:00:20.784 --> 00:00:22.593
for two different countries

00:00:22.593 --> 00:00:24.577
and as we see in many economic models,

00:00:24.577 --> 00:00:26.812
this is a, I would argue
oversimplified model,

00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:28.729
but it helps us get some insights,

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.544
where in each country
workers can only produce

00:00:31.544 --> 00:00:35.211
some combination of
sneakers and basketballs

00:00:36.132 --> 00:00:38.715
and to help us understand
this and to appreciate

00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:42.046
that you can see this
information in multiple ways,

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:46.381
let's present this also
as an output table,

00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:49.403
output table, which you will sometimes see

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:52.260
and from either the
production possibility curves

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.621
or from the output table,

00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:56.539
we can calculate the
opportunity costs of shoes

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.024
and the opportunity costs of basketballs

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:00.853
and then try to deduce some things

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:02.957
about comparative advantage.

00:01:02.957 --> 00:01:07.097
So in an output table, we
would look at country A

00:01:07.097 --> 00:01:11.181
and we would look at country
B and we would think about,

00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:14.706
well, what is the max,
and I'll just draw it,

00:01:14.706 --> 00:01:17.239
what is the max basketballs

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.854
and this is all per worker per day

00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:23.687
and we would also think
what is the max shoes,

00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:27.333
shoes, those look like
socks, but you get the idea,

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:30.260
once again, per worker per day

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.150
and so let me draw a little chart here,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.329
so we can do that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.600
and so what I'd like you
to do is pause this video

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.041
and see if you can fill in this chart,

00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:44.429
what is the maximum
basketballs per worker per day

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.113
in country A and then in country B

00:01:46.113 --> 00:01:49.362
and then do the same thing for shoes.

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:51.951
Alright, now let's work this together,

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:53.623
so first in country A,

00:01:53.623 --> 00:01:55.914
what is the maximum number of basketballs?

00:01:55.914 --> 00:01:56.785
Well, if in country A,

00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:58.813
they put all of their
energy into basketballs,

00:01:58.813 --> 00:01:59.646
we are right over here

00:01:59.646 --> 00:02:01.444
on the production possibilities curve,

00:02:01.444 --> 00:02:04.495
they can produce eight basketballs

00:02:04.495 --> 00:02:06.258
and if on the other end of the curve,

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:08.221
they put all of their energy into shoes,

00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:11.494
they would produce no basketballs
and six pairs of shoes,

00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:13.041
we're assuming that
these are pairs of shoes,

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:17.403
that we're talking
about, six pairs of shoes

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.303
and similarly if we go
to company, (laughs)

00:02:19.303 --> 00:02:20.842
if we go to country B,

00:02:20.842 --> 00:02:23.215
I keep saying company, instead of country,

00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:25.604
if we go to country B,

00:02:25.604 --> 00:02:29.458
if we say what's the maximum
number of basketballs,

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:31.830
well, if they put all their
energy into basketballs,

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.986
we get four basketballs
and no pairs of shoes,

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:37.711
so that's four basketballs,
but then if they put

00:02:37.711 --> 00:02:40.008
all of their energy into pairs of shoes,

00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:41.256
they produce no basketballs,

00:02:41.256 --> 00:02:43.731
they could produce four pairs of shoes

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:44.933
and so it's as simple as that,

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.759
this output table is
just showing the extremes

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:51.475
from the production possibility
curves for these countries.

00:02:51.475 --> 00:02:54.298
Now with the information
about the output table

00:02:54.298 --> 00:02:56.272
and these production possibility curves,

00:02:56.272 --> 00:02:58.461
let's calculate the opportunity cost,

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:00.506
so let me set up another
table and let me just say

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:05.093
this is going to be our
opportunity cost table, OC,

00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:08.493
not Orange County, opportunity
costs and once again,

00:03:08.493 --> 00:03:12.952
it's going to be for
country A and country B

00:03:12.952 --> 00:03:15.801
and we're gonna think
about the opportunity costs

00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:17.521
of producing basketballs

00:03:17.521 --> 00:03:20.298
and that's gonna be in
terms of pairs of shoes

00:03:20.298 --> 00:03:23.774
and then the opportunity costs
for producing pairs of shoes

00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:27.046
and that's going to be
in terms of basketballs

00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:30.611
and so let me set up another table

00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:35.316
and so I encourage you once
again, pause this video

00:03:35.316 --> 00:03:37.639
and see if you can fill in this table,

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.250
what is the opportunity costs?

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.556
We'll start with what's
the opportunity costs

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:44.723
for producing basketballs in
terms of shoes in country A?

00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:48.970
Alright, well there's a couple
of ways to think about it,

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.965
imagine a world in country A,

00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:52.221
where you're producing no basketballs

00:03:52.221 --> 00:03:54.276
and you're producing six pairs of shoes,

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:56.247
but then if you were
to increase the number

00:03:56.247 --> 00:03:59.235
of basketballs you produce by eight,

00:03:59.235 --> 00:04:00.710
so if you add eight basketballs,

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.137
well, you're gonna give
up six pairs of shoes,

00:04:04.137 --> 00:04:05.813
you see that right over here,

00:04:05.813 --> 00:04:10.062
you give up six pairs of
shoes and so in country A

00:04:10.062 --> 00:04:15.031
eight basketballs cost six
shoes, let me write that down,

00:04:15.031 --> 00:04:17.864
so in country A, eight basketballs

00:04:18.816 --> 00:04:20.841
and I'll just say B for short,

00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:22.174
cost six, six S,

00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:27.800
S is shoes for short,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.011
or another way to think about it,

00:04:29.011 --> 00:04:31.875
if you divide both of these by eight,

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:33.542
one basketball costs

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.690
six over eight shoes,

00:04:37.987 --> 00:04:40.345
all I did was eight
basketballs cost six shoes

00:04:40.345 --> 00:04:44.051
and one basketball's gonna
cost six divided by eight

00:04:44.051 --> 00:04:47.036
pairs of shoes and so
what is that gonna be?

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:49.670
Well, six over eight is the
same thing as three fourths

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.142
or three fourths of a pair of shoes,

00:04:52.142 --> 00:04:55.838
so one basketball costs three
fourths of a pair of shoes

00:04:55.838 --> 00:04:58.421
or we could say that as 0.75 S,

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:02.716
where S is a pair of shoes

00:05:02.716 --> 00:05:04.571
for this is my simplified notation

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.258
and what about in country B?

00:05:07.258 --> 00:05:08.843
Well, in country B,

00:05:08.843 --> 00:05:13.233
if I go from no basketballs
to four basketballs,

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:16.123
then I would have given
up four pairs of shoes,

00:05:16.123 --> 00:05:18.600
I would have given up four pairs of shoes,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.183
so in country B, so in B, four,

00:05:23.065 --> 00:05:24.815
four basketballs cost

00:05:26.753 --> 00:05:28.236
four pairs of shoes

00:05:28.236 --> 00:05:31.276
or divide both by four, you
could have a basketball,

00:05:31.276 --> 00:05:34.526
one basketball costs one pair of shoes,

00:05:35.664 --> 00:05:39.831
so a basketball here in country
B costs one pair of shoes,

00:05:41.463 --> 00:05:45.807
so one pair of shoes, S once
again is a pair of shoes

00:05:45.807 --> 00:05:47.601
and you could have also gotten it

00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:49.465
from this information here,

00:05:49.465 --> 00:05:52.732
you could set up an
equation, you could say look,

00:05:52.732 --> 00:05:56.036
if I put all of, in country A, if I put,

00:05:56.036 --> 00:05:59.405
so let's look at this
part right over here,

00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:02.816
you could say in country A,
if I put all of my energy

00:06:02.816 --> 00:06:05.918
into basketballs, I could
produce eight basketballs,

00:06:05.918 --> 00:06:08.588
but if I put that same energy into shoes,

00:06:08.588 --> 00:06:11.871
I could produce six pairs of shoes,

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.685
so with the same energy, I could
produce either one of these

00:06:14.685 --> 00:06:17.310
and then if I want the
opportunity costs for basketballs,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.021
I divide both by eight
and that's essentially

00:06:19.021 --> 00:06:22.688
what I did over here
and I get a basketball,

00:06:23.951 --> 00:06:26.829
it costs six eighths of a pair of shoes

00:06:26.829 --> 00:06:28.830
or three fourths of a pair of shoes,

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.987
which is exactly what I have over here.

00:06:31.987 --> 00:06:33.582
Now let's do the opportunity cost

00:06:33.582 --> 00:06:36.001
for a pair of shoes in either country,

00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:38.039
well, there's a couple of
ways to think about it,

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:39.960
you could just view it as the reciprocal

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.834
or you could even go back to
this equation right over here,

00:06:43.834 --> 00:06:48.523
if we are in country A,
we would say six shoes,

00:06:48.523 --> 00:06:49.710
if we put all our energy in shoes,

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.794
we could produce six of them

00:06:51.794 --> 00:06:53.521
or six pairs of shoes, I should say

00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:55.841
and if we put all of our
energy into basketballs,

00:06:55.841 --> 00:06:58.308
we could produce eight basketballs,

00:06:58.308 --> 00:07:02.871
but if you divide by six,
you get per pair of shoes

00:07:02.871 --> 00:07:05.157
and so per each pair of shoes,

00:07:05.157 --> 00:07:08.750
the energy to produce one
pair of shoes is equivalent

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.065
to the energy to produce
eight sixths of a basketball

00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:14.494
and eight sixths is the same thing

00:07:14.494 --> 00:07:16.986
as four thirds of a basketball

00:07:16.986 --> 00:07:19.200
and if we wanted to write it as a decimal

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.818
just for simplicity or maybe
to make it easier to compare,

00:07:21.818 --> 00:07:24.669
we would say that this
is approximately 1.33,

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:27.524
obviously the 3s just keep
going on, it repeats forever,

00:07:27.524 --> 00:07:30.998
but approximately 1.33 basketballs

00:07:30.998 --> 00:07:32.532
is the cost of producing a shoe

00:07:32.532 --> 00:07:34.800
and the opportunity
cost of producing a shoe

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.300
in country A, 1.33 basketballs

00:07:38.945 --> 00:07:41.077
and what about in country B?

00:07:41.077 --> 00:07:42.353
Well, in country B

00:07:42.353 --> 00:07:44.883
we could set up a
similar type of equation,

00:07:44.883 --> 00:07:47.366
where the same energy for four shoes,

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:49.281
I could produce four basketballs

00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:50.645
and that's essentially what we set up

00:07:50.645 --> 00:07:53.672
right over here on the left,
you divide both sides by four,

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:56.956
the energy of a shoe is equal
to the energy of a basketball,

00:07:56.956 --> 00:07:59.298
or I should say the
energy of a pair of shoes

00:07:59.298 --> 00:08:01.802
is equal to the energy
of making a basketball,

00:08:01.802 --> 00:08:05.037
so the opportunity cost
of making a pair of shoes

00:08:05.037 --> 00:08:07.287
is equal to one basketball.

00:08:08.455 --> 00:08:11.582
So now we're ready to draw the connection,

00:08:11.582 --> 00:08:14.872
given the opportunity
costs that we calculated,

00:08:14.872 --> 00:08:19.039
what country has the comparative
advantage in basketballs?

00:08:20.053 --> 00:08:21.703
Pause this video and try to figure it out.

00:08:21.703 --> 00:08:23.677
So now let's look at the opportunity cost

00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:26.543
of producing a basketball
in either country.

00:08:26.543 --> 00:08:30.951
In country A, each
basketball costs a worker

00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:32.642
three fourths of a pair of shoes,

00:08:32.642 --> 00:08:36.897
while in country B, it costs
them a whole pair of shoes,

00:08:36.897 --> 00:08:40.893
so country A actually has
a lower opportunity cost

00:08:40.893 --> 00:08:42.875
of producing basketballs

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:45.829
and so it has the
comparative advantage here,

00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:48.662
comparative, comparative advantage

00:08:51.192 --> 00:08:55.558
and then if we look at shoes,
it goes the other way around,

00:08:55.558 --> 00:08:57.694
country A has an opportunity cost

00:08:57.694 --> 00:09:01.590
of one and one third basketballs
for every pair of shoes,

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.624
while country B has an opportunity cost

00:09:03.624 --> 00:09:05.928
of only one basketball per pair of shoes,

00:09:05.928 --> 00:09:08.767
so it has a lower opportunity cost

00:09:08.767 --> 00:09:10.514
and this one actually might be

00:09:10.514 --> 00:09:12.467
a little bit counterintuitive,

00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:15.875
because if you look on the
shoe axis right over here,

00:09:15.875 --> 00:09:20.348
country A has the absolute
advantage in producing shoes,

00:09:20.348 --> 00:09:22.416
a worker per day in country A

00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:24.470
can produce six pairs of shoes,

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:25.845
while a worker in country B

00:09:25.845 --> 00:09:28.494
can only produce four pairs of shoes,

00:09:28.494 --> 00:09:31.576
but even though country A
has the absolute advantage,

00:09:31.576 --> 00:09:33.924
it would actually make sense for country A

00:09:33.924 --> 00:09:38.592
to focus on basketballs, while
country B focuses on shoes

00:09:38.592 --> 00:09:41.570
and in the next video,
we'll see how they can

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.880
trade with each other
to get to a scenario,

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.300
that is beyond their
production possibility curves

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:49.754
and why focusing on your
comparative advantage,

00:09:49.754 --> 00:09:51.304
at least in this theoretical,

00:09:51.304 --> 00:09:54.221
very simplified world, makes sense.
