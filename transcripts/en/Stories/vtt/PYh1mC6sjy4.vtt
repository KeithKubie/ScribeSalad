[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.640
LAURA LING: We're driving to
Green Bank, West Virginia,

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.230
and the radio just went out,
I lost cellphone service,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.290
no Wi-Fi.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.750
And that's because we just
entered the National Radio

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:20.870
Quiet Zone.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.800
It's been called the
quietest place in America.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.650
There are no cellphone towers,
Wi-Fi is highly restricted,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.330
microwaves too.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.070
The US National Radio Quiet
Zone, a 13,000 square mile area

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.260
was established in 1958
to protect telescopes

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.052
like these from
electromagnetic frequencies

00:00:40.052 --> 00:00:41.635
that could cause
harmful interference.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.370
We went 450 feet
up to the very top

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.180
of the world's largest
steerable radio telescope

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.830
in Green Bank, West Virginia.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.687
In being up here, I feel
like a speck on the earth.

00:00:55.687 --> 00:00:57.270
JAY LOCKMAN: What
it's used for really

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.170
makes me feel like a
speck on the earth,

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.470
because it's used by
scientists to study

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.739
things that are going on
very far out in the universe.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.960
Stars that are being formed,
or stars that are dying,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.690
galaxies and their collisions.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.240
People have looked for
life using this telescope.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.204
LAURA LING: What makes this
particular telescope unique?

00:01:17.204 --> 00:01:19.370
JAY LOCKMAN: What makes it
unique is, for one thing,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.260
it's location.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.430
It's in the National
Radio Quiet Zone,

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.500
and so we're free from a lot of
the man-made interference that

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.330
would really block study
of sensitive signals.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.010
The tiniest little
transmitter, even

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.310
things like cellphones or
even the kind of transmitters

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.310
that are in your digital camera
would wipe out the signals.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.940
Another thing is its sheer size.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.790
It's a very good, very
precise tracking instrument,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.580
so a lot of things
put together make

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.950
it an absolute unique
instrument for the study

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.505
of a large range of phenomena
out there in the universe.

00:01:50.505 --> 00:01:52.380
LAURA LING: Do some
people feel as if they're

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.034
living in a little bubble here?

00:01:54.034 --> 00:01:55.700
JAY LOCKMAN: In a
sense, I feel like I'm

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.600
living in the little
wonderland, because we have

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.312
this great science
going on here,

00:02:00.312 --> 00:02:01.770
and I suppose there
are people that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.050
can't imagine doing
without cellular service,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.890
but for most of human history
we managed quite well.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.394
Think of it as living in 1980.

00:02:10.394 --> 00:02:11.560
LAURA LING: I love the '80s.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.390
JAY LOCKMAN: Well, the fashion
left something to be desired.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.440
LAURA LING: Jonah Bauserman
patrols the 10-mile radius

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.755
around the National Radio
Astronomy Observatory

00:02:20.755 --> 00:02:24.120
to make sure there are no
electromagnetic frequencies

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.560
that might interfere
with the telescopes.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.655
JONAH BAUSERMAN: This is
actually NRAO property,

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:33.040
you know, the folks that live
here sign a rental agreement,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.850
and it basically
says you are not

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.920
allowed to have microwave ovens,
Wi-Fi, cordless telephones.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.390
Anything that could transmit a
signal is strictly forbidden.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.430
LAURA LING: So no Lean Cuisines
for these guys for dinner?

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.170
JONAH BAUSERMAN: Nope Or
they have to figure out

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.990
another alternative to cook it.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.900
LAURA LING: I mean, it
does seem in some ways

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.200
that this town is kind
of from a different era.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.320
JONAH BAUSERMAN: It
is a unique area.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.300
We're kind of locked back
in time, if you will.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.570
LAURA LING: The National
Radio Quiet Zone is not only

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.980
a place of scientific
research and discovery,

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.250
it's become a haven
of sorts for people

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.540
who believe they suffer
from a condition known

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.140
as electromagnetic
hypersensitivity,

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.684
that electromagnetic
fields make them sick.

00:03:22.684 --> 00:03:24.100
DIANE SCHOU: I got
a headache that

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.830
was like a sledgehammer
on the head.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.130
JENNIFER WOOD: I started
losing weight really fast.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.387
I got emaciated.

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:30.845
The doctors were
really frightened.

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:32.730
They thought maybe I had cancer.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.550
MELISSA CHALMERS: I
was very nauseous.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.841
I was throwing up all the time.

00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:37.540
Every moment of every
day was absolute torture.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.310
LAURA LING: Diane
Schou, Jennifer Wood,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.340
and Melissa Chalmers are
among the few dozen people who

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.380
have moved to Green Bank
in the last few years

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.610
to try to escape the
ever-growing reach

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.340
of Wi-Fi technology.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.342
What sorts of things
were making you sick?

00:03:52.342 --> 00:03:54.050
DIANE SCHOU: Well,
originally it was just

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.330
the cellphone tower
that was near my home,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.780
but after that it
became cellphones,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.540
and eventually it also
morphed into power lines,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.150
electrical devices, fluorescent
lights are horrible.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.820
The electricity
became so painful

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.350
that when the neighbor
ran her coffee maker,

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.240
I was in such pain,
with such a headache

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.329
and, oh, that really hurt.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.269
MELISSA CHALMERS: When
I was using the phone,

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.268
after couple minutes, I
would start getting numb

00:04:20.268 --> 00:04:23.880
on this side of my face,
and so I would turn it off,

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.050
but then the last
time I used it,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.560
my face went numb for two weeks.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.643
JENNIFER WOOD: A lot of
houses I can't even be in,

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:32.995
so this is why I hand-built my
own house with no electricity.

00:04:32.995 --> 00:04:34.370
LAURA LING: There
are some people

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.380
who say that what
you're suffering

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.900
from is not a condition, it's an
affliction, it's in your head.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.190
How does that make you feel?

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.240
DIANE SCHOU: They're uneducated.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.060
They are closed minded,
and they are selfish.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.920
It is real.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.655
It is true.

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.030
LAURA LING: How
did you feel when

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.232
you arrived in this quiet zone?

00:04:54.232 --> 00:04:55.940
MELISSA CHALMERS: I
felt great, actually.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.440
You know, at one point, my
whole body just relaxed.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.570
DIANE SCHOU: By getting
away, I was able to recover.

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.840
I do have electricity
in my home.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.830
I use it carefully.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.070
So therefore, I do
have a computer.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.630
I can go to local grocery
store, I can go to church.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.790
I can be with people,
and they're not carrying

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.999
a cell phone in their pocket.

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:15.540
JENNIFER WOOD: As
soon as I moved in,

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.060
I was completely out of all
electrical fields and all cell

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.930
phone reception.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.870
Within two weeks, I noticed
I was already gaining weight.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.495
MELISSA CHALMERS: It
took a couple days

00:05:22.495 --> 00:05:25.990
for the ringing in my ears to
stop here, and after two days

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.897
I never wanted to leave.

00:05:28.897 --> 00:05:30.730
There no other place
like it that I've seen.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.370
LAURA LING: But as technology
continues to creep in,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.870
things may be getting a little
louder in the quiet zone.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.560
JONAH BAUSERMAN: We've got
quite a few Wi-Fi modems here

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.980
in the area.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.670
These could potentially
cause harmful radio frequency

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.250
interference to the telescope.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:59.050
I would say there's probably
maybe 40, maybe 50 Wi-Fi modems

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.530
just driving through
the town of Green Bank.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.530
LAURA LING: Wow, that's a lot
of Wi-Fi for the town that's

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.100
not supposed to have any Wi-Fi.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.160
JONAH BAUSERMAN: It's a
little bit disheartening,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.125
but it is what it is, I suppose.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.170
LAURA LING: Even though
they're not supposed to,

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:20.235
people here are accessing things
such as wireless technology,

00:06:20.235 --> 00:06:23.750
and so you have to wonder,
how long can this place truly

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.815
remain a quiet zone?

00:06:24.815 --> 00:06:26.690
MELISSA CHALMERS: I
think eventually the zone

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.528
will be threatened.

00:06:27.528 --> 00:06:29.486
People are going to want
to use the technology,

00:06:29.486 --> 00:06:29.822
because they want to use it.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.620
I don't know what I'll do.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.120
JONAH BAUSERMAN: The type of
science that we're doing here

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.840
is not just for right
here, right now,

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.520
in this day and time.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.500
It's for the next generation.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.280
The universe is vast, it's
huge, it's magnificent,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.870
and to be able to
take a tool like this

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.490
and look back through time
is just astounding to me.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.490
