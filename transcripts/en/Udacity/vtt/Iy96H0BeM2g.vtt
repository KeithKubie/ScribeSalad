00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.234
One of the more solid findings of cognitive change in late adulthood is between

00:00:04.234 --> 00:00:10.290
two kinds of intelligence: crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.042
Crystallized intelligence is what we know from experience, culture, learning

00:00:14.042 --> 00:00:18.351
and education. Crystallized intelligence is used when we try to solve problems

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:22.906
that we've seen before. Fluid intelligence is a more pure intelligence. It's

00:00:22.906 --> 00:00:27.672
raw processing speed, your mental quickness and abstract reasoning. This is

00:00:27.672 --> 00:00:30.920
used when we attempt to solve problems that we've never seen before. It might

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.602
help to look at these on the graph. Here, we see crystallized intelligence, in

00:00:34.602 --> 00:00:38.458
this area. What's clear with aging is that crystallized intelligence doesn't

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:43.008
decline. However, as we see here with fluid intelligence, it does begin to

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.709
decline at about middle adulthood.
