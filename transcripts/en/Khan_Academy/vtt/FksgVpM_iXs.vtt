00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.350
Solve the system of equations
using any method.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.930
We have y is equal to 2 times
the quantity x minus 4

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.700
squared plus 3.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.960
We also have y is equal
to negative x squared

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.460
plus 2 x minus 2.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.470
The solution-- it might be one,
it might be none, or it

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.580
might be two solutions-- to this
system occurs for the x

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.640
values that generate
the same y values.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.570
There's the same x and
y that satisfy

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.870
both of these equations.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.910
In order to find the x values,
they need to equal the same y

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.030
values, so this y has
to be that y value.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.060
So the solution is going to
occur when this guy right

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:45.080
here-- negative x squared plus
2x minus 2 is equal to that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.780
guy up there, or equal
to 2 times x minus 4

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.690
squared plus 3.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.120
Now let's just try
to solve for x.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.980
The left hand side-- we're going
to have to multiply this

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.040
out, so let's do that first.
It's negative x squared plus

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.530
2x minus 2 is equal to.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.110
And on the right hand side, 2
times x minus 4 squared is x

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.455
squared minus 8x
plus 16 plus 3.

00:01:14.455 --> 00:01:17.980
This is going to be equal
to 2x squared-- I'm just

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:27.680
distributing the 2-- minus 16x
plus 32 plus 3, which is equal

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.960
to 2x squared minus
16x plus 35.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.930
That's, of course, going to be
equal to this thing on the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.050
left hand side, negative x
squared plus 2x minus 2.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.040
Let's just get rid of this whole
thing from the left hand

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.600
side all at once by adding
x squared to both sides.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.720
We can all do it in one step.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.340
We're going to add x squared
to both sides.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.040
Let's subtract 2x from
both sides, and let's

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.450
add 2 to both sides.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.310
On the left hand side, those
cancel out, those cancel out,

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.095
those cancel out.

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:15.430
You're left with 0 is equal to
2x squared plus x squared is

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.390
3x squared.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.940
Negative 16x minus 2x is
negative 18x, and then

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.500
35 plus 2 is 37.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.060
So we just have a plain vanilla
quadratic equation

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.220
right here.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.510
We might as well apply the
quadratic formula here to try

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.920
to solve it.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.000
Our solutions are going to be
x is equal to negative b.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.860
Well, b is negative 18, so
negative b is positive 18.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.960
It's 18 plus or minus the square
root of 18 squared

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:59.990
minus 4 times 3 times
c-- times 37.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:05.290
All of that is over 2 times
a-- 2 times 3, which is 6.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.400
Let's think about what
this is going to be.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.680
Over here, we have 18 plus or
minus the square root of--

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.220
let's just use a calculator.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.860
I could multiply it out but I
think-- we have 18 squared

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:28.170
minus 4 times 3 times 37,
which is negative 120.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.760
It's 18 plus or minus the square
root of negative 120.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.820
You might have even been
able to figure out

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.770
that this is negative.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.030
4 times 3 is 12.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.460
12 times 37 is going to be
a bigger number than 18.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.850
Although it's not 100% obvious,
but you might be able

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.170
to just get the intuition
there.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.290
We definitely end up with a
negative number under the

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.440
radical here.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.950
Now, if we're dealing with
real numbers, there is no

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.000
square root of negative 120.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.850
So there is no solution to
this quadratic equation.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.030
There is no solution.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.500
If we wanted to, we could
have just looked at the

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.100
discriminant.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.660
The discriminant is this part--
b squared minus 4ac.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.960
We see the discriminant is
negative, there's no solution,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.350
which means that these two
guys-- these two equations--

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.410
never intersect.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.310
There is no solution
to the system.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.060
There are no x values that
when you put into both of

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.860
these equations give you
the exact same y value.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.460
Let's think a little bit about
why that happened.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.280
This one is already in kind
of our y-intercept form.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.070
It's an upward opening
parabola, so it looks

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.240
something like this.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.370
I'll do my best to draw
it-- just a quick and

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.990
dirty version of it.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.670
Let me draw my axes in
a neutral color.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.930
Let's say that this right here
is my y-axis, that right there

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.000
is my x-axis.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.130
x and y.

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.540
This vertex-- it's in the vertex
form-- occurs when x is

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.595
equal to 4 and y
is equal to 3.

00:04:56.595 --> 00:04:59.490
So x is equal to 4 and
y is equal to 3.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.010
It's an upward opening
parabola.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.210
We have a positive coefficient
out here.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.240
So this will look something
like this.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.990
I don't know the exact thing,
but that's close enough.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.960
Now, what will this
thing look like?

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.690
It's a downward opening parabola
and we can actually

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.910
put this in vertex form.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.880
Let me put the second equation
in vertex form,

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.925
just so we have it.

00:05:23.925 --> 00:05:25.010
So we have a good sense.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.730
So, y is equal to-- we could
factor in a negative 1--

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.670
negative x squared
minus 2x plus 2.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.210
Actually, let me put the plus
2 further out-- plus 2, all

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.080
the way up out there.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.390
Then we could say, half of
negative 2 is negative 1.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.100
You square it, so you
have a plus 1 and

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.390
then a minus 1 there.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.170
This part right over here, we
can rewrite as x minus 1

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:02.130
squared, so it becomes negative
x minus 1 squared.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.715
Let me just do it one
step at a time.

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:06.100
I don't want to skip steps.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.820
Negative x minus 1 squared
minus 1 plus 2.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.250
So that's plus 1 out here.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.060
Or if we want to distribute
the negative, we get y is

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.440
equal to negative x minus
1 squared minus 1.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.030
Here the vertex occurs at x is
equal to 1, y is equal to

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.280
negative 1.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:29.840
The vertex is there,
and this is a

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.350
downward opening parabola.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:34.820
We have a negative coefficient
out here on the second degree

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.310
term, so it's going to look
something like this.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.640
So as you see, they
don't intersect.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.030
This vertex is above it
and it opens upward.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.320
This is its minimum point.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.610
And it's above this guy's
maximum point.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.790
So they will never intersect,
so there is no solution to

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.710
this system of equations.
