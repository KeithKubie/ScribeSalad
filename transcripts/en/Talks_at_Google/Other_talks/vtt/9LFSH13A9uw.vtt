[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.410
SHARON SALZBERG: Great,
thank you so much.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.140
It's such a delight to be here.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.990
I was here a little bit for
this conference, Wisdom 2.0,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.250
so it was kind of
nice coming back

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.149
into the same room and
just sort of settling.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:21.890
So I as you doubtless know,
I am a meditation teacher.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.140
And its very funny now when I'm
introduced that way, because I

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.290
came back from India where
I'd first gone to study--

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.098
I went in 1970, and
came back in 1974.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:36.135
And in those days, I'd be at a
party or some social situation

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:39.000
and people would say
to me, what do you do?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.360
And I'd say, I teach meditation.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.360
And they would kind of
go, oh, that's weird.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.610
Or occasionally, somebody
would say to me, oh,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.170
did you meet the Beatles
when you were over there.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.920
I'd say, sadly no, they went
when I was in high school.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.890
And now, all these years later--
after so much more significant

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.280
research, and science,
and kind of a relanguaging

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.459
of the whole process--
the most common response

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.730
I hear when I say
teach meditation is,

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.360
I'm so stressed out.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.100
I could really use some of that.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.060
Although my favorite response,
which I also hear sometimes

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.320
is-- my partner should
really meet you,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.790
that'd be really good for them.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.460
And these days, even going
beyond the context of stress,

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.550
people see meditation--
I think rightly so--

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.100
as a kind of capacity building.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.760
As a way of finding
resourcefulness,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.270
and a kind of an innovative
energy within themselves.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.080
Sometimes I hear the
response which concerns me

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.150
the most, which is, oh I tried
that once, I failed at it.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.330
I couldn't do it.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.050
And then what follows
is some description

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.640
of what people expect.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.800
I should be able to
stop all my thinking.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.200
I should have a
completely blank mind.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.460
I should have only
beautiful thoughts,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.220
like doubtless everyone
else in the room is having.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.460
I should be able to keep
sleepiness completely at bay.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.539
I should find perfect peace
within the first hour.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.039
Whatever it might be.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.120
And that of course concerns me,
because we say we believe very

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.010
strongly, you cannot fail at it.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.430
It's impossible.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.220
Because the essence of
the meditative process

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.980
is changing the way we
relate to everything.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.260
So it's that quality
of relationship,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.560
that's where the
transformation takes place.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.920
So you can't actually be
having the wrong experience,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.880
the wrong thing happening.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.490
So I'd gone to
India to begin with.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.850
It was actually my
junior year in college.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.780
I went to college when I was 16.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.290
I'm a product of the New York
City public school system

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.150
where they like to skip grades,
so I skipped two grades.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.520
And when I was a
sophomore in college,

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.270
I took an Asian
philosophy course--

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.930
which quite honestly, as I look
back, was sort of happenstance.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.480
I needed a philosophy course.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.330
It was a requirement.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.590
I looked at the schedule,
and it was something

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.760
like-- it's on Tuesday,
that would be convenient,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.910
so let me take that.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.690
And of course the course
completely changed my life.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.560
So this is what I
heard in that context.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.360
That there were
some very practical,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.830
immediate, direct
tools that anybody

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.490
could do if they want to.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.580
There wasn't, like,
a prerequisite.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.990
Anybody who wished to
could pick them up,

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.500
and that these
tools of meditation

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.320
were like skills training.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.300
Training, first of
all, in concentration.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.280
In the ability to
stabilize our attention.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.350
Most of us experience
ourselves as fairly distracted,

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.980
maybe not in every
realm of our experience,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.730
but at least in some.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.850
Where we sit down to think
something through, or work

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.380
through a dilemma,
and then we're gone.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.670
The way our minds tend
to jump to the past,

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.140
and we go over and over and
over some situation, often one

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.127
where we now have some
kind of tinge of regret.

00:04:10.127 --> 00:04:12.210
I should've said nothing,
I should have said more.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.410
Why did I go there, why
didn't I, why did I stay?

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.029
Whatever it is.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.029
And we don't go
over it with an eye

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.649
toward making amends, or
learning from our mistakes.

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:25.732
We just go over it, and over
it, and over it, and over it.

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:28.370
Or our minds jump to
the future, and we

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.930
create a scenario that has not
happened, and may never happen.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.470
Which is different that just
kind of creating a space,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.580
and letting your mind roam.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.794
It's more like an anxiety
driven construct-- of like,

00:04:40.794 --> 00:04:42.210
well then this is
going to happen,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.390
and that's going to happen.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.310
No doubt it will all fall
apart when that happens.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.550
And then we emerge
from that with kind

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.550
of the burden of that.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.590
So our minds tend to jump to
the past, jump to the future.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.100
Judgement.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.640
Speculation.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.370
And the process of
developing concentration

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.000
is one of more
stabilizing our attention.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.690
It's not in a frozen way,
it's not in a rigid way.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.590
But it's like with tremendous
flexibility and fluidity.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.130
So we realize we're
gone, we can come back.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.440
So that the end result is
that we're much more centered,

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.080
and grounded, and present.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.500
And we recapture
all that energy,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.150
which has been just
flying all over the place.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.550
The larger consequence,
the feeling

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.800
of that sort of
distraction is said

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.920
to be a kind of fragmentation.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.390
It's the way we have so
much role identification

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:34.550
often in this society.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.540
That people say, I feel
like I'm one person at work,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.830
and I'm a different
person at home.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.650
Or my very favorite
example of that

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.650
still is, I was teaching
in New York City somewhere.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.540
And somebody raised
her hand and she said,

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.260
I feel filled with loving
kindness and compassion

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.540
for all beings everywhere,
as long as I'm alone.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.609
But once I'm with others,
it's really rough.

00:05:56.609 --> 00:05:58.150
And everybody laughed,
because we all

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.802
knew exactly what she meant.

00:06:00.802 --> 00:06:02.260
And it can be the
other way around.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.130
We might feel fine
when we're with others,

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.330
and very ill at
ease being alone.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.720
So our lives can
be very cut apart.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.120
Or seem very cut apart.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.060
Whereas the reality is
that they're seamless.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.600
We're of one piece.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.360
So concentration and a greater
stabilization of attention

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.090
is one of the great
skills of meditation.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.510
The second is mindfulness,
which for me feels

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.140
kind of like the
word of the hour.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.764
When I came back from
India, of course,

00:06:30.764 --> 00:06:32.660
no one ever use the
word mindfulness,

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.810
unless you were using it in a
very kind of classical context

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.400
in terms of meditation training.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.580
And now it's just everywhere.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.850
I teach in Washington,
DC about once a month,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.380
and one of my great amusements
is listening to the conductors.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.120
Because every once
in awhile they

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.050
will say please be mindful
of the gap between the train

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.560
and the station platform,
and I get very excited.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.810
I'm like, oh they said mindful.

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.850
Mostly they say what
they really mean,

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.750
which is please be
careful of the gap.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.380
I recently had the conductor
who simply said, there's a gap.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.930
It's like, no hint about how
he wanted you to relate to it.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.040
It's just like, there it is.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.420
But really, you hear this
word like everywhere now.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.280
So classically, mindfulness
means a quality of awareness.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.960
A way of paying attention so
that our perception of what's

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.070
happening in the moment is
not so distorted by bias.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.320
Projection into the
future, like what's this

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.000
going to feel like in three
months, eight months, 10

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.290
years, right?

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.750
Which distorts our sense of
what's happening right now.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.510
And interestingly enough,
as an example of that,

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.370
in some of the meditation
research around physical pain

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.570
what they've
discovered-- and this

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:56.870
is Richie Davidson's lab
in Madison, Wisconsin.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.450
I don't know how they got
IRB approval to inflict pain,

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.030
but somehow they did.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.660
And what they discovered
was that the difference

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.900
between meditators
and non-meditators

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.550
was not the reaction
to the pain.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.050
Everybody had the
reaction to pain.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:18.460
But the difference was in
terms of what happened next,

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.380
where they said
non-meditators tended

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:25.410
to flip into an
anticipatory cycle.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.780
It's like, whatever happened
in terms of the pain,

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.260
you know the tension,
the reaction, happened.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.360
But then they didn't
relax subsequent to that.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.767
Because they were very caught up
in when's the next bout coming.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:38.850
How bad is it going to be.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.179
How intense will be.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:40.679
Right?

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:45.380
Whereas the meditators have that
same reaction to pain, but then

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:46.960
it was over.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.500
And they weren't caught in
all of that anticipation.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.450
It's interesting.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.220
So maybe that is
a great tendency,

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.850
or we just pile on to our
experience in some way,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.370
but we're continually adding so
many layers of interpretation

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.890
and judgment that we
lose touch with what

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:08.890
is actually happening right now.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.530
Or, we have a big
thing about control.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.035
I shouldn't be feeling this way.

00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:13.995
This is here.

00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:15.940
I've been meditating
for 40 years.

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.460
It shouldn't be here anymore.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:21.280
Or I spent $10,000 in
therapy just last year,

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.075
surely it should be gone.

00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:25.510
Or no one else feels this.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.290
Or whatever it might be.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.960
All of which tends to distort
the actual experience.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.120
And so we say that
mindfulness is the ability

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:40.880
to make the distinction between
what our direct experience is,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.670
and then everything
we make of it.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:46.130
It's not to say we want
to destroy or annihilate

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.620
that narrative capacity.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.600
We want that, for sure.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.970
But we don't necessarily
want to be stuck there.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.110
Right?

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.410
We might want more to
be able to see things

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.580
from different angles, and
see them for ourselves.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.440
Just in the
interests of freedom.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.170
So my favorite
example of mindfulness

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:07.820
these days is, let's say
you're on your way to a party.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.410
And you run into a friend,
and the friend says to you,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.600
you know who I met today?

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.540
That new person who's
going to be our colleague,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.730
and they're really,
really, really boring.

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.890
And then you go to the
party, and who do you end up

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:24.720
stuck talking to you,
but the very person

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:27.010
you have just been told is
like the most boring person

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:27.510
on earth.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:33.120
Very likely, you don't
really listen to them.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.370
You don't really look at them.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.630
You're thinking about the
50 emails you need to send,

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:40.050
or everybody else you'd
rather be talking to

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.360
than this very person.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.590
But sometimes we realize
that, and we stop,

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.610
and we gather our attention,
and we do really listen.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.480
And we really look.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.170
Maybe we come to the end of that
party and we walk out thinking,

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.570
you know that new person?

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.290
They are so boring.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.110
But maybe we don't.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.910
Because life is
full of surprises

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.540
when we pay attention.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.760
So why take a borrowed
impression, what

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.670
someone else said about
something or someone,

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:17.710
rather than developing our
capacity to realize that.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.050
Let go of some of those
preconceptions and assumptions.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.510
See more directly, and
decide for ourselves.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.680
So one of the great
dangers of mindfulness

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.790
in terms of the language that
we tend to use around it,

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.354
is that it can seem so passive.

00:11:31.354 --> 00:11:32.145
It's so complacent.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:36.310
Or so it seems.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.290
Of course, it doesn't really.

00:11:38.290 --> 00:11:40.440
When we say things
like, mindfulness

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.560
means accepting things
the way that they are,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.320
it sounds like you're
going to vegetate.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.730
Or, be with your experience
without judgment,

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.440
that you're going
to lose discernment

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.830
and an edge of activity.

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:55.070
And of course, it's
not like that at all.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.490
It's much more
creating that space.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.220
That our action
is comprehensive.

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.090
It's not coming from someone
else's vision of what's true.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.000
That we can make
choice very easily.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.100
We're going to do just a
little bit of meditation

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:15.720
here together, and one of the
standard kind of beginnings

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:20.340
to a meditation instruction
is to sit and just

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.200
listen to sound.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.741
Of course, there's
not a lot of sound

00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:26.420
here, but I'll make
some just by talking.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:30.040
I once gave that
instruction somewhere,

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.000
and immediately someone
raised their hand

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.110
and said, well, what if it's
the sound of the smoke alarm

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.610
I hear.

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.560
Am I supposed to sit
here mindfully knowing

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.830
that the smoke
alarm is going off?

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:41.390
Or should I get up?

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.410
And I said, I'd get up.

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.850
All right.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.540
But I can see how one
can have that impression.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.640
And yet, really the relationship
of mindfulness to whatever

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.820
we're experiencing-- something
very vital, and alive,

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.800
and creative because
we're freeing ourselves

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.490
from all of those old
habits of perception.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.420
And then the last great skill of
meditation practice, the third,

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.990
is compassion.

00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:11.200
Or loving kindness.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.530
Compassion for ourselves.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.419
Compassion for others.

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:15.960
And this is a very
interesting thing.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.890
First of all, the notion that
compassion can be trained

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.550
is a little weird,
I find, in the West.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.230
People think of it as
cold and mechanistic,

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.890
whereas in the
Eastern psychology,

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.620
say in Buddhist
psychology, absolutely

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.430
it's considered that
compassion can be trained,

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.430
because we know that
attention can be trained.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.780
And compassion is like
an emergent property

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.160
of how we pay attention.

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.020
How do we recover when
we've made a mistake.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.070
When we've lost sight
of our aspiration.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.420
When we've strayed
from our chosen course.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.840
And the kind of
mini version of that

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.880
is inherent in the
meditation instruction.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.010
You sit down.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.790
You have an object
of awareness, say

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.480
it's the feeling of
the breath, which

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.860
is what we're going to do.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.940
And most people discover
it's not 900 breaths

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.080
before their attention wonders.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.870
Usually it's more like three.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.670
Or maybe five, or maybe eight.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:17.030
Maybe one.

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.930
And then we're gone.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.820
And sometimes we are way gone.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.990
And then comes this magic
moment when we realize oh, it's

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.830
been quite some time since
I last felt a breath.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.030
That's the moment where instead
of the berating ourselves,

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.020
and chastising ourselves,
and feeling like a failure.

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.730
We practice letting go, with
practice beginning again.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.730
And the only way
we can do that is

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.800
to deepen compassion
for ourselves.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.970
And this is very
interesting also,

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.200
because I was teaching
somewhere very recently,

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.885
and someone raised their hand
and said, I don't buy that.

00:14:54.885 --> 00:14:57.740
You know, I think if you
have compassion for yourself,

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.450
in effect, if you
forgive yourself,

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:02.580
that it just makes you lazy.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.000
That you're going to give
up a sense of clarity

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.250
about ambition, or goal.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.470
And that you're just going
to let yourself do anything.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:13.900
But I don't honestly buy that.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.800
Because I think if we look
at how we learn, how we grow,

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.350
how we change, it's
usually not from that kind

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:25.060
of brutal self-judgment.

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.460
So just in the example
of the meditation,

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:34.620
you sit down to feel the breath.

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:39.180
It is one breath,
and then you're gone.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.490
It's not that useful.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:41.490
It's not that efficient.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.260
It's not that
effective to realize

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.020
that you've been
distracted and then

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.840
launch into this spiral
of self-judgment.

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.280
I can't believe I'm thinking.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:51.910
No one else in the
room is thinking.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.380
They're all sitting
here in bliss.

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:55.240
They're all sitting here bathed
in brilliant white light.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.950
Or is that golden light, I
forget what color of light

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.015
that's supposed to be.

00:15:58.015 --> 00:16:00.090
Some kind of light everybody
gets, but I don't have it.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:00.660
They have it.

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:01.565
I don't have it.

00:16:01.565 --> 00:16:02.440
They're not thinking.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.040
I'm thinking.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.540
Maybe they are
thinking, but they're

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:05.760
thinking beautiful thoughts.

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.870
They're thinking
wonderful thoughts.

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:08.300
That's because they're
wonderful people.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.424
I'm not a wonderful person.

00:16:09.424 --> 00:16:11.400
That's why I'm thinking
such stupid thoughts.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.170
I'm thinking such
petty thoughts.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:15.809
I'm thinking about the
traffic flow on 9th Avenue.

00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:18.100
Why am I thinking about the
traffic flow on 9th Avenue.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:19.914
I'm not responsible
for the traffic flow.

00:16:19.914 --> 00:16:22.080
And anyway, I wrote to the
mayor's office last year.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.790
You know, and it's just
like, why am I doing that?

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:24.540
I'm so bad.

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:25.260
I'm so useless.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.440
Right?

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.960
So if we just engage in
that, if we fall into that,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.710
then not only have we extended
the period of distraction

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.160
sometimes considerably,
but it's so demoralizing.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.950
It's so exhausting.

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:46.340
We say in contrast that the
healing is in the return.

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.000
Not in never having
wandered to begin with.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.100
It's in our ability
to bounce back,

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.650
to come back with compassion.

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.190
With clarity.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:17:01.290
OK, so that's the basic platform
of the meditative process.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:06.210
And everything I talk
about in this book that

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:14.490
follows that-- resiliency,
open awareness, integrity--

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:19.180
we consider an emergent
property of those three.

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:22.650
Concentration, mindfulness,
and compassion.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:26.720
That's how they get
developed in a real way.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:32.060
So that the platform is
really using these tools

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.130
as a kind of skills
training, just

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:36.510
like I learned way back when.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.120
It doesn't have to be
involved, needless to say,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.230
in a belief system, or a dogma,
or a certain kind of tradition,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.980
even.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:51.430
But just a kind of practical
application of these tools.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.470
I consider that a very
interesting moment

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:56.140
too, because there
is a big difference

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:59.480
between thinking about
them and doing them.

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.620
It's of course so much
easier to think about them

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.250
than to actually do them.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.160
There's something-- it's almost
like alchemy in that moment--

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.230
where we're not deferring,
and we're not postponing.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:13.090
And we're saying, let me
see if this is true for me.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:17.940
It's like a grand
experiment that we make.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:19.680
One of the ways
this particular book

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:26.900
came about for me was born from
a previous book of mine which

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.470
is called real
happiness, which is

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:35.150
like a template for establishing
a meditation program in one's

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.690
life.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:40.060
And that book came out
a couple of years ago.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.080
And subsequent to
that, in February,

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.200
we ran a challenge on my website
where people could sign up

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.340
and we asked them to blog
or comment and describe

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.730
their own meditation practice.

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.370
And we asked everyone,
please be honest.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.745
Unless you actually sat down
and 10 seconds later you

00:18:58.745 --> 00:19:02.670
were floating away in a cloud
of bliss, don't say that.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.310
You know, lets really create
an authentic community

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.990
by disclosing what our
experience actually is.

00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:10.980
So people did that,
and it was so beautiful

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.020
and so interesting.

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.660
And at the same time,
it seemed clearer

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:22.760
that even given the wide variety
of occupations that people were

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.470
engaged in-- from firefighters,
an undercover policewoman,

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.730
and lots of tech people, and
school teachers, and nurses,

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:34.610
and all kinds of people-- one
of the most challenging arenas

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:40.590
to take these values and
make them real was work.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:46.210
So then I began to look at, OK,
let's say that you understand

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:50.120
and practice some amount
of stabilizing attention,

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.170
and refining attention
through mindfulness,

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.890
and knowing how to
begin again, and having

00:19:54.890 --> 00:19:57.325
that deepening of
compassion-- what

00:19:57.325 --> 00:20:00.730
does that look like
in the workplace.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.740
What might it look
like, and how might you

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:06.940
take that and make it real.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:09.090
So it's not just a nice thought.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:13.710
They say that the greatest
predictor of happiness at work

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.884
is a sense of meaning.

00:20:15.884 --> 00:20:18.300
And that's very interesting,
because sometimes the meaning

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.210
comes not at all from
the job description,

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:26.570
but it can come from what
we bring to that job.

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:27.760
How we are.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.190
First of all, there's a
sense of doing a craft well.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.890
Having great integrity
and fullness.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:37.420
In doing just the best
we can do at something.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.460
And it also comes from
any kind of communication

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.950
and connection.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.840
Realizing that when we
relate to somebody else,

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.530
whether it's a
colleague, or a client,

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:51.920
or whatever it is-- that
is a meaningful moment.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.990
It's not just nothing.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:56.320
It's not negligible.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.270
And that we can use
that encounter, whatever

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:05.020
it is, toward the
well being of not only

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.830
a mission, but
that other person.

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:10.710
And I find that with
any kind of job.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:11.950
It is really interesting.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:15.620
And I'll just close--
before we start

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:19.050
sitting for a few minutes,
and then do questions--

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:24.740
with what is, I think, my
favorite story from the book.

00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:27.670
And that is this time-- I love
telling this story in New York

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.710
City because you don't need a
huge, long preamble about taxis

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.170
and changes of
shift, but anyway.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:40.930
It was one of those hours when
it's so, so hard to get a taxi.

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.100
And I was further downtown,
and I was on my way

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:49.050
to Midtown, New York to try to
hear the Vietnamese Zen teacher

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.950
Thich Nhat Hanh give a lecture.

00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:54.230
And it was just that time,
and I couldn't get a cab,

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.780
and then a cab finally stopped.

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.870
And of course the
lights were off,

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:01.250
and they ask where you're
going, so that they

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.280
could see if your
destination matches

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:05.636
where they need to
drop off the cab.

00:22:05.636 --> 00:22:08.520
And so I told him, and
he said, OK get in.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.240
So I got in a cab,
and then we got

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.850
stuck in the most unbelievable,
awful, unthinkable unbearable

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:17.970
traffic.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.960
I'd never seen anything like it.

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.990
And we were just crawling
along, going nowhere.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.475
And my first thought
was, oh great,

00:22:25.475 --> 00:22:28.110
I'm not going to
make the lecture.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:32.080
I then I really felt very bad
in terms of the cab driver.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.030
I thought, he was
nice enough to stop.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:37.060
His shift was over.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.400
I don't know if he gets
penalized in some way.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.290
I don't know if he has to
pay a fine in some way.

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:46.690
And I said to him,
I am so sorry.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.280
It was really good
of you to stop,

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.820
and now I've never
seen traffic like this.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.300
It's just unbelievable.

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:54.700
I am so, so sorry.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:23:00.680
And he said to me, Madam,
traffic is not your fault.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:05.210
And then he said,
nor is it mine.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:06.990
And I thought, wow.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.540
First of all, I
don't have to get

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:11.550
to the lecture, because I just
had an enlightened cab driver,

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:16.360
and that was like my nugget
of wisdom for the day.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.450
And I kept thinking about that
second comment, nor is it mine.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.340
And I thought about
how many times in a day

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.380
he's usually blamed for
something that's not his fault.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.760
Bridge is closed,
traffic's crazy.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.700
Some other driver
does something else.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:36.240
And I thought, what wisdom
not to take that on.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.830
And I thought, OK, there it is.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:42.810
There's an encounter that
was really, really important.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:47.120
So I think that's a
wonderful example of what

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.975
we bring to any job
that we do, and how

00:23:49.975 --> 00:23:53.260
it can really make a difference.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.200
OK, so let's do some meditation.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:55.920
Is that OK?

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.100
So, we say the essence
of meditation practice

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:07.750
is balance, that's interesting.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:12.670
Instead of our normal,
maybe more acquisitive frame

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.752
of mind-- like if I
have a big insight soon,

00:24:15.752 --> 00:24:16.710
I can get up and leave.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:24.490
The whole sensibility is that
the insight, everything else

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.270
we want, will
emerge from bringing

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.980
our system into greater balance.

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.430
So they say some balance
is experienced right away

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.400
in our posture.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.900
See if your back
can be straight,

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.450
without being strained
or over-arched.

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:40.570
You want some energy,
but not so much energy

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:43.190
that you're really
rigid and uptight.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.030
You also want to be
relaxed, but not so relaxed

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:49.670
that you're way slumped over,
nearly bound to fall asleep.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.510
And we'll start just
by listening to sound,

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.780
whether it's the sound of
my voice, or other sounds.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:06.180
It's the way of
relaxing deep inside.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:08.615
Allowing our experience
to come and go.

00:25:14.264 --> 00:25:16.680
Of course we like certain
sounds and we don't like others.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.080
But we don't have to chase after
them to hold on, or push away.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.490
Just let it come, let it go.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:10.930
And bring your attention to the
feeling of your body sitting,

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.370
whatever sensations
you discover.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.280
Bring your attention
to your hands.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:49.350
See if you can make the shift
from the more conceptual level,

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:53.420
let go fingers, to the
world of direct sensation.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.250
Picking up, pulsing,
throbbing, pressure.

00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.495
Whatever it might be.

00:26:58.495 --> 00:27:00.620
You don't have to name
these things, but feel them.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:30.450
And then bring your attention
to the feeling of your breath.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:33.200
Just the normal, natural breath.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.710
Wherever it's clearest
or strongest for you.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:40.690
Maybe that's the nostrils,
or the chest, or the abdomen.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.067
If you find that place, you
can bring your attention

00:27:43.067 --> 00:27:43.900
there and just rest.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.630
See if you can feel one breath.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:09.250
If you like, you can use a quiet
mental notation of in, out--

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.630
or rising, falling--
to help support

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:16.460
the awareness of the
breath, but very quiet.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.110
So that your attention,
your attention

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.790
is really going to
feeling the breath.

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:16.750
And if images, or sounds,
or sensations, or emotions

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:20.740
should arise-- but they're
not all that strong-- if you

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.170
can stay connected to the
feeling of the breath,

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.672
just let them flow on by.

00:29:24.672 --> 00:29:25.380
You're breathing.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.360
But if something
comes up with a bang,

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.370
and it just pulls you away, you
get lost in thought, spun out

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:37.220
in a fantasy, or you fall
asleep, don't worry about it.

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:43.660
The most important moment
of the whole process

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:46.146
is considered to be that moment.

00:29:46.146 --> 00:29:48.645
That's the moment we have the
chance to be really different.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.070
So instead of judging yourself,
and condemning yourself,

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:59.890
see if you can gently let go.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.670
And shepherd your attention back
to the feeling of the breath.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:11.020
If you have to let go and
begin again, like 10,000 times,

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.457
in the next few minutes,
that's really OK.

00:30:13.457 --> 00:30:14.290
That's the training.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.065
And when you feel ready,
you can open your eyes.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.420
So, we have a little time for
questions or comments, anything

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.810
you'd like to talk about.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:27.670
And those two mics are there.

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:31.410
If you can make your way over
there, that would be great.

00:33:38.159 --> 00:33:38.700
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.210
SHARON SALZBERG: Hi.

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:43.670
AUDIENCE: I have been meditating
for a couple of years now.

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:44.669
Actually, things to you.

00:33:44.669 --> 00:33:47.840
I took some of your
classes at the Tibet House.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.850
And I find that I'm
still struggling

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:53.060
with this very
basic thing, which

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.240
is how to focus on the breath
without controlling the breath.

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.530
And I've tried all kinds
of tricks, and some of them

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.680
occasionally work.

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:01.540
Most of them don't.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.906
And I wondered if you
had any thought on that.

00:34:04.906 --> 00:34:07.200
SHARON SALZBERG:
What are your tricks?

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:10.219
AUDIENCE: One of them was to
focus-- instead of focusing

00:34:10.219 --> 00:34:14.760
on the most prominent
place where the breath is,

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.400
to focus on something else
that's affected by the breath,

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.269
such as, like, my
shoulders, and how

00:34:19.269 --> 00:34:20.560
they're affected by the breath.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.389
And then I don't control
it quite as much.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:24.870
SHARON SALZBERG: Right, OK.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.920
First of all, I
wouldn't worry so much

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.310
about controlling the breath.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:32.889
It doesn't need to become the
major project of your practice.

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:37.830
The reason we say don't
is more to counter

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.820
the tendency we would have to
feel, well I'm not breathing

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.010
deeply enough, properly,
appropriately, skillfully,

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:45.219
whatever it is.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:48.080
And thereby making it a
breath exercise, rather than

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.480
an awareness exercise.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:53.350
So, if you find that you're
controlling the breath somewhat

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.770
and it's not exhausting
you, it's OK.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:56.780
Don't worry about it.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:03.430
A lot of what we talk about in
terms of controlling the breath

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:06.160
is creating a kind of balance.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.630
So that would mean
spaciousness, openness.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.760
So that the breath
feels like it's

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.930
happening in a bigger space.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:17.170
And so, people-- it is
like a personal experiment

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.880
that people make--
just to see what helps

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.740
create more that sense of space.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:26.080
For some people, it's as
simple as listening to sound.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.970
Which tends to be more
expansive in awareness.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:31.950
Or feeling your whole
body, and feeling

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:35.580
the breath happening
within the body.

00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:39.060
It may be that if you're
mostly with the breath

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.900
at the nostrils, that
switching to the abdomen

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.789
will have a different
sense to it.

00:35:46.789 --> 00:35:47.830
So it's things like that.

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:49.670
It's just kind of playing.

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:52.550
Not with a sense of like,
I've got to correct this.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:55.530
But just to see if you
can create some balance.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.455
AUDIENCE: Right, OK.

00:35:56.455 --> 00:35:56.955
Thank you.

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:07.340
AUDIENCE: Hi Sharon, thank
you for coming, or Salzberg.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:09.590
I've been meditating
for quite some time,

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:13.870
and the example you brought
up about sending the letter

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:16.860
to the mayor, and those
demoralizing thoughts-- one

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.890
thing that I've practiced
is making them positive.

00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:23.510
My fear is that it
kind of gives you

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:28.660
this sense of maybe false
value, or arrogance.

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.512
Have you seen that happen
to people in the past?

00:36:31.512 --> 00:36:33.720
SHARON SALZBERG: So you have
those kinds of thoughts,

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.994
and then you switch them?

00:36:35.994 --> 00:36:37.410
AUDIENCE: To very
positive, right?

00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:40.170
Like, wow, I sent a
letter to the mayor.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:44.710
Like, I have all this
power, or you know--

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:48.120
SHARON SALZBERG: I don't
think that's a problem.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:51.400
I think ultimately all
those different methods,

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:55.330
and the things we try, and the
tricks, and the ways we play,

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:59.930
are all aimed toward creating
a more balanced relationship

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:01.870
to our experience.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:05.850
And if that's what helps you see
the thought as just a thought,

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:09.920
and not take it so to heart,
and not be so embroiled in it,

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.200
it's great.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.020
The way I usually work
is more like-- myself,

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:17.270
in my own practices.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.890
You know, sometimes
I tell the story

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:24.950
about once having seen a cartoon
from the Peanuts comic strip.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:29.140
I saw it in a house that some
friends had rented for several

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.740
of us to do a retreat
in, and it was

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.430
left on the desk in the bedroom
that had been set aside for me.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:37.220
So, in the first
frame of the cartoon,

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.722
Lucy is talking
to Charlie Brown,

00:37:38.722 --> 00:37:40.430
and she says, oh you
know, Charlie Brown,

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:43.300
what your problem is--
the problem with you

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.720
is that you're you.

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:48.371
And then in the second frame,
poor Charlie Brown looks at her

00:37:48.371 --> 00:37:51.120
and says, well what in the
world can I do about that?

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.240
And then in the third
and final frame,

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:56.030
Lucy says, I don't pretend
to be able to give advice,

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:59.130
I merely point out the problem.

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:01.710
And somehow whenever I
was walking by that desk,

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.950
my eye would fall
right on that line.

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:06.980
The problem with you
is that you're you.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:11.160
Because that Lucy voice had
been so amazingly predominant

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.120
in my earlier life.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:16.841
And I felt that one of the
techniques that I have been

00:38:16.841 --> 00:38:18.340
trained in, in terms
of mindfulness,

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:19.920
is called mental noting.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.180
Where you quietly place a
label if the word comes easily

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.720
on your predominant experience.

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.470
So, I felt like seeing
that cartoon gave me

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:31.480
a new mental note, which
was kind of like, hi Lucy.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:34.700
Or my favorite form of
that was, chill out Lucy.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.400
You know, something great
would happen for me,

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.100
and my next thought
would be, it's never

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.950
going to happen again.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:43.270
And I could say, chill out Lucy.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.340
You know, so it's not
like all freaked out,

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.800
like Lucy's still here after
all these years of meditating.

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.490
Or, yes Lucy, you're right.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:51.950
You're always right.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:54.390
But it's a very different
kind of relationship--

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:58.320
of recognition, balance,
a little bit of space,

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.780
a little bit of humor.

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.420
Some tenderness,
some compassion,

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.930
and an ability to let go.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:05.620
Like, OK, I see you.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.320
So that's one way of working.

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:11.140
And if it works for
you to work with kind

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:16.750
of molding the thoughts, or
seeing them in a different way,

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:20.042
then that's just another
way of bringing balance.

00:39:20.042 --> 00:39:20.750
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:23.419 --> 00:39:23.960
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.340
SHARON SALZBERG: Hi.

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.480
AUDIENCE 3: I just
had a question.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.730
I've kind of been a meditation
dabbler for a number of years.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.890
But I've never had
a long term teacher.

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:36.370
But I did have long
term music teachers.

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:41.450
And I just wonder if
this instruction you gave

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.735
is similar to instruction
I've heard elsewhere.

00:39:43.735 --> 00:39:46.210
And I guess I just
wonder, if you've

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.450
been doing it for a
long time, or whatever

00:39:49.450 --> 00:39:51.330
your experience was.

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:54.179
If kind of by analogy,
what we do now

00:39:54.179 --> 00:39:55.470
is sort of like playing scales.

00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:56.928
And then when you're
at your level,

00:39:56.928 --> 00:39:59.910
it's like you're playing
Brahms concertos or something.

00:39:59.910 --> 00:40:02.070
If it's like a really
fundamentally, amazingly

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:06.140
different experience, or if
you could somehow speak to what

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.630
the processes is like.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.838
SHARON SALZBERG: Yeah, I
mean in some ways I actually

00:40:09.838 --> 00:40:13.210
see the instruction as a
fractal, which fascinates me.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:14.760
Like, the very
first instruction I

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:18.170
ever got, when I went to
India all those years ago,

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:21.410
and began my meditation
practice, which

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:23.750
was in the context of an
intensive 10 day retreat.

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:25.710
Because it took
me awhile to find

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:27.905
just the kind of practical,
pragmatic approach

00:40:27.905 --> 00:40:29.450
I was looking for.

00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.150
That was the first
instruction I heard.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.210
Sit down and feel your breath.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:34.650
And I was very dismissive.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.250
I thought, feel my breath?

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.100
I came all the way to India.

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.342
Where's the magnificent,
fantastic, esoteric technique

00:40:41.342 --> 00:40:43.050
that's going to wipe
out all my suffering

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.280
and make me a
totally happy person.

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.169
I thought, feel my breath?

00:40:47.169 --> 00:40:48.710
I could have stayed
in Buffalo, where

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:51.060
I was going to school,
to feel my breath.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.930
And then I thought,
how hard can this be.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:56.500
And then I was like,
whoa, this is not so easy.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:00.180
So there's so much contained
in that simple instruction.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.710
Settle your mind in the moment.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:05.250
Realize you're
distracted, and come back.

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.010
There's a huge
amount there that has

00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:12.620
ramifications and implications
for something so much bigger.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:18.860
So, in a way I'm still playing
the scales 40 years later.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:21.110
And another way, of
course my experience

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.390
is completely different.

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:29.100
I think I was so self-judgmental
in the kind of level of anguish

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:34.290
that I experienced and
expressed when I was distracted,

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:39.120
or I had an emotion I didn't
like and was very strong.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.660
And now it's much more
like, hey, chill out Lucy.

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.400
Which makes a big difference.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.750
I think there's a
common trajectory

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.740
that people go through
depending on what motivates you.

00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.560
In the beginning,
there's a trajectory

00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:01.370
toward greater and greater
inclusivity and compassion

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.430
that's born out of wisdom.

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:09.890
Like, it's not forced.

00:42:09.890 --> 00:42:15.220
It's not something that you
feel obliged to develop.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.500
It's just something shifts.

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:22.500
So that even if you're
thinking about your job,

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.910
there's just a
kind of recognition

00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:29.390
of how many other people need
to do their jobs in a good way

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.740
so that you can do
your job in a good way.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:33.240
Right?

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:35.770
That we're not so isolated,
were not so alone.

00:42:35.770 --> 00:42:38.060
That we exist as part of
networks, and patterns,

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.900
and a bigger fabric of life.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:45.160
Or, my very favorite reflection,
which we could do right now,

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.912
is how many people come
to mind as having played

00:42:49.912 --> 00:42:52.370
any kind of role in your being
here in this room right now.

00:42:55.771 --> 00:42:56.270
Right?

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:58.860
Because we're all
here because-- myself

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.700
included-- because of
conversations, and encounters,

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:04.140
and relationships.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.310
And somebody gave us a
book, or someone told us

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:09.760
about their meditation practice,
or whatever it might be.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.480
It's just layers, and
layers, and layers.

00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.640
So this moment in
time is actually

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:17.240
a confluence of connections.

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.660
As is every moment in time.

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:21.570
And so, whereas in
the beginning that

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:23.780
might have seemed like
an abstract notion

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.940
to me-- because I saw it,
and saw it, and saw it, to be

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.950
true-- then it's just, it's
just different in those ways.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:38.480
And so, one of things I really
love about meditation practice

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:43.890
is the level in which
it seems to change us.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:47.720
Because it's not deliberative,
and it's not studied.

00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:53.350
In the sense that you're
not encountering a stranger

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:57.440
and feeling disinterested, and
then thinking, well, you know,

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.270
I just did an eight week
meditation class on compassion.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.650
And I really should
force myself to smile,

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.210
and pretend to be interested.

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:08.550
It's not like that.

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:11.740
There's just shifts that go on.

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:14.270
So that these things
come much more naturally.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:19.300
Remember when the Dalai Lama was
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:22.080
one of my friends said,
giving the Dalai Lama

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.200
a peace prize is like giving
mother nature an art award.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.740
But his level of
compassion-- I thought of him

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.910
because I've seen him meet
many strangers, obviously,

00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:33.700
of all kinds.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.280
And he always
seems to be present

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.901
and interested and caring.

00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:39.150
You don't get the feeling
he's sitting there thinking,

00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.440
oh God, not you.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.720
Not five more people,
I can't believe it.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.590
But I am the Dalai Lama, so
I better act like I care.

00:44:49.590 --> 00:44:53.870
There seems to be a very
authentic sense of presence.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:56.260
But he's the one that gets
up at like 3:00 every morning

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.540
and practices for three hours.

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:58.870
It didn't just happen.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:02.470
But the changes become embodied.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:04.930
They become more
natural in that way.

00:45:08.289 --> 00:45:08.830
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.260
SHARON SALZBERG: Hi.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.830
AUDIENCE: So, when I think about
mindfulness in everyday life,

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:17.890
not specifically just
during meditation,

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.880
and I think about the
distractions that all of us

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.200
have in life here.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.340
It's usually a vibrating phone,
or an email alert or something.

00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:29.870
But then also with all of
the other people that you've

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:31.860
met in various
professions, I'm wondering

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:37.590
if there were any more practical
tips, or just general things

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.540
that worked for people.

00:45:39.540 --> 00:45:41.690
Whether it was ignoring
those distractions,

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:45.712
or making a note of
them, and what works.

00:45:45.712 --> 00:45:46.670
SHARON SALZBERG: Great.

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:52.344
So what tends to work is
ritualizing kinds of pauses.

00:45:52.344 --> 00:45:54.010
You know, they don't--
well, two things.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:57.850
One is uni-tasking every now and
then, instead of multitasking.

00:45:57.850 --> 00:46:00.260
And the other is
ritualizing certain pauses.

00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:05.580
They don't have to be--
neither has to be very lengthy.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.480
But, we need them to
punctuate our day.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.890
So that they're repeated.

00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:17.380
And in terms of
pauses, for example

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:21.000
a very classic example
would be don't pick up

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.840
the phone on the first ring.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.920
Let it ring three
times, and breath.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.130
And then you pick it up.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:29.100
It's almost unbearable
to think about.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:35.930
But if you actually do it,
it's like-- in those moments,

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:37.840
we can return to ourselves.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.190
Because usually what
happens, as you are implying,

00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:44.010
is that we get caught in
this kind of crazy momentum.

00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:47.204
And we're taken so far away
from ourselves that we're just--

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:48.870
and we're getting
increasingly agitated,

00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:51.210
and then it's harder
to return because we

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.030
know it's going to feel
comfortable when we come back.

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:57.140
But if we just kind of
regularly come back.

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.510
We come back to the moment.

00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:59.770
We come back to ourselves.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:01.810
We can utilize something
like the breath, which

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:04.000
is with us-- I was
going to say always,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.546
except I learned in doing
an interview for this book,

00:47:09.546 --> 00:47:13.730
the journalist told me there
was such a thing as email apnea.

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:15.690
Which I hadn't known before.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:18.460
That people tend to stop
breathing, actually,

00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.085
checking email.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:27.410
Which is also interesting,
and kind of dreadful.

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:30.370
But, since we're breathing
most of the time,

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:33.780
and we could be breathing
more if we're mindful,

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.310
it's a great vehicle
for just coming back.

00:47:36.310 --> 00:47:39.920
And once we come back to the
moment, and to ourselves,

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.507
we're also coming back to
our sense of priorities,

00:47:42.507 --> 00:47:43.340
our sense of values.

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.472
They're just apparent to
us, whereas they're not

00:47:46.472 --> 00:47:48.430
when we're just kind of
caught in the momentum.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:50.740
And then uni-tasking.

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.460
I'm sure you know studies
show that multitasking isn't

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.300
as great as what
it's made out to be,

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.470
in that we're actually
not more effective,

00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:59.720
we're not more efficient,
we're not getting more done.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.610
So even though we've got
this huge amount to do,

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:05.290
and it seems like it will
get done the best if we do it

00:48:05.290 --> 00:48:08.880
all at once, it's not going
to happen in a good way.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:11.680
And so, here too,
it's like a question

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.370
of ritualizing or committing.

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:17.320
Like three times a day, if
I'm drinking a cup of tea,

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:20.690
or drinking a cup of coffee,
I'm going to just do that.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:22.740
I'm not going to do
that, and check my email,

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:27.040
and have a phone conversation,
and watch the news on TV.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.910
And if we if we can get into
that habit of just bringing

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:34.030
mindfulness in these short
momen-- one of my teachers

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:37.400
said short moments
many times-- then it

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.184
will make a very big difference.

00:48:39.184 --> 00:48:40.350
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.350
SHARON SALZBERG: Uh huh.

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.157
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:47.157 --> 00:48:47.990
SHARON SALZBERG: Hi.

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:49.990
AUDIENCE: So, my
question is on oneness,

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.170
which you touched on
a little bit earlier,

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.340
but I was hoping we could
dive into more detail.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:57.930
So, in New York
City, and at work,

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:01.610
we can often get
caught up in I. I'm

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.780
late for work, I need a taxi.

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:05.410
I want that promotion.

00:49:05.410 --> 00:49:08.020
I'd like to be the one
to improve that algorithm

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:11.180
product, et cetera.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:15.520
Google is great at fostering
a we driven environment,

00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:17.630
but how can we on
a personal level

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:21.060
use our practice to connect
with that idea of oneness

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:23.490
and become closer
to it, and really

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:28.100
indoctrinate it
into our daily work.

00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.110
SHARON SALZBERG: One
of their reflections

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:32.910
that we do-- I mean, I
think one answer is actually

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:37.610
a kind of loving kindness
meditation, or training,

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:41.770
so that we really look at others
rather than look through them.

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:45.660
And that we, you
know if you think

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.520
about the people
you might normally

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.990
encounter who are kind
of neutral for you,

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:52.050
like check-out person
at the supermarket,

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:55.140
or whatever it might be.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.590
Where we do tend to create
an other out of indifference.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:02.020
Not antipathy, or prejudice,
but just indifference.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:03.580
And you make the
experiment, what

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.470
happens when I actually
look at somebody, instead

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.050
of look through them.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:13.654
And in terms of work, as well,
there's a certain remembrance

00:50:13.654 --> 00:50:16.070
that first of all, everybody's
a human being and everybody

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:17.110
wants to be happy.

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:19.280
It doesn't mean you're
not competing, sometimes,

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.970
or whatever it might be.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:26.260
But there's a
certain remembrance,

00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.520
and you actually can do it
as a kind of reflection.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.340
Everybody's a human being, and
everybody wants to be happy.

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:36.230
And sometimes a corollary
to that is everybody

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:37.190
makes mistakes.

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:40.140
So, after I'd written the
book, in addition to-- now

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:43.320
I'm in that phase where
it's after the book,

00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:45.169
so now I'm learning
all these other things,

00:50:45.169 --> 00:50:47.460
and all these people are
bringing anecdotes, and stuff,

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.000
and I think oh damn.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.025
But anyway.

00:50:51.025 --> 00:50:53.400
After I'd written the book,
I was teaching somewhere here

00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:55.060
in New York, and
some it came to me

00:50:55.060 --> 00:51:00.600
and said all week long my
boss has been like a tyrant

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:02.586
in a very uncharacteristic way.

00:51:02.586 --> 00:51:04.210
And she's been really
unfair, and she's

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:07.390
been really off-putting
and critical,

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:10.520
and it was only sitting here
meditating that it occurred

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.980
to me for the first time, maybe
she's going through something.

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.940
Maybe something hard is
happening in her life.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:19.940
And I said to her, well do you
have the kind of relationship

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:22.390
where you can ask her,
is anything going on?

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:24.642
She said, you know
actually I do.

00:51:24.642 --> 00:51:26.670
But I thought that was
an interesting moment.

00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:31.420
It's like we don't usually
we stop, and think,

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.520
oh maybe that person
has something going on.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.520
Because we're just engaged in
defensive or reactive mode.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:41.420
I think it's just a very
powerful reflection.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:44.930
Everybody's a human being, and
everybody wants to be happy.

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:46.930
And of course the
fear is that that's

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:49.020
going to make us sort of
weak, and sentimental,

00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.750
and kind of gooey, and we're
going to lose our edge.

00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:56.020
But I think the reality, of
course, is not that at all.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.950
It's just-- it is
more as you say,

00:51:57.950 --> 00:52:00.670
a kind of we
consciousness within which

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:03.480
we can be quite strong.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:08.500
So, I think we need to
stop, but maybe one more.

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.100
Just finish.

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.635
AUDIENCE: Thanks for being here.

00:52:12.635 --> 00:52:13.100
SHARON SALZBERG: Sure.

00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.460
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about loving kindness

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.410
meditation.

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:17.595
I've sort of practiced
mindfulness meditation

00:52:17.595 --> 00:52:20.830
on and off for a couple
years, but every time I've

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:22.920
tried to get into loving
kindness it ends up

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:25.130
being much easier to
direct positive thoughts

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:26.499
externally than internally.

00:52:26.499 --> 00:52:28.790
And I guess that's the order--
you start with yourself,

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:31.755
and then the ones close to
you, and then sort of neutral.

00:52:31.755 --> 00:52:33.130
Understanding that
probably comes

00:52:33.130 --> 00:52:35.360
from some sort of
self-judgement place,

00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.030
is there a set of
tricks or something,

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.560
like something that makes
that barrier easier to cross.

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:41.610
SHARON SALZBERG: I'll
teach you the basic trick.

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:43.840
Don't start with yourself.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.830
No, truly.

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:46.892
The principle of loving
kindness practice,

00:52:46.892 --> 00:52:49.350
where instead of gathering our
attention around the feeling

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:51.500
of the breath, we're
gathering our attention

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:55.590
around the silent repetition
of certain phrases.

00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.810
Very simple phrases,
like may I be happy.

00:52:57.810 --> 00:53:00.710
Or may you be happy,
something like that.

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:04.030
And the principle,
classically, is

00:53:04.030 --> 00:53:07.820
that it's supposed to be done
in the easiest way possible.

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:12.806
And the reality is that
starting with ourselves, which

00:53:12.806 --> 00:53:14.680
is how you're supposed
to start, because it's

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.630
said to be easiest,
is not always easiest.

00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:20.130
Sometimes it's
really, really hard.

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:22.990
So I always go back to
that fundamental principle

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:24.970
of doing it in the
easiest way possible.

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:28.250
Because part of what's
developing along

00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:31.350
with the loving kindness
is confidence and clarity.

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:33.050
It's understanding
the difference

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:37.840
between maybe having compassion
for someone else and giving in.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.650
Or understanding what it
feels like to have compassion

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:43.080
for yourself and someone else.

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:46.530
Or, there's a lot that is
developing all along the way,

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:52.380
and so it's worth
not struggling.

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.470
It doesn't mean you
never include yourself,

00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:55.440
because you have to.

00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.475
But it doesn't have
to be right away.

00:53:57.475 --> 00:53:58.225
It really doesn't.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:02.390
OK, thank you.

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:07.843
[APPLAUSE]
