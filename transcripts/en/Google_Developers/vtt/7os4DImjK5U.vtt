00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.542
Peter Vesterbecka: Yeah, so we
just released our first version

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:09.292
for the biggest platform out there.

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:12.750
So, we released Angry Birds for the web
together with the Chrome team.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.375
So, that's actually now available
in the Chrome Web Store.

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:20.917
So we built this using like
some of the latest HTML features,

00:00:20.917 --> 00:00:23.000
so this is all WebGL.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.958
Okay. We also support Canvas for people
that don't have WebGL in their browser.

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:31.917
We used the Google Web Toolkit,
so we built this all in Java.

00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:35.375
Then we're using a bunch of
other stuff like the App cache.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.208
So again being in the Chrome Web Store, 

00:00:38.208 --> 00:00:40.083
we have access to a bit more storage

00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:44.875
so we can actually support the complete
Angry Birds game experience

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:46.542
when you're offline as well.

00:00:46.542 --> 00:00:49.917
So, there's a lot of cool stuff
that went into this.

00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:54.458
Yeah, so we brought this whole
Chrome dimension.

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:58.167
So it's a set of exclusive levels
that are only available in Chrome.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.417
So that's something that
you should definitely check out.

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:05.542
There are seven levels in the Chrome
dimension and they're all very Chrome-y.
