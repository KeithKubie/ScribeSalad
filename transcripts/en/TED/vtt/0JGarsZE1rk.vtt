00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:14.954
I have never been arrested,

00:00:14.978 --> 00:00:16.841
never spent a night in jail,

00:00:16.865 --> 00:00:20.686
never had a loved one
thrown into the back of a squad car

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.366
or behind bars,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.827
or be at the mercy of a scary,
confusing system

00:00:26.851 --> 00:00:29.901
that at best sees them with indifference,

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:31.758
and at worst as monstrous.

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:36.229
The United States of America locks up
more people than any other nation

00:00:36.253 --> 00:00:37.660
on the planet,

00:00:37.684 --> 00:00:40.591
and Louisiana is our biggest incarcerator.

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:44.177
Most of you are probably like me --

00:00:44.201 --> 00:00:45.352
lucky.

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:49.537
The closest we get to crime and punishment
is likely what we see on TV.

00:00:50.102 --> 00:00:51.433
While making "Unprisoned,"

00:00:51.457 --> 00:00:53.759
I met a woman who used to be like us --

00:00:53.783 --> 00:00:54.933
Sheila Phipps.

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:58.104
(Recording) Sheila Phipps:
Before my son went to jail,

00:00:58.128 --> 00:01:00.108
I used to see people be on television,

00:01:00.132 --> 00:01:03.921
fighting, saying, "Oh, this person
didn't do it and this person is innocent."

00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:06.659
And you know, you snub them
or you dismiss them,

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:08.703
and like, "Yeah, whatever."

00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:09.878
Don't get me wrong,

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:12.406
there's a lot of people
who deserve to be in prison.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.250
There's a lot of criminals out here.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.473
But there are a lot of innocent
people that's in jail.

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:21.703
EA: Sheila's son, McKinley,
is one of those innocent people.

00:01:21.727 --> 00:01:26.587
He served 17 years of a 30-year sentence
on a manslaughter charge.

00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:28.410
He had no previous convictions,

00:01:28.434 --> 00:01:31.012
there was no forensic
evidence in the case.

00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:35.147
He was convicted solely
on the basis of eyewitness testimony,

00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:37.330
and decades of research have shown

00:01:37.354 --> 00:01:40.226
that eyewitness testimony
isn't as reliable

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.150
as we once believed it to be.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.694
Scientists say that memory isn't precise.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.551
It's less like playing back a video,

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:51.026
and more like putting together a puzzle.

00:01:51.997 --> 00:01:57.489
Since 1989, when DNA testing
was first used to free innocent people,

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:02.962
over 70 percent of overturned convictions
were based on eyewitness testimony.

00:02:03.784 --> 00:02:05.090
Last year,

00:02:05.114 --> 00:02:08.993
the district attorney whose office
prosecuted McKinley's case

00:02:09.017 --> 00:02:12.503
was convicted of unrelated
corruption charges.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.765
When this district attorney
of 30 years stepped down,

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.717
the eyewitnesses
from McKinley's case came forward

00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:24.200
and said that they had been pressured
into testifying by the district attorneys,

00:02:24.224 --> 00:02:27.105
pressure which included
the threat of jail time.

00:02:27.465 --> 00:02:30.392
Despite this, McKinley is still in prison.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.981
(Recording) SP: Before this happened,

00:02:33.005 --> 00:02:34.461
I never would've thought it.

00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:38.115
And well, I guess it's hard
for me to imagine

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.695
that these things is going on, you know,

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.972
until this happened to my son.

00:02:43.504 --> 00:02:45.144
It really opened my eyes.

00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:48.068
It really, really opened my eyes.

00:02:48.092 --> 00:02:49.546
I ain't gonna lie to you.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.963
EA: Estimates of how many innocent
people are locked up

00:02:53.987 --> 00:02:56.677
range between one and four percent,

00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:58.707
which maybe doesn't sound like a lot,

00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:02.916
except that it amounts
to around 87,000 people:

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.314
mothers, fathers, sons locked up,

00:03:06.338 --> 00:03:07.687
often for decades,

00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:09.917
for crimes they did not commit.

00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:13.013
And that's not even counting
the roughly half a million people

00:03:13.037 --> 00:03:15.269
who have been convicted of nothing --

00:03:15.293 --> 00:03:17.166
those presumed innocent,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.023
but who are too poor to bail out of jail

00:03:20.047 --> 00:03:23.906
and therefore sit behind bars
for weeks upon months,

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.099
waiting for their case to come to trial --

00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:27.804
or much more likely,

00:03:27.828 --> 00:03:30.184
waiting to take a plea just to get out.

00:03:30.736 --> 00:03:33.859
All of those people
have family on the outside.

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.518
(Recording) Kortney Williams: My brother
missed my high school graduation

00:03:38.542 --> 00:03:39.793
because the night before,

00:03:39.817 --> 00:03:41.318
he went to jail.

00:03:41.342 --> 00:03:43.587
My brother missed my birthday dinner

00:03:43.611 --> 00:03:46.588
because that day, actually,
he went to jail.

00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:50.146
My brother missed his own birthday dinner

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.629
because he was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

00:03:52.653 --> 00:03:55.749
(Recording) EA: So all these times
when he ended up going to jail,

00:03:55.773 --> 00:03:58.297
were charges pressed
or did he just get taken to jail?

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.872
KW: The charges would be pressed

00:03:59.896 --> 00:04:02.922
and it would have a bond posted,

00:04:02.946 --> 00:04:04.913
then the charges will get dropped ...

00:04:04.937 --> 00:04:06.391
because there was no evidence.

00:04:07.248 --> 00:04:10.202
EA: I met Kortney Williams
when I went to her college classroom

00:04:10.226 --> 00:04:11.717
to talk about "Unprisoned."

00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:15.136
She ended up interviewing her aunt,
Troylynn Robertson,

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.310
for an episode.

00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:19.709
(Recording) KW: With everything
that you went through

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:20.884
with your children,

00:04:20.908 --> 00:04:22.890
what is any advice that you would give me

00:04:22.914 --> 00:04:24.823
if I had any kids?

00:04:25.827 --> 00:04:29.058
(Recording) Troylynn Roberston:
I would tell you when you have them,

00:04:29.082 --> 00:04:32.138
you know the first thing
that will initially come to mind is love

00:04:32.162 --> 00:04:34.134
and protection,

00:04:34.158 --> 00:04:35.654
but I would tell you,

00:04:35.678 --> 00:04:38.766
even much with the protection
to raise them

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.496
with knowledge of the judicial system --

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.100
you know, we always tell our kids
about the boogeyman,

00:04:46.124 --> 00:04:49.117
the bad people, who to watch out for,

00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:53.069
but we don't teach them
how to watch out for the judicial system.

00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:57.031
EA: Because of the way
our criminal legal system

00:04:57.055 --> 00:04:59.691
disproportionately targets
people of color,

00:04:59.715 --> 00:05:03.008
it's not uncommon for young people
like Kortney to know about it.

00:05:03.494 --> 00:05:07.336
When I started going into high schools
to talk to students about "Unprisoned,"

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.853
I found that roughly one-third
of the young people I spoke with

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:12.763
had a loved one behind bars.

00:05:13.504 --> 00:05:16.743
(Recording) Girl: The hardest part
is like finding out where he's at,

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:18.368
or like, when his court date is.

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.477
Girl: Yeah, he went to jail
on my first birthday.

00:05:22.415 --> 00:05:24.418
Girl: My dad works as a guard.

00:05:24.442 --> 00:05:25.970
He saw my uncle in jail.

00:05:26.527 --> 00:05:27.743
He's in there for life.

00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:31.103
EA: According to the Annie E.
Casey Foundation,

00:05:31.127 --> 00:05:36.980
the number of young people with a father
incarcerated rose 500 percent

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:39.818
between 1980 and 2000.

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.356
Over five million of today's children
will see a parent incarcerated

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.322
at some point in their childhoods.

00:05:46.798 --> 00:05:51.321
But this number disproportionately
affects African American children.

00:05:52.252 --> 00:05:54.943
By the time they reach the age of 14,

00:05:54.967 --> 00:05:58.740
one in four black children
will see their dad go off to prison.

00:05:59.198 --> 00:06:02.592
That's compared to a rate
of one in 30 for white children.

00:06:03.191 --> 00:06:08.269
One key factor determining the future
success of both inmates and their children

00:06:08.293 --> 00:06:12.642
is whether they can maintain ties
during the parent's incarceration,

00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:17.009
but prisoners' phone calls home
can cost 20 to 30 times more

00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:18.886
than regular phone calls,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.117
so many families
keep in touch through letters.

00:06:23.172 --> 00:06:25.357
(Recording: Letter being unfolded)

00:06:25.381 --> 00:06:27.588
Anissa Christmas: Dear big brother,

00:06:27.612 --> 00:06:29.443
I'm making that big 16 this year, LOL.

00:06:29.934 --> 00:06:31.593
Guess I'm not a baby anymore.

00:06:31.617 --> 00:06:33.226
You still taking me to prom?

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.499
I really miss you.

00:06:34.523 --> 00:06:36.735
You're the only guy
that kept it real with me.

00:06:37.485 --> 00:06:40.102
I wish you were here so I can vent to you.

00:06:40.695 --> 00:06:43.286
So much has happened since
the last time I seen you.

00:06:44.847 --> 00:06:46.909
(Voice breaking up) I have some good news.

00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:48.766
I won first place in the science fair.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.981
I'm a geek.

00:06:50.005 --> 00:06:52.271
We're going to regionals,
can't you believe it?

00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:54.470
High school is going by super fast.

00:06:54.893 --> 00:06:56.071
In less than two years,

00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:58.709
I hope you'll be able to see me
walk across the stage.

00:06:59.413 --> 00:07:02.318
I thought to write to you
because I know it's boring in there.

00:07:02.342 --> 00:07:04.054
I want to put a smile on your face.

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:08.077
Anissa wrote these letters to her brother

00:07:08.101 --> 00:07:10.323
when she was a sophomore in high school.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:13.278
She keeps the letters he writes to her
tucked into the frame

00:07:13.302 --> 00:07:14.480
of her bedroom mirror,

00:07:14.504 --> 00:07:16.543
and reads them over and over again.

00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:19.117
I'd like to think
that there's a good reason

00:07:19.141 --> 00:07:21.519
why Anissa's brother is locked up.

00:07:21.543 --> 00:07:25.600
We all want the wheels of justice
to properly turn,

00:07:25.624 --> 00:07:27.432
but we're coming to understand

00:07:27.456 --> 00:07:30.980
that the lofty ideals we learned
in school look really different

00:07:31.004 --> 00:07:34.337
in our nation's prisons
and jails and courtrooms.

00:07:34.943 --> 00:07:38.516
(Recording) Danny Engelberg: You walk
into that courtroom and you're just --

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.073
I've been doing this for a quite a while,
and it still catches your breath.

00:07:42.097 --> 00:07:44.635
You're like, "There are so many
people of color here,"

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:49.629
and yet I know that the city is not
made up of 90 percent African Americans,

00:07:49.653 --> 00:07:53.149
so why is it that 90 percent
of the people who are in orange

00:07:53.173 --> 00:07:54.324
are African American?

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:57.907
(Recording) EA: Public defender Danny
Engelberg isn't the only one noticing

00:07:57.931 --> 00:08:00.122
how many black people
are in municipal court --

00:08:00.146 --> 00:08:01.298
or in any court.

00:08:01.322 --> 00:08:02.500
It's hard to miss.

00:08:02.524 --> 00:08:04.795
Who's sitting in court
waiting to see the judge?

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:06.020
What do they look like?

00:08:06.044 --> 00:08:08.513
(Recording) Man: Mostly
African-Americans, like me.

00:08:08.537 --> 00:08:10.792
Man: It's mostly, I could say,
85 percent black.

00:08:10.816 --> 00:08:14.215
That's all you see in the orange,
in the box back there, who locked up.

00:08:14.239 --> 00:08:16.633
Man: Who's waiting? Mostly black.

00:08:16.657 --> 00:08:19.136
I mean, there was a couple
of white people in there.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.733
Woman: I think it was about
85 percent African-American

00:08:21.757 --> 00:08:22.954
that was sitting there.

00:08:23.923 --> 00:08:27.731
EA: How does a young black person
growing up in America today

00:08:27.755 --> 00:08:30.147
come to understand justice?

00:08:30.696 --> 00:08:33.839
Another "Unprisoned" story
was about a troupe of dancers

00:08:33.863 --> 00:08:36.173
who choreographed a piece
called "Hoods Up,"

00:08:36.197 --> 00:08:38.347
which they performed
in front of city council.

00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:42.410
Dawonta White was in the seventh grade
for that performance.

00:08:42.986 --> 00:08:47.177
(Recording) Dawonta White: We was wearing
black with hoodies because Trayvon Martin,

00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:49.488
when he was wearing his hoodie,
he was killed.

00:08:49.512 --> 00:08:50.868
So we looked upon that,

00:08:50.892 --> 00:08:53.704
and we said we're going to wear
hoodies like Trayvon Martin.

00:08:53.728 --> 00:08:55.846
(Recording) EA: Who came up
with that idea?

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.537
DW: The group. We all agreed on it.

00:08:57.561 --> 00:09:00.305
I was a little nervous,
but I had stick through it though,

00:09:00.329 --> 00:09:04.577
but I felt like it was a good thing
so they could notice what we do.

00:09:04.601 --> 00:09:07.793
(Recording) EA: Shraivell Brown
was another choreographer and dancer

00:09:07.817 --> 00:09:09.059
in "Hoods Up."

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:11.644
He says the police criticize
people who look like him.

00:09:11.668 --> 00:09:15.032
He feels judged based on things
other black people may have done.

00:09:15.056 --> 00:09:17.192
How would you want
the police to look at you,

00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:19.025
and what would you want them to think?

00:09:19.049 --> 00:09:20.348
SB: That I'm not no threat.

00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:22.421
EA: Why would they think
you're threatening?

00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:23.843
What did you say, you're 14?

00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:29.043
SB: Yes, I'm 14, but because he said
a lot of black males

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:32.034
are thugs or gangsters and all that,

00:09:32.058 --> 00:09:34.588
but I don't want them thinking
that about me.

00:09:35.855 --> 00:09:37.598
EA: For folks who look like me,

00:09:37.622 --> 00:09:41.925
the easiest and most comfortable
thing to do is to not pay attention --

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:45.591
to assume our criminal
legal system is working.

00:09:45.615 --> 00:09:50.101
But if it's not our responsibility
to question those assumptions,

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:52.292
whose responsibility is it?

00:09:53.001 --> 00:09:56.713
There's a synagogue here that's taken on
learning about mass incarceration,

00:09:56.737 --> 00:09:58.820
and many congregants have concluded

00:09:58.844 --> 00:10:02.995
that because mass incarceration
throws so many lives into chaos,

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.218
it actually creates more crime --

00:10:05.242 --> 00:10:07.067
makes people less safe.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.639
Congregant Teri Hunter says

00:10:09.663 --> 00:10:13.131
the first step towards action
has to be understanding.

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:18.996
She says it's crucial for all of us
to understand our connection to this issue

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.788
even if it's not immediately obvious.

00:10:23.096 --> 00:10:25.276
(Recording) Teri Hunter:
It's on our shoulders

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:28.861
to make sure that we're not
just closing that door

00:10:28.885 --> 00:10:30.470
and saying, "Well, it's not us."

00:10:30.842 --> 00:10:35.200
And I think as Jews, you know,
we've lived that history:

00:10:35.224 --> 00:10:36.374
"It's not us."

00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:41.706
And so if a society
closes their back on one section,

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.412
we've seen what happens.

00:10:43.436 --> 00:10:46.627
And so it is our responsibility as Jews

00:10:46.651 --> 00:10:50.214
and as members of this community

00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:53.429
to educate our community --

00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:56.358
at least our congregation --

00:10:56.382 --> 00:10:58.342
to the extent that we're able.

00:10:59.477 --> 00:11:02.739
EA: I've been using
the pronouns "us" and "we"

00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:05.759
because this is our criminal legal system

00:11:05.783 --> 00:11:07.132
and our children.

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:09.752
We elect the district attorneys,

00:11:09.776 --> 00:11:13.820
the judges and the legislators
who operate these systems

00:11:13.844 --> 00:11:14.994
for we the people.

00:11:15.677 --> 00:11:16.964
As a society,

00:11:16.988 --> 00:11:20.589
we are more willing to risk
locking up innocent people

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:23.503
than we are to let guilty people go free.

00:11:24.187 --> 00:11:27.696
We elect politicians
who fear being labeled "soft on crime,"

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.712
encouraging them to pass harsh legislation

00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:34.980
and allocate enormous resources
toward locking people up.

00:11:35.452 --> 00:11:37.116
When a crime is committed,

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:41.894
our hunger for swift retribution
has fed a police culture

00:11:41.918 --> 00:11:44.758
bent on finding culprits fast,

00:11:44.782 --> 00:11:49.295
often without adequate resources
to conduct thorough investigations

00:11:49.319 --> 00:11:52.410
or strict scrutiny
of those investigations.

00:11:52.926 --> 00:11:56.025
We don't put checks on prosecutors.

00:11:56.514 --> 00:11:59.650
Across the country,
over the last couple of decades,

00:11:59.674 --> 00:12:03.769
as property and violent crimes
have both fell,

00:12:03.793 --> 00:12:08.661
the number of prosecutors employed
and cases they have filed has risen.

00:12:09.341 --> 00:12:12.048
Prosecutors decide
whether or not to take legal action

00:12:12.072 --> 00:12:14.101
against the people police arrest

00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:17.122
and they decide what charges to file,

00:12:17.146 --> 00:12:22.899
directly impacting how much time
a defendant potentially faces behind bars.

00:12:23.706 --> 00:12:27.593
One check we do have
on prosecutors is defense.

00:12:27.943 --> 00:12:29.635
Imagine Lady Liberty:

00:12:29.659 --> 00:12:32.080
the blindfolded woman holding the scale

00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:35.284
meant to symbolize the balance
in our judicial system.

00:12:35.854 --> 00:12:39.066
Unfortunately, that scale is tipped.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.616
The majority of defendants in our country

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.022
are represented by
government-appointed attorneys.

00:12:45.046 --> 00:12:49.181
These public defenders
receive around 30 percent less funding

00:12:49.205 --> 00:12:50.943
than district attorneys do,

00:12:50.967 --> 00:12:54.124
and they often have caseloads
far outnumbering

00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:56.665
what the American Bar
Association recommends.

00:12:57.466 --> 00:12:59.332
As Sheila Phipps said,

00:12:59.356 --> 00:13:02.289
there are people who belong in prison,

00:13:02.313 --> 00:13:05.813
but it's hard to tell
the guilty from the innocent

00:13:05.837 --> 00:13:09.019
when everyone's outcomes are so similar.

00:13:09.603 --> 00:13:11.117
We all want justice.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:15.334
But with the process weighed
so heavily against defendants,

00:13:15.358 --> 00:13:17.095
justice is hard to come by.

00:13:18.376 --> 00:13:22.080
Our criminal legal system
operates for we the people.

00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:24.862
If we don't like what's going on,

00:13:24.886 --> 00:13:27.395
it is up to us to change it.

00:13:28.196 --> 00:13:29.347
Thank you very much.

00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:36.260
(Applause)
