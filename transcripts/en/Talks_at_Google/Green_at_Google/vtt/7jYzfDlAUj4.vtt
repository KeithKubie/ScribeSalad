&gt;&gt;Alan Eustace: It's nice to see so many kids
in the audience because this is your planet.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.309
And if we don't take care of it then it's
not gonna be good for you and if you don't

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.159
take care of it then your kids are not gonna
have a great planet to live on.

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:20.279
And our speaker today is lead scientist at
the Nature Conservatory. He's dedicated his

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.970
career right now to-to basically saving our
planet and telling us a lot about what the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.970
issues that face it.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.910
There are a lot of challenges from the water,
to the air, to the survival of species, to

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.480
global warming, all these kinds of things,
and it's really important that the best scientists

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.820
and the best minds and best kids understand
what's happening to our planet, because you

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.030
can change it. It's early enough to change
the things that we're doing.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.190
So with that, let me introduce Sanjayan. Please
take it away, sir.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.190
[applause]

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.830
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Thanks, Alan. Very kind of you.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:56.830
[applause]

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.620
Alright guys, thank you. And thanks very much
for having me out here, particularly John

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.290
Fitch for being persistent--persistent enough
to navigate the Nature Conservancy and figure

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.520
out how to invite us and who to invite.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.860
And then Alan Eustace, thank you so much for
the introduction.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.250
I'm gonna just start by playing you a one
minute video and if you get bored with my

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.070
talk then you just take the video and that's
all you need to do, right?

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.510
The video just played on Discovery Channel's
big Life series. So this is a public service

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.800
announcement that played when Life was, was
airing. And it's still playing on--on--on

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.800
television.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.020
Alright.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.760
[sound of wildlife]

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.590
[guitar music]

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:55.640
&gt;&gt;male video narrator: Life, an everyday miracle
of survival.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.450
Today the future of all life on earth hangs
in the balance.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.450
[guitar music]

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.450
What happens next depends on us.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.450
[guitar music]

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.450
[song I'm Yours by Jason Miraz]

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.070
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.039
I melted
I fell right through the cracks

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.929
Now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:18.180
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me but divine

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:45.549
intervention
I reckon it's again my turn to win some or

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:52.989
learn some

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.730
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.849
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.030
Look into your heart and you'll find that
the sky is yours

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.870
So please don't, please don't, please don't
There's no need to complicate

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.190
'Cause our time is short
This oh, oh, this is our fate, I'm yours

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.190
do, do, do, do,

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.190
[music]

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.099
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Alright. So now that's all you
have to remember and then you can go away.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.560
Well thanks for havin' me here again. My name
is Sanjayan, I'm the lead scientist for the

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.239
Nature Conservancy.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.019
I have some ties to California. I went to
my graduate school here at UC Santa Cruz and

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.569
about oh eight or nine years ago I joined
the Nature Conservancy. And eventually had

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.639
this great job where I travel around the world,
learn about our projects, and try to bring

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:39.999
the best ideas we have in science and in how
we do our work to audiences like you around

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:40.999
the world.

00:03:40.999 --> 00:03:43.670
So that's sort of the short version of what
I do. Thank you.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.670
That one?

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.670
&gt;&gt;female voice: That one.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.939
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Yeah. She said, "Don't touch one
of these buttons."

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:50.939
[laughter]

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:55.139
And so immediately then I'm like, "Okay which
one is that?"

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.230
So I wanna tal--start with something a little
different.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.699
These, does anyone know what these are? These
are called?

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.839
[pause]

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:05.839
You know what they are, John?

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.040
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yeah, they're aboriginal
dot paintings.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.040
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: They're aboriginal dot painting.
There're called song lines and that's exactly

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.040
right.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.310
So the aboriginal people had this great way
of interpretat--interpreting the--the world

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.780
they see around them. And then they put it
up in abstract art like this. Now to us it

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.740
looks like art, but to them it had symbol
and meaning. And it's not just a map through

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.900
space it's also a map through time.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.009
It brings the spiritual and material world
together, it has a directionality to it.

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.970
So some of these round circles for example
mean water holes. That's the simple explanation.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.539
But it would take an aboriginal person who
understands these song lines to really interpret

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:48.650
them for you.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.620
It's the original version of Google Earth,
if you like.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.860
So these paintings are found all over Australia
and very recently we started a project in

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.389
Australia. We started our program there.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.789
And our Program Manager who's Australian went
out there and he was talking to some aboriginal

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:08.710
people and he said, "Well I'm here and I'm
here one of the things the Nature Conservancy

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.400
does we help you map your environment. We
help you place nature within context of your

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.130
lives. We call it the habitat assessment."

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.410
So he said, "We're here to do this habitat
assessment," and these aboriginal people kinda

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.409
looked at him kinda funny and said, "Well,
you're a little late because we sort of already

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.080
have it." And he pointed up to the wall.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.520
And sure enough they have, up there, their
own interpretation of how they see the planet.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.870
And it's just as legitimate as how we see
it.

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.610
So that's sort of our, my--my--my point in
telling you this is that for as long as people

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.570
have been on the planet they've been interested
in mapping the planet and understanding our

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.430
relationship to it. Okay?

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.169
[pause]

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:57.849
So fast forward to today. Today the Nature
Conservancy's releasing this new book called

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.889
The Atlas of Global Conservation and there's
some copies in the back, but it kinda looks

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:04.180
like this.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.800
And this is the first time I get to hold it
up and say, "Here's where we're releasing

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.939
it." So Google Headquarters here becomes one
of the spots that we release this book.

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:17.440
So what is the Atlas of Global Conservation?
Well, it's basically song lines for planet

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.909
earth just in Western scientific language.
I guess that's the best way to put it.

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:25.909
[pause]

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:31.139
What the Atlas has is a series of maps; maps
that you have never seen before because the

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.530
data has never been put in one place before.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.740
And it's maps of all the habitat types on
earth: coral reefs, fresh water, forests,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.099
caves. If you wanna find out the best state
in the U.S. for caves, if you're really into

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:49.520
caves, you can find it out in the Atlas. If
you wanna find the best caves on the planet

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.849
you can find that out in the Atlas as well.
If you wanna compare how cool those caves

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:57.870
are with the caves that you might go to you
can do that on the Atlas as well.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:58.999
And it goes on and on.

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:05.229
So all the habitat types on earth are mapped
out there, but also species diversity. What's

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:08.999
the best place for fresh water fish? If you're
into fly fishing you can look at the Atlas

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:10.870
and you can find out what's the best place
 –

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:11.870
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: No.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:12.870
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: for fishing –

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.870
&gt;&gt;male voice in audience: No.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.870
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: and not tell anyone else.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:15.870
Right, good point.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.800
It's been adjusted slightly to keep the best
parts secret.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.010
But let's say you're interested in wildlife
trade or interested in something that's going

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:28.229
wrong with the planet like deforestation or
maybe habitat loss, or you wanna find out

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:33.780
what's the habitat that's been most impacted
by our activities you can do that on the Atlas

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.780
as well.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.300
Turns out its grasslands, grasslands are the
habitat type on earth that are most converted

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:44.449
by human activity. Makes sense; we like to,
where grass grows we like to put agriculture,

00:07:44.449 --> 00:07:45.449
right?

00:07:45.449 --> 00:07:46.449
So you can do that.

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:50.479
This map for example is coral reefs. It tells
you coral reef diversity. It's a map that

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:54.340
you've never seen before because no one has
ever pulled that information together in one

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.199
spot.

00:07:56.199 --> 00:07:59.409
One of the authors, by the way, of the Atlas
if your more interested in the Atlas you can

00:07:59.409 --> 00:08:03.629
definitely bug her, it's Jen Molnar, she's
one of my colleagues and --

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:04.629
[applause]

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:08.259
she worked for, actually she worked for five
years. We tell people we worked for three

00:08:08.259 --> 00:08:12.800
years 'cause we want to like think that we're
fast, but it really took a long time; so 10

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.090
scientists working for at least three years
to pull all this information together.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.009
Now talking about information, don't worry
kids it's not too bad, I'll go through this

00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:22.009
very quickly.

00:08:22.009 --> 00:08:24.360
The, I'm gonna read each one.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.610
So the biggest problem with doing the Atlas
was guess what? It was getting that data,

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.610
right?

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:34.320
It was getting the data because the data existed
in so many different places. And guess what?

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.600
No one wanted to share that data.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.280
So scientists are really good at going out
and collecting data and they're really bad

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:45.940
at sharing it because they think one day eventually
they will publish it. Most of the time it

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:47.100
just sits there.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.160
And so one of the things our team had to do
was, they were not just scientists, they were

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:56.090
negotiators. They had to literally fly to
places and convince people to put it all together

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:57.130
for the common good.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:02.780
So for me that was really the biggest breakthrough
the Atlas does, it brings 70 partners all

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:08.000
together in a way that they are willing to
share global data for all our benefits and

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.180
all their benefits as well.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.420
So big thanks to them.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.410
So that's all I wanted to really say about
the Atlas and how we did it and the importance

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.410
of it.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:22.270
You should know that every map on the Atlas
today goes live on our Website and we're just,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:26.520
we were in discussions here with Google and
so we're gonna work with you guys and the

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:31.990
tools that you have to integrate our data
and the Atlas data into the latest and greatest

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:36.290
stuff that Google's providing. So this is,
this is just sort of a first step of getting

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.290
it out there.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.290
[applause]

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:43.870
Fair enough. I had nothing to do with it because
I if I did I would have probably blown it,

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.510
but Jen did and others did.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:50.000
So I'm gonna talk to you about conservation
now and how the Atlas has helped guide the

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.640
conservation work we do. And I'm gonna tell
you three stories, that's basically it and

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.200
if you can remember one of them that's great.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.830
So the first story I wanna tell you is about
deserts and conservation of deserts.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:05.840
Now when you think about deserts you mostly
think about big, vast, open lands that are

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.800
not really important. It turns out about a
third of the world surface are covered in

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.010
deserts. And guess what? A billion people
live in deserts. And most of them are really

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.200
poor. So very, very high levels of poverty
are in deserts.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:24.220
There's not a great way to make a living if
you live in a desert. Recently, well actually

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.900
a couple years ago, I had the chance to go
and do a journey that I've wanted to do for

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.810
a long time. And that is walk across one of
these deserts.

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:35.860
And the desert that I walked across was the
oldest and driest desert on the planet and

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:41.080
it's called the Namib. The Namib is a true,
old sand desert. It's been there forever and

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:47.600
ever and ever and there are few indigenous
communities that still live there.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.680
And so we walked the Namib but we walked it
with camels because we needed something to

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.430
carry our stuff. We couldn't carry all the
water and all the food that we needed.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:00.320
Now we couldn't ride these camels. This is
a crucial mistake that we made. So we were

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:05.830
so poor that we had to get second-hand camels
to make this journey. And what we didn't realize

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.830
in the fine print of buying a second hand
camel, they were not ride-able. So mistake

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:13.170
number one is the second hand camels could
not be ridden.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:18.490
But we had and we, and we, and so you see
six camels here, we actually started with

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:24.290
eight. But one got eaten by a lion before
the journey even began [laughs] that was done

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.261
with the camel. He went, he went very happily,
don't worry kids.

00:11:27.261 --> 00:11:30.050
[laughter]

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:35.600
And the second one got pregnant [laughs].
This is really true actually. [laughs]

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.600
[laughter]

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.170
The third one actually developed a bit of
a limp and as you can see he's not carrying

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.170
anything.

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:45.580
So, so the camels were carrying our stuff
and it took us about 20 days to go across

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.110
this desert.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:53.460
Now I'm doing this with these four guys. They're
African guys and they run a small organization

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.650
called Save The Rhino Trust. And even though
they're a tiny group they're in charge of

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.910
doing conservation on an enormous piece of
real estate; basically a desert twice the

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:08.950
size of Yosemite National Park, to put it
in perspective; enormous, enormous landscapes.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.510
And these guys are the protectors of this
landscape. Some it's a national park it's

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.440
called the Skeleton Coast National Park. You
can go and visit it. Some of it is not, it's

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.010
just open land that still belongs to community.

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:22.530
If you wanna get lost, good place to go.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:26.570
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt went to have
their kid over here, right? So just kinda

00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:27.810
gives you an idea where it is.

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.480
But these are the guys that took me on this
walk. And they hadn't done this trip either.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.250
They were like, "You wanna go across the desert?
Why do you wanna do that? No one goes across

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.250
the desert."

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:40.100
So we did the first time that--that desert
had ever been crossed on foot was our journey

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.980
and we had National Geographic come along
and there's a whole story about it, but I--I

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.980
won't go into that.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:50.950
I wanna point out one little thing. These
guys are the sole providers for their communities.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.860
They're the guys who wear that uniform, threadbare
as it is, with pride. They make a little bit

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.540
money from the few tourists who've come there
and they take that money back in their village.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.660
They make about a hundred dollars a month.

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.510
But when they go into their communities and
I've gone into communities with them, they

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:10.630
are the big men in town. So they take their
job very seriously and they care about this

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.960
place very much.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.440
And what do they care about especially of
this place? Well they care about this animal.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.440
Do you know what that is?

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.520
&gt;&gt;child in audience: A rhino.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.520
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: A rhino. What kind of rhino?

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.000
&gt;&gt;child in audience: White one.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.050
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: No. It's not a white rhino it's
a black rhino, great.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:32.670
It's a black rhino. And there's only 3,500
black rhinos on the planet. And the best population

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:36.740
of black rhinos on the planet lives here;
it lives in Namibia. It's the only place that

00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.470
black rhinos are free ranging.

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:42.720
They don't, they can just walk out there on
landscape and not International Park. It's

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.320
this astonishing thing.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.940
And here's the more amazing thing: there--there's
never been a poaching incident of black rhinos

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:54.120
in Namibia in the last 15 years. And that's
amazing because each of those rhino horns

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:58.680
would bring you about sixty thousand dollars.
That's a lot of money, so there's a lot of

00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.940
pressure on rhinos.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:05.980
South Africa has lost rhinos; Zimbabwe's lost
rhinos; Kenya's lost rhinos; Namibia zero.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:11.670
And it's all because of this guy who's sitting
next to me and he's actually telling me, "Pick

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.190
your tree man, pick your tree." Because this
rhino by the name of Speedy, and that's the

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.360
real name of the rhino, is about to charge
us.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.070
[laughter]

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:25.680
That's really what he told me. He's like,
"Pick your tree. Pick your tree." And I'm

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.820
looking around and I'm like --

00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:29.820
[laughter]

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.820
[laughs]

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:34.670
Alright. So one thing happened on this journey
that I wanna tell you about which was kind

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.670
of amazing.

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:40.860
So we're on this walk and we're going down
this long journey and all of a sudden out

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:47.340
in the horizon far, far away I see this little
white dot. And this white dot kinda attracts

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:52.920
us and flat--flat land like that. And all
of a sudden the whole team starts kinda moving

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920
towards it.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.630
This is on the very last day of our journey,
by the way. We're one day from the ocean;

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:03.190
we've been on the road walking for about 19
days and we had finished most of our food,

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:08.900
particularly there was no more protein left,
so we were on sort of male--me, maze diet,

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.790
really just carbohydrates.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.450
And for us we could handle it, we've got a
little body fat, but for the Africans they

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:20.710
craved that protein; they wanted the meat.
No meat for a long time and you saw the whole

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:28.620
line sort of turn towards this white dot and
pretty soon we're all standing there and everyone

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:34.870
was wondering what I had in my box, we're
standing around an egg. It's not the same

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.730
egg, by the way.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:42.110
But an egg and it's like this on the ground.
And pretty soon all of us are crowding around

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:45.560
it just like this and we're amazed. Do you
know what kind of egg this is?

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560
&gt;&gt;child in audience: Ostrich.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.190
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: It's an ostrich egg, right. So
an ostrich had laid this egg and they're ostriches

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.280
they'll lay and they'll come back, they'll
lay more or they'll abandon the egg, we don't

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.280
know.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.460
But we're in a national park now in the Skeleton
Coast National Park, and in a national park

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:03.250
you not supposed to do what? You're not supposed
to take anything or touch anything, right?

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.880
And we didn't. We took pictures. We looked.
We oohed and ahhed at it. It was kind of amazing

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.590
thing; this egg perfectly placed out there
in the middle of the desert. Again, this is

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.260
not the same egg.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:19.750
But then we all picked up our--our backpacks
and started walking off and I looked back

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:24.490
and the four African dudes who were with me,
they're still looking at the egg.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.490
[laughter]

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:30.180
And they're all like in a circle. And they,
they speak this clicking language, they'd

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:34.360
click away, it's a clicking tongue like the
sound bushman. You see that movie Gods Must

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.981
Be Crazy, they-they do that clicking, like
[clicks tongue], like that. And they're clicking

00:16:38.981 --> 00:16:43.910
away at this thing. And I can't really understand
Damara, which is the language they're speaking.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.050
But I pretty much understand. I wonder if
there's actually a Google translator for Damara?

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:49.050
[laughter]

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.050
But, get to work on that.

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.550
But, if there was, this is what they were
saying, they would probably say, "Distract

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:59.400
the white guys. Gather some sticks and we'll
have a 24 egg omelet in a heartbeat."

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.790
[laughter]

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.170
We didn't say anything, we kept walking. And
I looked back and what was amazing is each

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:11.500
of these guys picked up their camel and kept
walking. And pretty soon that egg is out there

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.500
on its own.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:18.569
And as we did this journey it kinda struck
me that even though they're very, very poor

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:25.400
and they are in a completely different economic
class than I am, for them that still represents

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:30.840
something that is important to conserve. For
them that's their source of livelihood, that's

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.250
what they do. And they took their job in the
middle of nowhere, no one's watching them,

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:36.690
incredibly seriously.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:41.670
I--I thought that that kind of ethic could
only be possible in countries once you've

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:46.320
reached a certain income level. And what I
saw that day out in Namibia really changed

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.550
my mind about the ability of local communities
to embrace concepts that I really thought

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:56.630
were for the--the well off and privileged.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:18:01.180
My second story I'm gonna take you somewhere
else. Let's see where we go.

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:05.760
Those are forests of the world, tropical forests
in particular. So we're gonna go to Borneo.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.930
We're gonna go to a forest up here called
the Wahea Forest.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:12.820
And Borneo's a really neat place. It has lots
and lots of forests, but the forests are under

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:18.640
a great deal of threat. Their in threat from
palm oil. Oil of palm got planted in huge

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.050
plantations and that creates enormous, enormous
problem for the forests there.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:27.920
One of the problems that happens is as the
wet soil dries up it releases huge amounts

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.170
of carbon dioxide. The cutting of these native
forests allows Indonesia to be ranked in the

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:38.270
top five countries for releasing greenhouse
[bad audio] which then contributes of course

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.670
to climate change as you all know.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:45.690
Forest burning is a big, big deal for us.
But it's very hard to find because palm oil

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:49.860
is very lucrative. If you go home and you
look through your cabinet, look at the stuff

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:55.040
that you have; palm oil's in nearly everything;
like you'll find it in Chip Ahoy cookies.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.220
You'll find it in soap. You'll find it in
all kinds of products you have right now in

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:05.420
your, in your cupboard. And it's not native
to Indonesia. Most of it comes from Asia;

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.220
it's actually native to West Africa; it was
brought over.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.910
So saving these forests is really important,
but you don't find a lot of saved forests

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:18.361
when you go out to Indonesia. But this forest
you do. It's an amazing place, the Wahea Forest.

00:19:18.361 --> 00:19:23.730
So I went out there and you see lots of wildlife;
see orangutans like that and you see lots

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.730
of great birds.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:30.390
But then when you come to the edge of the
forest you see this; you see these big totem

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:35.090
poles, very scary looking. They're very tall
and they have this warrior on it with some

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:39.890
sort of bird or animal on the top and pretty
scary and they're always looking outwards;

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:42.190
they're always looking out of the forest not
inwards.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:47.690
And they're basically warning posts that are
telling people, "Don't come into this forest.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.540
Danger. This is our forest, stay away. Stay
away from this forest."

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.760
And when you go in the Wahea Forest it is
pretty intact. I mean you see lots of wildlife

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.910
there. And I was surprised how this forest
survived when all else around it is just a

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.550
blight zone. I mean everything else is just
blitzed.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:09.850
Why has this forest survived? And what do
these poles, these totem poles have to do

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.720
with it? What's the Wahea Forest about? How
come it's protected? And he says, "Oh you

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.990
gotta talk to the chief of the Wahea." "Great,
let's go see the chief."

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.030
Now to see the chief you gotta get in the
car and you gotta drive back out of the forest

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:25.340
and you gotta go about 40 miles. Now that
40 mile journey literally takes a day because

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:30.610
the roads as so bad. And you go through this
burnt out ag-land and burnt out trees and

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:32.680
you eventually get to this village.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:37.730
And in the village you meet the chief. And
this is Chief Tak who's sitting here. He's

00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:42.370
a Wahea; he's a Dayak tribesman. And this
is a colleague of mine from the Nature Conservancy

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:47.930
who's translating for me. And I make all the
pleasant small talk, "How you doin'?" and

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:51.810
he tells me about how wonderful the forest
is and why it's so important and how when

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:56.110
he lived in the forest it was all very much
more, much cooler than it is now where he

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.990
lives and all this sort of stuff.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.860
So the big question came to me and I said,
"Well, if you love the forest so much why

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:06.471
do you live out here in this village? Why
aren't you living in the forest?"

00:21:06.471 --> 00:21:12.820
And he didn't quite understand what I said.
And Eric, my--my colleague, had to re-translate

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.190
again and said, "Why don't you live in the
forest? Why are you living in this village,

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.170
half a day or a day drive away from the forest?"

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:26.880
And he kind of looked at me puzzled and he
said, "Oh, no. I've always lived here. It's

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.030
the forest that's moved."

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:29.030
[pause]

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:34.220
And that's when it sort of struck me that
their forest when he was a kid, the forest

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:38.550
was right around him. That village had never
moved. The forest had just moved because it's

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:40.440
been logged all the way up there.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.170
So then the obvious next question was, "Well
why have you protected this forest?" And here's

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:49.240
what he said to me, because I was asking,
"Well are you gonna do some ecotourism there,

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:54.500
are you gonna try to capture some carbon credits?"
I'm thinking, "How do you make money out of

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.820
this? How do you pump it back into the system?
How do you make it sustainable?"

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.490
And he said, "No, no we're not doing anything.
We're not even hunting there anymore. We're

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:06.309
just leaving it alone." And it's a big forest,
100,000 acre plus forest.

00:22:06.309 --> 00:22:13.490
"Why?" Well he said, "Once the forest goes,
we no longer are the--the Wahea people. For

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:18.590
us our entire identify is around that forest.
When that forest disappears we will just be

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:23.640
a Dayak and then we'll just be another Indonesian
like all the other Indonesian tribes out there.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.920
For us to be the Wahea people we have to have
the Wahea Forest."

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:33.740
And for him and his community it had entirely
to do with sovereignty. And that was a really

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:38.540
new thing for me to think about; conservation
for sovereignty. I hadn't thought about that.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.809
I hadn't thought that people's identity could
be so linked that they would wanna protest

00:22:42.809 --> 00:22:47.890
their place because it ma--made sense to them
because that's who they were, right?

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.560
So that's my story about Indonesia and the
forest that I went to. And Chief Tak, Chief

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:57.080
Tak by the way just won a big prize from the
Indonesia President, the highest environmental

00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:01.860
award to be given in Indonesia. He just received
it for his work and his community's work for

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:06.100
protecting this forest, not because it was
giving them money, but because it defined

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.510
who they were as a community.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:14.630
The last story I wanna tell you guys is a
marine story. And this one's about economics.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.430
So I told you about conservation ethics, I
told you about sovereignty and now I'm gonna

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.309
tell you a little bit about economics.

00:23:20.309 --> 00:23:22.620
And I'm gonna take you to, what's this map
of?

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:23.620
[pause]

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.851
&gt;&gt;[voices in audience]: Coral reefs.

00:23:25.851 --> 00:23:26.851
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Coral reefs, great.

00:23:26.851 --> 00:23:32.010
So the lighter it is, the less intense the
diversity of reefs are. So that's Hawaii,

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:33.970
for example. That's the Caribbean.

00:23:33.970 --> 00:23:39.710
But look at this place. Look how dark the
color is. So that's the Coral Triangle and

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:44.350
the Coral Triangle is the world's most diverse
spot on earth. There's more species in the

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:49.390
Coral Triangle than any other place on the
planet.

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.560
[pause]

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.550
And of course when you go underwater you see
enormous varieties of fish.

00:23:57.550 --> 00:23:58.550
[pause]

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.540
You also see lots of cool things like this
guy. I had to throw that up there. That's

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:08.360
a pigmy seahorse. And that pygmy sea horse
is about the size of my little fingernail.

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:13.230
Not my little finger, my little fingernail.
And it's an adult pygmy sea horse. It lives

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.920
on the sea fan. It's pretty hard to find.
You gotta go right up to it and look really

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.970
carefully and then you'll find some of them.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:19.970
[pause]

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:25.260
It also had big fish there. So not just diverse
fish, but it's one of the few places left

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:30.510
in Asia where you can still find big sharks
and big groupers and things like that.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:36.150
We're actually catching that shark, but we're
catching it in the non--traditional way.

00:24:36.150 --> 00:24:40.700
Talk about fishing, so I was asked to go and
take part in a tagging operation with sharks

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.960
and they said, "Well, we're gonna catch over
a hundred sharks and put a tag on them and

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.520
then release them to find out where they go
and how they live."

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.280
And I thought, "Well, great. I love fishing
so we'd catch these things in the traditional

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:55.910
way [chuckles] which had to do with a line
and a rod or something like that and a hook."

00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.100
But no, we were gonna not hurt these sharks.
So they way we were gonna do it is swim up

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.490
to them very quietly when they were feeding
 --

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.490
[laughter]

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:07.460
I'm not makin' this up. [chuckles] And then
we were gonna put a rope around their tail

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.650
[laughs] --

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:09.830
[laughter]

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.830
and then the question is, "Well then what?"
[laughs]

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:16.150
Well then you try to stay away from the pointy
end. [laughs]

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:17.150
[laughter]

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:21.830
But that's literally how we caught these sharks.
So we caught actually over 110 sharks; several

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:25.590
species; and we tagged them and to find out
where they were going and how they were using

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:26.590
the area.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:30.070
We also caught some bigger sharks, like tiger
sharks, and those ones we actually managed

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:34.531
to put cameras on them and the cameras stay
with them for six to eight hours and then

00:25:34.531 --> 00:25:38.540
they release and the camera comes to the surface
and you have videotape of the shark looking

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.080
through the environment through its own eyes.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.030
But because we didn't use hooks, we didn't
hurt the sharks. As soon as we released them

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:49.510
they would go back to doing what they liked
doing which is looking for food.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:53.510
Alright, so anyway, sho--sho--show you that.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:57.960
But in addition to all this amazing wildlife
that's in the Coral Triangle, of course, there's

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:04.820
also people. There's 30 million people making
a living out of sea, out of fish, right, and

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.720
they all live here.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:07.720
[pause]

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.841
So one place in particular that I wanna focus
on is the Solomon Islands.

00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:17.070
So the Solomon Islands are these amazing chain
of islands and there's, I can tell you lots

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.860
and lots of stories about the Solomons, but
I won't, I won't do it right now. I'll give

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.130
you two little points of, of--of interest.

00:26:23.130 --> 00:26:28.170
So the last head hunters of Asia lived in
the Solomons. These are people who really

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:32.430
went around scaring other people away essentially
from the coast because they wanted to protect

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.430
the resources.

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:38.700
It was also the last place that an American
that, that Japanese surrendered to an American

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:45.640
after World War II. And it was in, guess when
it was? It was 1967 because there was a Japanese

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:50.450
soldier who had hid out in the Solomon Islands;
it's a great place to hide out. They had to

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:55.100
actually fly over and drop letters from his
mother telling him that the war was over.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.550
Should have been over for 25 years and that
he should consider surrendering which--which

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.600
thankfully he did.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:07.440
It's also where President Kennedy swam to
shore when his PT109 got, got, got bombed.

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:14.190
And there's a swim in the Solomons that I
have done. It's called the, the Kennedy Mile

00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:19.150
and the Kennedy Mile is a very fast swim 'cause
there's of course lots of sharks around. [laughs]

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:20.150
[laughter]

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:24.120
But they drop you off and you swim to the
island that Kennedy, it's called Palm Island

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:29.150
now, the island that he came up on. It's a
great place. It's, it's 2,000 islands spread,

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:36.381
sorry, a thousand islands spread over two
million square kilometers of ocean, so really

00:27:36.381 --> 00:27:37.381
fantastic.

00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:42.260
But I told you about head hunters. The Solomons
also has the highest diversity of languages;

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.960
one of the highest on the planet. There's
over a hundred languages spoken in the Solomons

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.600
and I didn't take a language class there.
A hundred different languages and only half

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:55.170
a million people. And because everyone has
their own tribal customs there's a lot of

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.940
conflict between communities.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.940
And what do they fight about? Well, they fight
about fish.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:04.150
So there were two big communities and they
were at war with one another. And I mean when

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.520
I say, "war with one another," they were really
at war with one another. They were burning

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:13.270
each others houses, they were threatening
one another in very serious sort of ways.

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:17.090
And through the work of the Nature Conservancy,
but also because of an enlightened leader,

00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:22.570
a local leader in this community, they created
a marine protected area between these two

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:23.570
islands.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.190
So they took one piece of ocean and they actually
said it was "taboo." That was the word they

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:32.490
used. The word "taboo" is actually a Solomon
word. It's actually pronounced "tamboo" and

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:35.840
it means "don't go there. Keep out. Stay away."

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:40.320
And what happened when we created this protected
area, when we created this protected area,

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:46.501
the protected area is about 110 square kilometers
in size, it allowed fish to--to breed.

00:28:46.501 --> 00:28:51.960
It allowed all the marine life that had been
fished out everywhere else to breed and grow.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:56.940
And as they bred and grew, they swam out and
then the communities could each harvest the--the

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:04.110
over spill if you like. We call it fish banks.
So when we go out there we don't talk about

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:08.010
marine protected areas, no one wants to hear
that. But when we say "fish banks" people

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:09.170
go, "Oh, what's that?"

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:13.650
Well here's how it works. It's like a savings
bank, but it's for fish. And if both of you

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:17.070
agree on this bank it'll allow us to protect
the whole area.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:19.620
Now the question is, does it work?

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:25.549
So this little girl for example has harvested
these animals which are actually sea slugs

00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:32.090
and they're sold in East Asia dried. And just
these three sea slugs will pay her--her--her

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:38.690
tuition for one semester. Just to give you
an idea. It really does work because it's

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:42.720
a little bit of money but it makes a huge
difference to local communities.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.590
So we helped set up this incredible marine
protected area and if any of you ever get

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:51.870
to go to the Solomons it is worth seeing this
place. It's called the Arnarvons. The Arnarvons

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:53.660
Marine Community Conservation Area.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.890
But if you go there you will see all the big
fish I told you about. You will see sea turtles

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:02.170
and manta rays and big sharks; more sharks
than you've seen anywhere else, almost anywhere

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:08.230
else on the planet. And you can see the, you
see giant clams that are still giant. So you

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:13.230
really just, the--the diversity of life is
great. Well so what? We're the Nature Conservancy

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:16.960
we're supposed to protect nature. Of course
the wildlife's gonna do well.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.270
How 'bout the people?

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:23.010
So a few years ago we went and did something
frankly not enough conservationists do. We

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:26.380
went to measure the impact of our work on
the local communities.

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:32.360
So we did a survey of about 2,200 people.
I think it was 230 households that were surveyed.

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:37.230
And we asked them basically simple economic
survey questions. How well are they doing?

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:43.840
Guess what? Their income had doubled in that
period; had doubled; not just gone up a little

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:44.840
bit; had doubled.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:50.420
And we used multiple measures of--of well-being
from how many kids are going to school, how

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.910
diversified is the economy, how are the women
doing, they tend to be the marginalized people

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:55.910
in society.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:00.260
So we measured lots of different ways. We
found the same result. So not only did wildlife

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:05.560
do well, but people were doing better as well.
All because they now had this fish bank that

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:09.990
allowed them to harvest resources that were
coming out it.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:14.330
Only one data slide and it's one before my
last slide. I'll just show that to you just

00:31:14.330 --> 00:31:22.260
to give you an idea. So the--the pink line
there or the purple line is communities that

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.640
associated with a marine protected area.

00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:31.169
And the dark blue or black line are communities
that don't have a marine protected area. And

00:31:31.169 --> 00:31:36.040
you can see, look at income for example, between
communities that don't have marine protected

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.330
areas and that do. It's essentially doubling
in--in size.

00:31:40.330 --> 00:31:48.090
Or look at this fish catch, it's not actually
fish catch, it's actually one type of-of marine

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:52.700
product and it's called trochus. The trochus
shell is very valuable. It's, if you ever

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:57.290
go to Saville Row, if you're James Bond, and
you go to Saville Row in England and you get

00:31:57.290 --> 00:32:02.460
a really nice shirt, one of the options you'll
get asked is whether your want a trochus shell

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:06.669
button. And if you get a trochus shell button
it's probably coming from the Solomons.

00:32:06.669 --> 00:32:11.390
Notice that zero everywhere else, but here
six percent of the households still are able

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:16.179
to go and harvest that. So it makes a big
difference.

00:32:16.179 --> 00:32:17.860
So here's how I wanna end this talk.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:23.270
When you think about conservation to you and
I it's about saving wildlife. But when you

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:29.520
go outside of frankly the Bay Area, or other
really well-to-do places, it becomes about

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:35.230
much more than that. It really becomes about
ways of life. It'll become about health, it'll

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:40.671
become about security, economic well-being.
It takes on all different tones. And I can

00:32:40.671 --> 00:32:45.679
tell you stories for all those examples where
health and conservation are linked; or when

00:32:45.679 --> 00:32:48.350
economic benefits and conservation are linked.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:52.490
That I think is the future of the environmental
movement. As long as we just talk about cool

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:55.110
animals we're only gonna attract people like
you.

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:59.781
But when we start talking about what this
can do to people's real lives, then we can

00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:05.770
stay up doing conservation at really big scales:
two million acres; twenty million acres; big,

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:06.770
big stuff.

00:33:06.770 --> 00:33:13.010
We can't do the big stuff unless we could
get other people to join in with us. And that's,

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:17.870
that's the key. That's the key; how we talk
to people who currently we consider the enemy.

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.450
They're not the enemy they're just people
just like you and I tryin' to live a better

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:26.260
life. And we can show 'em a different way
that connects their livelihood to the environment

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.770
we can, we can make it happen.

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:33.419
So here's how I wanna end this talk. Think
of this, think of this little thing: as long

00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:37.940
as humans have been on this planet we have
only been able to see the planet from eye

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:42.150
level, essentially. For three and half million
years we've walked around and we've looked

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.230
at the planet like this.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:48.330
If you go to Tanzania there a place called
Laetoli; it's a really cool place in Tanzania.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:52.890
It's where you see these old hominid footprints;
they're this size and there's two of 'em and

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.600
they walk parallel to one another. And they're
three and a half million years old.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:02.130
The first evidence of humans standing upright
or hominids, early primates standing upright

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:07.710
and walking. One was a male probably and one
was a female. We can tell because of the size

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:12.789
of the footprint. And one probably carried
a baby because the female has a slight tilt

00:34:12.789 --> 00:34:17.289
to her and which means she was probably having
a baby on her hip or somewhere on her.

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:21.359
And as these footprints go, they stop for
a minute and they turn slightly as if they're

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:26.179
looking at something in the distance; the
moment of doubt. The first expression of doubt

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:28.649
in humanity recorded on the rocks.

00:34:28.649 --> 00:34:32.210
What was the doubt about? Where were they
looking? Were they looking at danger? Was

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:37.169
there something out there like a lion or something
they were worried about? Or was it opportunity?

00:34:37.169 --> 00:34:43.839
Maybe there was a dead animal or food or water
source, right? We have only seen the planet

00:34:43.839 --> 00:34:46.879
from eye level. And how far can we see?

00:34:46.879 --> 00:34:50.309
Well, if you're an ordinary human and you're
standing on flat ground you can see about

00:34:50.309 --> 00:34:53.690
ten miles. I think its six and a half, something
like that. Six and half to ten miles and then

00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.389
the earth's horizon curves around.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:35:03.349
Then in one generation, our generation, my
generation and your generation, right, we

00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:08.450
see the entire planet all at once. Think about
that! I mean it's just actually stunning.

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:12.880
Three and half million years we've been locked
to one way of viewing the world and then all

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:17.630
of a sudden we take it for granted, I mean
especially kids in the audience, I mean they

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:20.430
really take it for granted. Of course we see
the whole planet.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:26.140
So what are we gonna do with that knowledge?
Forty years from now we didn't know, we didn't

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.631
know what we were doing to the entire planet.
And I truly believe that 40 years from now,

00:35:30.631 --> 00:35:37.140
Earth Day is 40 years old today. So 40 years
from now I think it'll be too late. The biggest

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.739
changes we wanted to make, it'll be too late
to make those changes. The animals you wanted

00:35:40.739 --> 00:35:44.400
would be gone. We wouldn't have the services
that people depend on.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.941
So right now we're in this narrow margin.
Of course you would wanna be born right now.

00:35:47.941 --> 00:35:51.869
This is the best time to be born. This is
the most opportune time to be born 'cause

00:35:51.869 --> 00:35:59.279
we're the ones who will see the worst, but
really have the opportunity to do the most.

00:35:59.279 --> 00:36:03.489
So that's kinda what I wanted to let you go
with, but I wanted to tell you one li--last

00:36:03.489 --> 00:36:05.479
thing about this little egg.

00:36:05.479 --> 00:36:10.579
So you remember I told you we left the egg
behind and we walked off. Well that night

00:36:10.579 --> 00:36:14.760
we came to the ocean and we camped up there.
And some of these African guys I had been

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:20.441
with had never seen the sea before. Namibia
has no standing water at all. Think about

00:36:20.441 --> 00:36:23.509
it. And all of sudden you're seeing the ocean.
That's like seeing planet earth for the first

00:36:23.509 --> 00:36:24.509
time really.

00:36:24.509 --> 00:36:29.119
So there they are in ocean; everyone's celebrating;
we're all taking a bath, it's great. The next

00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:34.769
morning a brand new Cessna Caravan comes and
lands on the beach. Beautiful plane bounces

00:36:34.769 --> 00:36:40.789
down the runway; stops; we all pile in. Brand
new plane; leather seats; air conditioning

00:36:40.789 --> 00:36:46.089
for the first time. Someone opens up a Coca-Cola
and hands it to me. Now I'm not big into sugary

00:36:46.089 --> 00:36:51.489
drinks, but it felt really good. So I took
that first sip, it's great. Door shuts. Plane

00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:54.729
revs up, goes bouncing down the sand, takes
off.

00:36:54.729 --> 00:37:00.549
As it's taking off I look out the window and
guess who's waving at me? My four African

00:37:00.549 --> 00:37:05.410
guides and the camels. They're waving as we're
taking off.

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:11.220
See my little expedition is over, but they--they
don't get to go in the plane with the camels.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:16.720
They have to turn those things around and
right, and walk right back across the desert

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.279
back to where we started.

00:37:19.279 --> 00:37:24.309
Of course in that moment we realized that
by evening they were gonna reach the egg.

00:37:24.309 --> 00:37:25.309
[laughter]

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:31.740
And none of us were gonna be around. And the
interesting thing is the entire plane erupted

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:36.220
in a conversation about what they would do
then, when we're not around watching.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:40.559
Which makes me realize that all conservation
no matter where you do it, whether you do

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:45.329
it in--in Tahoe as you saw in the paper today
or whether you do it in Namibia; or they do

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:51.150
it in Morrow Bay off the coast of California
or, or whether you do it in Indonesia.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:55.740
All conversation is local. And ultimately
the sustainability of conservation will only

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.220
happen if local communities embrace it.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:03.710
We will always be foreigners and guests in
their land. As soon as our little money ends

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:08.069
they will have to step up and take over. The
amazing thing is we don't really know what

00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:09.130
they would do.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:13.369
I frankly might have eaten it. Don't put that
in, okay?

00:38:13.369 --> 00:38:14.369
[laughter]

00:38:14.369 --> 00:38:18.619
I don't know. But the question was that we
didn't either and it was a legitimate debate

00:38:18.619 --> 00:38:22.160
we had. I actually think they would probably
have left it alone and kept walking. That's

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:27.180
what those guys are like. But the point is
that when our eyes are turned how will they

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.240
take care of the planet?

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:35.339
Thank you very much.

00:38:35.339 --> 00:38:36.609
[applause]

00:38:36.609 --> 00:38:43.720
&gt;&gt;Alan Eustace: So do we, we have plenty of
time for questions. If--if some of you wanna

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.180
get up and leave, please feel free to do that
just try to be quiet, but I'm sure there are

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:50.680
questions in the audience and we'll take them
for Sanjayan.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.910
That was a great talk.

00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:52.910
Anybody have any questions?

00:38:52.910 --> 00:38:54.829
&gt;&gt;male voice: I have a question about the
Solomon Islands.

00:38:54.829 --> 00:39:03.069
Back on the Solomon Islands data you showed
data after you had implemented the marine

00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:04.069
protected area --

00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:05.069
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Yep.

00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:06.069
&gt;&gt;male in audience #1: versus areas that didn't
have marine protected area.

00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:07.069
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Yep.

00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:10.400
&gt;&gt;male in audience #1: Do you have data of
the place that had later a marine protected

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.589
area before it had the marine protected area?

00:39:12.589 --> 00:39:16.200
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Great question and the truth of
the matter is we don't have it at the level

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.579
we want it at. We do have some, but not enough.

00:39:19.579 --> 00:39:23.569
So very clever, I knew you would catch something
like that. Good catch.

00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:27.760
The problem is most conservationists don't
do a good job of measuring the impact of their

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:33.410
work because we do God's work. We do good
stuff. Why do we, that's a genuine fault with

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:40.349
us. You don't think about that and it's a
systematic, it's a systematic fault with how

00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:41.839
we think about conservation.

00:39:41.839 --> 00:39:46.339
So in the Solomons' case we do have some,
but the--the real sample we had were communities

00:39:46.339 --> 00:39:48.880
that had it and communities that didn't.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.440
I--I--I see where you're goin' with it. We're
doing a bigger study there right now.

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.440
[pause]

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.760
&gt;&gt;Alan Eustace: Here you go. Here's a question
right here. Do you wanna stand up and ask

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:58.839
your question?

00:39:58.839 --> 00:40:04.739
&gt;&gt;child in audience #1: How are salamanders
surviving like these days? Because they need

00:40:04.739 --> 00:40:11.049
like a special habitat so like do their habitats
get destroyed every once in a while like --

00:40:11.049 --> 00:40:15.420
&gt;Sanjayan: Great question. So how are salamanders
and I'd say amphibians and frogs doing?

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:21.289
So they're not doing very well because most
things like frogs and amphibians and toads

00:40:21.289 --> 00:40:25.859
need both land and water to survive. So you
can't just protect land, you also have to

00:40:25.859 --> 00:40:30.700
protect water. And water pollution is a really
big, big problem with pesticides and things

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:31.700
like that.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:36.930
So most of them aren't doing that well. There
are some that are doing some, that are doing

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:37.930
pretty well.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:42.520
In California you have really great salamander
called the tiger salamander. It's a really

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.690
big salamander and he's got spots and he kinda
looks like a tiger. If you pick him up, which

00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:51.781
you shouldn't really do, but if you do, he'll
croak at you. He'll go, "Raa" like that, like

00:40:51.781 --> 00:40:53.450
a little tiger. It's pretty cool.

00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:57.569
And that salamander's actually doing really
well because, well they're doing well in some

00:40:57.569 --> 00:41:02.960
places because we're working with farmers
and land owners to really protect the grassland

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:07.650
for that salamander needs to live in. So the
Nature Conservancy and other local land trusts

00:41:07.650 --> 00:41:11.579
are working all over California to protect
that salamander, the tiger salamander.

00:41:11.579 --> 00:41:12.579
[pause]

00:41:12.579 --> 00:41:16.089
&gt;&gt;male in audience #2: You talked about the
fish bank in Solomon Islands --

00:41:16.089 --> 00:41:17.089
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Yeah.

00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:19.339
&gt;&gt;male in audience #2: you explained how--how
the locals there prefer to think of it as

00:41:19.339 --> 00:41:23.690
a fish bank as opposed to conserva--conservancy.
It seems to me that argument would be true

00:41:23.690 --> 00:41:28.039
pretty much anywhere in the developed world
as well. Have you had success in trying to

00:41:28.039 --> 00:41:30.650
replicate that for cod or various other fishes?

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:35.420
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: We've had tremendous success with
our argument of using banks as a catch phrase

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:40.160
to--to talk about a collective resource the
community can draw on in times of trouble.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:45.219
So not only do we have fish banks we also
now have grass banks; That are grassland areas

00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:49.479
that the community agrees to set aside for
wildlife like in Northern Kenya we're doing

00:41:49.479 --> 00:41:54.289
enormous projects there; where we're setting
aside huge grass banks as well as in the United

00:41:54.289 --> 00:41:58.712
States, California, Arizona, places like that,
where the community says, "We've gonna leave

00:41:58.712 --> 00:42:03.349
this for-for wildlife, but in times of drought
when everyone's rushing to sell their cattle

00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:07.729
and so all the cattle prices deflate, we can
go in there and graze it in that, in that

00:42:07.729 --> 00:42:08.729
time."

00:42:08.729 --> 00:42:12.039
And it's a, it's a very attractive argument
to poor communities who constantly go through

00:42:12.039 --> 00:42:17.619
boom and bust cycles of have and then everyone
then no rain then all cattle are dying then

00:42:17.619 --> 00:42:19.930
everyone's selling at the same time.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:24.900
With fish banks we have in lots of different
kinds of things. One really cool thing we're

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:31.270
doing right here off the coast of--of California,
just south of here, is basically buying trawler

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:36.630
permits and taking a lot of the trawlers that
are having the biggest harm on certain areas

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:37.630
out of business.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:42.299
So we own the license, the Nature Conservancy
does, but then we put them back out and just

00:42:42.299 --> 00:42:47.549
give it to them under conditions where they
can fish more sustainably using line methods

00:42:47.549 --> 00:42:51.200
for example. And then keeping them out of
the most sensitive areas as well.

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:55.729
So there's a lot of really clever stuff going
on where we're trying to engage with economic

00:42:55.729 --> 00:43:02.210
interests to not put them out of business,
but to use our might and our dollars to steer

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:03.799
in a different direction.

00:43:03.799 --> 00:43:04.799
[pause]

00:43:04.799 --> 00:43:05.799
&gt;&gt;Alan Eustace: Here you go.

00:43:05.799 --> 00:43:06.799
[pause]

00:43:06.799 --> 00:43:16.430
&gt;&gt;child in audience #2: How many pounds of
food did you need for the walk across the

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:17.430
desert?

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:18.430
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: And what's your name?

00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:19.430
&gt;&gt;child in audience: Anika.

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.430
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Anika, oh great. How old are you,
Anika?

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:21.430
&gt;&gt;Anika: Nine.

00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:23.150
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: You're nine, oh I have a niece
just like you, she's eight. And she asked

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:28.279
me how many pounds of food I ate on my walk
across the desert.

00:43:28.279 --> 00:43:32.599
You know the food wasn't, I don't, the truth
of answer is I don't know how many pounds

00:43:32.599 --> 00:43:38.380
of food we had because we didn't pack like
that. We just thought about, you think about

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:44.489
it in cups like so we each would have one
cup of this thing that looks like porridge

00:43:44.489 --> 00:43:49.180
and then like one can of like tomato which
we'd put on top and maybe a can of sardines

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:51.190
that we'd throw on top of that, and eat that
for dinner.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:56.140
So we didn't think of it in pounds. I will
tell you for water, which is the real issue,

00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:00.479
'cause you can last without food for very
long. Water, we were each using about seven

00:44:00.479 --> 00:44:05.280
liters of water a day. That's seven bottles,
big bottles of water every day. That's for

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:11.619
everything. That's for showering quickly;
that's for brushing my teeth; that's for drinking;

00:44:11.619 --> 00:44:12.809
and that's for cooking.

00:44:12.809 --> 00:44:19.019
And just to give you an idea, that's how much
we used every day for 20 days. If you, if

00:44:19.019 --> 00:44:22.599
you are in West Africa you would use about
35 liters of water a day.

00:44:22.599 --> 00:44:26.240
You know much Americans use, here, you know
how much I use in America?

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:27.319
&gt;&gt;Alan Eustace: Wanna make a guess?

00:44:27.319 --> 00:44:29.920
&gt;&gt;Anika: I don't know.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:35.420
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Seven hundred liters of water
a day; seven hundred. So that means we're

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.190
probably wasting a lot of it, don't you think?

00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:38.190
[pause]

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:41.100
&gt;&gt;Alan Eustace: Any other questions?

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.100
Yeah, here.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:47.480
&gt;&gt;male in audience #3: I won't tell you how
old I am.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.480
[laughter]

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.299
So this takes lots of money. How does the
Nature Conservancy fund these projects?

00:44:52.299 --> 00:44:53.840
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: It's a great question.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:58.979
So the Nature Conservancy gets most of its
money from individual donors. We have about

00:44:58.979 --> 00:45:04.059
a million members around the world and they
send in from 50 dollar memberships to much,

00:45:04.059 --> 00:45:05.479
much bigger than that.

00:45:05.479 --> 00:45:11.769
We also get a chunk of money from foundations
that support it, many of them in the Bay Area;

00:45:11.769 --> 00:45:15.859
Moore foundation, Hewlett-Packard all those
foundations give the Conservancy money to

00:45:15.859 --> 00:45:16.859
do it.

00:45:16.859 --> 00:45:20.229
And then there's a small amount of money that
we use where we leverage government money

00:45:20.229 --> 00:45:22.099
to get something big done.

00:45:22.099 --> 00:45:27.739
So that's how the Conservancy, it raises money
the old-fashioned way through members like

00:45:27.739 --> 00:45:29.019
you and like others like you.

00:45:29.019 --> 00:45:30.019
[pause]

00:45:30.019 --> 00:45:32.140
&gt;&gt;male in audience #4: That wasn't a real
egg was it?

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.140
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Huh?

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.390
&gt;&gt;male in audience #4: That thing you were
shaking was not a real egg?

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:39.229
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: It is a real egg. What do you
think I'm doing like faking these kids out?

00:45:39.229 --> 00:45:40.229
[laughter]

00:45:40.229 --> 00:45:41.229
[pause]

00:45:41.229 --> 00:45:43.599
&gt;&gt;male in audience #4: Does it really survive?

00:45:43.599 --> 00:45:46.400
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Here pass it, no, no, no. It's
look.

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.400
[laughter]

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.930
I've eaten what's inside it. Okay.

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:54.280
Let's go show, let's go show him 'cause I
don't think you believe it.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:55.749
&gt;&gt;male in audience #4: Like you, you were
shaking it so much --

00:45:55.749 --> 00:45:56.749
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Oh.

00:45:56.749 --> 00:45:57.749
&gt;&gt;male in audience #4: I was like --

00:45:57.749 --> 00:46:02.460
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Yeah, that ostrich, no, that ostrich,
no, it was a, a unfertilized egg from an ostrich

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.059
that I actually personally knew.

00:46:04.059 --> 00:46:06.769
&gt;&gt;male in audience #4: Oh, okay. [laughs]

00:46:06.769 --> 00:46:07.769
[laughter]

00:46:07.769 --> 00:46:13.219
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: It's actually true. It's one lonely
female that lives on a farm.

00:46:13.219 --> 00:46:14.219
[pause]

00:46:14.219 --> 00:46:16.849
&gt;&gt;male in audience #5: I really appreciated
you drawing a link between conservation and

00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:21.089
health and people living better lives. And
you gave us really great examples of how people

00:46:21.089 --> 00:46:24.339
who live with very little means do that.

00:46:24.339 --> 00:46:26.829
How can we draw that connection in our own
communities and perhaps in our own country

00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:30.329
where people live with great means and I think
don't make that connection?

00:46:30.329 --> 00:46:38.230
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: You know, so here's the way to
do this. I've had a struggle with it and it's

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:43.989
very hard to talk about conservation to people
who don't think maybe just like us. So you

00:46:43.989 --> 00:46:48.829
have to use whatever the words, whatever language
you can to talk about something that has real

00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:49.940
meaning to their lives.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:56.380
Rachel Carson 40 years ago she took on the
pesticide industry and broke them. I mean

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:03.160
she got DDT banned; one woman. And she did
that by talking to other women living, talking

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:10.369
directly to women in their kitchens back in
the 60's; talking to them about health and

00:47:10.369 --> 00:47:14.940
safety for their kids. So she said, "Look
if the songbirds aren't singing out there

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:19.839
in the woods do you really want your kids
playing out there? If the songbirds are dying,

00:47:19.839 --> 00:47:21.910
do you really want your kids out on the grass
lawn?"

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:28.170
I--I think that the problem with conservation
right now, this is my generation that we did

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:32.859
this, we started talking about biodiversity
and biodiversity became this all encompassing

00:47:32.859 --> 00:47:33.859
thing.

00:47:33.859 --> 00:47:38.579
And we said, "You go into a forest, you go
into coral reef, and the diversity of life

00:47:38.579 --> 00:47:43.359
blows us away." And because it blows us away
and listen, I, make no apology I live in Montana.

00:47:43.359 --> 00:47:46.700
I live in Montana because I wanna live in
a place where there's a big animal that could

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:51.720
potentially kill me when I go for a walk.
I like that sort of stuff. But I'm a pretty

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.869
rare individual when it comes to the grand
scheme of things.

00:47:54.869 --> 00:47:59.733
So the truth of the matter is, this notion
that nature's out there and it should be protected

00:47:59.733 --> 00:48:06.059
in all its glory almost like a cathedral,
I think is a bit false. We have thought so

00:48:06.059 --> 00:48:10.989
much about, what we need to do more is think
about how to integrate people in it; talking

00:48:10.989 --> 00:48:14.779
about not nature from people but nature for
people.

00:48:14.779 --> 00:48:17.920
And you can do it in simple ways: you can
talk about energy efficiencies in the Bay

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:24.630
Area. That is definitely within reach of everyone
here. Early adopters, right? Or you talk about

00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:29.459
how water goes into the Bay; you talk about
food you eat, where you're getting that food

00:48:29.459 --> 00:48:31.480
from. It does make a difference.

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.480
[pause]

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.779
&gt;&gt;Alan Eustace: One more question maybe before
 --

00:48:34.779 --> 00:48:35.990
&gt;&gt;Sanjayan: Right next to you.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:40.690
&gt;&gt;male in audience #6: What's the biggest
problem you run into when you're tryin' to

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:43.359
create like fish banks and other banks?

00:48:43.359 --> 00:48:49.420
&gt;Sanjayan: There're are two problems. One
is the--the issue that the gentleman talked

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:53.239
about a little bit before, conservation takes
money.

00:48:53.239 --> 00:48:57.700
And when we talk about fish banks we're talkin'
about them in the Solomon Islands, well guess

00:48:57.700 --> 00:49:01.880
what most of our donors don't live there;
they live here.

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.859
People like to give to things that are in
their own backyard. It's hard to get them

00:49:04.859 --> 00:49:10.890
to make that leap to some place very, very
far away. So you are really resource constrained

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:15.380
when you do conservation in these far away
places. That's the na--nature of the beast.

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:17.549
So that's one issue.

00:49:17.549 --> 00:49:23.029
The second issue is gaining people's trust.
So that's really hard. You could, you should

00:49:23.029 --> 00:49:27.459
never promise something to people that you
don't really wanna stand behind. It doesn't

00:49:27.459 --> 00:49:32.500
mean you can't make a mistake, but you can't
mislead them in any way at all. You have to

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:36.619
be completely transparent. If the numbers
don't add up and you're just asking them to

00:49:36.619 --> 00:49:41.069
say, "Look take a jump with me on this," then
tell 'em that. But you can't fake it, it'll

00:49:41.069 --> 00:49:44.549
catch up with you. It'll catch up with you
so fast and it'll all blow up. And I've seen

00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:47.099
it happen in conservation over and over and
over again.

00:49:47.099 --> 00:49:51.980
So you have to be really honest and transparent
when you talk to local communities. You never

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:54.839
talk down to people just because they speak
a different language.

00:49:54.839 --> 00:50:00.089
Those aboriginal people they knew more about
the environment than you could find out on

00:50:00.089 --> 00:50:05.059
the Internet today. They had this intimate
understanding of it and--and appreciated what

00:50:05.059 --> 00:50:09.569
they're bringing to the table is as valuable
as what you're bringing to the table, it's

00:50:09.569 --> 00:50:10.569
just different scale.

00:50:10.569 --> 00:50:14.359
And then be honest and open when you're having
discussions with them. That's the hardest

00:50:14.359 --> 00:50:15.549
challenge.

00:50:15.549 --> 00:50:16.549
Thank you guys so much.

00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:18.749
[applause]
