00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In order to solve this problem, we need to first make a key observation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Imagine that we have a block here that's suspended by four springs.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now we know that in order to calculate the net force on this block,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we have to add up all of the forces contributed by each of these springs,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
which is going to be four times the contribution of one spring.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But it also turns out that we can actually imagine all four of these springs

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
being replaced by just one single spring with a spring constant of 4K.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It turns out that springs when put in parallel like this, you can just add up their spring constants

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and treated as one common spring which is a pretty nifty trick.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now that we know this fact, we can actually just imagine all four of these springs

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
on the bottom of the car as just being one big spring with spring constant 4K

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and now we're ready to solve for the period of oscillations.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We learned in the unit that the period of springs oscillation

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is equal to 2Ï€ times the square root of the mass of the thing oscillating over the spring constant K.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In this problem; however, this K is actually not the same as this K.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Since this equation only applies to a block on one spring,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we can immediately it to a block on four springs but as we just argued,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
these four springs are actually equivalent to one spring with a spring constant of 4K,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
so we can actually replace this K with 4K and now we can use this equation.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And plugging in our numbers here, we find that the period of the oscillation of the car

00:01:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
on the spring is equal to 0.44 seconds.
