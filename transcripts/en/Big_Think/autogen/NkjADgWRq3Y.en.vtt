that we can anticipate so there's

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770
that we can anticipate so there's
 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.640

gift is the imagination and then one

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
gift is the imagination and then one
 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.760
gift is the imagination and then one
very practical and gifted teacher said

but the first comment I think is the
 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.290
but the first comment I think is the
most honest it's all couched in

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300
most honest it's all couched in
 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.100
most honest it's all couched in
metaphors and so I studied a variety of

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110
metaphors and so I studied a variety of
 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.400
metaphors and so I studied a variety of
methods people always made fun of me in

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410
methods people always made fun of me in
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.420
methods people always made fun of me in
acting school because I was always

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
acting school because I was always
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.370
acting school because I was always
taking notes I was very interested in

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380
taking notes I was very interested in
 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.800
taking notes I was very interested in
what is this how is it again that people

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810
what is this how is it again that people
 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.009
what is this how is it again that people
can change before my eyes and along the

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019
can change before my eyes and along the
 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.789
can change before my eyes and along the
way of my studying acting and also my

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799
way of my studying acting and also my
 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.910
way of my studying acting and also my
teaching acting I began to see that my

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920
teaching acting I began to see that my
 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.280
teaching acting I began to see that my
students sounded a lot alike and so I

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290
students sounded a lot alike and so I
 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.800
students sounded a lot alike and so I
wanted to show them that no human being

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
wanted to show them that no human being
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.690
wanted to show them that no human being
talks like another human being

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
talks like another human being
 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.229
talks like another human being
there are people who are identical like

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239
there are people who are identical like
 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.150
there are people who are identical like
you can have an identical twin of your

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160
you can have an identical twin of your
 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.789
you can have an identical twin of your
voice like there are people who sound

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799
voice like there are people who sound
 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.610
voice like there are people who sound
exactly like a sibling in the tone of

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620
exactly like a sibling in the tone of
 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.339
exactly like a sibling in the tone of
voice but nobody talks alike

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349
voice but nobody talks alike
 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.009
voice but nobody talks alike
and so I thought that one place to study

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019
and so I thought that one place to study
 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.160
and so I thought that one place to study
identity would be in the actual speech

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170
identity would be in the actual speech
 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.099
identity would be in the actual speech
of a given person and originally I was

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109
of a given person and originally I was
 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.970
of a given person and originally I was
going around interviewing people because

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980
going around interviewing people because
 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.949
going around interviewing people because
I wanted to teach something about that

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
I wanted to teach something about that
 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.379
I wanted to teach something about that
about individuality as it is captured

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389
about individuality as it is captured
 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.160
about individuality as it is captured
and in in the actual physical

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170
and in in the actual physical
 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.110
and in in the actual physical
physiological mechanism of making sounds

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120
physiological mechanism of making sounds
 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.990
physiological mechanism of making sounds
we are linguistic animals and then along

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
we are linguistic animals and then along
 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.809
we are linguistic animals and then along
the lines of doing that I developed this

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819
the lines of doing that I developed this
 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.390
the lines of doing that I developed this
method through which I make plays which

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400
method through which I make plays which
 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.960
method through which I make plays which
is that I interview people I take

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970
is that I interview people I take
 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.059
is that I interview people I take
something that they said and then I

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069
something that they said and then I
 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.879
something that they said and then I
attempt to say exactly what they said

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889
attempt to say exactly what they said
 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.069
attempt to say exactly what they said
more than word-for-word utterance for

more than word-for-word utterance for
 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.710
more than word-for-word utterance for

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720
utterance because I have come to see
 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.500
utterance because I have come to see
that it's in the way the utterances

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510
that it's in the way the utterances
 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.140
that it's in the way the utterances
themselves are manipulated that identity

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150
themselves are manipulated that identity
 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.129
themselves are manipulated that identity
comes forward so that's what I've been

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139
comes forward so that's what I've been
 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.229
comes forward so that's what I've been

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239
studying and practicing for a very very
 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.170
studying and practicing for a very very
long time and I have to say the thing

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180
long time and I have to say the thing
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.390
long time and I have to say the thing
that's unquenchable about me is

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400
that's unquenchable about me is
 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.009
that's unquenchable about me is
something I told you about earlier

guess I have to

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270
guess I have to
 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.560
guess I have to
more than 30 years now if I've been

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570
more than 30 years now if I've been
 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.650
more than 30 years now if I've been
learning anything it's that I've been

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660
learning anything it's that I've been
 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.050
learning anything it's that I've been
learning more and more about listening

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060
learning more and more about listening
 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.510
learning more and more about listening
and I never get tired of it never get

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520
and I never get tired of it never get
 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.940
and I never get tired of it never get
tired the goal is to tell a story that

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950
tired the goal is to tell a story that
 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.150
