00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here I've written down four claims.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
A context-free grammar always produces just a finite number of utterances.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
A context-free grammar can capture the language a^N and b^N, where N is the same.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Context-free grammars are more powerful than regular expressions,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and context-free grammars can tell if a program declares a variable before using it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Or equivalently, I could use a context-free grammar

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
to determine if a program declares every variable before he uses it.
