00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.419
we've done a couple experiments with acetone and dry ice to make a

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.559
Supercooled liquid that you could freeze things in the acetone has a freezing point

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.620
Below the temperature of dry ice and so it stays liquid

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.209
But today we're gonna see what happens to put acetone in something much colder liquid, nitrogen

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.350
We'll see if our acetone will freeze solid in liquid nitrogen, and if it does freeze

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.669
We'll see if it will still ignite when we hit it with a flame to make this a little bit easier

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.610
Let's pour some of our acetone from our big can into this squeeze bottle that'll make it easier to get the acetone where we want

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.189
It to go and perhaps drip it directly into our liquid, nitrogen

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.930
There's our thermos full of liquid nitrogen so

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.299
As a first test what I want to do is fill one of these balloons

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.300
just a little bit just so the

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.379
Main pouch of the balloon is nice and full of liquid and then I'll dip that down into the liquid, nitrogen

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.379
We'll see how that goes

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.769
Yes, I'm also not 100% sure what the acetone is going to do to the latex of the balloon so that's another experiment right now

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.010
All right balloon full of acetone lowering into liquid, nitrogen

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.449
The liquid nitrogen is getting really excited and splashing up a lot

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.680
And I don't really want it to be splashing on my fingers the whole time or else start getting frostbite

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.649
Just holding it. It's getting really cold cool

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.290
just from the vapors

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.110
Fingers were too cold

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.899
It's already rigid still got liquid at the top, so I don't think we're finished freezing. We've already made some good progress

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.390
And you can still see at the very top a little bit of liquid

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.929
I think we're seeing liquid assets home inside the solid acetone

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.889
Hard to tell hard to know if the acetone is frozen or just the balloon is frozen

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.780
While that's freezing a lower and empty balloon down into the liquid nitrogen as much as I can and we'll see

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.299
What happens when the latex freezes -?

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.909
All right, so this is a balloon I

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.869
Just managed to crack it there we go now I shattered it

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.429
So that's why I'm not sure we have frozen acetone or just the frozen balloon around liquid acetone

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.679
Now it's back to just being rubber stretchy as always

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.969
I think I still here liquid shaking around in there, but I do think that we have some solid acetone as well

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.580
So I think we've got a shell of solid acetone

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.250
surrounding some liquid acetone at this point

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.059
I just got to get it to the point where it's solid all the way through that's the goal

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.669
All right our acetone inna balloon has been in the liquid nitrogen for several minutes now

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.110
So I want to take it out and try and break the balloon off of it now the balloon

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.869
Itself is going to be very brittle right now. I'm gonna try and cut it we'll see what works generally

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.170
We just want to get the balloon off of the acetone however we can

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.440
Mmm that shattered

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.970
Well, we can see inside the balloon that we definitely have

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.300
solid acetone

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.649
And balloon has begun to crack. Yeah, maybe I can peel it off

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:04.319
There we go whoo chunk of solid a stone, let's see if this would night pour out the extra

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.640
The acetone around it will ignite, I don't know if our little lump of frozen acetone has actually lit

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.640
I'm just gonna pour this out, ooh

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.629
We can also see that our chunk was not solid all the way through

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.169
They had a little hollow spot in the middle where it was still liquid

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:33.599
I think well that was interesting it looked like the frozen acetone itself didn't like to stay ignited

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.519
It melted fairly quickly and all of the melted acetone seemed like it would burn fairly easily

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.690
But the ball of frozen acetone itself really didn't seem to do too much

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.840
Let's try again

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.019
I'm just dripping acetone everywhere. That's not a good seal at all

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:16.209
All right a balloon is attached. Let's see if it can hold pressure

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:27.999
Yes can hold pressure, so now I should be able to fill with acetone without it leaking everywhere in case this over the pot

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.240
I Think that's pretty good

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.460
Rubberband is actually holding that pretty well

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.270
Now this time we're using a larger quantity of acetone

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:55.780
And I really want to make sure that it freezes as much as possible so to help me hold it into the acetone bath

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.329
I'm gonna tie this string around the neck and then we'll have this string coming up out of the nozzle in our thermos

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.040
Just like that

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.220
Alright, let's slowly lower

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:11.259
Wow that starts doing exciting things right away. Let's slowly lower the balloon into the liquid, nitrogen

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.250
We go now our balloons attached on a string

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.759
Although it might just be floating. I'm not sure about the difference in density of liquid nitrogen and acetone

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.050
There's very cold vapor on my hands alright

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.569
Let's set that aside for maybe five or ten minutes and really let that acetone freeze

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.250
While our balloon full of acetone is cooling down in the liquid nitrogen. I have another experiment

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.099
I want to try I

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:50.179
Have some of our acetone still left in this squeeze bottle and I'm going to see what happens if we add food coloring to it

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.680
I don't know if these two will mix or if will just sort of stay separate. Let's find out

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:01.129
It looks like it's mixing a little bit. It's not like what happens if you put food coloring into oil

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.340
That's I?

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:10.549
Think that's made some green acetone. It does look like there are little tiny flecks floating around in it now and

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:15.319
I'm not sure if that's something that happened with the separation of the dye

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:19.999
Or if there are some other contaminants inside this bottle and those picked up even more of it

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:25.218
But for the most part this looks like green acetone to me so here we now have a Styrofoam plate

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:32.900
Covered in liquid nitrogen. Let's see what happens if we drip some of our bright green colored acetone down onto it

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.139
It went right down through the liquid nitrogen onto the plate

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:42.528
It might be cooling down so fast that it stops eating through let's try and get a smaller amount out

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.860
One drink that's all

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:03.799
Our balloon filled with acetone has now been sitting in our liquid nitrogen bath for five to ten minutes

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.329
And I'm hoping that it's solidified most of the way through let's take it out, and see how it's looking

00:08:14.669 --> 00:08:18.649
Well that's something definitely deformed a little bit

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:24.829
It's not quite the same round shape that it was before I want to try taking the balloon off then same thing

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.139
Let's see if we can get our little ball of acetone to light

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:33.799
I also might take it and after it's got the balloon off and put it back into the liquid nitrogen for a couple minutes. Oh

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.409
Something just cracked. Oh that was the balloon. I think it just shattered off

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.100
How neat

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.220
I might still have

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.550
some liquid

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:57.349
There we go here is our frozen acetone balloon, which is quickly?

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.429
Dripping off liquid and probably just melting so I'm going to throw it back in the liquid, nitrogen

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.209
Thinking the time that it took to move it from the pot into the liquid, nitrogen

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.020
I had melted the shape of the tongs into the sides of it

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:17.839
stuff heats up quickly

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:23.070
Now we want to pull our frozen

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.390
Acetone ball out of the liquid nitrogen put it in the pot and try and light it on fire

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.569
But so it doesn't have time to warm up as much. Let's do all of that outside with blowtorch sitting ready Oh

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.119
Our acetone has split apart well now we have several different pieces that we can try this with

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.290
Nothing

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.889
Stop coming right toward me all the time put this out with some nature infuse

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:04.880
Yep

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.659
All right, let's see the piece. We do here at this time

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:12.340
Let's see the metal of the tongs is just melting right down through it

00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:32.269
It's just making my hand cold I

00:10:32.699 --> 00:10:35.688
Have to say I'm a little disappointed that we can't light this on fire

00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:40.488
Well there you have it the results of freezing acetone in liquid, nitrogen

00:10:40.939 --> 00:10:47.269
It definitely freezes it turns into a hard solid material. I was a little disappointed that we couldn't get it to light on fire

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.029
while it was still in its frozen State

00:10:50.129 --> 00:10:54.498
He did melt very quickly and the melted acid home was very easy to light on fire of course

00:10:54.499 --> 00:11:00.889
But frozen acetone sadly does not seem to burn acetone may not burn very well while it's in its frozen state

00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:06.589
But it's still pretty useful stuff including if you want to make your own supercooled liquid, but don't have access to liquid nitrogen

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.699
Remember if you have a bath of acetone with a lot of dry ice in it

00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:16.428
You can get it down to over a hundred degrees Fahrenheit below zero. That's cold enough to freeze a lot of stuff

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:21.769
Thank you for joining us for this video as part of our never-ending quest to dunk every known substance in the liquid, nitrogen

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:26.149
Remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at the king of random calm. See you there

00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:31.219
Now one more thing that I am going to try even though. It's maybe not the wisest

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:36.589
acetone has a fairly low burn point so I've got some insulated gloves on and

00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:39.048
I'm just gonna see if I can light my hands on fire with it

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.660
Just a little bit

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.160
There we go

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:54.579
That was fun smart maybe not fun no of course not never try that it's not fun at all

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.240
