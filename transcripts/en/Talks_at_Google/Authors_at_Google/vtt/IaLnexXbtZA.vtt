ROBIN ROSENBERG: Thank you.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.490
My talk today is "Superheroes
and the Life Lessons They

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.870
Teach Us." And part of my
mission is that I think the

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.857
scientific psychology, we know a
lot of fun facts to know and

00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:21.110
tell that can more importantly
improve people's lives

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.090
if only they knew.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.615
And even if they knew,
the important thing

00:00:23.615 --> 00:00:24.890
is that they remember.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.430
So what I try to do is teach
these little kernels in ways

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.170
that are memorable.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.020
And popular culture figures
are great examples.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.020
Superheroes, in particular,
are wonderful examples.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.040
Let me tell you a little bit
about how I got started on

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.840
this venture, in this
trajectory, if you will.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.410
I have three sons.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.710
And when the oldest two were in
preschool, they came home

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.950
talking about the X-Men.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.680
So I read comics as a kid.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.620
Mostly DC, I have to admit.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.140
And the X-Men was after
my time as a kid.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.129
And so they were coming home
wanting to know about X-Men,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.760
or wanting to watch Saturday
morning cartoons and talking

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.330
about X-Men.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.690
And so I bought some
X-Men cartoons,

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.750
comic books, and videos.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.380
And I was also writing an
introductory psychology

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.410
textbook at the time for
college students.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.760
And I opened up the X-Men
comics, and I was blown away

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.390
by how much psychology
there was.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.480
Show of hands, how many people
are familiar with X-Men?

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.420
OK, good.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.300
And so that started
me on this path.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.210
So I'll be using a lot
of examples as

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.500
you'll be able to see.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.470
I'm going to talk about
hopefully four, but

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.920
realistically probably
three lessons.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.450
One is being different
can give you power.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.970
Another is adversity
can be overcome.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.150
And the costume counts.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.400
My mother was right.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.200
And then if we have time, I'll
do superheroes aren't the only

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.930
ones with alter-egos.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.040
OK, so being different
can give you power.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.100
Show of hands, how
many people here

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.600
grew up feeling different?

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.300
How many people grew up
not feeling different?

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.220
Wow.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.180
OK, so one person raised
their hand.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.039
It's unusual.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.009
Usually everybody raises
their hand.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.315
So we can talk more
afterwards.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.490
There is a phenomenon in
psychology where human beings

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.150
are wired with something called
social categorization.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.640
We're prone to divide the world
into "us" versus "them."

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.700
And we are always in "us,"
wherever we are.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.520
"Them," the technical
term is outgroup.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.240
And those people are generally
considered more negatively.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.590
They have more undesirable
attributes.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.860
And outgroup is seen as more
homogeneous than it really is.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.110
So, for instance, vampires,
unless there's something I

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.690
don't know going on,
are the outgroup.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.540
And so we view them as
pretty similar--

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.870
fangs, suck blood, that
kind of thing.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.195
And we don't generally like
them, at least until recently.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.850
And that's another example
of an outgroup.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.140
That's the 1966 "Batman"
villains.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.330
I mean, they're very colorful.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.380
But we it's all "them."

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.710
"Us," the term is the ingroup.

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.880
And we consider ourselves
generally more positively.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.170
And we are more likely to help,
trust, and cooperate

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.680
with members of our group.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.720
So this is Buffy.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.295
Show of hands, familiar with
"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"?

00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:27.300
OK, great.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.480
So this is her.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.660
And the Scoobies.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.180
And eventually, it includes
vampires.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.660
So the "us" gets wider.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.300
And it's not simply vampires
versus humans.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.580
But it becomes a little
bit more complex.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.420
And the ingroup, everyone has
their own back story.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.280
It's interesting.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.080
That's another us,
DC superheroes.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.490
And so we are prone to divide
the world into "us" versus

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.450
"them." And whenever we do, we
amplify the differences.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.650
Blue eyes versus brown eyes--

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.510
I don't know how many--
elementary school, there was

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.930
this program going
on for kids.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.230
Now being different can
refer to variety

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:07.490
of different qualities.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.050
You can be physically different,
like Nightcrawler,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.270
who is blue and has a tail
and can teleport.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.769
This is a version of the Bat
Girl character, Barbara

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.459
Gordon, where her back is
broken by the Joker.

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.480
And so she's in a wheelchair.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.070
You can be psychologically
different.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.250
These are five different
psychological dimensions of

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.390
personality.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.440
And so people fall on each
of the five lines.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.810
They'll have a point on which
they fall on those dimensions.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.790
And your profile will be unique
because, really, the

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.770
points are infinite
on the continuum.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.040
And so you are different.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.480
People at the extremes
are quite different.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.960
But everyone is different,
psychologically,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.810
from someone else.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.410
You can be different by
virtue of having an

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.770
unusual personal history.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.810
For instance, Bruce Wayne
witnessed his parents' death.

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.370
Hopefully, that is unusual.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.990
But, unfortunately, he's
not the only one

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.320
who's experienced that.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.490
So there are a lot of different
ways to be and feel

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.960
different within a given
social context.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.930
And I'm going to come
back to the

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.560
importance of social context.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.930
So this is normal curve,
the bell curve.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.300
People are undoubtedly
familiar with it.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.790
And we typically think of being
different as being in

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.970
the yellow parts, or
maybe part of the

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.150
reddish pink parts.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.770
And psychologically, depends on
what you're talking about,

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.820
whether being different is
restricted to the tails.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.000
Basically because of the social
categorization "us"

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.070
versus "them" phenomenon,
whenever you're feeling

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.590
different about something, it
puts you at risk to feel part

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.990
of the outgroup when you're
out in the larger world.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.860
So you could be in the blue
normal curve, the biggest

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.290
part, the most frequent part
of the bell curve.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.610
But if you're with people who
are in either of the yellow

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.960
parts, you will feel different,
even though

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.840
statistically you're not.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.810
But that won't matter.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.030
Your psychological experience of
being different is totally

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.000
based on your social context.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.850
So if you were really smart, for
instance, and didn't have

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.370
a magnet class or a magnet
school, and you were with

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.670
other kids who weren't as
smart or gifted in a

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.410
particular way, you would
feel different.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.050
But if you had gone to a magnet
school with other

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.850
people like you, you wouldn't
feel different.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.330
Everybody with me on that?

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.050
How many people here went to
some kind of special school,

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.320
magnet school?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.530
Interesting.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.520
So this is the Thing from
the Fantastic Four.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.080
And he is walking through a
glass doorway, which breaks

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.370
because he's too big for it.

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.070
And he says, "Why must they
build doorways so narrow?"

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.950
And the point here is simply
that, again, when he's out in

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.880
the social world of everybody
else, all the people in the

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.960
blue part of the normal curve,
he feels really different,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.730
which isn't as noticeable
depending

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:10.990
on his social context.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.460
So being different usually
means being part of an

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.930
outgroup unless you're fortunate
to be in a place

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.490
where there are lots of other
different people like you.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:21.520
So it's a little bit of a
problem to be different.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.340
And you may have experienced
this.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.430
There's this tension between
wanting to either be or appear

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.940
normal, to fit in, to be like
everybody else in your social

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.690
context, versus accepting
yourself as you are.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.070
Because if you want to be or
appear normal, there's a part

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.250
where you don't like yourself,
which is an

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.450
uncomfortable way to be.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:44.710
So I'm going to show you some
little clips from "X-Men First

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.460
Class," which is the prequel to
"X-Men." It's the film in

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.030
which they start to realize they
have powers and find each

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.460
other and feel a sense
of belonging.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.920
Show of hands, how many people
have seen "X-Men First Class"?

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.390
Cool.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.880
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.064
-You have no idea what I'd
give to feel normal.

00:08:03.064 --> 00:08:03.830
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.360
ROBIN ROSENBERG: So that the guy
on the right becomes the

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.300
character Beast.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.570
He so desperately wants to feel
normal that he injects--

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:14.590
he basically tries out a serum
on himself and ends up

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.760
becoming even more mutated.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.300
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.374
-You want society to
accept you, but you

00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:23.860
can't even accept yourself.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:25.581
-Should we have to hide?

00:08:25.581 --> 00:08:25.980
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.230
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Should we
have to hide who we are?

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.930
So that's one.

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.040
People are struggling with this

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.270
issue about being different.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.500
This is a clip from "The
Incredibles." Show of hands,

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.640
how many people have seen
"The Incredibles"?

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.220
OK, so it's a grown-up
cartoon film.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.929
Kids think they understand
it, but they don't.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.250
It's really for adults.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:45.780
And it's a family.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.680
The superheroes have kind of
gone underground because there

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.250
was a lot of bad press
and stuff.

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:55.040
So they are trying to be normal,
be like everyone else.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.570
The older daughter
has a power where

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:00.620
she can become invisible.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.390
So her name is Violet.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:05.590
And the younger son Dash
is like the Flash.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:07.540
He can be really fast.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.020
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.500
-Normal?

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.940
What do you know about normal?

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.820
What does anyone in this family
know about normal?

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.740
-Now, wait a minute,
young lady.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:15.700
-We act normal, Mom.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.660
I want to be normal.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.750
The only one normal
is Jack Jack.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.390
And he's--

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:19.520
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.090
ROBIN ROSENBERG: And
he's a baby.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:22.860
OK.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.675
And then we have Dash.

00:09:23.675 --> 00:09:23.950
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.180
-I want to go out for sports.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.440
-Honey, you know why
we can't do that.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.025
-But I promise I'll slow up.

00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:31.780
I'll only be the best
by a tiny bit.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.200
-Patience.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.660
-You always say, do your best.

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.920
But you don't really mean it.

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.820
Why can't I do the best
that I can do?

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:38.820
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.210
ROBIN ROSENBERG: So it's
the other side.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.870
So in the family, they're
playing out both

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.330
sides of this dilemma.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.440
So people in real life and
superheroes find different

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.460
solutions to this.

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:49.610
Show of hands, how
many people have

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.230
seen the TV show "Heroes"?

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.640
OK, first season was great.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.280
But it was really hard to know
where to go with it.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.100
So in the TV show, it's like
X-Men that people have powers

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:03.880
that they develop.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.280
It's a mysterious process.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.120
And one of them can talk to
electronic devices or

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.260
electrical devices.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.520
And he doesn't really spread the
word around because people

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.030
would think he was
really weird.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:18.260
So he says-- this is
a cartoon version--

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.520
but I keep that a secret.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.650
You never how some people
react to secrets.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.850
So he hides it.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.268
The solution is to pass,
if you will.

00:10:26.268 --> 00:10:28.220
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.950
ROBIN ROSENBERG: This is
Mystique, who is, in her

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.480
natural state, blue.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.260
Her dilemma is to pass
or not pass.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:38.790
And in the beginning,
she passes.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.310
Another solution is to
pretend that your

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.570
differences are flukes.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:47.430
This is an early Superboy
cartoon when he lifts a car to

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.700
save someone.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.070
And his friends see.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.400
And they're wowed.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.170
And he says, I guess something
happened just for a minute to

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:55.910
give me super strength.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.800
Right?

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.670
And people do actually exhibit
super strength when there are

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:03.180
emergencies like this, so OK.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.520
Another solution, which is the
one that I advocate, is to

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:11.040
accept and, if possible,
enjoy being different.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.750
And that when you're by
yourself, or with family and

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.290
friends who are supportive,
being different can be a

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:18.960
positive force.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.210
So this is Superboy being alone
and having fun just

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:29.130
exploring his powers, leaping
tall barns in a single bound.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.650
And this is the kid from
"Heroes." And his mom thinks

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.760
what he can do is amazing.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.870
And she just thinks he's
the cat's meow.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.390
And loves spending
time with him.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:43.460
And it really helps him be
comfortable with himself.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.240
This is the Fantastic Four.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.890
And in contrast to when the
Thing is out in public

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.400
breaking glass doorways, when
he's with other people who are

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:56.940
sort of like him in that they
got morphed, he can be really

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:02.230
comfortable and be himself
and feel proud and good.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.610
"X-Men First Class," when they
find each other, again, it's

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:11.230
about finding your people,
if you will.

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.020
Whoops--and that was "The
Incredibles" when they

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.380
acknowledge their differences
and don their tights.

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.670
So how can you make being
different work for you?

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.730
So superheroes teach us to
recognize and acknowledge the

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:26.700
ways that we're different.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:27.060
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.390
-But Dad always said our powers
were nothing to be

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:29.960
ashamed of.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.290
Our powers made us special.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:32.780
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.890
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Thank
you, Dash.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:39.970
So with recognition, when you
acknowledge and recognize,

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:41.920
comes exploration.

00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.880
Again, these three little
steps are what

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.310
superheroes teach us.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:48.450
When you realize you're
different, you want to know,

00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:49.610
so what does that mean?

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.300
What are the parameters
about being different?

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.560
How different am I?

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:58.060
So, from the TV show "Heroes,"
this young woman realizes this

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.450
she's never been sick.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.580
If she hurts herself, she
gets better right away.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.260
So in exploring, she puts her
hand down the garbage disposal

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.260
and turns it on.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.920
It heals right away.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.170
It was a little cool CGI.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.600
But exploration is
really important.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:18.350
This is a schematic of
Spiderman's spider-injecting,

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:22.150
spider-webbing stuff.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.650
It's a little creepy,
the idea that it

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:26.530
comes out of his wrist.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.240
But it was a schematic so he
could understand and explore.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:30.780
What are the limits of this?

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.920
What are the parameters?

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:35.420
And in the film, he tries to see
how much he can get away

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.070
with without going on empty.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.730
And this is what happens
when you don't explore.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.880
This is not a DC Comic.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.440
It says, "Superboy politely
apologizes for ripping some

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.250
dude's arm off." And he says,
"Aw man, I'm sorry.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.020
That's totally my bad." Because
he didn't know the

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.660
limits of his strength.

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.530
This is a version in which he
did not explore the parameters

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.440
of his ability to
be different.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.990
Also, there's control.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.400
So one of the things that Luke
Skywalker does is learn to

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.970
control the ways that
he's different.

00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:11.440
Buffy learns to control.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.880
She has some super strength.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.430
She learns to control that.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:18.650
The other thing that happens
when you're different and you

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.770
acknowledge that is you
hopefully will decide to what

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.950
purpose should that
different-ness be put.

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.910
Superman, Clark Kent, struggles
with the gifts that

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:32.950
he's been given and how
should he use them.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:37.790
NPR a while back had a
little radio poll.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.040
If you could have a superpower,
what would it be?

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.060
And people would say, oh, X-ray
vision so I could see in

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.180
the girls' locker room,
or invisibility

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.420
and I'd rob a bank.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.150
And I think at some point,
it gets kind of boring.

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.610
You know, how many girls' locker
rooms you want to look

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.300
in before you decide,
OK, now what?

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.410
And that's--

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.660
I mean, unless you're
a really early

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.670
pubescent teenager or something.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:07.300
So purpose becomes
really important.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.760
All the superheroes have this.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.610
They have an ability.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.060
How do they want to use it?

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:15.270
That's Hermione Granger,
who's definitely a

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:17.420
superhero in my book.

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.160
Tony Stark, Iron Man.

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.280
So the other thing superheroes
teach us is to band together

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.990
with like-minded folks.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:30.260
So these are the X-Men,
Fantastic Four, DC

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.030
superheroes.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.510
So this is Comic-Con,
banding together

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:36.260
with like-minded folks.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.080
I don't know what these people
are, but they're clearly

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.710
banding together and they're
like-minded.

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.400
Banding together with
like-minded folks--

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.850
I mean, people are amazing.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.770
There's so many different ways
we can be different.

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.340
Banding together with
like-minded folks.

00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:51.590
Sometimes you are
the only one.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:53.630
There is no one else like you.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.890
And so in the middle, this is
Clark Kent from "Smallville."

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.880
And until his cousin appears,
there is no

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.110
other alien from Krypton.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.440
So the best you can do is band
together with people who

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:08.650
accept the ways that you're
different and support you.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.870
And those are his friends who
know that he's super.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.900
This is Hell Boy
and Abe Sapien.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.530
They are the only
ones on Earth.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.940
But they band together with
people who support them.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.600
So lesson one, acknowledge
the ways in

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.790
which you're different.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.750
Until you claim it is a part
of yourself, you'll be

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.040
fighting against it.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.485
Explore the boundaries of
your different-ness.

00:16:29.485 --> 00:16:32.090
Learn to control it.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.120
Think about how you
want to use it.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.620
And then band together with
like-minded folks.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.010
OK, so each of us is different
from everyone else.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:41.910
But we're similar in
that we're all

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.660
different from each other.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.540
That's the take-home message.

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.250
All right.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:47.250
Adversity can be overcome.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:51.420
Show of hands, how many people
here have experience--

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:54.100
I'm not going to ask any more
details than this--

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.530
experienced a traumatic stress
or significant adversity?

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.610
How many people have not?

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:03.760
You are really lucky.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.099
And I hope that that lasts.

00:17:05.099 --> 00:17:07.700
Most people will in their
lifetimes experience

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:10.430
significant adversity.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.400
And a fun fact to
know and tell--

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.270
well, actually, first let me ask
you this other question.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:20.470
So based on what you know of
the world, if someone has a

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.880
traumatic event, do you think
the likelihood is greater than

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.250
50% that they'll develop

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.920
post-traumatic stress disorder?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.490
So if you agree that at least
50% of the people who

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:33.700
experience the trauma will get
PTSD, raise your hand.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.950
Wow.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.310
As a psychologist, I was in this
group until I read the

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:43.790
statistic that only 20% of
people who experience a trauma

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:46.670
go on to develop PTSD, which is
not what's portrayed in the

00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.660
films and movies and books.

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.820
And so I just thought that
was really interesting.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.620
And we know a lot at now about
what makes people more

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.920
vulnerable to developing it.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.280
But I'm not talking
about PTSD today.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.030
It's a little interesting
fact.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:03.635
I want to talk about the 80% of
people, and the people who

00:18:03.635 --> 00:18:06.520
have PTSD who moved
past it, which is

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.940
adversity can be overcome.

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:10.300
Many superheroes have

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.720
experienced significant adversity.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:18.080
Just to name a few, we've got
Peter Parker, who initiated a

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.410
series of events that led to
the murder of his beloved

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:23.650
uncle and guardian Ben.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.490
Prof.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.050
Charles Xavier is a telepath and
was through the Holocaust

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.690
and experienced many peoples'
deaths in his mind.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:32.940
Jean Grey is similar.

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.890
As a kid, she's a telepath and
experienced the death of her

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:39.500
friend in a car crash, depending
on which version.

00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:42.040
Anakin Skywalker, where
do we start?

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:46.463
But he witnessed the torture and
then death of his mother,

00:18:46.463 --> 00:18:49.860
then turned to the dark side.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.070
Many of us, as I said, have
experienced some kind of

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.570
traumatic stressor or
significant adversity.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:57.350
How are we doing on time?

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:58.930
OK.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:05.480
I'm going to skip over the
specific kind of stressors and

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.940
adversity that people can have
because we know them.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:12.140
But if we look at our
superheroes, what type did

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.280
they experience?

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:15.980
So this is Bruce Wayne
and witnessed the

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.070
murder of his parents.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.900
And his own life
was in danger.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:23.330
And then I'm going to show you
Tony stark from "Iron Man 1."

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:25.330
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.160
ROBIN ROSENBERG: And for those
of you in the know, in the

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.550
film, in contrast to the comics,
this was intended.

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.720
He was the target versus him
being an accidental target in

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.615
the comic, which actually makes
the story, I think, I

00:19:44.615 --> 00:19:46.000
think a bit richer.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.930
Intended personal violence is
the one that tends to leave

00:19:48.930 --> 00:19:50.040
the biggest wake.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.390
So if you were assaulted versus
in a natural disaster,

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:59.990
you're more likely to have a
bigger psychological effect.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.700
People cope with adversity and
trauma by making meaning of

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.790
their events and aftermath.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.450
And they understand it in a
larger framework about the

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:09.790
meaning of life.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:13.770
So for most of us, before
adversity hits, we have a set

00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.610
of global beliefs.

00:20:15.610 --> 00:20:20.170
They include a belief in a just
world, which is that you

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:22.265
deserve what you get and you
get what you deserve.

00:20:22.265 --> 00:20:24.970
It's a little circular,
a little childish, but

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:28.530
nonetheless, that we're
human, that it's

00:20:28.530 --> 00:20:30.010
possible to trust others--

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.900
not all others, but
there are some

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.730
trustworthy people out there--

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.820
and that it's possible to be
effective in the world.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.190
These beliefs drive
our global goals.

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.540
Whatever we're striving toward,
we're striving because

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.720
we believe that if we work hard,
we'll have an effect.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.100
That if we work at a
relationship, you know

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.740
inherently the person
will be trustworthy.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.530
We should try to find friends
and an intimate partner.

00:20:55.530 --> 00:21:00.380
And that if we do good, we
should get good-- a belief in

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.180
a just world.

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:06.050
And then the beliefs and the
goals give us a sense that

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.170
life has purpose.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.180
We're moving forward.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.660
We have meaning.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:12.550
Unfortunately, when you
experience significant

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:16.720
adversity or trauma, you say,
why did this happen?

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.890
Or if a loved one experienced
it, why did it happen to them?

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:22.640
Because it really challenges
a belief in a just world.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.510
If I'm a basically good person
and something bad happens to

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.710
me, does it mean
I deserved it?

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.420
Because I get what I deserve
and I deserve what I get.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.770
So it challenges the beliefs.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:37.730
Oh, whoops, wrong button.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:41.580
So, again, it challenges
belief in a just world.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.200
If the trauma or adversity
involved another person who

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.470
was untrustworthy that we
trusted, it calls into

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.200
question our ability to evaluate
people and decide who

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.470
is trustworthy and who isn't.

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:54.770
And that's pretty scary.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.330
And if we weren't able to
protect ourselves or the other

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:01.100
person that we care about, then
how can we be effective

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.220
in the world?

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.260
Because that's really the most
important thing is to really

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.720
protect yourself or
other people.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.090
And these are pretty grim
existential questions that

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.140
people ask themselves after
adversity or a trauma.

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:17.460
So you question your global
beliefs which causes you to

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.410
question your goals.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:20.400
Because why am I working
so hard if I

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.580
don't get what I deserve?

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.450
If I can't be effective,
what's the point?

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:29.840
And, in fact, life can feel
meaningless and purposeless.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.930
There's a natural process.

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:32.210
People work through this.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:35.200
Human beings are absolutely
amazing.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.600
And part of how we work through
it and the process of

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:39.620
working through it is to develop
a fuller understanding

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.380
of why the negative events
happened, thinking through the

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.360
implications, which may be
changing the idea that you

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.660
don't get what you deserve--

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.720
you know, life isn't fair--

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.710
discovering possible silver
linings; recognizing that

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.800
other people are often worse
off, and putting the events in

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.150
a broader context.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:04.490
So with resolution, people get
a heightened sense of self

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:06.470
where they're aware of
their vulnerability.

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.200
They appreciate life more.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.860
And Nietzsche was right, a sense
of being stronger for

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.300
having survived.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:19.380
They have an increased
connection to other people.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:22.010
They're more expressive
emotionally, more disclosing

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.360
about what happened to them,
and, in general, an increased

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:27.130
empathy for others.

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.210
And they have an altered
philosophy of life.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:34.270
And this is, I think, where
superheroes model for us.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.630
They're more spiritual.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:36.940
They live life more fully.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:38.726
But they're also social
activists.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.520
So I'm going to go through
the story of Batman.

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.800
Does anyone here not know
Batman's origin story?

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.390
Great.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:53.610
Really quick, bottom panel's
his parents get killed.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.750
This is the original 1939
comic, by the way.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.530
It was his back story
developed in the

00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.080
sixth Batman comic.

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.170
Bruce Wayne is incredibly
precocious in so many ways.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:06.920
And so the important panel is
the last one, which is "Days

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.970
later, a curious and strange
scene takes place." For most

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:12.190
people, this is not days.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.020
This may not even be
weeks or months.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.840
But because he's Bruce Wayne,
it happens in days.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.340
"And I swear by the spirit of
my parents to avenge their

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:22.190
deaths by spending the rest
of my life warring on all

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:24.400
criminals."

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.190
So he has gone through all of
this resolution process within

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:31.580
a few days of this terrible
thing happened to me.

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.060
It causes me to challenge
my beliefs and goals.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.010
And I now have a new goal.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.430
And it makes my life
feel meaningful.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.360
He then proceeds to dedicate the
next decade or so of his

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.590
life to not just becoming a
scientist detective, but also

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:50.680
being at the peak
physical shape.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.960
Is it fiction?

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.410
So psychologically, there's no
one who's really wealthy, who

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.190
has all these gadgets,
who's going around.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.920
There are real-life superheroes
in New York, but I

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.030
don't think any of them
are like Bruce Wayne.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.300
Psychologically, show of hands,
how many people think

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.930
it's fiction, doesn't
really ring true?

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:08.600
I've already got--

00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.520
no, it's not.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.350
So I don't know how many of
you people remembered Adam

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:16.490
Walsh, a young kid who was
kidnapped in the '80s and then

00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.050
later found murdered.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:22.050
His parents started the Adam
Walsh Foundation to help

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.740
families of missing kids.

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.280
His dad, David Walsh, went on
to be on "America's Most

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.430
Wanted."

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.550
So these are all variants
of the psychologically

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:31.900
true story of Batman.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:36.600
So David Walsh dedicated the
rest of his life to helping

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:39.810
prevent what happened to him,
to his son, and after the

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:43.910
fact, helping people
if it did happen.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.380
Jill Markussen was a
mortgage broker.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.370
And in 2008, she lost her job
and almost lost her home.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.880
And her community pitched in to
help her make her mortgage

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.750
so she didn't lose her home.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:58.020
And when she got back on her
feet, she started Project

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.960
Flipmode to help other people
who are in danger of losing

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.210
their homes.

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:08.920
Willie Minniefield, his brother
needed a new kidney.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.260
And minorities tend not to
donate organs at the same rate

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.380
as do whites.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.810
And so, unfortunately, it didn't
work in time, but he

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:21.210
developed a Minority Organ
Donation Education Program to

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:24.140
encourage minority
organ donation.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.340
Christy Nicholson, her husband
was killed in a

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.520
shootout with someone.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.880
She, every year, does a huge
blood drive that have saved

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.360
hundreds of lives.

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.510
These are all real stories.

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.260
I mean, it's easy
to find these.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:37.610
I mean, it's totally easy.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:38.860
They're all over.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.860
And these are the true
Batman stories.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.440
So the writers of Batman, Bob
Kane and Bill Finger really

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.060
found something that was true.

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.540
And they translated it into
a superhero form.

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:57.480
But what they created was
real, psychologically.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.820
Unfortunately, there's another
way to resolve this

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:01.670
discrepancy.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.050
And that's to become
cynical and bitter.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.080
And this is true.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.360
And we, unfortunately, see
this in real life.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.940
You have people who develop
global beliefs

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:11.890
that they're cynical.

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.940
They're greedy.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.830
And they're hedonistic.

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.370
And they say, hey,
life is short.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.210
I want to get mine
while I can.

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:18.450
We see this on Wall Street.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.950
We see it in companies.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:21.310
We see it in relationships.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:23.870
And we see it in our villains.

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:27.740
So Magneto came through the
other side of the Holocaust

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:30.830
and had a very different
philosophy than Professor X.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:32.120
The Joker--

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.960
whatever his back story
is, and we will

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.480
never know the truth--

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.600
he certainly came out the other
side with the sense of,

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.260
hey, live for today.

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.140
See how much sick fun
you can have.

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.390
And Two-Face, same thing.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:45.770
Life is capricious.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:47.040
Things are taken away from me.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.470
I'm going to get mine.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.290
So be a superhero.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:56.620
Develop new global beliefs, new
global goals, new meaning

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.050
and purpose.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:03.270
The costume counts.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.690
I don't know about you, but when
I was a kid, my mother--

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:11.080
going shopping for clothes
was exquisite torture.

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.640
Because I wanted to dress
how I wanted to dress.

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.960
And she would say, no, it's
really important to make an

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.380
impression.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.240
To this day, I will
not go shopping

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.350
with anyone for clothes.

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:25.390
But it had an impact on me.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:27.120
Her words resonate in my head.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.930
And for many, many years,
I didn't believe her.

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:33.110
And then I became
a psychologist.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:37.160
And it was really hard to admit
that she was right.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.870
What you wear affects you and
other people and the way they

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:41.560
respond to you.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.090
And I'm going to walk you
through a little bit about the

00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:46.460
science about this and what
we learn from superheroes.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.850
Choose wisely.

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:51.070
I did not take her advice
for a very long time.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.800
That's a costume.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.750
These are all costumes.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.350
Costumes are not just for
superheroes or Halloween.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.310
We live in New York.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.020
You know this.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.640
Costumes are everywhere.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.340
This is a costume.

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:04.760
Costumes.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.700
CCer Certainly a costume.

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:14.180
So a costume communicates
something about ourselves,

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:14.960
what we wear.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.760
It is a costume.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:17.070
Everyone, we're all
wearing costumes

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.760
I'm wearing a costume.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.880
You're wearing a costume.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.970
So our dress communicates
a public self.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.860
So this is Britney Spears
in her public

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.970
costume, such as it is.

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.490
And there's also what we want
to communicate about our

00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:32.870
private selves.

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:36.760
And that's her private self.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.880
How we dress also communicates
some aspect of a role that

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.780
we're playing.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.240
And so we role play
with costumes.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:48.525
In our daily wear, , again,
it's a costume.

00:29:48.525 --> 00:29:50.730
We're communicating something
about ourselves.

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:53.740
In our evening or weekend wear,
we're communicating

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.510
something about ourselves.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.630
And at special events,
we're communicating

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:58.700
something about ourselves.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:04.110
So at weddings, at live action
role plays, we are

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.640
communicating something
about ourselves.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.550
Superheroes are communicating
something about themselves

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:12.020
when they wear their costume.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.440
We also communicate something
about ourselves and our

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:21.350
costume electronically with our
profiles and blogs, with

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:25.570
our avatars for those
who have an avatar.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:29.520
And when we don these
costumes, we're also

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.990
communicating how we want to
influence how other people

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.930
view us and treat us.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:35.800
Or we should be.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.100
I mean, I didn't think I was,
but my mother was right.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.430
So people do form impressions of
you based on what the glean

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:44.980
from your costume and
your appearance.

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:48.130
So, OK, what do you
think about her?

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:50.610
Real quick, just shout
out whatever.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.540
What do you think of her?

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:56.083
What are you inferring
about her?

00:30:56.083 --> 00:30:56.830
AUDIENCE: Preppy.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:57.120
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Happy?

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:57.540
AUDIENCE: Preppy.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.330
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Preppy.

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.460
OK, what made her look preppy?

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:01.260
AUDIENCE: The plaid.

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:01.990
ROBIN ROSENBERG: The plaid.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.190
OK.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.060
Anything else?

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:05.030
Any other thoughts?

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:06.990
into manga.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.910
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Into manga.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.620
AUDIENCE: Because of her
costume, it looks manga-esque.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.430
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Because of
her costume, it looks

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:12.430
manga-esque.

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.940
Any other thoughts?

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:15.800
OK.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] ironic.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.800
ROBIN ROSENBERG:
Ironic because?

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.210
AUDIENCE: She's sort of going
over the top in the schoolgirl

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.270
sense and kind of back
around the other way.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.750
Or at least that's one way
to think about it.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:26.470
ROBIN ROSENBERG: OK.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:27.450
Going over the top.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:28.300
Good.

00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:29.560
I gave this talk last night.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.290
And I've never had this happen
before, but someone said they

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:34.400
thought she was a prostitute.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:38.210
And another person thought
that she was a stripper.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.700
Wow.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:41.640
That had never entered
my mind.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.780
Show of hands, actually, how
many think that's possible

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.160
from seeing this photograph?

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.410
Whoa.

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:54.180
So the point is we all make
inferences about each other.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.890
Some of us make different
inferences than others.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.460
But we all make inferences about
people based on how they

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.630
look and how they dress.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:02.860
There also is a whole
other [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.290
Her posture is also such that
it's going to lead you to make

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:08.810
these-- it's not simply what
she's wearing, but it's her

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.120
non-verbals as well.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.000
So it happens really quickly.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.780
We just make these
evaluations.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.950
How does this process work?

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:20.530
So there are two ways
we evaluate people

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:21.750
based on their costume.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.800
One is a controlled,
deliberate,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.150
and effortful process.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:28.780
And we use it less frequently.

00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.120
And I'm going to show you why.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.270
Show of hands, how many people
have seen "Men in Black"?

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.200
For those of you who haven't,
in this scene that I'm going

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.520
to show you, Will Smith plays
a New York cop who doesn't

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.470
always play by the rules.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.790
He's really good, but
he's fast and loose.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:49.430
And he was invited to apply for
a job that was an elite

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.710
job, but he had no
idea what it was.

00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:54.030
And he took all these paper and
pencil tests in the room

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.380
with people, high-ranking
generals from the military.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.910
And all of that group that are
in the room applying for this

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:04.350
job and filling out forms are
now invited into a room where

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:05.910
they're going to
be given a gun.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:09.572
And they're going to be asked
to shoot fake people, the

00:33:09.572 --> 00:33:11.850
little cardboard kinds
of things.

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.540
So let's watch this.

00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.037
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:14.037 --> 00:33:14.534
[SIREN]

[BUZZER]

00:33:16.025 --> 00:33:17.516
[BUZZER]

00:33:17.516 --> 00:33:35.410
[GUNSHOTS]

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:38.490
-Edwards, what the
hell happened?

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:39.740
-Hesitated.

00:33:41.785 --> 00:33:46.080
-May I ask why you felt little
Tiffany deserved to die?

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:47.840
-Well, she was only one that
actually seemed dangerous at

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.450
the time, sir.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.360
-How'd you come to
that conclusion?

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.370
-Well, first I was going to pop
this guy hanging from the

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:53.000
streetlight.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.990
And then I realized, you know,
he was just working out.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:56.470
I mean, how would I feel if
somebody come running into the

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:59.030
gym, bust me in my ass while
I'm on the treadmill?

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.570
Then I saw this snarling
beast guy.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.300
And I noticed he had a
tissue in his hand.

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.810
And I realized, you know, he's
not snarling, he's sneezing.

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:08.330
You know, ain't not
real threat there.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:09.670
Then I saw a little Tiffany.

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.900
I'm thinking, you know,
eight-year-old white girl,

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.230
middle of the ghetto, bunch of
monsters, this time a night

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.770
with quantum physics books.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.520
She about to start
some shit, Zed.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.389
She's about eight years old.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.889
Those books are way too
advanced for her.

00:34:20.889 --> 00:34:23.205
If you ask me, I say she's
up to something.

00:34:23.205 --> 00:34:25.340
And to be honest, I'd appreciate
it if you'd ease up

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:26.881
off my back about it.

00:34:26.881 --> 00:34:28.369
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:34.510
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Why don't
we do this all the time?

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:37.340
It takes way too much effort
to sustain this.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:42.540
We actually cannot do what Will
Smith did all the time.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:44.710
Or if we did, we wouldn't be
able to function and do

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.460
anything else.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.139
The cognitive load is so high.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:54.469
We can do it sometimes
when we try, when it

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.710
counts, like he did.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:59.210
But it's just not possible
to sustain.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:00.890
So what do we do?

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:04.650
Instead, we use what's called
automatic processing.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:08.640
And we take minimal information
and we classify

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:11.530
people according to the traits
that we infer about them.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:14.320
So like the woman in the plaid
skirt, we're going to just see

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:20.080
plaid skirt, weird shirt,
pigeon-toed, and then whatever

00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:23.460
you think-- stripper, ironic,
whatever your own personal

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.530
tastes are.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:29.890
So we do this, again, through
social categorization, the

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:31.290
"us" versus "them" thing.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.760
So we look at what
they're wearing.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.460
And we say, oh, that's
like us.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.840
That's like them, you know,
which them, which us.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.410
And then when we
just assume it.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.020
So there's a cognitive bias
that we know about in

00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:46.120
psychology called the Halo
Effect, which is if an

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.610
individual has an important
attribute in one situation or

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:52.850
context, we infer that this
individual has additional

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:53.880
related attributes.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.630
So villain or hero?

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.810
AUDIENCE: Hero.

00:35:58.810 --> 00:35:59.260
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Hero.

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:01.804
OK, why?

00:36:01.804 --> 00:36:03.160
AUDIENCE: The hair.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.430
ROBIN ROSENBERG: The hair?

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:07.020
No, it's the Superman
little twisty thing.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:07.610
No, that's true.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:07.890
AUDIENCE: Square--

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:08.306
ROBIN ROSENBERG: What?

00:36:08.306 --> 00:36:09.140
AUDIENCE: Square jaw.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.240
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Square
jaw, yep.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:10.580
OK.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.490
Cleft chin, right?

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:13.390
Any other thoughts?

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:14.080
AUDIENCE: Smiling.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.880
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Smiling, OK.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.740
AUDIENCE: Nice cape.

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:19.232
ROBIN ROSENBERG:
Nice cape, OK.

00:36:19.232 --> 00:36:20.570
AUDIENCE: Common pose, too.

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.020
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Common
pose, OK.

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.230
So all of this happened
instantly, before I even asked

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.270
you a question about it.

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:30.330
Once you saw it, you made all
of these assumptions.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:34.380
So you looked at the cleft chin,
and you inferred other

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:35.800
qualities about it.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.360
So in real life, we have
examples of this

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.490
in our daily life.

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.310
These are well-founded,
well-researched things.

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:45.860
So we think that good-looking
people are kinder,

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:50.470
which is not true.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.730
I mean, a given person may or
may not be, but in general,

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:55.830
good looking people
aren't kinder.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.450
And that we think
well-groomed job

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.700
applicants are more competent.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.610
But, again, we are making all
these assumptions because it

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:10.000
helps us get by with less
cognitive effort.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.140
OK, so there's a flip side of
this called the Devil Effect

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.820
or the Horn Effect.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:18.020
And if someone has undesirable
attributes, then we infer that

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:21.250
the person has additional
related negative attributes.

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.142
So hero or villain?

00:37:23.142 --> 00:37:24.440
AUDIENCE: Villain.

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:24.930
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Villain.

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:26.296
Why?

00:37:26.296 --> 00:37:28.250
AUDIENCE: Dark colors.

00:37:28.250 --> 00:37:28.710
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Say?

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:29.860
AUDIENCE: Dark colors.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:30.740
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Dark colors.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.731
OK.

00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:33.570
AUDIENCE: Scowling.

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:35.610
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Scowling,
frown, yep.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.180
AUDIENCE: Small head compared
to the body.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.772
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Small
head, right.

00:37:40.772 --> 00:37:42.680
AUDIENCE: He's looking
down at us.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.170
ROBIN ROSENBERG: He's
looking down at us.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.070
Cool, OK.

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:46.450
AUDIENCE: His arms
are crossed.

00:37:46.450 --> 00:37:47.460
ROBIN ROSENBERG: His
arms are crossed.

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:48.060
OK.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:48.600
Cool.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:53.470
Now, ironically, this stance is
very close to the Superman

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:56.190
stance, which is legs spread.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.680
Its hands on hips.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.710
We have seen Superman
in this pose.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.320
So it's not simply the pose.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.470
But you see how all of a sudden,
you saw this and you

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:08.350
instantly made a decision,
villain.

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.850
The metallic part
probably helped.

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:11.840
I assume it's metallic.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.250
I'm not sure, but it's
shiny like metal.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:19.540
And so we made all of
these attributes.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.790
So I'm going to tell
you about a study--

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:24.530
people are already laughing.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.210
So there was a study
that was done.

00:38:27.210 --> 00:38:30.230
And you, as a participant, were
brought into the lab.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.530
And you were shown photographs
of people.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.850
Some of them were wearing
a plain T-shirt.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:36.370
And some of them were
wearing what I'd

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:37.325
call an alcohol T-shirt.

00:38:37.325 --> 00:38:40.400
It had Jack Daniels or
something on it.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:47.220
In the photograph in the lab,
I had the same person.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.770
Sometimes it was plain.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.410
And I had photographs
of it being plain.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:52.270
And I had photographs
of it being alcohol.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.970
So the people are the same.

00:38:55.970 --> 00:39:00.050
It's just we both conditions,
if you will.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:03.130
You were asked to rate people,
just like tell us what you

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:04.220
think about this person.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.520
And some of those people wearing
a plain T-shirt and

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.690
some of them were wearing
an alcohol T-shirt.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:14.010
Nothing else was different
except the alcohol words.

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:18.180
So what the participants said
is that the people in the

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.770
photographs who were
wearing an alcohol

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:21.470
T-shirt were rated as--

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:22.920
long list--

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.050
less honest, less independent,
less responsible, less

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:28.820
reliable, less religious, less
likely to be on time, less

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.050
likely to do well in school.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.940
They were more likely to smoke,
to be a party animal,

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:35.990
drink or swear, and
be risk-taker.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:43.500
All of this inferred
from alcohol words.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.520
I think it's probably true.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.450
I mean, I know I should know
better, but I would make the

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:49.350
same assumptions.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:51.990
But we don't know where the
person got the T-shirt.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.950
It was a gift, it was--

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:56.080
I mean, It's just interesting
how all of this

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:59.530
negative stuff came out.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.700
So social categorization
reduces the

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:03.840
effort we have to expend.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:06.900
We don't have to think if the
guy in the cape was a bad guy.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.940
We just immediately make
these assumptions.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:13.360
But it makes us more likely
to make biased judgments.

00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:17.280
So people categorize us
based on how we dress.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.680
And then they treat
us accordingly.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.920
My mother was right.

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:25.080
Now the interesting thing is
that the way they treat us can

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.550
elicit certain behaviors
from us.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.870
And my mother didn't quite
tell me this part.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:33.000
Although I think she have
intuited because she's a good

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:33.950
lay psychologist.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:35.150
There was a study done.

00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:37.490
There was another study.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:39.110
You're brought into the lab.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:42.180
You are a woman.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.520
And you're told you're going
to have a telephone

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:48.690
conversation with another
participant in the study.

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:50.940
And so you go into this
cubicle, and you'll

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.360
speak to him there.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.250
And whatever they told me,
to talk about whatever.

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:58.960
If you are a guy and you came
into the lab, you were shown a

00:40:58.960 --> 00:40:59.770
photograph.

00:40:59.770 --> 00:41:03.750
And you were told this is the
woman you're going to talk to.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.210
Come into this cubicle.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:08.080
Now it turns out, half the guys
were shown a photograph

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.840
of an attractive woman.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.870
And half the guys were shown
a photograph of an

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:12.800
unattractive woman.

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.530
And these were objectively
rated beforehand.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:17.000
People rated the photographs
of who is

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.750
attractive and who wasn't.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:21.300
These photographs had nothing to
do with the actual woman in

00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.980
the cubicle waiting to
talk to the guy.

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:28.240
So just again to reiterate the
set-up, they're told they're

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.260
going to talk to a woman who's
either attractive or

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.650
unattractive.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.930
So that's the panel
on the left.

00:41:33.930 --> 00:41:36.850
In the middle panel, they
have their conversation.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.430
They're separately
tape-recorded.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:40.450
They leave the lab.

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:42.160
They're done.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:46.800
In the lab, a rater who works
for the professor is listening

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:50.050
to the women's part of the
conversation only.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:53.500
And they are rating her tone
of voice for warmth and

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.420
friendliness.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.440
That's their job.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.520
And then they rate them.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.490
And then they look back and see
did the guys think that

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:05.240
these were attractive women
or unattractive women.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:09.740
And it turns out that the women
who were rated as warm

00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:14.130
and friendly were the women
where the guy thought that she

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.830
was going to be attractive.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:19.510
So what happened is the guy
thinks, I'm going to talk to

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:21.990
someone who's attractive.

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:27.360
And he somehow interacts with
her in a way that elicits this

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.700
warmth and friendliness
from her.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.240
And he didn't even see her.

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.140
It was just on the
phone, something

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.000
in his tone of voice--

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.600
they, it was a lot of guys,
it wasn't just one guy.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:43.080
Something elicited from her
behavior that made her conform

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:45.110
to how he assumed she was.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:53.070
It becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy where the way you

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.930
dress causes people to treat
you accordingly.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:59.990
And how they treat you, then,
elicits that behavior from

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:01.090
you, whether you
want to or not.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:02.130
It's all unconscious.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:06.410
This happens like in the
ether between people.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:07.610
It elicits the behavior.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:09.480
And it becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:12.760
So people will make inferences
about you based on your

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:13.800
appearance.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:16.300
And most of the time, they
will not be Will Smith.

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:18.340
They will not make that
extra effort and go

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.480
beyond a snap judgment.

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.020
So their judgments affect their
behavior, which affects

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.420
your behavior and thoughts
and feelings without your

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.050
knowing about it.

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:30.080
And it becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy.

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.980
So what costume do
you want to wear?

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.550
You should ask yourself what
part of yourself do you want

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.160
to hide or express?

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:39.100
What role do you want to play?

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.730
What snap judgments do you want
other people to make of

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.360
you because they will?

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.830
Are you willing to have
these become a

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:48.030
self-fulfilling prophecy?

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:49.500
And I think we don't--

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.510
I have time for questions,
so I'll just

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:52.990
skip over this lesson.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:57.219
Questions, thoughts, ideas?

00:43:57.219 --> 00:43:57.712
Yeah?

00:43:57.712 --> 00:44:02.149
AUDIENCE: So I actually have
a question and a comment.

00:44:02.149 --> 00:44:05.107
So I'll start with the
comment about the

00:44:05.107 --> 00:44:06.340
experiment with the shirts.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:06.630
ROBIN ROSENBERG: OK.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:07.260
One second.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:09.180
Is there a mic they're
supposed to go to?

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:13.200
Oh, I'm sorry, if you have a
question, just go to a mic.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.450
Sorry, I forgot about that.

00:44:20.278 --> 00:44:23.150
AUDIENCE: So the comment is
about the experiment with the

00:44:23.150 --> 00:44:25.930
shirts with the Jack Daniels.

00:44:25.930 --> 00:44:27.970
So as you were describing
that, I was thinking to

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.400
myself, well, OK, but what--

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.120
I'll just speak for myself,
but I think

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:33.460
this is fairly typical.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:37.000
What happens is a lot of times
with things like that is

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.700
there's a thing that goes on in
your mind where you say--

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.590
not particularly about the Jack
Daniels shirt, that's

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:42.550
fairly innocuous--

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:46.130
but somebody wears a particular
shirt and so

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:49.180
immediately the place you go
to is, well, you made a

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:51.380
conscious choice to wear
that shirt, right?

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:55.630
So the wearer is trying to
transmit something about

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:56.250
themselves.

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.710
Whether that's right or wrong,
it doesn't matter.

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:01.740
But that's sort of what goes
on in your head as the

00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:04.220
observer is, well, you chose
to wear that shirt.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.470
You're trying to send out
some kind of signal.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.240
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Right.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.140
AUDIENCE: Which could
be totally wrong.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.600
The other thing is
about superheros.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.810
So I'm the father of two boys
who are both adults now.

00:45:14.810 --> 00:45:18.910
But the one thing that struck
me-- and I know, I watched, I

00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:20.520
read comic books when
I was a kid.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:23.340
And I'm old enough that I
remember the George Reeves

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.990
Superman, although
it was in reruns.

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:29.030
I'm not quite that old.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:32.080
But one thing that struck me
with both of my sons was how

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:38.180
early the hook sank
about superheroes.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:41.140
I mean, I can remember my older
son being like 18 months

00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:45.080
old, taking his baby blanket
and asking us to wrap it

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.780
around his neck as a cape.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.010
In fact, at this point, I wish
they'd wean themselves from

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:56.220
that stuff, but maybe
by 40 they will.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:56.780
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Or not.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.310
AUDIENCE: But yeah, maybe not.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:02.270
But one thing that struck
me was there's got to be

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:04.340
something deeper going
on there, right?

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:09.365
There's something in their
very, very young minds.

00:46:09.365 --> 00:46:09.630
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Primal.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:12.040
AUDIENCE: There's something
that's resonating in terms of

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.980
what they desire to be.

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.300
Or I'm not sure exactly what
it is, but that the

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.800
hook sinks so early.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.380
I mean, obviously there's
a lot more.

00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:22.730
If all your friends are
surrounding you and they're

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:26.910
all carrying Spiderman lunch
boxes, and there's a lot more

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:28.760
of that stuff, certainly,
than when I was younger.

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:31.040
But I'm wondering if there's
something deeper than that,

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:33.500
that's it's not just media
pressure, that there's some

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.160
hook that sets in very early.

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.340
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Absolutely.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.870
And actually the book that's
not on sale there, "Our

00:46:39.870 --> 00:46:41.290
Superheroes, Ourselves"
addresses

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:42.060
some of this question.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.610
It's essays by psychologists
talking about our relationship

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:47.770
with superheroes and the ways in
which we're similar to and

00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:50.160
different from superheroes.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.230
So before there were
superheros, it

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.590
was cowboys and Indians.

00:46:55.590 --> 00:46:58.740
It was probably Sampson
versus Delilah.

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:02.550
I mean, throughout history
kids play.

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:07.810
And they play about characters
that they know, Bible figures.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:10.380
If they're exposed to
superheroes, it's superheroes.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:14.600
Kids really want moral clarity
about right and wrong.

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.690
And I think part of what
superhero stories offer, aside

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:22.140
from the violent part, is the
kid superhero stories offer

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.650
moral clarity.

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:26.610
And they also show that
sometimes doing the right

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.550
thing is hard, which is a lesson
that we actually want

00:47:29.550 --> 00:47:31.020
adults to remember.

00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:34.270
So being a whistle-blower is
a great example that's a

00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:37.260
superhero tale without
the power.

00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:40.780
So kids are just gravitated
toward moral

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.370
clarity and also power.

00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:46.440
I mean, kids are unbelievably
powerless in the world.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.780
They have so little control
over anything.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:53.930
And the idea of being this
superhero and having all of

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:55.450
these powers and being
able to do all

00:47:55.450 --> 00:47:57.350
these things is amazing.

00:47:57.350 --> 00:47:59.880
And then the other piece, just
to address that, is the kids

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:04.640
are easily self-hypnotizable.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.100
In the Western world, most
of us lose our ability to

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:10.090
hypnotize ourselves.

00:48:10.090 --> 00:48:11.670
But kids are amazing at it.

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:12.990
That's their fantasy play.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.280
They are there.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:17.920
And so superhero stories, when
they imagine them, it is

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:20.680
incredibly vivid as
if it's real.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.360
And so when they put on a cape
and imagine themselves flying,

00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.910
they are self-hypnotized.

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:29.140
I mean, they're not going
to jump out a window or

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:29.880
anything like that.

00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:32.310
Or, unfortunately, occasionally
that happens if

00:48:32.310 --> 00:48:34.750
there aren't screens
on the window.

00:48:34.750 --> 00:48:37.840
But it's very vivid and powerful
for them in a way

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.470
that dream life can be this
amazing release and experience

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.480
that when they imagine being
a superhero, it taps into

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.970
something very primal.

00:48:45.970 --> 00:48:48.530
Before it was superheroes,
it was something else.

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:51.820
But I think that
urge is there.

00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:53.026
Yeah?

00:48:53.026 --> 00:48:54.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.900
So you talked about the
inferences that we

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:01.330
automatically make based
on the visual

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:05.190
cues that we observe.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:10.140
And I understand that as an
empirical observation.

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:13.820
You also give the advice that,
be careful what you wear.

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:15.500
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Yes.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.700
AUDIENCE: I felt like that was
a little insufficient if you

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:21.530
don't talk about the
conditioning that is done on

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:26.410
society and why those inferences
are actually made.

00:49:26.410 --> 00:49:33.490
Because there's nothing about
looking at a character from

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:38.850
below or looking at a character
from above that is

00:49:38.850 --> 00:49:45.040
any correlation to good or bad,
negative or positive.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.400
So I was hoping you could
talk a little bit about

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:48.800
re-conditioning.

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:49.560
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Sure.

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:50.050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.490
ROBIN ROSENBERG: So all
of us have our own

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:54.660
unique learning history.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.030
Some of it is shared.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:59.020
If we watch the same films and
movies and TVs, or read the

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:02.880
same books, and are exposed to
things, then part of our

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.190
learning history is shared.

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.870
And part of it is unique to our
family and our community.

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.540
And then our own personal,
unique

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:10.190
history that no one shares.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:17.360
And all of those go into the
assumptions and inferences

00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.060
that you make about people.

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:23.760
So for instance, I have two
sons who work at Google.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.660
So I feel like I can say this.

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:30.270
So if you grow up in a
family where people

00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:34.260
don't iron their shirts.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:38.560
Your kids will have certain
assumptions that are going to

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:41.680
be different about people who
wear non-ironed shirts, who

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.490
wear rumpled shirts, than
someone who grows up in a

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:47.430
family where the underwear
was ironed.

00:50:47.430 --> 00:50:51.520
And so that will influence what
you think when you see

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:54.140
someone in a rumpled shirt.

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:58.160
You can absolutely overwrite
what you've

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.170
learned with new learning.

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:03.630
And so if instead of working
at Google, you now end up

00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:07.060
working on Wall Street, and you
are told in no uncertain

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:09.700
terms that you need to have
a suit and tie every day.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.240
And it needs to be really
expensive suit.

00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:14.080
And you should definitely
have ironed shirts.

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.940
You will have new learning.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:20.390
And you will learn whatever the
culture there wants you to

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:24.360
learn about ironed shirts,
about what it means.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:28.810
So humans are great learners,
some of the time.

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:31.790
And so in this context, you
would learn new things.

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:36.730
If a film came out that shot
the superhero the other way

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:40.830
around and the villain from
above, and that was the new

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:44.690
point-of-view style, then we
would just unlearn that.

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:46.990
This new learning would
overwrite the old learning.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.980
Did that answer your question?

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.280
AUDIENCE: That wasn't
my question.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.040
ROBIN ROSENBERG: No, did that
answer your question?

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:56.614
ROBIN ROSENBERG:
OK, not really?

00:51:56.614 --> 00:52:02.870
AUDIENCE: So I totally
understand the conditioning of

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.120
inferences.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:09.540
But what I was getting at
is I think they are very

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.240
subjective.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:20.270
And they sometimes result in
undesirable effects against

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:20.960
other people.

00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:27.851
So I think there has to be an
effort to recondition those

00:52:27.851 --> 00:52:29.800
factors that cause
the inferences so

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.200
that they, I guess--

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.880
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Ah, OK.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:35.080
Right.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.160
So the effort to recondition
more accurately.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.800
The problem is it's like
the Will Smith dilemma.

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.100
We can't do that all the time.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:46.360
We just can't function in the
world and simultaneously be

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:48.650
reconditioning ourselves and
checking whether the

00:52:48.650 --> 00:52:51.320
assumptions we're making about
people, is that true.

00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:54.450
We can do it some of the
time, when it counts.

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:56.100
When we care, we can do it.

00:52:56.100 --> 00:52:58.720
When I'm meeting someone for the
first time and I know if

00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:02.090
I'm looking, and I say, oh,
this person is X, Y, and Z

00:53:02.090 --> 00:53:03.760
based on how they look.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:07.830
I can take the time to get
to know that person.

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:10.190
I can make a decision to take
the time to get to know the

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:13.660
person to see, are my hypotheses
about them correct?

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:15.120
But we can't do that
all the time.

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:18.290
It's just a huge amount
of effort.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.570
Yeah?

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:22.920
AUDIENCE: Question about your
specific choice of hero

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:27.190
exemplar for lesson two,
specifically Batman as an

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:30.410
example of someone who is
psychologically well adjusted

00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:32.050
to psychological shock.

00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:34.310
ROBIN ROSENBERG: OK.

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:36.140
Let's put down the
gauntlets here.

00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.040
OK, go ahead.

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.210
AUDIENCE: I think especially in
the post-Alan Moore, post

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:46.280
'80s comic hero era, we have
started looking at superheroes

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:47.380
who are simply not

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.760
psychologically well put together.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:53.890
And Batman, the vigilante who
has serious issues in current

00:53:53.890 --> 00:53:58.245
generation post-rebirth
DC comics, why?

00:53:58.245 --> 00:53:58.970
There are--

00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:59.170
ROBIN ROSENBERG: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:01.650
AUDIENCE: --any number of people
who are better put--

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:04.480
even Cyclops as fewer issues
than Batman who is

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:06.360
fundamentally a broken person.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:08.930
ROBIN ROSENBERG: OK, so I
don't agree with you.

00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:14.376
I wrote a book called "Whats
the Matter with Batman?"

00:54:14.376 --> 00:54:17.000
AUDIENCE: I will
be buying that.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:17.980
ROBIN ROSENBERG: I will
send you a copy.

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:20.210
Come afterwards.

00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:24.130
And I kind of go through the
likely diagnoses for him.

00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:29.210
And part of where I come out is
that everyone has issues.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:32.600
You cannot live in this world
and not have issues.

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.080
His issues are obvious,
granted.

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.796
But I don't think that he's
really screwed up.

00:54:38.796 --> 00:54:43.680
I think that this is a man who
is a serious guy, perhaps by

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.010
temperament, we don't know.

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:47.390
I mean, it's hard to say what
he was like before.

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:49.930
I mean, I think "Batman
Begins" film is really

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:51.470
interesting in how it portrayed

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:53.570
him how he was before.

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:55.050
And that's really an
interesting take.

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:57.330
But he's a serious guy.

00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:00.220
I don't think being serious
means your screwed up.

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:01.420
It just means you're serious.

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.990
He has issues with
relationships.

00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:05.090
Who doesn't?

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:09.740
I mean, put aside the 50%
divorce rate, how many

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:12.050
relationships don't work?

00:55:12.050 --> 00:55:15.670
I mean most intimate
relationships we have in life

00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:17.050
don't work out.

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:19.310
I'm not going to say he's
screwed up for that reason.

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:21.500
Then all of us would
be screwed up.

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.980
If you go down the list
of the ways--

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:27.440
he's serious, and he's
a dedicated guy.

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:32.130
It's like to say that Navy SEALs
would be screwed up, or

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:35.100
thoracic surgeons who spend--I
don't know--

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:39.830
20 years in training and are on
call all the time and often

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:42.820
have difficult marriages and
lives because they're on call

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:44.300
all the time and it's
incredibly--

00:55:44.300 --> 00:55:46.430
you have to have a certain
personality to get to be a

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:50.200
thoracic surgeon, to get
to the end stage.

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.490
It's sort of an occupational
hazard.

00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:55.020
Being a cop changes people.

00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:58.090
Any discipline, any
occupation changes

00:55:58.090 --> 00:55:59.520
people in certain ways.

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.720
So I would take issue
with you about that.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:03.120
And I was intentional.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:03.760
AUDIENCE: I appreciate that.

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.850
ROBIN ROSENBERG: OK.

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:06.630
But give me your address.

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:08.570
I'll send you a copy
of the book.

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:11.740
Any other questions?

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.370
No more people want
to take on Batman?

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:13.960
I'm ready.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:15.970
I'm prepared.

00:56:15.970 --> 00:56:17.250
Anything else?

00:56:17.250 --> 00:56:20.337
Oh, yeah?

00:56:20.337 --> 00:56:21.220
AUDIENCE: It's sort of a

00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:24.180
follow-up to the last question.

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.840
Then where did the dark
age come from?

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:28.770
I mean we had in the '30s and
the '40s, we had the golden

00:56:28.770 --> 00:56:32.350
age, which was these really
naive characters, and the '50s

00:56:32.350 --> 00:56:33.560
in the '60s.

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:36.490
In the '60s and '70s, they got
a little more serious.

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:41.510
And then with "Watchmen" and
"The Dark Knight Returns," all

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:47.920
of a sudden, they were all, if
not broken, then a whole lot

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:51.710
less pure and a whole lot
harder to root for.

00:56:51.710 --> 00:56:54.800
Some of that, I think, just came
from the changes in how

00:56:54.800 --> 00:56:57.410
comic books got sold
in the 1980s.

00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:01.300
But that was a long time ago.

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.100
And we had a dark Superman
movie this

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.685
year, or so I've told.

00:57:05.685 --> 00:57:09.580
Where does the attraction with
dark superheroes come from?

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.720
I mean, light superheros,
I understand.

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:15.650
Have we grown up?

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:17.170
ROBIN ROSENBERG: I actually
think part of it is that we

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:18.290
have grown up.

00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:21.800
So those of us who read comics
as kids, or Saturday morning

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.530
cartoons, we grew up.

00:57:23.530 --> 00:57:26.800
And those simple moral tales
that appealed to us as kids do

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:28.490
not appeal to us now.

00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:30.610
They were simplistic.

00:57:30.610 --> 00:57:36.220
And they are not consistent with
our nuanced experience of

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:41.130
the world where morality is
often relative and it depends

00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:42.690
on context.

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:48.840
And so I think that Alan Moore
unleashed the pent-up desire

00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:51.470
for more sophisticated
stories.

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:55.450
And then I think with that, we
started wondering, so what

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.940
would it be like to
be a superhero?

00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:59.930
What would it be like
to be Batman?

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:04.070
Or Superman is actually a harder
one, but what would it

00:58:04.070 --> 00:58:07.250
be to live day in, day
out as a superhero?

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.600
And we want to see
our characters

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:11.350
suffer a little bit.

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:16.190
So if it gets darker, it's
because they get real.

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:17.700
AUDIENCE: But why did our
generation change?

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:21.380
Because my mom bought "Action"
number one and regretted the

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:23.540
rest of her life
not keeping it.

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:26.650
So she grew up on the really
simplistic superheros.

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:28.890
And then she grew up.

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:32.930
Did she just ignore all the
comic book superheroes?

00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:38.430
Or did something happen with
this generation that wanted

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:40.530
darker superheros that didn't
happen with the previous

00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:45.370
generation that was happy to
have the more pure ones?

00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:46.960
ROBIN ROSENBERG: I think
two things happened.

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.620
One is realism in general.

00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:53.170
Psychological realism was
just in all other

00:58:53.170 --> 00:58:54.645
genres, so why no.

00:58:54.645 --> 00:58:56.340
I mean, even in spaghetti

00:58:56.340 --> 00:58:58.590
Westerns, it started happening.

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:01.610
Clint Eastwood became
a three-dimensional

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:03.530
character in his films.

00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:07.470
So I think it was in the
zeitgeist at the time.

00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:16.350
And I also think that for your
mom, maybe you went with your

00:59:16.350 --> 00:59:21.900
mom to see the first Chris
Reeves' "Superman" film?

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.570
Maybe it was a family
affair, maybe not.

00:59:24.570 --> 00:59:26.387
AUDIENCE: She watched "Star
Trek" with me, which fits me a

00:59:26.387 --> 00:59:26.560
little bit better.

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:28.100
ROBIN ROSENBERG: OK, she
watched "Star Trek."

00:59:28.100 --> 00:59:29.140
AUDIENCE: Almost superheroes.

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:29.460
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Right.

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:32.410
But I think we also delayed
having kids.

00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:34.570
And so we were happy to have

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:38.040
adult-oriented superhero stories.

00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.990
Where when people had
kids sooner, it

00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:43.070
was a family affair.

00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:44.740
Reading comics together,
talking about and

00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:45.860
watching the TV shows.

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:50.400
And so I think it was a more
private experience.

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.550
And that's what was offered.

00:59:51.550 --> 00:59:53.910
And honestly, I think we
just all became more

00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:56.425
psychologically sophisticated
and wanted our

00:59:56.425 --> 00:59:57.613
heroes to be, too.

00:59:57.613 --> 00:59:58.570
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:59:58.570 --> 00:59:59.820
ROBIN ROSENBERG: A great
question, though.

00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:00.795
And any other questions?

01:00:00.795 --> 01:00:01.060
Yes?

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:03.486
AUDIENCE: Isn't it the case of
the early Batman was a lot

01:00:03.486 --> 01:00:04.370
more violent than later?

01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:07.410
And it certainly was the case
the comics in the early '50s

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:08.990
were a lot more violent
than they were

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:10.260
before the comic code.

01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.060
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Yes.

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.330
AUDIENCE: And before the
"Watchmen," there was Frank

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:17.140
Miller turning daredevil into
somebody who drops somebody to

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:18.600
break all the bones
in his body.

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.430
I mean, it didn't happen
immediately.

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:22.480
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Right.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.840
Every decade is a little
bit different.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:28.750
And there's a history, the
pendulum swings to and from.

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:32.060
And the original Batman
was really dark.

01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.620
And so many people view the
Christopher Nolan films as a

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:38.400
return to his roots.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.580
It was very dark for its time.

01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:43.570
So, right, it depends
on which era.

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:46.380
Michael Uslan, who was the
executive producer of all of

01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:52.050
the recent Batman films since
1989 and has thought deeply

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:56.050
about Batman says that-- he
extends it beyond Batman--

01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:59.670
but whenever you were first
exposed to a superhero,

01:00:59.670 --> 01:01:02.760
whatever version that was it
its moment in time, that's

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.660
your template of the
real superhero.

01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.790
And everything else is sort
of a deviation from that.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:10.430
It's like an imprinting.

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:13.330
And I think there is
something to that.

01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:13.720
Yeah.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:17.930
Any other questions?

01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:18.510
OK.

01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:18.960
Thanks.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:19.540
Great questions.

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:19.840
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.090
ROBIN ROSENBERG: Thank you.
