Suppose you make $7.95 an hour and
you work for 8.5 hours.

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:09.372
We calculate the total amount you
make by multiplying these two numbers

00:00:09.372 --> 00:00:10.260
together.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.903
So what is 7.95 x 8.5?

00:00:12.903 --> 00:00:14.691
Enter your answer here.

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:24.691
