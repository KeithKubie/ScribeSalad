NOW TIME FOR MY NECK, MY BACK,
MY BUSEY, AND MY CRACK.

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:20.387
GARY BUSEY, SEEN HERE THINKING
ABOUT A BUG IN HIS MOUTH, IS

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.157
LIKE THAT BIG OLD DOG THAT KEEPS
KNOCKING STUFF OFF YOUR COFFEE

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:25.826
TABLE WITH HIS TAIL BUT HE'S
JUST SO LOVABLE THAT YOU CAN'T

BRING YOURSELF TO HAVE HIM PUT
HIM DOWN.

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:33.667
GARY'S HAD A ROUGH TIME, AND BY

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.502
DURING RECENT BANKRUPTCY
HEARINGS, WE DISCOVERED THAT

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:36.737
GARY ISN'T THE SHREWD INVESTOR

&gt;&gt; A LARGE HOAGIE.

00:00:56.723 --> 00:01:01.061
I SAW HIM COME OUT OF THE WOODS
WHEN I WAS HIKING IN THE MALIBU

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:04.765
WITH AN ITALIAN SUBWAY SUB.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:05.165

00:01:21.949 --> 00:01:25.886
&gt;&gt; A LEGAL PAD WITH ALTERNATE
SPELLINGS OF BUSEY.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.888
&gt;&gt; THIS OLD BANDAID. HE CHEWED
ON IT FOR A WHILE, BUT IT'S

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:28.789
STILL GOOD.

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:33.327
Chris: BAMFORD.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.464
A CERAMIC DOG BANK FROM COLOR ME
MINE, HE DOESN'T PUT MONEY IN HE

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.498
JUST WHISPERS WISHES IN IT.

00:01:38.532 --> 00:01:42.703
[LAUGHING]

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:43.403
