1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,970
My wife and kids are quick to anger.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,210
Sometimes it's explosive like
the Moab mother of all bombs.

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,850
Other times it's a slow
grinding war of attrition.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,470
Being a student of your podcasts,

5
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:16,560
I've learned the worst strategy is to
directly attack there four to fight

6
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,760
emotional position.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,840
It seems like this is a good opportunity
to employ the flanking maneuver.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,390
How do I effectively flank their
anger without appearing weak?

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,720
Okay, first of all, flank yourself
cause that appearing weak thing.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,520
That's pretty much in your head really.

11
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,890
It is slow generally in your head and
that's the first thing you need to do is

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,240
that's your ego talking when you
don't want to, when you don't want to,

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,380
when they hit you with
something that they're angry at,

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,560
the thing that's hitting back his ego,
that's what's hitting back.

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,390
So first thing you gotta do is,
okay,

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,020
I'm going to check my ego right now cause
I'm going to win the long war. In fact,

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,120
you have to be careful when you stay calm,
when everyone else is angry.

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,540
You have to actually be careful not
to come across as aloof or you know,

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,800
arrogant. Yeah, yeah. Like when people
are getting mad. Okay. Okay. For instance,

20
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:11,580
if your wife is super mad about something
and you show no emotions and you don't

21
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:14,200
get mad at all, they get
matter sometimes, right? Yeah.

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,480
You don't even care about this,
you know, so no, no. So you got up,

23
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,950
you got to give a little bit.
You know,

24
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:24,750
I'm not saying it a little
bit of hey I get it.

25
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,340
Right, but then which one do is
absorb? Oh they want to get mad. Cool.

26
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,110
Absorb.
Take the screaming,

27
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,290
give the head nod of understanding in
a more only marginally emotional way.

28
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:41,430
That pretty much communicates that.
I understand you're mad and I'm,

29
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,980
I'm listening and I hear you.
You know I get it.

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,970
And let them get it out of their system.
This, let them get an honors system.

31
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,440
Then let them calm down.

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,800
And then after you've given them the
time to kind of calm down and settle down

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,250
and I mean it's a longer than you think.

34
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,580
It's longer than you think. Let them
let, let when you think they're calm,

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,460
wait an extra 45 minutes if not two hours,
probably two hours.

36
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,640
Cause they're not called to be safe.
They just stopped screaming. Right.

37
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:18,330
They're all so,
and then what you do is,

38
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,960
and then what you do is you kind of take
it on yourself. You're going to own it,

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,130
right? And you say something like, Hey,
you know that thing that made you mad.

40
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:27,900
I want to make sure it doesn't
happen again. Right. You don't walk.

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,230
What can I do better to make sure that
you don't get mad about that. Right.

42
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,360
You take,
you take ownership of that.

43
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,580
What do I need to adjust
and what exactly is it that,

44
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:41,100
that I did that frustrated.
What is it that frustrates you?

45
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:44,310
What can I do to stop it? Maybe it wasn't
me. Maybe you're mad at the printer,

46
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,400
but you know, how can we fix that?
Because I don't want you to do.

47
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,320
And then you know,
so you have the,

48
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:52,890
that kind of conversation and you know,

49
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,880
you're going to slide something tactfully
and their tactfully because again,

50
00:02:56,881 --> 00:02:58,920
you're still dealing with like,
you know,

51
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,080
possible flare up scenarios
happening. So you know, but you,

52
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,320
but you say something like that,
you know,

53
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:08,530
we both know that nobody benefits when
people lose their temper. Right? I mean,

54
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:11,950
we gotta be careful, you
know, no one, it's not,

55
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:14,350
it doesn't do us any good when people lose
their temper, we, everyone knows that.

56
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,760
Right?
So you slide those things in there.

57
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:20,761
You're given that kind of like a little
mini lecture indirectly about what's

58
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,530
happening. And then when you
have other conversations,

59
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,590
now we're in just a normal day to day
thing. You drop things about temper,

60
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:28,720
you know, you talk about
temporary being, well, you know,

61
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:31,930
it's a weakness and it's no one
makes good decisions when they have,

62
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:33,040
when they lose their temper,
everything.

63
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,350
So some of the dumbest things I've
ever done was when I logged, you know,

64
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,590
everyone knows that you see,

65
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,930
you start sliding those things in there
that it's bad for your decision making.

66
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:45,640
It's bad for relationships, it's bad for
your health, it's bad for life. And again,

67
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:49,340
you're not directly saying these things.
You're subliminally saying even,

68
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,060
you know, it's man, I
remember one time I lost him.

69
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:55,150
This little dumbest things I ever did
when I lost my temper and I kicked the

70
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:59,860
wall and I broke my toe and I put a hole
in the wall and the landlord came. I,

71
00:03:59,861 --> 00:04:02,110
that's when I,
I hate when I lose my temper.

72
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,770
And you start getting them in the,

73
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,510
even thinking about it over time,
and this is the thing,

74
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:14,290
it's a long war and there's going
to be relapses along the way,

75
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,730
but you got to just hold the line,
keep it steady,

76
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,060
absorb and then f flank gently to get
them to start self recognizing where

77
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:32,800
they're at and what their temper
does. Tone tempers crazy. Yeah.

78
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:37,990
And you see people lose their temper.
It's, it's a total loss of control. Yeah.

79
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,590
It's a total loss control and it's
just doesn't do anybody any good.

80
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,890
And when you see someone that really
loses their temper, you're like,

81
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,940
what is wrong? Come on. Yeah.

82
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,390
And when I was a kid and I used to
lose my temper and at some point I just

83
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,980
realized,
I forget what it was.

84
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,190
I forget what made me think there
was something my dad said to me,

85
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,920
there's something about, you know,
something along those lines of like, yeah,

86
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,880
you lose your temper. It's like a
little baby. Oh, loss of control. Okay.

87
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:10,240
So you, you, when you realized it,
that's because of something your dad,

88
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,210
my dad said to me something along
the lines of like, you know,

89
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,820
I think he was referring
to an athlete or something,

90
00:05:15,821 --> 00:05:19,110
someone that just had no emotions
and how that was impressive. Yeah.

91
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,570
And I was like, hmm, that is
impressive. Massive control one,

92
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,930
nothing is going to make me mad. Yeah.
Doesn't matter what's going on around me.

93
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:33,700
Yeah. Yeah. It is like a baby, you know,
like I said, you know, like babies,

94
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,550
they cry and they whatever,
cause they don't know how to talk.

95
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,410
So if they knew how to talk and control
everything, just be like, Hey, I'm colt.

96
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,840
Or Hey, I'm hungry. But they
didn't know how to talk.

97
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:46,540
So why do adults go crazy
and cry because their babies,

98
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,860
because they don't know
how to talk if they,

99
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:49,850
if they kind of for every little
thing, they're babies. Yeah.

100
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,340
They don't know how to talk. I said,
actually, you know what under, um,

101
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,650
and it depends. That depends how much
controlling in all these little variables,

102
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:58,070
but it's

103
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,710
like the front part of your brain that's
a decision making like the conscious

104
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:04,280
like okay, I'm going to make this
dis this conscious decision, right?

105
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,320
Which is the last part of your
brain to develop that way.

106
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,720
And it's like a conscious
decision making by the front,

107
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,840
the like frontal lobe Cortex,
you know, something like this.

108
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,220
And it happens and it fully
develops around age 25 by the way.

109
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:21,410
So if you're (242) 032-0220 one at all.
And so put simply, it's like, okay,

110
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,130
my actions now how do they
affect the future? You know?
So in one way or another,

111
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:29,540
it's going to be kind of surrounded on
that little premise, small little pro.

112
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,630
So otherwise you're just going on
straight auto mode, however you,

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,820
however you feel that's going to
influence, not totally control,

114
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:39,760
but that's the thing that's going
to influence your behaviors.

115
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:44,330
So Times of stress, your frontal
cortex start to shut down a little bit.

116
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,090
Hunger shut down a little bit.
Uh,

117
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,980
hormonal situations for guys and girls.
Oh, so you lose your temper more.

118
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,400
That's where angry comes from.
Hangry is one of them, you know,

119
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:57,320
and it's like all these
things, loss, empathy,

120
00:06:57,321 --> 00:07:00,900
loss of like all this stuff where your
decisions just aren't that dope. Yeah.

121
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:06,260
And so, and when I say hormonal,
like that's why you get roid rage.

122
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,750
You don't look good. Cause like
guys, if they're on steroids,

123
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,340
that's their hormones are up.
Or girls pms scene.

124
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,870
It's like a real, you know,
premenstrual syndrome. It's like a road.

125
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,290
Their hormones are all still,

126
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,890
I remember one time my wife
started when she was pregnant,

127
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:26,460
she started crying during an 18
and t commercial. Like legit.

128
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:32,210
I was like, oh my gosh, what's wrong
with her? Some of those are kind of sad,

129
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,740
emotional nonetheless there. Why were
you crying during Hawaii? Five O oh man.

130
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,380
I'm telling you. They're trying,
they're trying to make it deep man,

131
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:45,320
that show you're watching him.
Nadise anyway, nonetheless. Um,

132
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,230
it's back to losing your temper and stuff.

133
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,330
It is a week thing. So it's kind of
obvious, especially from the outside,

134
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:56,390
to see that look, this losing your
temper is not cool. And a lot of people,

135
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:58,180
they think it's cool
because it feels good.

136
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,930
It feels good when you're a little kid,

137
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:02,640
you respect it because you see someone
lose their temper, you, you scared.

138
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,610
It's like turning into superman.
Right?

139
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,470
[inaudible] mean he's feared,
but right.

140
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,790
You're not feared by you look stupid.
Yes.

141
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,920
If that's the message to convey to your
kiss. Yeah. Losing your temper. Stupid.

142
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,800
Yeah. And Man, some people there,

143
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,890
you could tell they say that stuff
with a little bit of pride, you know,

144
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:25,160
it's just me and my temporary tempers
going to get me in trouble and they're all

145
00:08:25,161 --> 00:08:28,790
like, yeah, you're not proud.
I'm a dead man. That's like me.

146
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:33,320
That should be the guy I wish I didn't.
That should be, if you say, Hey,

147
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:36,110
I just have a temper, that should
be the equivalent of you saying,

148
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,440
I don't know how to read it should
be that, hey, nothing wrong with it.

149
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,800
You can get past it and
you know, whatever. I'm not
going to judge you for it,

150
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,600
but it's not good.
It's not a good state to be in boot.

151
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,000
Someone who can't control your temper,

152
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,390
just like it's not a good state to be
in as a grown adult to not know how to

153
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:53,030
read no judgment,
but you solve that problem.

154
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,470
That's a B.

155
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,040
If you're having like if your kids have
a temper and they're easy to anger,

156
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,340
it's because chances are I
don't know everybody of course,

157
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:07,710
but chances are they
got it from the parents.

158
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,770
Keep in mind you're one of those parents.
I'm not saying,

159
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,840
I'm not saying that you have a temper,
I'm not saying you don't,

160
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,680
but I am seeing sure kids have a temper.
Your wife as a temporary,

161
00:09:20,681 --> 00:09:22,800
you got it. Really honestly, evaluate.

162
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,730
Do I have a temper and
understand that cause the kids,

163
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:31,200
they're just these little seeds of
beings who are like, hey, how do I act?

164
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:34,650
I don't know how to act all act, how you
know just how I feel. I'm going to cry.

165
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:36,860
This is my default. I'm just going
to cry when something's right.

166
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:39,390
So you're saying that for the parents
have a temper and show that knack,

167
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,280
that way the kids will learn it from them.
You're going to learn it.

168
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:44,380
So there is some theory or something
like genetic though I thought,

169
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,590
well maybe I guess it could.
We don't know if it's genetic or not,

170
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:50,820
but there are some where you know the
father has a bad temper and then the kid

171
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:54,150
has a bad temper. Yeah, temper gene.

172
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:59,160
So what it is is there's the genetic
situation for sure at that you're more apt

173
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,940
to not be able to
control certain parts of,

174
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:05,880
or not not be able to control
but control less. You know,

175
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:10,200
certain parts of your brain or chemistry
is going to make you lean towards

176
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:13,380
certain types of behavior, like impulsive
behavior or something like that.

177
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:17,550
There is that for sure. But
again, man, when you're a kid,

178
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,700
you're just looking for how do I
act? I don't know. I'm growing up.

179
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:21,690
I don't even know how to act.

180
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:24,000
So the first thing you're
going to look at is the people,

181
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:27,780
the Authority figures in front of you,
the parents. If the parents aren't there,

182
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:30,840
who are they looking to? I don't know.
The guy next door, the guy on TV,

183
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:33,870
the guy up the street, the guy in the
music video, whoever. I don't know.

184
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,030
Whoever's doing better than me.
That's it.

185
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,920
So if you're the parent and you're
losing your temper all the time,

186
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,160
kids going to lose their
temper. That's how, what?

187
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:47,750
They're going to learn how
to act. So point there is

188
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:54,070
if you lose your temporary or if
your kids are losing the Internet,

189
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,900
you start with yourself
because you know the crime,

190
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,241
you know,
kind of,

191
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:03,540
there's certain things that's real easy
to see when someone else does it or yeah,

192
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:07,140
most things. But yeah. But it's
really, yeah. You simply don't see,

193
00:11:07,141 --> 00:11:09,270
it sounds like this guy here
that asks this question,

194
00:11:09,271 --> 00:11:13,800
he's saying his wife loses his temper and
that could be where the kid is getting

195
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,000
that, that modeling from. Right,
right. And he's saying he doesn't.

196
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:20,400
Now is there a chance that he
does to private? I guess so.

197
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:22,440
But it sounds like he's pretty
together and he's saying, look,

198
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:27,240
I just need to get them to calm down.
Right. So yeah, in this situation,

199
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:30,750
I'd say it's probably the wife who's
losing her temper and then the kid is

200
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:33,990
imitating or modeling,
and then we have this scenario happening.

201
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,530
So what we need to do is explain to
everyone in the family that it's not good.

202
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:41,100
We're not losing our tempers anymore.
They, yeah. And the reason I say it to is,

203
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,290
again, I, I'm not saying
he does lose his temper,

204
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:47,990
but I am saying that it is a possibility
that because if let's say mean,

205
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:52,880
and your husband and wife and I
bought were just bruised. Yeah.

206
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,680
Well we're worried, you know, it's life.

207
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,630
Me and my wife. Okay. If she
loses the temper, her temper,

208
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,330
and I'm taking the direct
approach, right? Yeah.

209
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,110
Which I understand you're now temper more
all, I'm going to lose my temper back.

210
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,840
I'm going to go fire. I'm going to fight
fire with fire. You raise your voice.

211
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:16,780
I'm gonna raise my voice. The kids over
there in the corner. How do I act? Oh,

212
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,910
that's how I act right there.
That's a possibility.

213
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,380
And kids will become antisocial.
That's the thing goes on.

214
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,860
It's one of the things,
one of the many things anti social,

215
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,700
I told you about that book called
Mind Games. Small little book.

216
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,810
I forget the author like pretty clearly
and concisely laid out if you have anger

217
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:40,960
issues like what up with that?
It's an insecurity changed my whole life.

218
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,740
Low self esteem.
