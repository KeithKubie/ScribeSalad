00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.780
ROMAN NURIK: Hello and welcome
once again to "Android Design

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.500
in Action."

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.665
I'm your host, Roman Nurik.

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:14.590
NICK BUTCHER: And
hi, I'm Nick Butcher.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.700
MIKE DENNY: Hey there.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.274
I'm Mike Denny.

00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:18.690
ROMAN NURIK: And
today we're going

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.190
to recap all the
things that we talked

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.460
about on the show in 2013.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.930
It's been a busy year.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.340
We've had something like
20 or something episodes

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.532
just this yea-- actually
probably more than 20.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:34.240
NICK BUTCHER: This is
the 23rd this year.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.406
ROMAN NURIK: 23rd this year.

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:36.320
Nice.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.970
We've had a busy
year, and we're going

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.870
to talk about all the different
kind of highlights of the show

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:42.747
this year.

00:00:42.747 --> 00:00:45.330
NICK BUTCHER: So I'm sure that
you guys have watched them all,

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.170
but just in case, we're going to
pull out some of the highlights

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.322
that we very much enjoyed
bringing to you over the year.

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:52.280
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.810
So without further
ado, let's get started.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:02.540
So in 2013, we had about
600,000 total views

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.319
of all of our episodes.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.370
About a third of that came
from our episode on KitKat--

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.240
actually about half,
which is great.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.252
But this is awesome.

00:01:12.252 --> 00:01:13.710
I'm personally
really, really happy

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.560
that you guys are
finding the show useful,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.250
that you're sharing
it with your product

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.590
managers, and your
designers, and developers,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.040
and hopefully in 2014, we
have even greater viewership.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.540
So thanks for watching.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.320
So with that little bit
out of the way, Mike,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.270
do you want to jump in
with some of our episodes

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.930
on shared inspiration and
maybe some of our rants?

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.280
MIKE DENNY: Yeah, definitely.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.590
So we were looking back
on all these episodes

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.230
from this past year, and
we want to kind of group

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.910
them in general themes.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.140
And so I'm going to
be talking about a lot

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.410
of the different
inspirational segments

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.800
that we had on the show
and also some of our rants,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.850
where we just kind of go off
about how we think things

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.240
should be, and how
people can improve,

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.590
and how we can help them.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.180
So to start with that, I'm
going to look at the episode

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.040
that we did about
design workflow.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.360
Actually we had Alex Faaborg
from the Android Design team

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.070
on the show.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.820
And he walked us through some
of just the general structure

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.820
that the Android Design
team here at Google

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.610
uses in their design process.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.190
And this can
definitely be helpful

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.200
if you're looking for a little
more structure and process

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.620
to help you improve in
your design practices.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.900
As we can see here from
these little slide frames,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.590
the first couple steps
are about sketches.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.810
And sketching is great
because it gives you a chance

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.490
to get your ideas
out onto the paper

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.520
that you can then share
with other stakeholders

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.110
without committing to anything.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.460
So paper is great, but if
you don't have access--

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.520
or if you prefer to do
something on computer,

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.400
there are definitely a lot
of sketching tools available

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.840
online that you
can go check out.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.660
For any of these episodes
that we're doing,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.940
feel free to go back and
watch the whole episode.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.650
These are definitely recaps.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.589
So I just wanted
to point that out.

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:26.172
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah,
and the other thing

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:29.472
is that we have slides
and-- not really commentary,

00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:31.180
I guess-- we mostly
have slides available

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.540
for each of the episodes.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.680
So don't feel like you
need to take screenshots,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.800
or whatever, of this show.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.550
We have all the slides
and all the videos

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.920
available at
androiddesigninaction.com.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.274
We'll mention that link
at the very end as well.

00:03:44.274 --> 00:03:44.940
MIKE DENNY: Yep.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.200
Yep.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.410
Yep.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.826
Just wanted to get
that out there.

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:48.970
So after sketching,
after getting

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.760
some feedback from
your coworkers

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.510
or whoever you're
working with, it's

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.320
great to generate
additional ideas as well.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.240
And then you can
move on to f which

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.450
is a little bit more
formalized process

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.180
where-- especially for modeling
interactions between screens

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.831
and user flows-- more on flows
as we see it in step five

00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:12.330
there.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.480
After you block out the
main interactions and U/I

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.570
layouts with f it's a
good next natural step

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.400
to move on to the more high
fidelity or full fidelity

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.200
mockups in Photoshop
or Illustrator,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.850
whatever your asset
generation tool of choice is.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.120
And this is definitely
an iterative process.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.510
If you go back and look at the
full slides, there are about 10

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.240
of these full fidelity
mockup slides that

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.690
have all the different
iterations of the little header

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.060
image or the Google Mail app
that the design team went

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.000
through during that process.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.260
You also want to go back and
make sure that you can clearly

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.330
distinguish and spell out the
overall flow through your app.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.270
And it helps to
visualize that, maybe,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.820
using an art board
in Illustrator

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.660
with all the
multiple screens, so

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.600
that you can kind of visually
show the mental model

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.340
of your information
design in your app.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.780
And then redlines
are-- it's just

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.180
a term to describe
the specific metrics

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.050
and spec for the developers who
are going to be implementing

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.990
the designs that you've created.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.680
So that's always
helpful to give them

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.430
just a bunch of assets in
addition to specific metrics

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.590
to spell out.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.460
You know, this list item
should be 48 DIPs tall,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.090
this padding around should
be 16 DIPs, et cetera.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.376
So the next episode that
I want to recap is--

00:05:48.376 --> 00:05:50.000
NICK BUTCHER: Before
we move on, I just

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.290
want to say my overriding memory
of this kind of design process,

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.610
takeaway, was Alex
sharing the insight

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.230
that often the medium you
use to express your ideas

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.960
will dictate the kind of
feedback you get back.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.640
So if you show someone a very
highly designed, Photoshop,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.800
pixel-perfect, then you're
going to get comments

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.279
about the shade of blue
and drop shadow size.

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:15.820
Whereas if you show
someone a sketch,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.472
they'll go to town
on the basic idea.

00:06:17.472 --> 00:06:19.430
And I thought that was
a really important thing

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.330
to be cognizant of
when you're designing,

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.710
to keep the fidelity
of the medium in mind.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.375
So it kind of just
reinforced to me,

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:28.750
always be sketching, keep
sketching as early as possible,

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.366
and get loads and
loads of base feedback

00:06:31.366 --> 00:06:33.241
before you move it on
into some of these more

00:06:33.241 --> 00:06:35.072
high fidelity [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:35.072 --> 00:06:36.280
MIKE DENNY: Yeah, definitely.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.740
Thanks for pointing
that out, Nick.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:39.080
And it's great.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.470
I mean obviously I
recently joined the team.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.784
I wasn't in almost
all of these episodes,

00:06:43.784 --> 00:06:45.700
so Roman and Nick, please
feel free to jump in

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.944
as I'm recapping these with--

00:06:47.944 --> 00:06:49.490
NICK BUTCHER: Oh, we will.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.110
MIKE DENNY: I'm sure you will.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.450
One more thing
that Alex mentioned

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:57.550
as kind of a social
engineering hack for anytime

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.990
you present your
designs is to show

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.460
them using the tool
you use to create them.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.525
So if your manager starts going
off on a tangent-- you know,

00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:08.900
I wish that was just a little
bit bigger-- you could just

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.580
go change it right then.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.132
And he can decide
if it were bigger

00:07:13.132 --> 00:07:13.965
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:13.965 --> 00:07:15.714
ROMAN NURIK: So rather
than showing a PDF,

00:07:15.714 --> 00:07:17.950
basically show them in
Illustrator or in Photoshop.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:18.736
Yep.

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:19.444
MIKE DENNY: Yeah.

00:07:19.444 --> 00:07:21.440
Definitely.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.910
So moving on, the next
episode I'm going to recap

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.990
is the one in which we
presented the apps that

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.840
were selected to be part of
the Beautiful Design Collection

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.060
that we featured in Google Play.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.280
This is a fairly
regular process that we

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.770
do here and on the team.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.350
And it's definitely
worth going back

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.750
to check out those
apps to understand

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.920
why we really, really love them.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.790
And it's one of the
great things that I

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:56.790
think is worth mentioning here
is that these aren't apps that

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:02.650
were 100% Holo, cookie
cutter, kind of-- you could,

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.530
you confuse them with
Google standard apps that

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.050
come with the platform.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:10.950
These were apps that understand
the Holo design language,

00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:16.010
but then extend and go
beyond to add real hero

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.470
moments in their
app and to express

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:22.529
their brand in a
more meaningful way.

00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:24.820
ROMAN NURIK: In this episode
really kind of highlighted

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:25.920
some of those things.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.760
One or two of the little
details in each app that really

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.929
made it shine, that really
made it stand kind of above,

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.570
I guess, the
competition, if you will.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.730
MIKE DENNY: Yeah, and
along the same lines,

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:45.770
the next episode that we
looked at was in June.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.990
And we did a bit of a
recap on the creation

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.670
and the design of
the Google I/O app,

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:56.090
which is actually a really great
open-source project that we

00:08:56.090 --> 00:09:00.510
update every year in
anti-- ahead of Google I/O.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.810
And we like throwing in latest
developments and new features

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:05.660
in the platform.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.080
And it's definitely
a great reference app

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.071
to go back and look at how
a developer can implement

00:09:13.071 --> 00:09:14.570
the kinds of design
principles as we

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:17.227
talk about on "Android
Design in Action."

00:09:17.227 --> 00:09:17.935
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:09:17.935 --> 00:09:19.970
And it supports all
the best practices,

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.830
things like support for
different screen sizes,

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.370
use of heavy-- very, very
heavy use of fragments,

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.810
and loaders, and
things like that.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:32.470
But also shows a lot about how
to style your action bar, how

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.000
to do interesting things
with the action bar.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.874
So lots of good little
tidbits in that app.

00:09:40.874 --> 00:09:41.540
MIKE DENNY: Yep.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.039
Yep.

00:09:42.039 --> 00:09:44.180
Definitely.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.040
So definitely go back
and check that out.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.430
And also check out the
open-source project

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:50.240
or the Google I/O app.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:57.952
ROMAN NURIK: And that's at
code.google.com/p/iosched.

00:09:57.952 --> 00:09:59.660
I remember that like
the back of my hand.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.360
MIKE DENNY: If only we could
just show a link on the screen

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.470
that you could click.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.060
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, we could
probably do that in post.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.518
MIKE DENNY: In addition, if
you look at the high definition

00:10:08.518 --> 00:10:11.470
video on YouTube here,
if you scan the QR

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.390
code at the bottom
of the slide there,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.092
it'll take you to the Play Store
where you can download and play

00:10:16.092 --> 00:10:16.818
with the app.

00:10:16.818 --> 00:10:17.526
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:10:17.526 --> 00:10:19.340
Moving on?

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:20.110
MIKE DENNY: Yeah.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:24.010
So this was a great
episode in which

00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.820
Marco and Owen from
the Android Design team

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:32.490
came on and talked about
the sweeping redesign--

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:37.120
multi-platform redesign
of the Google Play apps.

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.310
So that includes the
Play Store itself

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.750
and all the different
media apps that you

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.390
can use to consume content
that you have on Google Play--

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:49.880
movies, music, books, et cetera.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.090
So all those apps
were redesigned

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:59.460
from the ground up with kind
of the overarching principles

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.530
that they were going
for to be responsive,

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.160
to have modular
elements, and also

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.740
to be familiar and emotionally
evocative throughout.

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.820
So before-- if you
go back and look

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.580
at the episode they show some
before here I'm only showing

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.070
the after and kind
of the nice look

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.920
and feel you guys are used
to now-- but if you go back

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.310
and look before,
they showed kind

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:28.390
of the design fragmentation
between the web product,

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:31.460
between the tablet
and phone products.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.190
And so it was
definitely a great move

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.750
to bring everything
together, to brand everything

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:44.600
in a way that it sets an example
for apps outside of Google,

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.090
especially with
the use of color--

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:49.640
and we'll talk about that more
when we discussed the branding

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.460
and consistency.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.480
It's just a great example
of responsive apps

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:00.470
where the U/I adapts
to the screen size.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.450
And the U/I is very
fluid and dynamic

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.500
based on the device
you are using.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.650
And it also caters to common
use cases on those devices.

00:12:11.650 --> 00:12:16.045
For example, if I use my
phone to download an app,

00:12:16.045 --> 00:12:17.990
that might be a totally
different experience

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:21.300
than browsing for a movie
to watch on my tablet.

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:23.717
So the apps were redesigned
with that in mind, especially.

00:12:23.717 --> 00:12:25.591
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, and
some of the key things

00:12:25.591 --> 00:12:27.850
that they use-- they
describe their use of cards

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:31.130
as kind of this inside
out design approach

00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:35.010
where the content really
adapts to its containers.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.170
And they talked lot
about use of-- I

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.110
guess the differentiation
of these cards,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:45.400
of sizes and things, to better
enforce hierarchy and what's

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.820
most important, what's
most relevant to you.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.235
I mean obviously, Mike, as
you said, the use of color

00:12:51.235 --> 00:12:53.580
is tremendous here across
all the Play properties.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:57.060
It really helps kind of
establish a sense of place

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.100
within the entire
Play ecosystem.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.602
So red if you're in movies, or
blue if you're within books.

00:13:02.602 --> 00:13:04.060
MIKE DENNY: Yeah,
yeah, definitely.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:05.660
So you always know
where you are.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.510
And one thing I wanted
to point out about cards

00:13:08.510 --> 00:13:11.260
is I think this is probably the
most sweeping implementation

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:15.640
of the cards U/I that
we've seen thus far.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:18.220
I think it started
initially with Google Now.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.970
And now you can see this
kind of card metaphor

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:24.460
throughout almost
every Google product.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.790
That doesn't mean
necessarily that you

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.970
have to put cards in your app.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:30.280
You shouldn't try to force it.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.860
I know it's kind
of become somewhat

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.160
of a visual design trend.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:38.300
Just understanding the
purpose of the card

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:44.710
to kind of encapsulate a single
idea or a piece of content

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:48.120
is a way to use that card
metaphor in your designs

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.000
responsibly.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.731
ROMAN NURIK: So let's move on.

00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:54.105
And yeah, definitely feel free
to check out that episode.

00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:56.470
There's a lot of good content
specifically about cards.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.790
Marco and Owen talk
about why they use them.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.244
Let's move on to
Favorite Design Details.

00:14:01.244 --> 00:14:02.910
Actually one thing I
wanted to point out

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:06.130
is one of the properties that
launched after that episode was

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.870
Google Play Newsstand, or the
purple section of Google Play.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.630
And that's actually--
Marco actually

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:17.160
discusses that in this Favorite
Design Details episode.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.030
So that's Marco
up here, this guy.

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.930
Check out his segment
of this episode

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.862
for a discussion of
Google Play Newsstand.

00:14:25.862 --> 00:14:26.820
MIKE DENNY: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.515
So Rachel Garb on the
top row there, she

00:14:29.515 --> 00:14:31.610
talked about the Airbnb app.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.570
Roman, you talked
about Foursquare.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:38.040
Nick talked about Google
Chrome and new kind

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.170
of non-obvious
interaction patterns

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:43.910
that are kind of like
power user features.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:48.020
Rich Fulcher from the design
team talked about Libra app.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.170
And the Libra app is fantastic
in it's visualization

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.260
of data, how they've
really made it interactive.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:58.590
So they track the weight,
you zoom in, zoom out,

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:00.680
and you can kind of
scale using gestures.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.270
It's a great experience.

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:03.860
I talked about the
Timely app which

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.590
is a stopwatch, alarm
clock, et cetera.

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.450
And Nick talked
about-- or sorry--

00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:11.200
ROMAN NURIK: Adam.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.088
MIKE DENNY: Adam talked
about the Etsy app.

00:15:14.088 --> 00:15:15.296
ROMAN NURIK: Actually, sorry.

00:15:15.296 --> 00:15:17.600
Quick tidbit there.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.589
When Adam and Nick
first joined the team--

00:15:19.589 --> 00:15:21.130
or I think when Adam
joined the team,

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.649
I always confused Adam and Nick.

00:15:22.649 --> 00:15:23.190
You know why?

00:15:23.190 --> 00:15:26.832
Because they're
both taller than me.

00:15:26.832 --> 00:15:27.982
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:27.982 --> 00:15:29.440
ROMAN NURIK: But
yeah, Mike, go on.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.106
I didn't mean to
interrupt you there so.

00:15:33.849 --> 00:15:35.390
MIKE DENNY: And Adam
recorded his bit

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:37.470
from New York, which is why
his little background there

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.678
looks a little bit different.

00:15:38.678 --> 00:15:40.580
But one thing I
wanted to point out

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.670
is that only a couple of
these were Google apps.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.860
And for the third-party
apps that we talked about,

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:54.410
notice that they weren't
pure Google apps.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.950
However, they were
pure Android apps.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.930
So with brand
consistency, this is

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.250
going to be a theme in
some of the other things I

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.500
talk about today.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.790
You want to
communicate your brand,

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.370
and you want to also
stay pure to Android.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.960
So pure Android
doesn't necessarily

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.410
mean you can't deviate
from the design principles.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.160
Like we encourage to
deviate with purpose.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.860
And so the general overall
theme of this episode

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.740
was that if you put the
extra effort in-- which

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.060
a lot of times takes
quite a bit more than just

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.880
the regular features--
to add hero moments,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.500
to add just slick animations,
beautiful visual presentation,

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:43.280
and really easy to understand
and use interaction patterns,

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.610
it'll just make a huge
difference overall.

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:50.134
ROMAN NURIK: Shall we move on
to Branding and Consistency?

00:16:50.134 --> 00:16:50.800
MIKE DENNY: Yep.

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.720
So I've talked about this
a couple times already.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.900
I just wanted to
illustrate this graph.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.337
I don't know who--
ore this presentation,

00:16:59.337 --> 00:17:00.420
I don't know if this was--

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.669
ROMAN NURIK: I think it was
Nick that talked a little.

00:17:02.669 --> 00:17:03.600
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.319
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, that was me.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:06.680
I was trying to think
of a way to express it,

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.004
and I got the most number of
gradients on a slide ever,

00:17:10.004 --> 00:17:12.410
I think.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:15.250
MIKE DENNY: Well when
I watched this episode,

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:19.140
I felt like you
expressed this kind

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.089
of complex and touchy subject
in the most clear-to-understand

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:25.069
way that I've heard
it expressed to date.

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:27.390
So kudos, Nick.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.930
So the idea of this
is your information

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.310
design, your interaction
design, and your visual design,

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:39.170
should kind of have a different
balance between your own brand

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:44.630
and the Holo or Android visual
style and design language.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.670
So the information
design, the architecture

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:53.000
of your app, how information
flows throughout your app,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.190
and also how a user
understands the interactions,

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:03.270
the mental model-- those
are very, very brandable.

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:08.530
And you should express
your information design

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:11.610
as creatively as
you can and really

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:17.740
let your simplicity and
your branding shine there.

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.470
On the other hand,
interaction design--

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:24.090
you don't want to introduce
new interaction patterns

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:29.160
for simple navigation or high
level switching between views.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.490
Because extra stuff that
the platform already

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:34.020
does for you for
free is just going

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:38.340
to confuse users or add steps
for them to learn how to use

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.810
your app, when you
should really just

00:18:40.810 --> 00:18:44.760
be finding the right fit
for existing patterns

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.700
and, where needed,
extending those.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:53.150
So it's not necessarily that all
the components that we provide

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.200
in the platform are the only
things you should use, right?

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.470
But if you need a little
extra flexibility,

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:01.120
you should at least use
one of the base components

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.840
as a starting point.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.060
And then for visual
design, which

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.600
is what most people
associate with branding,

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.210
you want to strike a balance.

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:15.460
So they pointed
out in the episode

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:20.730
that the best way, probably,
to use your branding,

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:23.040
to highlight your branding
in your visual design is

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.690
through the use of
a branded color.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.500
A fantastic example of this
is throughout the Play apps

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.260
where each Play property
has its own color.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.460
And that helps
between multiple apps

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:40.920
to keep you kind of in context
of which property you're

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.640
dealing with at the time.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.520
Now for most people
out there, they're

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.940
not going to be developing a
suite of apps like the Play

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.220
Store.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.570
But at the same time, you
don't want your user interface

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.670
to be your brand.

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:56.470
The navigation is not the brand.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:20:01.690
The way this button looks
can kind of be your brand.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.260
So that's where this slider is
kind of halfway in the middle.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.550
You want to take the core look
and feel of the Holo design

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.740
language and then extend that.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.060
Don't, you know, replace
the right angle triangle

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.290
in the spinner drop down
with something else.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.560
You know, start with
that familiar place,

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.560
and then you can kind of
use those expected metaphors

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.250
and visual indicators
throughout,

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:32.690
so that users know exactly how
a component-- even if it isn't

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.150
exactly as it
looks, they'll know

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:36.010
how it can be used
because you're

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:38.510
kind of starting
at the right place.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.260
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah,
that's a great summary.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:43.650
Basically if you're
going to make something,

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.870
you should make your U/I
elements interesting.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.680
You give them some
extra, you know,

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.630
bit of-- put in that
extra punch of branding.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:54.710
But make sure they're
still very, very familiar

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:57.550
because you really want to
lean on what you already know.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.300
And what users already
know are the things

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:04.900
that are in apps like Gmail,
and Google Keep, and Chrome.

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:07.480
Things like the overflow,
things like tabs

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.160
and the navigation
drawer, those things

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:11.005
exist in terms of
interaction design.

00:21:11.005 --> 00:21:12.380
For visual design
you really want

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.360
to take that and
kind of extend Holo.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.850
Not replace it, not
use it wholesale.

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:20.010
But really extend it, and
really kind of pump it

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.264
with your own sense, with
your own branding I guess.

00:21:23.264 --> 00:21:24.430
MIKE DENNY: Yeah definitely.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.160
And the design principle
from the Android Design Guide

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.190
that really is expressed here
is that users should have tricks

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.970
that they can use everywhere.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.920
And so that's what we've
been talking about.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.910
These little visual
indicators that users

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:41.110
expect to behave in a certain
way, don't go replacing that

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:44.510
just because you
think it looks cool.

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:49.124
ROMAN NURIK: OK so let's
move on to Common UX Issues.

00:21:49.124 --> 00:21:49.790
MIKE DENNY: Yes.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:55.710
So this was definitely one of
our more ranty episodes where--

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.276
ROMAN NURIK: There's
one long rant.

00:21:57.276 --> 00:21:58.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:01.970
MIKE DENNY: There's a top
10 list, we counted it back,

00:22:01.970 --> 00:22:08.170
of really common UX
issues or problems

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.580
that we on the Developer
Relations team see.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:18.940
So part of our everyday job is
to review apps internally here

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:20.290
at Google and also outside.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:24.460
We work with a lot of you guys
to help you improve your apps.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.780
And these are just things
that we've seen over,

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.790
and over, and over.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.850
And we felt like going on a
rant and spelling them out

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:40.290
would hopefully prevent them
from spreading to more apps

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:41.620
out there in the wild.

00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.320
So I pulled out just
a couple of these.

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:48.560
For the full list and
the full detail rant,

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.090
definitely check
out the episode so

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.729
that you know what not to do.

00:22:52.729 --> 00:22:54.270
But things that I
wanted to point out

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.800
were-- like the
navigation is my brand,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.980
like I mentioned for
the previous episode.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:04.570
Additional things that
can be pretty annoying

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.530
are showing modal
loading dialogs.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.730
The best way to
deal with loading

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.850
in data asynchronously
over the network

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.460
is to do it before you
show it to the user.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.030
So wherever possible,
obviously that's

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.770
not possible in every
case, especially

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.250
for real-time
updates-- if the user

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.540
wants to update a social
feed, for example.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.350
But when presenting
a loading indicator,

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.780
it's best to do it in
line, either with the U/I

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.940
element that's currently loading
or somewhere more prominent

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:40.080
on the action bar, for example,
to indicate that something's

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.880
loading in from the network,
but not necessarily a popup

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.730
dialog that blocks
off your action.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:50.830
The worst thing about this
is when you override the Back

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:54.630
button so that you can't cancel
the dialog until the loading

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:56.420
process actually completes.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:57.970
So that's a big no-no.

00:23:57.970 --> 00:24:01.070
And definitely should
go through your apps

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:05.650
and kind of streamline
your use of loading.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:07.400
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
this was a fun top 10.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.774
So if you're
working on an app, I

00:24:08.774 --> 00:24:10.794
recommend you go back
and look at these top 10

00:24:10.794 --> 00:24:12.710
and make sure you're not
falling foul of them.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:13.800
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.440
Let's move on in the
interest of the time.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.980
So I'm going to flip through
a bunch of best practices.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.900
And actually-- so those
episodes are very inspirational.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:26.270
We had a bunch of rants.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.330
A lot of that is kind of on
the-- less on the education

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:30.170
side, I guess.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:33.600
Less on the learning about
Android and more about like,

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.260
here are the types of things
you should be thinking about.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.420
In this best practices section,
I'm going to talk about some

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:43.080
of the episodes, and very
briefly, some of the episodes

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.540
where we actually shared
some best practices,

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.656
some of our-- kind of the
specifics on how you implement

00:24:48.656 --> 00:24:50.780
action bars or how you
implement navigation charts,

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:52.390
or things like that.

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.680
So the first one I want to
talk about is Units of Measure.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:59.000
In this episode, which was
actually coupled with news

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.460
Reader redesign, which
Nick will talk about later.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.780
We talked specifically about
density independent pixels,

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:09.390
how you calculate DIPs, screen
density grids, basically

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.490
everything related to a lot of
the visual design and layout

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.780
stuff that you need to know.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.350
It's kind of like a visual
design 101 for Android,

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.180
if you will.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:18.970
So if you're just
getting started,

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.260
definitely check
out this episode

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.860
where we talk about
units of measure.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.300
We also talked about
looking at devices

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.590
in terms of their density
independent pixel resolution

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:32.540
rather than their
pixel resolution.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.510
So for example,
the Nexus 7 being

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:39.569
960 by 600 DIPs and the Nexus
5 being 640 by 360 DIPs.

00:25:39.569 --> 00:25:41.360
And that's a really,
really important point

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.690
if you're getting started
doing layout for Android.

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:49.670
Moving on, we had
another great episode

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.530
on the onboarding experience.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:54.650
And Nick actually came up
with this little-- the idea

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.279
of using a little snowboarder
as the icon for this episode.

00:25:58.279 --> 00:25:59.112
NICK BUTCHER: Great.

00:25:59.112 --> 00:26:01.275
There you've got
it, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:01.275 --> 00:26:02.590
ROMAN NURIK: No, I got it.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.506
I think we all got it.

00:26:03.506 --> 00:26:06.710
I think nobody talked
about it, but we got it.

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:09.550
This episode specifically
talked about a bunch

00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:13.960
of the different ways in which
you can mess up-- and not

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.310
only mess up but also improve
the getting started experience

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.700
for your app.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.610
So things like
speed bump tutorials

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:25.120
and basically avoiding those,
requiring registration,

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.750
splash screens,
basically getting

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.180
bootstrapped with the app.

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.539
We talked about lots
of things there.

00:26:31.539 --> 00:26:34.080
One of my favorite things that
we did is we talked about some

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.710
of the examples.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.020
One of my favorite apps
in this space is Tumblr.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.590
It actually lets you do
so much without signing

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.980
in, or registering, or anything.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.771
You open up the app,
and you're immediately

00:26:43.771 --> 00:26:47.500
given the full app, the full
U/I, the full experience.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.070
You can even start following
blogs or following Tumblr blogs

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:53.090
before you log in.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:55.230
So it's just a great
example of that.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.550
And then we also briefly talked
about over-the-air install with

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.730
the Google+ integration stuff.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:01.580
So--

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.163
NICK BUTCHER: In
this one episode too,

00:27:03.163 --> 00:27:05.280
it's one of my bugbear
kind of subjects.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.780
I kind of like to
think that there's

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.200
a funnel of people
trying to use your app,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.050
and every time you do one of
these kind of antipatterns,

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.260
the funnel gets smaller
and you lose a few users.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.260
So it's really kind of like
an interesting exercise

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.480
to critically look
at your startup flow

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.024
and see where you
are potentially

00:27:21.024 --> 00:27:22.326
going to lose some people.

00:27:22.326 --> 00:27:24.360
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, for sure.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.080
The next best practice
thing we talked about, again

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:30.080
in the area of visual
design, was launcher icons.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.390
And this episode was coupled
with a football apps--

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.890
or soccer apps as we
say here in the States.

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:38.750
Soccer or football
apps redesign.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:45.160
So in this episode, we talked
about some best practices

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:48.280
for designing launcher
icons-- the sizes,

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.820
the amount of spacing
you should use,

00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.380
also the perspective
you should use,

00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.080
and specifically the
density of assets.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:57.600
So there's one thing that
still keeps coming up.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:03.180
Don't forget to include XXHDPI
assets for launcher icons.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:09.280
And in the new world of Nexus 5
and larger icons on the Nexus 5

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:13.265
launcher, it should
actually be also XXXHDPI.

00:28:13.265 --> 00:28:15.570
So definitely make sure
to check out this episode

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.710
if you're designing
launcher icons.

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:22.940
Moving on, we did another
episode basically doing

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.400
a 101 on the action bar.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.400
I'm guessing if you've
been watching this show--

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.649
or if this is your first
episode, thanks for watching.

00:28:28.649 --> 00:28:32.550
But if you have learned
anything about Android so far,

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:34.730
it's probably-- or
Android design so far,

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.300
you've probably learned a
little bit about the action bar.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:40.430
In this episode, we dove
into quite a bit of detail

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:42.870
on the action bar-- the
general organization, you know,

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:46.020
which things should go where,
navigation on the left,

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.590
actions on the right.

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:50.300
We talked about some
guidelines for how many actions

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:52.290
you should show.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:53.784
And we also talked
about branding,

00:28:53.784 --> 00:28:55.450
and this is kind of
that recurring theme

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:57.100
that Mike was talking
about earlier.

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.600
Here's some of the
ways in which you

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.501
can start introducing your
branding into the app.

00:29:02.501 --> 00:29:04.250
And the action bar is
a key area for that,

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.970
so we highlighted
some ways in which

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:08.905
you can introduce your
brand color schemes.

00:29:08.905 --> 00:29:10.280
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah
the action bar

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.950
is one of those
fundamental patterns

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.770
that we say you should
probably deviate with purpose.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:16.216
So unless you've got really
good reason not to be using it,

00:29:16.216 --> 00:29:17.549
you probably should be using it.

00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:20.896
So if you're not 100% sure
about how and when to use it,

00:29:20.896 --> 00:29:22.062
then check out this episode.

00:29:22.062 --> 00:29:23.710
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.890
So after the action bar,
we invited Jens Nagle

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:30.465
and Rich Fulcher from
the Android Design team.

00:29:30.465 --> 00:29:31.840
And we talked
about Rich earlier.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.740
He was talking
about the Libra app

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.850
in our Favorite Design
Details episode.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:41.210
But Jens and Rich,
back in June, they

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:42.950
talked about the
navigation drawer.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.440
And this was right
after Google I/O, where

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:47.060
we announced the
navigation drawer

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:51.170
pattern and a bunch of the
framework support for it.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:53.770
But in this episode,
Jens and Rich

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:57.670
dove very deeply into
the interaction design

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.910
aspects of the
navigation drawer.

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:03.880
So things like what
should the Back button do?

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.070
How should you represent
your information hierarchy

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.390
in the navigation drawer?

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:11.110
They talked about things
like collapsible sections.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:15.350
I guess they talked about
hubs, navigational hubs, that

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.730
are kind of like deeper
sections of your app

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.150
that should still be
accessible within the drawer.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:22.420
So they talked about a whole
bunch of details there.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.800
That's actually some
pretty good information

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.721
on top of what's in
the design guide.

00:30:27.721 --> 00:30:29.470
So if you're building
a navigation drawer,

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:32.220
definitely check
out this episode.

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:35.580
MIKE DENNY: So the next episode
we did was on collections.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.920
And specifically, we
showed some I guess--

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.680
we talked about some best
practices by way of examples

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:45.990
on how lots of apps right now
are doing things right in terms

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.540
of displaying, letting
you search and filter,

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.040
and so on collections,
as well as

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.680
mutate-- things like adding
items to a collection,

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.040
removing items from a
collection, reordering,

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.860
taking action on items,
things like that.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.320
So we talked about some things
like distillation, things

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.330
like search and filter, having
a right side filter drawer.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.910
We talked about
responsive layout,

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:14.370
basically switching from lists
to a grid to a staggered grid,

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.480
like here an example of Pocket.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.460
We talked about
how different apps

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.110
let you act on
items using things

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.470
like the contextual
action bar, as well

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:28.460
as secondary actions
and item overflows.

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.310
Reordering items like using
a drag group on the side,

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:34.550
or Google Keep which is
actually an excellent example

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:38.380
of collections-- displaying
and modifying collections,

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.500
but notes in this case
how they actually use drag

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:42.960
and drop to let you reorder.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.930
So this episode
really, in summary,

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.540
is really just kind of
a smorgasbord almost

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.190
of different ways
in which apps are

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:54.700
doing things great in
terms of collections.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.090
OK, moving on.

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:01.220
The next the best practice
episode type thing that we had

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:06.270
was one on images that
we did back in October.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.120
And here we talked
about the different ways

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:13.500
in which you can actually do
interesting things with images.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.790
So we talked about some best
practices like how to show text

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:21.190
overlays when showing
banner images or thumbnails.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:23.536
We talked about placeholders
in this example.

00:32:23.536 --> 00:32:24.910
We talked about
how Pintrest does

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:29.940
a great job of actually keying
the placeholder a color,

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.450
based on the image.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.880
So they actually-- it seems like
they store another bit almost

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:39.290
in the database of the
key color in the image,

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.100
and they show that color
before the image itself loads.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.900
So gives you a little
touch of context

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.430
as to what's going to
show up in that space.

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:50.550
We also talked about the
center cropping technique,

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:55.260
which is a great way to
basically allow your U/Is

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.210
to scale to different
aspect ratios.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:01.310
And in the center cropping
technique you basically--

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:03.420
it's actually very
simple to use.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.820
You actually just set the
scale type to center crop

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.740
on an image view.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.640
But in this technique,
you basically

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:11.200
chop off either
the left and right

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.630
or the top and
bottom of an image

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:18.810
if the aspect ratio of the
image and its target destination

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:20.550
don't match.

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.610
And we also talked
about focus, things

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:25.420
like using blurring
and dimming techniques

00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:28.990
to help the user really focus
on the most important things,

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:33.270
whether it be the text in
front, or gray scaling an image

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:35.489
if it's not important,
and things like that.

00:33:35.489 --> 00:33:37.030
So overall we just
touched on a bunch

00:33:37.030 --> 00:33:39.850
of different best practices
and a couple of ideas

00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:42.930
on how to present images.

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:46.690
So moving on, we did another
episode on best practices

00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:48.780
for presenting Maps in your app.

00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:53.090
So we talked about things like
the different ways in which

00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:56.352
users can interact, or should
be able to interact with a map.

00:33:56.352 --> 00:33:58.560
The different ways in which
you can present and allow

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.790
interaction with
markers in info windows.

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:04.680
And we spent some time talking
about the visual design

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.530
of markers, basically
how you can introduce

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.440
branding into something that
is from a shape standpoint.

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.440
The shape of a marker
is generally pretty

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.830
standard, but how
you can actually

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:18.760
introduce some of your branding
into that as well as how

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.790
to deal with density.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:21.679
If you have tons
and tons of markers,

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:24.429
how can you actually
still allow the users

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.850
to see the map underneath
all the markers?

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.389
So we talked about
that for quite a bit.

00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:31.980
We talked about full screen,
and I'll get to that and second.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.929
We talked about an
embedded map mode

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.437
which Foursquare does
really well with.

00:34:36.437 --> 00:34:38.020
But we talked a bit
about full screen,

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:41.239
and actually in
Android 4.4, we also

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:46.310
talked about translucent
navigation and status bars.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.260
And these actually
go hand in hand.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.659
Another thing that we talked
about in the Android 4.4

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.480
episode was map padding.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:55.980
So actually in recent
versions of the map library,

00:34:55.980 --> 00:35:00.520
you can offset these controls
like the zoom control, as well

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.090
as the compass, and
my location control.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.540
You can actually
offset those and still

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.960
show the map above and
below those controls.

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.990
So it really helps
when presenting a map

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:17.290
in this kind of more full
screen or more immersive mode.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:19.660
Before we move on, I've
been talking a lot.

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.852
You guys have any comments on
maps or anything like that?

00:35:22.852 --> 00:35:23.643
NICK BUTCHER: Nope.

00:35:23.643 --> 00:35:24.684
You're doing a great job.

00:35:24.684 --> 00:35:27.650
ROMAN NURIK: All right,
let's plow ahead.

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:29.950
We did another episode
on home screen widgets.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.320
This is back in March.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:34.640
And in this episode, we talked
about the different types

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.740
of home screen widgets, things
like information only widgets

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.850
like your current weather, or a
control widgets like the power

00:35:40.850 --> 00:35:43.660
control, hybrid widgets
and collection widgets.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:46.720
We talked about the different
kind of patterns for content

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.610
to show inside of a widget.

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:51.844
We also, not pictured in
these thumbnails here,

00:35:51.844 --> 00:35:53.510
we talked about some
of the constraints,

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:55.550
like things you just
can't do with widgets.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:58.574
Like you can't play videos
in widgets unfortunately.

00:35:58.574 --> 00:36:00.740
But we did talk about some
of the things you can do.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.980
Like you can actually allow
for configuration of a widget.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.960
So one of the great
things about widgets

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.480
is that they let a user
take a bit of your app

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:11.160
and put it on their home screen,
one of the most valuable pieces

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.924
of real estate on their device.

00:36:12.924 --> 00:36:15.090
And one of the best ways
to have a successful widget

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:18.260
is to allow customization,
really let the user make it

00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.880
their own.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.740
We also talked about some
best practices for sizing.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.550
Basically when you're designing
the layout for a widget,

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.020
we talked about
some formulas you

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.545
can use to roughly figure
out how big it should be.

00:36:29.545 --> 00:36:31.920
NICK BUTCHER: I think one of
the most important things we

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:34.560
touched on there which perhaps
isn't quite as well-documented

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.220
as I'd like in our
design guidelines,

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:39.600
is the fact that you're
sharing some real estate.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.930
So while your app has the
full range of expression

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:45.670
of its brand, and
so forth, when it's

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:48.400
taking over the whole screen,
when you are creating a widget,

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.602
you have to bear in
mind the context that it

00:36:50.602 --> 00:36:53.060
will be presented next to other
widgets or other app icons.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.976
So I think that was a
really important section

00:36:54.976 --> 00:36:55.890
in that episode.

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.370
It's how you design your
widget so that it will go along

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:01.960
with those other and
home screen items.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:02.710
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.626
Specifically the visual
design of the widgets.

00:37:04.626 --> 00:37:07.120
It is more important to
be on that slider branding

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:10.330
consistency, more
important than in your app

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:14.417
to be closer to the Android
and Holo end of that spectrum

00:37:14.417 --> 00:37:17.000
when you're designing a widget
because it's next to everything

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:17.574
else.

00:37:17.574 --> 00:37:18.324
NICK BUTCHER: Yep.

00:37:18.324 --> 00:37:19.250
But we love widgets.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.340
It can make an app
stand out and really

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:24.344
differentiate your
app from the crowd.

00:37:24.344 --> 00:37:25.760
ROMAN NURIK: All
right, moving on.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.400
We did a little
bit in this section

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.110
where we talked
about the I/O app.

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:32.151
In the episode where we
talked about the I/O app,

00:37:32.151 --> 00:37:35.370
we also talked about
sharing in fullscreen U/Is.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:37.820
So sharing, I'm not going to
get into too much depth here.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.620
But we talked about
the different ways

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.270
in which you can allow
users to share content.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:45.980
Things like the shared
dialog that's very standard.

00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.720
Things like the share action
provider in the action bar.

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.740
The idea here is--
the big message

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.170
here is that you should
really allow sharing

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:55.470
to anything that's
on the user's device,

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:59.190
not just specifically to
two social networks or one

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:00.120
social network.

00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.440
You should really
kind of use whatever

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.800
the system has installed.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.180
So keep that in mind when
designing sharing U/Is.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:10.610
In the fullscreen,
I guess, area, we

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:13.510
talked about system bars,
things like the status bar

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:14.780
and the navigation bar.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.540
And then we talked a whole bunch
about different interesting

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.980
ways in which you
can use those bars,

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:25.440
having an overlay action
bar, or dimming out

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.870
the status bar and
navigation bar.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:30.490
Lots of different interactions
you can create here.

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:32.640
And these were-- we
talked about them

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.420
in even more depth
in a later episode.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.030
I think it was the
KitKat episode.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.880
When we introduced
immersive mode in KitKat,

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.970
we talked about some
of the even newer ways

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:46.540
you can do really,
really fullscreen, really

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.970
immersive U/Is.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:50.230
So if you're building a
fullscreen experience,

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:53.020
like a video player,
or a fullscreen game,

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.990
or a book reader, or
even a photo gallery,

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:00.370
definitely make sure to check
out this episode from June 4th

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:04.590
as well as the KitKat episode
which was very recent.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:05.620
All right, moving on.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.640
I think we're at the end-- yeah
this is my last slide here.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:14.660
The last kind of best practice
and best practice type

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:17.960
episode we had was
about design tools.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:21.560
So in this episode, we talked
a lot about the different tools

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:24.390
that the designers
on the Android team

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:27.860
use-- things like obviously
Illustrator, Fireworks,

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:29.330
Photoshop.

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:34.050
But we also talked about
some of the interaction--

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:35.870
I guess some of the
wireframing tools

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:39.170
that you have available to
you as an Android designer--

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:41.920
things like OmniGraffle
or Fluid UI, or Proto.io.

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.800
We did a compare and contrast
of those different interaction

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.360
design tools.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.370
And there are probably countless
more today than there were back

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.420
when we did this
episode, but if you're

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.780
looking for a
getting started guide

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.730
on which tools you
should get started with,

00:39:56.730 --> 00:39:58.430
definitely this
is a good episode.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:03.120
One last thing is we briefly
talked about the Android Design

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.920
Preview tool which lets
you mirror something

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:08.960
from your computer, from
like a Photoshop window,

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:09.670
to your device.

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:10.930
You can see it live.

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:13.040
And we talked about things
like the Android Asset

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.450
Studio, and Holo Colors
Generator, and Action Bar Style

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.410
Generator, that
let you basically

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:21.940
create all the assets you need
for the basics of your Android

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:22.530
app.

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:24.529
Things like the action
bar background and things

00:40:24.529 --> 00:40:25.675
like that.

00:40:25.675 --> 00:40:27.800
NICK BUTCHER: Tooling is
always an emotive subject.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.550
I mean people feel
passionate about their tools.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:30.950
And it's interesting,
some the feedback

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:31.810
we got from that episode.

00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:33.325
And some new tools have emerged.

00:40:33.325 --> 00:40:35.630
I think, for me, Sketch
is one of the tools which

00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:37.240
is on my list of
tools to check out.

00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.130
A lot of people
are saying they're

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:39.940
having a lot of
success using that

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.300
for kind of a
effective base design.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.390
ROMAN NURIK: For sure.

00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.890
OK.

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:48.041
And I think that about covers it
for the best practices section.

00:40:48.041 --> 00:40:50.040
Nick do you want to talk
about all the redesigns

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.619
and mockups we did in 2013?

00:40:52.619 --> 00:40:53.910
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.870
So redesigns are kind
of very much in the DNA

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.700
of the "Android Design
in Action" show.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.390
It's kind of the "in
action" part where

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:03.360
we like to show rather than
just talk about things.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.667
And so while they
take a lot of time,

00:41:05.667 --> 00:41:07.500
and we haven't been
able to do quite as many

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.458
as perhaps we'd like,
there's been some really,

00:41:09.458 --> 00:41:11.510
really fun shows
where we've managed

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:16.390
to either reimagine certain
apps out there or take

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:19.010
a look at a hypothetical app,
of what it might look like.

00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:20.801
And so we're going to
take you through some

00:41:20.801 --> 00:41:22.090
of our favorite redesigns.

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:25.954
So all the way back in January,
the first meat-flavored--

00:41:25.954 --> 00:41:28.245
your favorite meat flavored
reader app-- the first time

00:41:28.245 --> 00:41:30.200
we introduced it.

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.940
This was an episode
where we introduced

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.702
this idea of iterative design.

00:41:34.702 --> 00:41:37.550
So it was really, really fun
to take an application which

00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:39.970
you had like zero styling
applied to it at all.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:41.850
It just had some real
content in there.

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:43.570
And walk you through
the steps that we

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:49.260
would do to improve things like
applying themes, and applying

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.110
the metrics in the
Android Design Guide,

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.000
and take a look at typography,
and literally build it up step

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:54.860
by step.

00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:57.290
And as you can see as
Roman pans around here,

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.570
to go from something which
looks completely bare,

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.319
you know doesn't look
like an Android app.

00:42:01.319 --> 00:42:03.550
You're not exactly
sure how to use it, to,

00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:05.591
you know, something which
looks really attractive

00:42:05.591 --> 00:42:07.620
and communicates this
information hierarchy,

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.260
and really sells the content.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.810
So if you haven't
checked this out,

00:42:10.810 --> 00:42:13.018
this is probably one of my
all-time favorite episodes

00:42:13.018 --> 00:42:14.300
of "Android Design in Action."

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.100
Really, really
again, it breaks down

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.184
how we go about improving
your application.

00:42:19.184 --> 00:42:21.600
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, the one
thing we tried to do throughout

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.630
is talk about some of
the developer features

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:24.450
that we used.

00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:26.330
So on the bottom right
of a lot of the slides

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:28.360
there's a little kind of
"for developers" notes.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.810
So keep that in mind
if you're a developer.

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.930
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:36.440
Next episode I want to
talk about is in February,

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.950
we took a look at football--
not soccer-- football apps,

00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:43.760
in particular the application
Live Score Addicts.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.110
And we reimagined
what it could look

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:49.594
like by applying some more of
the Android Design guidelines.

00:42:49.594 --> 00:42:51.135
So we did a lot of
things we normally

00:42:51.135 --> 00:42:53.935
do like kind of applying a
more Androidy kind of flatter

00:42:53.935 --> 00:42:56.570
looking view, and
using action bars,

00:42:56.570 --> 00:43:00.617
and so forth, which
I think, instantly it

00:43:00.617 --> 00:43:02.470
made it look more like
an Android app to me.

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:05.780
It made it communicate its
purpose, its interaction

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:08.820
patterns, much clearer
to me after the redesign.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:10.590
So I was a fan of that.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.260
But the two things I wanted
to mostly pull out here,

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:16.340
and they're kind of
slightly larger pictures.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.480
I really enjoyed
with this redesign

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.050
taking a look at the
navigation, the way

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.670
the major navigation
is organized.

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:25.420
Because they were previously
using a drawer which

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.440
seemed to-- there wasn't
too many major sections

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.110
to this application.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:33.540
So by kind of flattening
down their kind of navigation

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.300
hierarchy, we were
able to move it over

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.050
to using a tab based interface
with lesser used functions

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:42.436
tucked away under the
overflow, like settings.

00:43:42.436 --> 00:43:44.220
And that instantly
was much clearer.

00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:47.450
I think if you can use a tab
based navigation where in which

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:50.880
it immediately communicates
the apps purpose to the user.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:55.180
Or using here-- using the action
bar spinner, sorry, not tabs.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.784
Then I thought this was a
great stepping back exercise,

00:43:58.784 --> 00:44:00.450
and not using a drawer
just because it's

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:03.020
attractive or a new [INAUDIBLE],
but actually thinking

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.610
of the simplest way to
communicate these actions.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:07.020
That was really fun.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.311
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, one of my
favorite parts of this, we

00:44:09.311 --> 00:44:12.380
also did a bit with
the color scheme.

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:14.966
We talk a lot about
single accent colors.

00:44:14.966 --> 00:44:16.340
Like a lot of the
Play properties

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.460
use a single accent color.

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.280
In this case, we
actually in the redesign

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:25.010
we decided to use two accent
colors-- this, I guess,

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:28.990
desaturated dark brown and
almost like a forest green.

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:33.430
So don't feel like you should be
limited to single accent color.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.987
If it makes sense for your
app to use two accent colors,

00:44:35.987 --> 00:44:37.320
absolutely feel free to do that.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.370
Here's just one example
of how we did that.

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:42.890
NICK BUTCHER: Yes,
that was quick.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.160
Moving on.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.230
So in March, we look
at how you might

00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:50.370
create a hypothetical
news reader.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:52.080
So we built on top
of this, kind of,

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:55.460
XYZ this kind of meaty
reader, and explored

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.000
some interesting
ways in which you

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.317
can do news reading experiences.

00:45:00.317 --> 00:45:02.650
So there was some fun stuff
about explorations in there.

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:05.946
Things like using
multi-finger gestures in order

00:45:05.946 --> 00:45:08.200
to kind of peek more
content, leading

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.770
to a kind of a lighter
weight process and so forth.

00:45:11.770 --> 00:45:15.420
I was really interested
in the use of search

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:16.462
to flatten the hierarchy.

00:45:16.462 --> 00:45:18.045
I thought that was
really interesting.

00:45:18.045 --> 00:45:20.710
A lot of applications struggle
with how you communicate

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:24.200
a really, really complicated
hierarchy of topics

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.070
and so forth.

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:27.530
And using search
and customization

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.280
to flatten and
navigate that I thought

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.789
was a fun approach to it.

00:45:31.789 --> 00:45:32.580
That was very good.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.496
ROMAN NURIK: One brief
thing I want to mention

00:45:34.496 --> 00:45:37.860
is this mock up was done before
we had the official navigation

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.790
drawer pattern, so some of the
mock ups, some of the designs

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.630
you see here are actually
not quite up to date

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:47.074
in terms of how you should
use the navigation drawer.

00:45:47.074 --> 00:45:47.990
NICK BUTCHER: Oh yeah.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.900
Bulldozing content.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.882
What's that all about?

00:45:51.882 --> 00:45:54.090
But lastly, I think that
the kind of the bottom right

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.810
image, it's the
slide [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:58.640
I very much enjoyed
the discussion

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.610
we had around focusing
on content because kind

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:03.880
of these news reader apps,
it's all about content.

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.590
It's all about presenting
and getting users to a story

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:07.620
they want to read.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.532
And the little
interface design things

00:46:09.532 --> 00:46:11.990
that you can do to make that
reading experience, the reason

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:14.440
they're there, more
pleasant can really help.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:18.280
So we played some ideas
around hiding the action bar,

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.530
about when to
surface new content,

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:22.720
about going into this
kind of lights out mode,

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.730
as we call it, where you dim any
other distractions in the U/I.

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.779
I thought that was
really fun to really,

00:46:28.779 --> 00:46:30.445
really have a
laser-focused application.

00:46:30.445 --> 00:46:31.740
And so that was good.

00:46:33.742 --> 00:46:34.700
ROMAN NURIK: Moving on.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:37.500
NICK BUTCHER: Next up
was an episode in March

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:41.170
where we took a look at
what a hypothetical podcast

00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:44.430
creator might look like.

00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:46.941
So this was an app where
we had kind of mocked it

00:46:46.941 --> 00:46:48.439
up and designed.

00:46:48.439 --> 00:46:49.980
But stepping back
from that, I really

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.820
enjoyed that we
started from the stage

00:46:52.820 --> 00:46:54.840
before the mock ups and
redesigns, if you will.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.260
We started from the
information hierarchy

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.440
and really took
some time to think

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.440
about what it was this
app was trying to achieve

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.930
and how that would influence
the screen design later on.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:08.960
So I really enjoyed that we
kept the information model.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.180
And in fact, we used the
labels throughout the design

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.460
to show which screens were
ticking off certain use

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.756
cases we were
trying to cover off.

00:47:17.756 --> 00:47:18.905
So that was a fun episode.

00:47:18.905 --> 00:47:20.404
Which I don't think
I was there for.

00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:23.148
But I did enjoy watching it.

00:47:23.148 --> 00:47:24.920
ROMAN NURIK: Moving on.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.290
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, moving on.

00:47:26.290 --> 00:47:32.310
In July, we took a look at the
application called FINN.no.

00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:35.000
ROMAN NURIK: This is actually
from GDG Oslo, I believe.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.430
We did kind of a
live app clinic,

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:40.550
I guess, with the
creators of this app.

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:43.930
And then they were like, hey,
can you show us some ideas--

00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:47.390
or show some mock ups of
how you would design this.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:49.037
So we went ahead and did that.

00:47:49.037 --> 00:47:50.620
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah
that was a fun one.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.940
So I think there was some
really nice work done

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:56.130
to better express the kind
of information hierarchy.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.230
So in general,
reorganization there.

00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:02.770
As well as moving some
of the interface patterns

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.690
like the action bar and
the navigation drawer a bit

00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:10.395
closer to the platform pattern
in order to kind of make

00:48:10.395 --> 00:48:13.020
them feel more intuitive so that
users going to kind of pick up

00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.745
the application and know
how to navigate around,

00:48:14.745 --> 00:48:16.200
which I thought was really nice.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.700
But the one thing I wanted to
highlight in this application,

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.299
we touched on it-- couple of
seconds ago, couple of minutes

00:48:21.299 --> 00:48:23.490
ago, talking about
information collections--

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:26.110
was the use of the right side
drawer for sorting options.

00:48:26.110 --> 00:48:28.400
I very much enjoyed this.

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:33.627
This is a great way to
bundle up your options.

00:48:33.627 --> 00:48:35.460
And it can feel like a
lighter weight action

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:38.370
rather than taking you
off to a second screen

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:40.620
or dialog perhaps.

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.880
So letting them, kind of,
set their sorting options.

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.210
And better yet, if
you can have them,

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:47.580
say, updating the background.

00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:49.850
So I can see as I move that
slide to left or right,

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:51.290
if I can see the
number of results

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.414
changing in the background.

00:48:52.414 --> 00:48:53.900
I think its really,
really nice way

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:57.360
to make it feel like I'm
directly working on this data,

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.700
rather than it's this slow
machinery process there

00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:01.870
and pulling a lever and
that's causing a process

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:02.745
to go somewhere else.

00:49:02.745 --> 00:49:04.970
I thought that was a
really, really nice touch

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.660
in that episode.

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.920
ROMAN NURIK: Moving on.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:10.960
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:13.579
ROMAN NURIK: We had a lot
of redesigns this year.

00:49:13.579 --> 00:49:14.370
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:14.905
It was fun.

00:49:14.905 --> 00:49:15.405
Yeah, OK.

00:49:15.405 --> 00:49:16.930
We did a few.

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:20.070
In July, we to look at a
hypothetical cricket app.

00:49:20.070 --> 00:49:21.940
So this is off the
back of-- Reto Meier

00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:24.400
did an excellent episode
of "The App Clinic"

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.960
talking about his ideal sports
app and how you would build it.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.160
But we then picked up
the ball off of him

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:34.260
and then talked about how we
might go around styling that.

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:38.210
And much in the vein of the
iterative design process,

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:41.450
we took this step-- this
application step by step.

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:45.300
So we looked at the information
density, and the typography,

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.180
and the visual
theming, and so on.

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.360
And built it up step
by step, talking

00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.050
through why we were
making new changes

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:52.049
and how you change them.

00:49:52.049 --> 00:49:53.910
And we went one
step further as well

00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:59.005
and showed an example of how
you might redline such a design

00:49:59.005 --> 00:50:02.540
to communicate all of
these design decisions

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:04.180
from a designer to a developer.

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.242
That was a fun episode.

00:50:06.242 --> 00:50:06.950
ROMAN NURIK: Yep.

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:09.650
Very fun episode.

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:13.020
And I think that was it for
the designs that year, right?

00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:16.075
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, we run
out of steam in July it seems.

00:50:16.075 --> 00:50:17.390
ROMAN NURIK: They take
quite a bit of time, right?

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:18.640
They're pretty time consuming.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:21.680
They are very fun, but
very time consuming.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.140
All right.

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:24.984
So the and more section.

00:50:24.984 --> 00:50:26.900
We had a couple of
episodes that didn't really

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.070
fall into any of
those three themes

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:30.320
and we did want to talk about.

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.309
Nick, do you want
to jump into those?

00:50:33.309 --> 00:50:34.600
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.240
In May, just after
the conference itself,

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:40.540
we took some time talk about
what happens at Google I/O,

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.950
and in particular, to highlight
some of the sessions that

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:46.330
will be most
relevant to designers

00:50:46.330 --> 00:50:48.060
working on Android applications.

00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.406
So I put up a few slides here.

00:50:50.406 --> 00:50:55.310
Three of my favorite
talks from Google I/O 2013

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.560
were this top row
of slides here.

00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.330
So that's talking about
Android's design principles.

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:03.364
The second one was talking
about Alex Faaborg again--

00:51:03.364 --> 00:51:04.780
That's a friend
of the show, shall

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:08.230
we say-- talking about how
cognitive science-- just

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:10.759
a fascinating talk, and
really one of those talks

00:51:10.759 --> 00:51:12.550
that gets in your head
and sticks with you,

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:14.185
and you kind of keep
thinking about it

00:51:14.185 --> 00:51:17.184
as you're working
on your design.

00:51:17.184 --> 00:51:18.600
And the third one
I've highlighted

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.905
there is Rich and Jens
again who did similar

00:51:21.905 --> 00:51:24.280
as we were just talking about
in the podcast [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.027
They kind of focus on the
process about going back

00:51:27.027 --> 00:51:29.610
to first principles and thinking
about your information model,

00:51:29.610 --> 00:51:33.340
and how you flesh it
out, and the process

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:35.550
of taking that and
turning it into use cases

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:38.330
then [INAUDIBLE] screen
design and so forth.

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:42.240
So those are some of
my favorite talks.

00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.870
I also [INAUDIBLE]
highlight that we

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.030
had a wonderful
session-- call it

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:48.980
kind of Android
Design Action Live.

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:53.580
Although we had some very,
very amazing TAs or helpers

00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.560
from the Android Design
Action community.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:56.985
So shout out to you guys.

00:51:56.985 --> 00:51:57.610
You're awesome.

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:00.575
Who came along and helped
us to run a session talking

00:52:00.575 --> 00:52:02.700
about the kind of things
we talk about on the show.

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:07.542
About how to take an idea, and
flesh it out into a [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:07.542 --> 00:52:09.640
model, and then
sketch, sketch, sketch,

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.032
to create interesting apps.

00:52:11.032 --> 00:52:12.240
And that was just phenomenal.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.198
We weren't quite sure
how it was going to work,

00:52:14.198 --> 00:52:16.850
but I was blown away with
the passion and the ideas

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:18.730
that people brought
to that session.

00:52:18.730 --> 00:52:20.315
That was really, really fun.

00:52:20.315 --> 00:52:22.160
Unfortunately not a
recorded show at I/O,

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.500
but maybe someday we
can do it again one day.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.110
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, for sure.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.776
We definitely have
to record an episode,

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:28.924
or record a session like that.

00:52:28.924 --> 00:52:30.590
And we do have all
the materials online,

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:35.000
so if you actually want to
run through the same problem

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:39.970
that we ran through, the
same question, the same task

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:42.577
we ran through, that material
is all available online.

00:52:42.577 --> 00:52:44.410
NICK BUTCHER: And the
last one I pulled out,

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:45.851
maybe it's more of a plug
because it was an Roman

00:52:45.851 --> 00:52:48.150
and I session where we
took off our designer hats,

00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:50.660
and put on our developer
hats, and instead

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:52.980
talked about how the
developers in the audience

00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:56.474
can actually go about
creating all these things.

00:52:56.474 --> 00:52:57.890
Rather than the
current principles

00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:59.764
and the visual design,
about how you actually

00:52:59.764 --> 00:53:03.754
go out implementing them, so
one for the developer audience.

00:53:03.754 --> 00:53:04.420
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:07.310
NICK BUTCHER: And lastly, I
think as Roman alluded to,

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:10.310
somehow our breakout
success of the year,

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:12.460
by view count at least.

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.076
In October, we did
a show recapping

00:53:15.076 --> 00:53:16.950
some of the more
interesting things in KitKat

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:19.270
for a design audience.

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:23.020
So some of the things that I've
highlighted here on this slide

00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:26.545
talking about the changes
to the different immersive

00:53:26.545 --> 00:53:28.990
or fullscreen modes
that you can use,

00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:30.830
including the
translucent bar mode

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:33.600
so where you can actually
draw behind some of the system

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.500
Chrome.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:38.300
And we talked about the
changes in branding,

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:43.160
about how KitKat has tried
to reduce the high contrast,

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:48.170
bringing attention to less
important things like touch

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:49.055
feedback.

00:53:49.055 --> 00:53:51.840
Instead just trying to make
those more subtle allowing you

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:55.650
more space to use color
for expressing things which

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:57.550
are important or
require emphasis, rather

00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:03.270
than the kind of highly jarring
responses to the gestures

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:04.760
and so on-- touches and so on.

00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:05.890
Sorry.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:10.120
We also covered some of the
newer documented patterns--

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:14.409
gestures, sorry-- which
have been codified, I guess,

00:54:14.409 --> 00:54:15.450
in the design guidelines.

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:18.400
The things like the double
touch drag which you'll find

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.815
is a great gesture for
like single-handed zooming.

00:54:20.815 --> 00:54:22.940
And you'll find it in things
like Chrome, and Maps,

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.345
and so forth.

00:54:24.345 --> 00:54:26.684
That's a great pattern--
gesture to look at.

00:54:26.684 --> 00:54:28.350
As well as, not really
a design feature,

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:30.350
but something that's
really worth being aware of

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:33.840
is the new ability
in KitKat to record,

00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:38.370
to grab videos from the device.

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:41.900
This is a great way to get
your developer to prototype

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:43.590
something, and
record a video of it,

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:46.090
and you can pass it around
to get feedback from people.

00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:48.131
It's a really handy tool
to have in your toolbox.

00:54:50.097 --> 00:54:52.430
ROMAN NURIK: So that's it for
"Android Design in Action"

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:53.640
in 2013.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.440
As you can see, we had quite a
long year-- 23 episodes was it?

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:01.380
We talked a lot about
some inspirational things.

00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.850
We went on quite
a few long rants,

00:55:04.850 --> 00:55:08.540
especially in that
Common UX Issues episode.

00:55:08.540 --> 00:55:11.110
We did a bunch of
redesigns and mock ups.

00:55:11.110 --> 00:55:14.570
And of course, we shared
some best practices,

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:16.980
some of the specifics on
how to use an action bar,

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.189
navigation drawer, and so on.

00:55:18.189 --> 00:55:20.396
NICK BUTCHER: It's really
fun, actually stepping back

00:55:20.396 --> 00:55:22.260
and looking at the
different things we did.

00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:24.560
So do let us know in the
comments, or on Google+,

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.970
or Twitter, or whatever, which
kind of aspects you enjoy,

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:31.180
[INAUDIBLE] or what you want
to see more of in the future.

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:32.930
MIKE DENNY: Yeah, and
if there's something

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:35.500
that we haven't done on the
show before that you think

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.890
would be cool, definitely let
us know in the comments as well.

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:40.840
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, we
have a bunch of ideas,

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:45.020
but we need even more ideas,
so definitely let us know.

00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:49.200
So with that, see you in
2014-- god, 2014 sounds

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.810
like such a weird thing, but
it's like, it's tomorrow.

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:52.910
It's not really tomorrow.

00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:53.280
It's just a few days away.

00:55:53.280 --> 00:55:54.050
MIKE DENNY: The future is now.

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:55.510
ROMAN NURIK: The future is now.

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:59.116
All right, with that, as always,
I'm your host, Roman Nurik.

00:55:59.116 --> 00:56:01.749
NICK BUTCHER: And bye
from me, Nick Butcher.

00:56:01.749 --> 00:56:03.040
MIKE DENNY: And I'm Mike Denny.

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:03.540
See you.

00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.810
ROMAN NURIK: See
you guys in 2014.
