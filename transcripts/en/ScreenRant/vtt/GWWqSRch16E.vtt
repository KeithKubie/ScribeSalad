00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.012
Marketing is one of the most important aspects
of a film.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:16.350
In the months leading up to its release, the
studio puts together trailers, posters, and

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.240
other materials to make the project appeal
to the widest audience possible.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.840
Even when a movie is a surefire hit at the
box office, stellar advertising can be the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.830
reason it goes on to break records instead
of just posting decent figures.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.571
There’s no denying that film marketing has
become an art form and can play a large role

00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:32.500
in how viewers perceive what’s coming through
the pipeline.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.050
Here are 10 of the greatest marketing campaigns
of all-time.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.280
Deadpool

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.160
Thought of as a risk by 20th Century Fox,
they finally rolled the dice on an R-rated

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.220
Deadpool film and it exceeded even the rosiest
expectations.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.120
A major assist has to be given to the film’s
marketing campaign, which remained true to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.590
the Deadpool character throughout.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.570
Ryan Reynolds was a willing participant in
several YouTube videos where he appeared in

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.200
character, and the trailers illustrated that
this wasn’t your typical superhero movie.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.489
Perfectly blending comedy and action, the
Deadpool campaign was hugely successful and

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.800
helped the film become the highest-grossing
R-rated film ever made.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.030
It kept going all the way through the Blu-ray
release, so Fox knew they had a winner.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.060
When Disney and Lucasfilm announced Star Wars
Episode 7 would hit theaters in 2015, it was

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.500
already a massive blockbuster.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.390
But once the Mouse House started revving up
the promotional campaign, anticipation and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.240
hype reached a fever pitch.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.000
The trailers smartly avoided any major plot
spoilers, and instead focused on the tone

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.310
and nostalgia for the brand.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.330
Not every film can boast that its previews
made fans tear up with joy.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.250
Add in events like Force Friday to celebrate
the arrival of tie-in merchandise, and it

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.860
was a magical time to follow the galaxy far,
far away.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.310
Everything paid off, as Force Awakens broke
just about ever box office mark.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.310
The Dark Knight

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.910
Christopher Nolan got people buzzing for his
Batman sequel in the final scene of Batman

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.890
Begins, revealing the Joker card.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.230
The ensuing marketing campaign for The Dark
Knight sent fans into a frenzy.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.079
Using viral marketing, a website for Harvey
Dent was launched, giving viewers their first

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.470
look at Heath Ledger’s Joker.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.380
Easter eggs at Comic-Con 2007 and even Dominos
Pizza provided fans with more reveals to drum

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.800
up the hype and anticipation.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.399
It all ended with people gathering in New
York and Chicago to watch a Bat signal light

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.100
up to celebrate the arrival of the film, which
earned unprecedented acclaim.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.780
Not to mention, the trailers were pretty great
too.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.780
Avatar

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.430
History has proven that you don’t underestimate
James Cameron.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.630
He clearly knows what he’s doing.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.610
The director held off releasing a trailer
for Avatar for as long as possible, unveiling

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.129
the first completed footage at a first-of-its-kind
special invite event where curious viewers

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.940
got treated to a sizzle reel of IMAX 3D footage
and merchandise.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.330
While this was happening, the standard trailer
and tie-in product information was released

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.690
to the general public, showing people what
the fan-favorite director had been working

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:37.770
on for years.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.590
Avatar was such a mystery at the time, that
only added to the appeal and made people want

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.910
to see what it was all about.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.280
Box office records and a Best Picture nomination
followed.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.280
Cloverfield

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.190
J.J. Abrams is known for his infamous mystery
box, where he keeps the twists and turns of

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.910
his latest project under wraps until the film’s
premiere.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.069
This arguably got started back on Cloverfield.

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.550
The first trailer for the creature feature
was a surprise attachment to the first Transformers

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.640
movie in 2007, telling moviegoers that if
they wanted more, they had to head to 1-18-08.com.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.959
The website told a story that ran parallel
to the film’s actual narrative, setting

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.050
the stage for the world without revealing
any crucial details.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.349
Abrams kept the focus on the monster instead
of the characters to manage expectations and

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.560
Cloverfield became a hit.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.900
The Blair Witch Project

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.150
Back before found footage movies became popular,
the style was very convincing.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.629
Some viewers actually believed they were watching
a real documentary.

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.250
The Blair Witch Project maintained this illusion
all the way to the film’s premiere.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.140
Website blairwitch.com spoke of a legend that
only “grew” as new “information” was

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.920
added from a variety of sources.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.489
The actors didn’t do any publicity, and
the IMDb page listed them as “missing, presumed

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.030
dead” to draw audiences in.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.260
By the time the movie premiered, everyone
wanted to see what it was about, and Blair

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.950
Witch turned a $20,000 budget into $258 million
worldwide.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.910
The campaign was so good and of its time,
it can never be replicated.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.910
Ex Machina

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.220
When working with a smaller film, studios
have to get creative to raise awareness.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.459
For Ex Machina, viewers were targeted in a
very personal way: on their phones.

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.769
During the SXSW film festival in 2015, users
of the Tinder app were approached by a woman

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.819
asking deep existential questions about love
and what it means to be human.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.299
After engaging in a brief conversation, the
girl would send people a link to an Instagram

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.200
page, which included the poster and trailer
for Ex Machina.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.040
It was a sneaky bit of promotion and probably
rubbed some singles the wrong way, but the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.930
sci-fi film found a following and launched
that Tinder girl – Alicia Vikander – to

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.930
stardom.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.000
The Social Network

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.880
For casual audiences, it was hard to see how
a film about Facebook’s origins could make

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.340
for compelling cinema.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.449
Even with David Fincher at the helm, it seemed
too tough a premise to sell.

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.030
But after the teaser trailer, the doubters
were silenced.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.770
Set to a haunting cover of Radiohead’s Creep,
the preview illustrated that there was much

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.290
more to the site’s beginnings than anyone
could have envisioned.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.970
It made a strong impression, as did the tagline
“You don’t get to 500 million friends

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.720
without making a few enemies.”

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.960
Not only was The Social Network one of the
most acclaimed films of 2010, it performed

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.300
very well at the box office, meaning the campaign
worked at highlighting the intrigue.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.500
Guardians of the Galaxy

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.690
Marvel Studios had an up-and-down year in
2013 with the lukewarm reactions to Iron Man

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.760
3 and Thor: The Dark World.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.300
They needed to mix things up to reinvigorate
the brand, and the Guardians of the Galaxy

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.360
were the answer.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.780
Taking characters even the most devout comics
reader was unaware of and turning them into

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.460
movie stars is no easy task, but a catchy
soundtrack and trailers showcasing pulpy space

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.020
opera thrills were more than enough to get
the job done.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.590
It was apparent this would be different than
any previous Marvel movie, which was a welcomed

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.590
development.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.000
The Guardians are now just as marketable as
their Avengers counterparts, which was unthinkable

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
only a few years ago.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.650
Those are our picks for the best movie marketing
campaigns.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.650
Are there any we missed?

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.110
Which ones sold you on a film?
