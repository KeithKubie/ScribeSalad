00:00:08.062 --> 00:00:09.270
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.080
Welcome to Talks at Google
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.540
Today it's my great pleasure
to introduce Richard Thaler.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.420
Don't get too comfortable while
you're enjoying your lunch,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.880
because Dr. Thaler is here
today to change the way you

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.290
think about economics.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.490
In his newest book,
"Misbehaving: The Making

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.540
of Behavioral
Economics," he shows we

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.730
wacky humans don't,
in fact, make the kind

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.980
of rational decisions that
traditional economics has

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.010
assumed in creating its models.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.890
At first, these deviations
from the assumed norm

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.000
were dismissed, but
now our miscalculations

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.530
and their effects are the
subject of serious study.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.340
The book couples
recent discoveries

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.010
in psychology with a practical
understanding of incentives

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.410
and market behavior
to tell us how

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.540
to make smarter decisions in
an increasingly complex world.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.510
Richard Thaler is an American
economist and the Ralph

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.595
and Dorothea Keller
Distinguished Service Professor

00:01:11.595 --> 00:01:14.010
of Behavioral
Science and Economics

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.970
at the University of Chicago
Booth School of Business.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.120
He is the co-author of the
bestselling book "Nudge"

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.030
with Cass R. Sunstein and
the author of "Quasi-Rational

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.480
Economics and the
Winner's Curse."

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.958
Please join me in
welcoming Richard Thaler.

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:32.826
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.200
RICHARD THALER: OK.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.310
Thank you very
much for having me.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.270
The title I've chosen
for the talk today

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.970
is "The Behavioralizing
of Economics:

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.670
Why Did it Take So Long?"

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.520
And this will give
you a little taste

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.930
of what the book is about.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.430
So it seems reasonable to
start with a definition of what

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.670
is behavioral economics.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:09.940
And as one of my predecessors,
Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.460
wrote this-- the phrase
"behavioral economics" appears

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.291
to be a pleonasm.

00:02:16.291 --> 00:02:21.100
A free book to anyone who
knows what that word means.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.970
It's a redundant phrase.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.720
And so Simon is
right, that it does

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.220
seem to be a redundant phrase.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.690
Why do we need the
adjective "behavioral?"

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.440
What other kind of
economics could there be?

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.590
And then he answers
his own question.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.110
The answer lies in the
specific assumptions

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.700
about human behavior
that are made

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.460
in neoclassical economic theory.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.970
So that theory is
based on the assumption

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.960
that agents in the
economy optimize.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.980
They choose the best
thing all the time.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.650
Is that accurate?

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.660
So the idea is that economists
think that the world is

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.644
populated by people like Spock.

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:07.310
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.017
-My choice will
be a logical one.

00:03:09.017 --> 00:03:09.600
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.470
Cold-hearted,
rationalizing optimizers.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.310
And I entertain the
possibility that there

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.499
are some Homer Simpsons around.

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:19.165
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:19.905
-Woo-hoo!

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:20.488
[END PLAYBACK]

00:03:20.488 --> 00:03:21.780
So how do they differ?

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.980
The people that populate
economic models I call econs.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.740
And they're perfect calculators,
rational expectations.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.590
They have no
self-control problems.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.370
They never are on a
diet, because they

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.650
eat just the right amount.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.320
They never have
hangovers, because they

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.510
drink the right amount.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.800
And they're complete jerks.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:59.440
Humans are dumber,
weaker willed, and nicer.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.020
Here's an illustration of
the fact that they're nicer.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.070
This is a picture
I took in Ithaca,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.680
where I lived for many
years teaching at Cornell.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.230
A farmer puts this stand up.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.430
This time of year, he
was selling rhubarb.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.500
And it's an honor box.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.190
You put in your money,
and you take your rhubarb.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.960
Notice there's a box here,
and it's got a lock on it.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.660
And I think the farmer
has just the right model

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.850
of human nature, which is
there are enough honest people

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.390
that it's worthwhile for him
to put the corn or rhubarb out

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.140
there and enough people will
put money in the box for him

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.240
to be willing to do that.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.700
But if he left all the
money out on a plate,

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.890
somebody would steal it.

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.620
When I first started teaching,
I had the following problem.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:10.840
I gave an exam, and the
students got mad at me.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.760
And the reason they got mad
at me was the average grade

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.690
on the exam was 72.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.490
These were Cornell
MBA students, so they

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.510
were top students
from top universities,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.730
not used to getting
grades like 72.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.170
And I told them, look, what
difference does it make?

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.850
We grade on a curve here.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.230
The curve was some
inflated thing.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.270
And so it really doesn't
matter what that number is.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.540
But they were still mad at
me, so I had to figure out

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.420
a way of solving that problem.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:52.210
So the next exam I gave,
I made out of 137 points.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.840
And the average grade on that
was-- it was a harder exam.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.560
The average was 70%.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.250
But that computed to 96,
and they were delighted.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.390
And in fact, some people
got scores over 100,

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.520
and they were in ecstasy.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:20.030
So this is an illustration
of what I call

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.920
supposedly irrelevant factor.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.260
So economists disagree
about all kinds of things,

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.110
like whether we
should fix the economy

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.130
by having the government
spend more or less.

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.070
It would seem to be pretty
basic that we could get that one

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.790
right, but you can
find economists

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.630
arguing on both sides of that.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.280
But one thing economists
all believe in

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.720
is that there's some stuff
that just doesn't matter.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.780
So for example, the number of
points available on the exam

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.750
should not matter.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:04.320
And there are lots
of other things.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.610
Some costs shouldn't matter.

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.720
How much you paid
for some dessert

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:13.440
shouldn't influence
how much of it

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:18.342
you will eat if you're already
full and it's very fattening.

00:07:18.342 --> 00:07:22.540
But if you're human, then the
more you paid for that dessert,

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.740
the worse you feel
about not eating it.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.010
So I started collecting examples
of supposedly irrelevant

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:37.800
factors, but economists were
not impressed with these.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.320
And they had a long
list of excuses

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:44.720
why these things don't matter.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.950
And let's talk
about some of those.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:53.200
So an early one came from
the famous Chicago school

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.740
economist Milton Friedman.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.450
And it has just a
two-word-- as if.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.210
And in fact,
economists can dismiss

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.760
an argument with the wave of
a hand and the phrase "as if."

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.830
And so what does as if means?

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:12.810
It means we don't
care whether people

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.710
can't compute these things
that you assume they can do.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:23.500
All we care about is whether
they behave as if they could.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:29.140
And so the fact that people
are incapable of figuring out

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.200
how much they need to
save for retirement

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.570
doesn't matter as long as
they behave as if they can.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:44.640
And this was taken to-- this was
a winning argument for 30 years

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.190
until two psychologists named
Daniel Kahneman and Amos

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.000
Tversky came along.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.010
And they had an
insight, which was

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:59.120
that there are predictable
circumstances where people

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.150
make predictable mistakes.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.180
So for example, they coined
the term "the availability

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.560
heuristic," which is when
people judge frequency

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.770
by ease of recall.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:17.810
And that's typically
a good idea.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.120
Things are usually more
frequent if you can think

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.490
of lots of examples of them.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.690
John is a common name, and you
know lots of people named John,

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.070
but it sometimes
can lead you astray.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:34.650
So for example,
people think there

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.890
are more homicides than suicides
when, in fact, there are

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.250
about twice as many suicides.

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.620
But homicides get more press,
and so they're more available.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.390
And so we make a mistake.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:52.600
And this example illustrates
a simple refutation

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.350
of the as if argument, or
the more general argument

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.000
that we don't care
whether people

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.770
make mistakes, because
if they cancel out,

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.810
we'll still be right.

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.619
And the point is,
they don't cancel out,

00:10:06.619 --> 00:10:08.035
because the errors
are systematic.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.950
Another argument I
got for many years

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:18.520
is, OK, you run some
experiment, and people screw up,

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.730
but if we get the
stakes high enough,

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:25.250
then people will get it right.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.540
And another argument
I would hear-- often

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:33.750
from the same person-- would
be, and in your experiment,

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.200
there's no real
opportunity to learn.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.000
So I ask you the homicide
suicide question once,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.100
and you get it wrong.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:46.630
But if I asked you 100 times and
presumably told you the answer,

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.700
then you'd get it right.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.900
So I'd hear these two arguments.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:55.490
And in fact, once
at a conference,

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.125
I was hearing both of
those from an economist

00:10:58.125 --> 00:11:00.020
called Ken Binmore.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.620
And it caused me to
create what I now

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.400
call the Binmore
continuum, which

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:12.820
is-- think about the frequency
with which you buy stuff.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.570
So there's some stuff
like milk that you

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:20.380
buy almost every time you
go to the grocery store.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:26.840
Then suits-- maybe once a year.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.220
More often, I guess, if you
have to wear them often.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:37.890
Houses, maybe once a decade.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:45.570
Marriages-- most people no more
than two or three per lifetime.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.180
Saving for retirement--
most of us only

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:52.410
get to do that once
barring reincarnation.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.610
So notice as we're
raising the stakes,

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:00.710
we're reducing the number
of times you get to do it.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.750
So in fact, there's
simply no reason

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.860
to think that when
the stakes go up,

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.210
people are going to get it right
more often, because they've

00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:15.900
had no opportunity to learn.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.950
Another argument I would
hear is, well, look,

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.110
if the stakes are
high enough, people

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.850
will hire some
expert to help them.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:30.030
But here are three examples
of high stakes decisions.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.990
Do we really think experts
are jumping in and helping

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:38.120
people make great decisions?

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.040
I don't think so.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.790
The whole financial
crisis really

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:50.770
was caused by-- it started at
the bottom of mortgage brokers

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.210
who were being paid for
each mortgage they issued,

00:12:54.210 --> 00:13:00.390
and they didn't care whether the
borrower was capable of paying

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.190
the mortgage back.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:08.340
And he wasn't really giving
the borrower very good advice.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:12.660
And all the way up the
chain, that worked.

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.080
Marriage is a pretty
important financial decision.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.290
Hardly anybody goes
to an expert for that.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:22.330
And across the board,
there's simply no evidence

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:27.040
that as we raise the
stakes, people do better.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:34.080
So let me hide that for a
minute and just tell you

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:42.410
a story about a dinner
I had with Amos Tversky,

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:45.050
one of the two
psychologists I mentioned,

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:49.859
and a guy who was
a colleague of mine

00:13:49.859 --> 00:13:51.650
for a while at the
University of Rochester,

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.505
and then later moved to the
Harvard Business School--

00:13:54.505 --> 00:13:57.260
a guy called Michael Jensen.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:02.520
And Jensen, at that time, was
a hardcore rational economist

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.100
and hardcore believer
in the efficient market

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.550
hypothesis in finance.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.560
And Amos decided at that dinner
to have some fun with him.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:15.520
And so Amos started
out by asking

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:20.320
Jensen to describe the
decision making of his wife.

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:27.130
And Mike regaled us with stories
of his wife's pathetic decision

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:28.250
making.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:33.790
And then Amos moved on
to members of Congress,

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:38.050
his dean, his students.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:42.740
And basically, anybody
Amos could name,

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:47.230
Jensen thought were
economic dolts.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:52.330
And then Amos pulls the rug
out from under him and says,

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.060
so Mike, here's the
thing I don't get.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.990
Everybody you know
you think is an idiot,

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:02.110
but the agents in your
models are geniuses.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.975
What gives?

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:12.220
And Mike was nonplussed
by this question.

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:17.550
And he said in a kind of
condescending manner, Amos,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.640
Amos, you just don't understand.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.067
Now, Amos Tversky is
probably the smartest person

00:15:23.067 --> 00:15:23.650
I've ever met.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.530
There's hardly anything he
didn't understand or couldn't

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:29.380
understand.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:34.060
So what is it that Jensen
thought he didn't understand?

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.580
He didn't understand markets.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:43.030
And Jensen launched
into what, in the book,

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:46.995
I call the invisible hand wave.

00:15:46.995 --> 00:15:50.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.915
Here's the way the invisible
hand wave argument goes.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:05.020
Yeah, in your laboratories,
people misbehave,

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:10.030
but in markets-- and
then it's my claim

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:14.610
that no one has been able
to finish that sentence

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:18.090
with both hands still.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.770
It's simply not
possible to do it.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:28.010
So what exactly is
going to happen?

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:32.085
Suppose that I choose
the wrong career.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.710
I probably did
becoming an economist.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:43.180
And what can you do about it?

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.610
You can't short my career.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:51.570
If I married the wrong spouse,
you can't short our marriage.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.690
And if I don't save
enough for retirement,

00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:06.170
then you can't short my
rounds of golf when I retire.

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.390
So there's no way,
really, for the market

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:15.030
to correct the decisions
that you make on your own.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:21.010
But for many economists, this
invisible hand wave argument

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.170
was quite compelling.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:31.410
And so I would say we
were stalled at some point

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:41.460
and needed to go out and collect
data in markets where people

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:46.940
are misbehaving and try to show
that meaningful stuff is going

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.810
on.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:53.340
So the line in bold is
really the key point,

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.830
which is it's much
easier to make

00:17:56.830 --> 00:18:02.540
money catering to
people's foibles

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:06.150
than it is in educating them.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:13.630
So the last I looked, $27
billion of extended warranties

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.580
were purchased.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:23.460
That's almost always a
mistake for anything small.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.060
So people are making $27
billion selling those.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.540
No one is making any
money convincing people

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.997
not to buy extended warranties.

00:18:32.997 --> 00:18:34.330
I've been saying that for years.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:38.030
I haven't made a
nickel off of that.

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:44.720
So here's another kind
of dismissive argument.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.100
There was an article written
about me in the Chicago Alumni

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:49.470
Magazine.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:53.510
And in good University
of Chicago style,

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.610
they go talk to my
colleague, Gary Becker,

00:18:56.610 --> 00:19:02.420
whose views on this are
approximately mine multiplied

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.870
by minus 1.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:09.820
And he said about
behavioral economics,

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:14.230
"the division of labor strongly
attenuates, if not eliminates,

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:17.390
any effects caused by
bounded rationality.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:19.670
It doesn't matter
if 90% of the people

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:22.500
can't do the complex
analysis required

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.790
to calculate probabilities.

00:19:24.790 --> 00:19:28.290
The 10% of people who can
will end up in the jobs

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.810
where that's required."

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.395
So I call this the
Becker Conjecture.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.450
And basically, he's
saying, don't worry

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.810
about what Thaler is saying.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.570
In places where
it matters, people

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.660
will be good at this stuff.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.790
So one of my students
and I decided

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:52.490
to investigate this
hypothesis in a high stakes

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:56.630
situation-- namely, the
National Football League.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:01.710
And I think we'd all
agree this is high stakes.

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.520
The owners are billionaires.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.060
In fact, they have
a spare billion,

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:10.950
which is approximately the cost
of buying the cheapest team.

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:15.960
And they have payrolls, their
players, over $130 million

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.750
a year.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:21.400
So I think we'd all agree
this is high stakes.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.810
Do things work there in the
way they're supposed to,

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:28.230
or can we find misbehaving?

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:34.710
And the market we chose to study
is the market for draft picks.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:38.630
So as I'm sure most
of you know, teams

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:44.010
pick players in an annual
draft in which the worst

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.650
team last year
gets the first pick

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:50.150
and the winner of the Super
Bowl gets the last pick,

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:54.580
and then they repeat
that for seven rounds.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.570
And there's a market for picks.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.730
And we estimated the
price for those picks.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:05.930
And you can see, we estimate
it with great precision.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.884
I'll show you why in a minute.

00:21:08.884 --> 00:21:10.800
But the first thing to
notice about this curve

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.730
is that it's really steep.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.700
It says that the value
of the first pick

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.710
is worth about five
times the value

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.520
of the first pick
in the second round.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:29.870
So our question is,
is that correct?

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:32.560
Is that market rational?

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.970
If you know some
finance, it's like asking

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:39.070
when Black and Scholes
invented the option pricing

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:45.120
model, if they had made a math
error, what would've happened?

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.781
So if you've ever
played with data,

00:21:47.781 --> 00:21:50.220
you know life
doesn't normally look

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.930
like this with a curve that
fits the data almost perfectly.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.920
We thought maybe we had
discovered Newton's fifth law

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.850
or something like that.

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:03.730
But instead, what
we had discovered

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.210
is something that,
in the league,

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.770
they referred to as the chart.

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:15.980
Somebody at the Dallas Cowboys
about 25 years ago-- the coach

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.580
there at the time,
Jimmy Johnson,

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.490
said, can you tell me what
various picks should be worth

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:26.860
so when people ask us to make
trades, we know what to do?

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:34.050
And he drew that
curve by free hand,

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.800
and then translated it
into a numerical table.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.280
And that chart circulated
around the league,

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:44.670
and now all the teams use it.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:50.120
So including this year, if you
looked at any of the trades,

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:53.700
they're almost dead on
the numbers in this chart.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.750
So the first pick
is worth $3,000,

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:03.350
and it says that you could get
the seventh and eighth picks

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:10.920
for the first pick, or you
could get-- this is the-- well,

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.440
we can look up-- the
33rd pick is $580,

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.790
so you can get five or six
of those for the first pick.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:21.510
So is that rational?

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:25.810
Well, I won't go through
the whole analysis we did.

00:23:25.810 --> 00:23:35.290
But we calculated the value to
the team of each player picked

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:37.590
over a 12-year period.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.110
And that's this top curve.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:44.020
And you can see
they know something,

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.180
meaning that the
value of the players

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:52.080
declines as the draft goes on.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.920
The first round players
are, on average,

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:57.290
better than second round
players, and so forth.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:01.610
This line is how much you
have to pay those guys.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:04.850
Now, what is the value
of a player to the team?

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:08.720
It's the difference
between those.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.340
It's what you get minus
what you have to pay.

00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:18.460
That's this line, which, you
may notice, is sloping up.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.426
Let me reproduce
that curve here.

00:24:22.426 --> 00:24:26.280
And in the bottom half,
I have the first graph

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:31.290
I showed you, which is
the market value of picks.

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:34.860
The top line is what
they're really worth.

00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:38.340
So remember, you can trade
this first pick for five

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:41.210
of these guys, each
of which are worth

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.320
more than the pick you gave up.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.970
This is major league
misbehaving for high stakes,

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:55.780
for people who should supposedly
should be in Becker's 10%

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.760
of people who get it.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.580
The biggest stakes market
is the financial market.

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.610
And it's kind of
surprisingly the place

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:09.890
where behavioral economics
has had its biggest impact.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.830
And in 1980, no one would
have predicted that.

00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:16.840
In fact, Michael
Jensen, the same guy

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.860
who I told the story
about with Amos diversity,

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.850
wrote a sentence saying the
efficient market hypothesis

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.340
is the best-established
fact in social science.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.960
Now, there are two aspects
of the efficient market

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.010
hypothesis.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:36.660
One is what I call the no
free lunch component, which

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.310
says you can't beat the market.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:46.410
And you can't predict the future
from the past, for example.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:51.570
That component of the efficient
market hypothesis, I say,

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.070
is approximately true.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.890
I say approximately.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:00.080
I'm a partner in a
money management firm

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.280
that actively tries
to beat the market.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:07.250
And so far, we can, but not
by a lot, and not every year.

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.950
So it's approximately true.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.190
It's hard to beat the market.

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.870
The other part of
the hypothesis--

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:17.630
the more important part-- is the
assertion that prices-- I call

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.600
it the Price is Right
Component-- that prices

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.220
are equal to intrinsic value.

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:30.200
So the market value of
Google is what it should be.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:34.750
Now, for many years,
efficient market advocates

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.630
had the comfortable
illusion that this part

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:42.230
of the hypothesis
was untestable.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:46.140
There's nothing better in a
hypothesis than an inability

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.860
to test it.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:54.231
And who can know, after all,
what the market value of Google

00:26:54.231 --> 00:26:54.730
is?

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.200
Nobody can prove that
it's right or wrong.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.930
So for a long time,
that part was not

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:06.900
really considered testable.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.260
But we found ways.

00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:17.920
So let me give you one
example, a recent example.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.990
There's a mutual fund, a
closed-end mutual fund,

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:26.150
which means they sell an
initial number of shares,

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:29.330
and then the shares are
traded on the market,

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.080
so you have to go buy
shares on the market

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.990
rather than sending
money to the fund, which

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:40.490
means that the price can differ
from the value of the assets

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:44.040
that it holds, which
is already embarrassing

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.810
to efficient market advocates.

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:53.670
So one such fund happens to
have the ticker symbol CUBA.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:58.180
Now, needless to say, it
has exactly zero investments

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.686
in Cuba.

00:27:59.686 --> 00:28:04.730
It's not legal for
Americans to invest in Cuba.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:06.590
And frankly, there
wouldn't really

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:09.580
be anything to invest
in even if you could.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.870
Now, let me show you a graph.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:18.750
The day that President
Obama announced

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:23.970
that he was going to
relax relations with Cuba,

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:30.660
the fund went from a 15%
discount to a 70% premium,

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:35.930
which means you have to pay $170
to get $100 worth of assets,

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:40.470
whereas you used to be
able to get it for $85.

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:45.480
Now, I can't tell you
what the right price

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:48.230
of the assets the
fund owns is, but I

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.500
can tell you you
shouldn't be paying

00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:55.010
$170 for $100 worth
of those assets.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.030
And whatever those
assets are worth,

00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:01.850
they were unaffected by
what the President did.

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.920
It's another supposedly
irrelevant fact.

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.880
We've seen lots of
examples on a larger

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:16.300
scale of apparent violations
of this component-- the crash

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.660
in 1987 when prices
fell by 20% on a day

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:25.350
with no news, the tech bubble
in the '90s, the real estate

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:28.640
bubble in the 2000s.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:32.370
Fischer Black-- one of the
inventors of the Black Scholes

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:36.660
formula-- in a
paper wrote that he

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.630
thinks markets are
efficient, meaning prices

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:43.910
are right within
a factor of two.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:47.725
I think had he lived long
enough to see the tech bubble,

00:29:47.725 --> 00:29:50.910
he would have realized
that to three,

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:55.650
since the NASDAQ went
from 5,000 to 1,400.

00:29:55.650 --> 00:30:00.280
And I don't think we would
want to call that efficient.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.000
If cars were priced right
within a factor of three,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.620
I don't think we would call
that an efficient market.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:15.640
So where do I think the
field of economics is going?

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.660
I'm calling for something
that I cheekily refer

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.280
to as evidence-based economics.

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:26.100
And again, you might ask
what other kind of economics

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:27.700
there might be.

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.180
And the answer is
fiction-based economics.

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:38.030
Because economic theory is a
theory of fictional creatures.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:41.180
It might as well be
a theory of unicorns.

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:45.430
Econs don't exist, so
theories based on econs

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.900
are fictional theories.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:52.980
And what we need is theories
that are based on humans.

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:57.180
So let me-- I'll
conclude with this

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.360
and allow you to just read it.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.000
It's the closing
sentences of my book.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.808
And I'll take whatever
questions you have.

00:31:09.808 --> 00:31:12.273
AUDIENCE: So
traditional economics

00:31:12.273 --> 00:31:14.245
uses mathematical models a lot.

00:31:14.245 --> 00:31:16.381
Mathematical models
naturally need

00:31:16.381 --> 00:31:21.620
to make simplifying assumptions,
like all math models do.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.140
And they can get a
lot of neat stuff

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.850
by being able to run
around with formulas.

00:31:26.850 --> 00:31:28.530
If you take away
that simplification,

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.130
you've obviously beaten
up on that simplification

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.180
of the rational actor.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.275
Can you get to a simple
enough model to have any math?

00:31:36.275 --> 00:31:37.150
RICHARD THALER: Yeah.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:45.670
So you've put your finger
on-- look, economics--

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.905
and I talk about
this at some length

00:31:47.905 --> 00:31:54.220
in the book-- economics was
behavioral until about 1940.

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.660
Adam Smith was a
behavioral economist.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.870
John Maynard Keynes was a
great behavioral economist.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:05.700
It has nothing to
do with whether we

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:07.040
should have deficit spending.

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.060
Just read his chapter
on financial markets.

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.930
It's a brilliant bit of
behavioral economics.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:18.380
Then in the '40s and '50s,
the mathematical revolution

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.060
started.

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:26.400
And you're right that--
the reason why economics

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.150
got more and more
rational is because

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:33.950
of the bounded
rationality of economists.

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:39.350
So the easiest models to write
down are of people optimizing.

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:41.860
Because if you took
high school calculus,

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.910
you know how to take a
derivative, set it equal to 0,

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:47.980
and solve.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.610
So that's optimizing.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:54.140
If people are
human and emotional

00:32:54.140 --> 00:33:00.520
and pay attention to
supposedly irrelevant factors,

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.605
then that simple
model will be false.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:11.561
Now, can you build formal models
that capture actual behavior?

00:33:11.561 --> 00:33:12.060
Yes.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:18.540
One example is a
theory of decision

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:23.590
making under uncertainty
called prospect theory that

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:28.590
was developed Khaneman
and Tversky in 1979.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.470
It's a much better
description of how

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.510
people make choices in
uncertain situations

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:38.770
than the previous theory,
expected utility theory.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:47.180
And there are other-- so the
new wave of behavioral economics

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:52.760
includes theorists writing
down mathematical models that

00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.820
try to capture some
aspect of truth.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:01.560
What we don't have and will
never have, in my opinion,

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.750
is a new overarching theory.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:09.230
If you want one
parsimonious theory,

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:11.449
stick with the one we have.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:12.270
It's just wrong.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:22.429
But we need to have
those theories.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:26.380
I couldn't do behavioral
finance without efficient market

00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:27.694
hypothesis as a benchmark.

00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:34.040
And there's nothing wrong
with writing down those models

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.940
unless you start to
think they're true.

00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:41.330
And so one of the reasons
we got into trouble,

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:45.800
into the financial crisis, is
that people like Alan Greenspan

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:50.179
believed the efficient market
hypothesis, and didn't think

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:52.449
there could be a
real estate bubble,

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:58.300
and didn't think that banks
would give loans to people who

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.460
couldn't pay the money back.

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.675
And he gave a famous
mea culpa speech

00:35:02.675 --> 00:35:08.760
where he admitted this much,
but it came a little late.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.660
Yeah, right here.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:13.276
AUDIENCE: My question of the
efficient market hypothesis

00:35:13.276 --> 00:35:17.580
was that it was about
efficiency of finding

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.033
the true price of things.

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:20.940
Is that roughly right?

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.380
RICHARD THALER: Well, as I
say, it has two components.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.010
One is the price is
right, and the other

00:35:26.010 --> 00:35:28.770
is that prices
are unpredictable.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:32.430
AUDIENCE: And so on
that price is right,

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:36.370
I've had the impression
it was inherently wrong,

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:40.210
because in most big
financial transactions

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.370
I've been involved with,
everybody else is lying

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.400
or concealing information.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.020
You're buying the
house, and the person

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.310
you're buying it from
carefully doesn't tell you

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:53.710
that they think the roof really
needs replacing, et cetera.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.110
RICHARD THALER: Well,
so in financial markets,

00:35:56.110 --> 00:35:58.390
the invisible hand wave
is like a windmill.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.510
Now, a part of that is deserved.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:10.580
So if you're buying
a house and you

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:13.670
buy a house with a
leaky roof, there's

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:18.820
no trade I can make
to exploit that.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:27.770
I could try to sell you my
house, but otherwise-- now,

00:36:27.770 --> 00:36:31.260
in financial
markets, presumably,

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:37.830
if stuff is going wrong-- so
when tech prices were soaring

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:43.710
in the '90s and companies were
selling for 100 times sales

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:48.620
because there were no profits,
so we couldn't compute price

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:55.310
earnings ratios-- we had to do
price sales ratios-- you could

00:36:55.310 --> 00:36:58.010
short the NASDAQ.

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:06.560
But people started worrying that
NASDAQ was overvalued in 1996.

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:10.070
And if you shorted
the NASDAQ in '96,

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:13.600
you were broke before
you were right.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:20.310
So financial markets are more
efficient than the markets

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:24.560
for houses and cars, but
still not perfectly efficient

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.769
for reasons I go into in
some length in the book.

00:37:28.769 --> 00:37:31.310
AUDIENCE: So maybe this is what
you're already saying, but is

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:33.797
it simply that you can't
predict when people are going

00:37:33.797 --> 00:37:36.130
to stop being wrong, and so
it doesn't matter if they're

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.720
wrong as long as they stay
wrong longer than you can afford

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.335
to disagree with them?

00:37:40.335 --> 00:37:41.210
RICHARD THALER: Yeah.

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.460
I once-- yes.

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:48.140
So I once had a conversation
with George Soros,

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.120
the famous hedge fund investor.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.810
And this was sometime
during the late '90s.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:58.590
And I asked him whether he
would ever consider just

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:04.800
shorting the S&amp;P 500,
because it certainly

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:10.590
looked to him and to me
like it was too high.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:17.140
And he speaks and
writes cryptically.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.920
And his answer was
much in character.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:25.350
He said that, well,
you can bet on prices

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.945
returning to intrinsic value,
but you'll die of boredom.

00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:35.700
And so that's the
fundamental problem,

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.540
that we can see--
I remember having

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:43.140
a discussion with my brother,
who lives in Scottsdale,

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:47.340
and he had just bought his
third property in Scottsdale.

00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:56.240
And I said, diversification,
have you heard of that concept?

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:58.340
You now have three
pieces of property

00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:00.620
within four square miles.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:05.430
It seems like you have all
your eggs in one basket.

00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:12.710
And he said to me-- and I'm
quoting him precisely-- no,

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:15.890
you don't understand.

00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:20.440
Real estate prices in
Scottsdale never go down.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:26.750
Now, if I could have-- if there
was a broker I could call,

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:31.690
short Scottsdale, I
would have done it.

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:37.550
But Bob Schiller, my fellow
behavioral economist,

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:41.720
tried to create such markets.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:45.020
And there wasn't enough volume.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.540
It turned out that that
effort was unsuccessful.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:53.320
But as a result, there's no way
to short a frothy real estate

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:53.820
market.

00:39:53.820 --> 00:40:00.380
So many people-- certainly Bob
Schiller was pointing-- well,

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.490
I could have tried
to show you a graph.

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:14.420
But if you plot real estate
prices from 1950 to 2000,

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:19.430
they're going up on a log scale
like it's a straight line,

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:21.470
1% to 2% a year.

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:27.340
And it's tracking 20
times rental price.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:33.230
And then it just shoots
off into Never Never Land.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:37.480
And in places like Vegas and
Scottsdale and South Florida,

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.620
it really just shot off.

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:44.140
And you had to either think
this time, it's different,

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:49.410
the world has changed, or
jeez, this looks like a bubble.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:51.300
But if you think
it's a bubble, it's

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.400
really hard to take
advantage of it,

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:57.760
and it's really hard to know
when it's going to break.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:03.240
And if you read Michael
Lewis's book "The Big Short,"

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:07.200
there are guys there
who had figured it out,

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:11.610
and they came very
close to going broke

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:13.910
before they were right.

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:18.520
And it was a matter
of a month or two.

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.380
And that's the
essential problem,

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.740
and that's why we
can have bubbles.

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:30.650
And many people think that
there are very frothy aspects

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:32.100
of the tech market now.

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:41.220
But if you think-- well,
Uber isn't listed yet.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:44.190
But if it were
listed, and you don't

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:50.160
think it's worth $40 or $50
billion, and you sell it short,

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:52.160
you better be right
soon, because you

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.000
start getting margin calls.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.630
A mic to the
gentleman in the back.

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.730
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about your NFL study.

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:05.270
RICHARD THALER:
Finally, football.

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:06.870
AUDIENCE: Football, yes.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:09.700
I can see how compensation
is directly observable,

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:14.140
but how did you estimate
the value of the draft pick?

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.390
Because it seems like there
lies a lot of assumptions.

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:22.340
RICHARD THALER: We
had performance data.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:28.010
For the graph I showed you,
we used pretty crude data,

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:29.575
like games started.

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:37.250
And we did that so we
could cover all positions.

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:44.820
But if you
replicated-- actually,

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:49.280
Nate Silver was with me at my
event last night in New York,

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:54.150
and he was telling me that
he had replicated our study

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:58.590
for quarterbacks using
the most sophisticated

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:02.060
new analytical measures
of quarterback ability.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:06.150
And the result was
an exact replication,

00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:09.370
which he thought was
too boring to publish.

00:43:09.370 --> 00:43:13.660
I almost hit him on
the spot, and I'm

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.740
going to have a stern
talking to him later.

00:43:21.210 --> 00:43:26.000
So we can measure--
in the places

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.520
where we can
measure performance,

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:31.804
we replicated it for wide
receivers, and it works.

00:43:31.804 --> 00:43:32.470
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:34.333
I'm familiar with the work of
Football Outsiders and places

00:43:34.333 --> 00:43:36.020
like that in
translating draft picks

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:37.896
to performance measures,
football performance

00:43:37.896 --> 00:43:38.728
in various measures.

00:43:38.728 --> 00:43:41.400
But you still then have to make
the translation to financials.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.275
RICHARD THALER: Yeah.

00:43:42.275 --> 00:43:45.090
So what you do is you
look at how much you

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:50.540
have to pay free agents
that are of similar quality,

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:54.280
and then we assume that
market is efficient,

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:56.990
which could be wrong.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:03.040
So the way it works
is-- take RG3.

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:07.820
So his first year, he was
an all-star quarterback.

00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:13.180
And we look, how much do
all-star quarterbacks in years

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:15.970
six through eight
of their contract--

00:44:15.970 --> 00:44:17.720
how much do you
have to pay them.

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:22.600
Then his second year, he's hurt,
so he's a reserve quarterback.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:25.890
Well, that's, say,
worth $4 million.

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:27.340
So we do that for every player.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:39.600
There are details in the
book and in the paper

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:43.235
on which that chapter is based,
which is available online.

00:44:43.235 --> 00:44:45.235
Go to my personal website
and you can find them.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:49.730
Any other questions?

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:50.230
Yeah.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:56.540
AUDIENCE: I have two, so
I'll pick one arbitrarily.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.260
I have an economist
professor friend

00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.820
who often likes to say that
if you don't have a model,

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:03.550
there's no point to
looking at something,

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.050
because you may
observe differences,

00:45:05.050 --> 00:45:06.675
but you won't learn
anything unless you

00:45:06.675 --> 00:45:11.149
can compare it to a model that
you think models something.

00:45:11.149 --> 00:45:12.940
RICHARD THALER: That's
a very popular thing

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:13.910
for economists to say.

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:15.535
AUDIENCE: I've read
that a lot, so I've

00:45:15.535 --> 00:45:17.440
seen that a lot of
economists believe that.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.640
But this as if
idea that you gave

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.680
seems to be the
opposite of that.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:25.210
It seems to say, who cares
whether the model represents

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:26.010
anything at all.

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:29.390
All that matters is
whether you see something.

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:30.460
RICHARD THALER: Right.

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:39.330
So I think that
models can hide a lot.

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:48.070
And I think the idea that
you can't learn anything

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:51.590
without a model is preposterous.

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:56.590
So there's no model
in our football paper.

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:58.460
But look at those graphs.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:01.890
They tell a pretty
powerful story.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:07.240
And there is an
underlying model,

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.680
which is that prices are
equal to intrinsic value.

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.520
And in order to get
the paper published,

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:16.049
we put in some Greek symbols.

00:46:16.049 --> 00:46:18.090
AUDIENCE: But what I wonder
is how do you think--

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.366
RICHARD THALER: But they
were completely unnecessary.

00:46:20.366 --> 00:46:22.240
AUDIENCE: How do you
think economists squared

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:23.940
these two ideas
that seemed to be

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:26.400
both popular and contradictory?

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.290
RICHARD THALER:
You use whichever

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:32.495
one comes in handy at the time.

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:39.800
That may sound
unnecessarily cynical,

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.670
but I don't think I
have a better answer.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.090
Maybe ask your other question.

00:46:44.090 --> 00:46:46.540
AUDIENCE: My other
question is this price

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:50.120
is right idea-- or the
price is wrong-- seems

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.180
to assume there is an
actual objective price

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.530
hiding under there somewhere,
whether people are getting

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:55.470
it right or wrong.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:57.220
And I wonder what
you think of the idea

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:01.750
that there may not be the,
that the right price is just

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:03.190
defined by whatever
people happen

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.550
to think it is right now.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:07.480
RICHARD THALER: Well, so
that's the view people had

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.790
when they thought they
could hide behind the idea

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:14.660
that they had a hypothesis
you couldn't test.

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:22.930
So one of the papers I
wrote was on an episode

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:29.930
during the tech bubble in
which the company 3Com happened

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:34.750
to be the owner of Palm.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:40.680
And somebody already knows
the punchline of this story.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:44.100
So Palm-- you will
remember if you're

00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:49.390
old enough-- a Palm
Pilot was about the size

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:51.610
of a deck of cards.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:56.400
And as far as I could tell,
it could keep your contacts

00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:03.660
and also serve as a calculator
and maybe a calendar.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.540
But it was considered
pretty sexy.

00:48:06.540 --> 00:48:13.480
And eventually, they had a phone
that was the first smartphone.

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:19.690
Anyway, 3Com owned Palm,
but 3Com was not sexy.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.310
And their stock price
was flat in a period

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:26.760
when any decent technology
company was going up 20%

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:28.040
a month.

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:33.810
And so they decided to
carve out Palm and make it

00:48:33.810 --> 00:48:35.850
a separate company.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:40.820
And so they did that, and
they had an IPO for Palm.

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:45.220
But they kept-- they only
sold 5% of the shares of Palm.

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:50.300
They kept 95%
within the company.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:56.230
And then the Palm IPO
happened, and Palm-- anything

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:59.090
that looked sexy at that time
sold for a ridiculous prize.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:04.540
But here's an equation.

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.850
I'm going to give
you an equation.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:15.320
3Com shareholders each
got 1.5 shares of Palm.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:19.150
Therefore, the
price of 3Com-- it's

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.970
an inequality, actually,
not an equation.

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:29.730
The price of 3Com must
be greater than 1.5 Palm,

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:36.240
because companies can't
be worth negative amounts.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:45.050
But the day of the Palm IPO--
if you computed the stub value

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:50.870
of 3Com, meaning its price
less its interest in Palm,

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:52.910
it was minus $23 billion.

00:49:55.700 --> 00:50:00.020
Now, that's wrong.

00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:02.880
That's really, really wrong.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:08.170
And I talk about in the
book-- when my co-author and I

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:11.130
presented this paper at
the University or Chicago,

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:15.710
we ended up getting into
a discussion of icebergs.

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:20.860
And my friend Gene Fama, who's
an efficient market advocate,

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:28.030
said look, these
are trivial examples

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:33.350
that you're showing us.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:38.530
OK, so this is wrong, but the
rest of the market is fine.

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:43.950
And I was saying, no, this is
just the tip of the iceberg.

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:50.030
And I've studied a bunch of
these, like the Cuba example.

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:55.220
And I call them the
fruit flies of finance.

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.950
Fruit flies are not a
particularly important species

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:01.300
in the grand scheme
of things, but they've

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.730
been incredibly
useful in genetics.

00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:08.540
And these special cases,
like closed end mutual funds,

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:12.310
and Palm and 3Com,
are where we can say

00:51:12.310 --> 00:51:15.020
for sure the price is wrong.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.990
And so the debate turned.

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:22.080
Gene was saying that this
was the whole iceberg,

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.510
and I was saying it was
the tip of the iceberg.

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:29.750
And it's a discussion we
continue to have to this day.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.050
I think our time is up.

00:51:36.050 --> 00:51:37.380
Thank you very much.

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.730
