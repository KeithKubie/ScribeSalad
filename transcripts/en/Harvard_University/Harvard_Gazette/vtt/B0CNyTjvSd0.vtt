00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.700
I started getting interested in science
actually when I was really little. I

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.929
liked to play this game with my parents
where I'd ask them a question, something

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.220
like, why is the grass green? And they
give me an answer and then I would ask

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.900
them, why? And they would give me an
answer and I'd ask them, okay why? I kept

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.360
wanting to dig down into exactly what it
was, you know, really figure out the

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.130
answer to my question on the most minute
level and so I think that science really

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.250
complements that and has a lot to do
with that, you know, you're never

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.040
satisfied with the answers you get, every
answer leads to more questions. In the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.940
class that I'm taking right now, there's
quite a few women faculty members,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.950
there's a good ratio of female students
to male students, in the class so that's

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.620
been really great, there's definitely
been a lot of really great mentors and a

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.400
lot of really inspirational peers that
I've met as well.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.380
I think in the future

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.400
what I would love to be doing is in vitro fertilization and IVF, screen for

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.250
different genetic diseases or
potentially cure some of those genetic

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.500
diseases in embryos and improve people's
lives that way.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.720
Whatever I do, if I do

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.540
decide to become a doctor, for example, I
know that because I got that

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.479
well-rounded education and that liberal
arts kind of point of view, I will be

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.980
better at doing whatever I end up doing
because I studied science at Harvard.
