00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.830
imagines it an elaborate revenge fantasy
you know that also involves him

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840
you know that also involves him
 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.480
you know that also involves him
improving himself and so that's his

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:43.490
improving himself and so that's his
 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.340
improving himself and so that's his

that's his vision of the future is that
 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.130
that's his vision of the future is that
you know technology will will save him

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140
you know technology will will save him
 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.810
you know technology will will save him
and somehow make him more powerful yeah

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820
and somehow make him more powerful yeah
 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.360

with everybody else yeah and there were
 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.240
with everybody else yeah and there were
definitely times particularly in my

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250
definitely times particularly in my
 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.710
definitely times particularly in my
early teens where you know I felt I felt

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720
early teens where you know I felt I felt
 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.010
early teens where you know I felt I felt
like that not necessarily that I was

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020
like that not necessarily that I was
 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.200
like that not necessarily that I was
going to build and command a robot army

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210
going to build and command a robot army
 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.460
going to build and command a robot army
but you know just the promise of the

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470
but you know just the promise of the
 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.910
but you know just the promise of the
promise of technology you know is

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920
promise of technology you know is
 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.030
promise of technology you know is
frequently about evening evening the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040
frequently about evening evening the
 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.390
frequently about evening evening the

everyone the way that they they haven't

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500
everyone the way that they they haven't
 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.719
everyone the way that they they haven't
been so I think the best the best kind

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729
been so I think the best the best kind
 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.810
been so I think the best the best kind
of you know my favorite kind of futurist

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820
of you know my favorite kind of futurist
 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.550
of you know my favorite kind of futurist
thinking is that kind of futurist

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560
thinking is that kind of futurist
 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.410
thinking is that kind of futurist
thinking so yeah you know I may I am a

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420
thinking so yeah you know I may I am a
 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.370
thinking so yeah you know I may I am a
fan of technology and science and I know

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380
fan of technology and science and I know
 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.550
fan of technology and science and I know
there are you know people there are a

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560
there are you know people there are a
 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.410
there are you know people there are a
lot of people who don't feel that way

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420
lot of people who don't feel that way
 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.219
lot of people who don't feel that way
who fear technology in progress and you

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229
who fear technology in progress and you
 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.390
who fear technology in progress and you
know they don't necessarily have to be

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400
know they don't necessarily have to be
 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.160
know they don't necessarily have to be
Luddites to be that way you know they

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170
Luddites to be that way you know they
 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.660
Luddites to be that way you know they
may use cell phones and and computers

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670
may use cell phones and and computers
 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.880
may use cell phones and and computers
but at the same time they feel like

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890
but at the same time they feel like
 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.739
but at the same time they feel like
technology is you know a Pandora's box

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:11.749
technology is you know a Pandora's box
 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.470
technology is you know a Pandora's box
that has been opened and and all of the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480
that has been opened and and all of the
 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.330
that has been opened and and all of the
ills of the world are gradually

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340
ills of the world are gradually
 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.699
ills of the world are gradually
you know destroying our society and

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709
you know destroying our society and
 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.320
you know destroying our society and
tearing us apart and isolating us and

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330
tearing us apart and isolating us and
 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.930
tearing us apart and isolating us and
destroying the planet and you know maybe

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940
destroying the planet and you know maybe
 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.240
destroying the planet and you know maybe
they're right but I kind of think that

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250
they're right but I kind of think that
 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.740
they're right but I kind of think that
if you look at progress in particular

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750
if you look at progress in particular
 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.890
if you look at progress in particular
technological progress if you take any

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900
technological progress if you take any
 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.320
technological progress if you take any
sort of rational long view of what has

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330
sort of rational long view of what has
 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.750
sort of rational long view of what has
happened so far you would have to come

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760
happened so far you would have to come
 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.380
happened so far you would have to come
away with the opinion that overall it's

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390
away with the opinion that overall it's
 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.350
away with the opinion that overall it's
been good for humans here on earth and

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360
been good for humans here on earth and
 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.759
been good for humans here on earth and
you know I fully expect that that trend

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769
you know I fully expect that that trend
 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.289
you know I fully expect that that trend
will continue and certainly there are a

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299
will continue and certainly there are a
 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.780
will continue and certainly there are a
lot of challenges you know there are

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790
lot of challenges you know there are
 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.150
lot of challenges you know there are
millions of gallons of crude oil pouring

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160
millions of gallons of crude oil pouring
 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.949
millions of gallons of crude oil pouring
into the ocean right now and that's a

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959
into the ocean right now and that's a
 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.380
into the ocean right now and that's a
terrible thing and it's a terrible side

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390
terrible thing and it's a terrible side
 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.030
terrible thing and it's a terrible side
effect of our technological footprint on

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040
effect of our technological footprint on
 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.289
effect of our technological footprint on
this planet but you know I believe that

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299
this planet but you know I believe that
 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.160
this planet but you know I believe that
we can face these challenges and and I

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170
we can face these challenges and and I
 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.020
we can face these challenges and and I
believe we can solve these problems and

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030
believe we can solve these problems and
 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.190
believe we can solve these problems and
I think with I think that we will

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200
I think with I think that we will
 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.199
I think with I think that we will
because that's what it's sort of what

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209
because that's what it's sort of what
 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.130
because that's what it's sort of what

and that he had heard of it and had an

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510
and that he had heard of it and had an
 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.390
and that he had heard of it and had an
opinion of it you know yeah I would like

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400
opinion of it you know yeah I would like
 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.630

to say to him is I apologize that I got
 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.470
to say to him is I apologize that I got
the math wrong I have been informed by

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480
the math wrong I have been informed by
 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.280
the math wrong I have been informed by
numerous mathematicians both expert and

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290
numerous mathematicians both expert and
 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.710
numerous mathematicians both expert and
armchair that I am actually describing a

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720
armchair that I am actually describing a
 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.559
armchair that I am actually describing a
Julia set and not the Mandelbrot set I

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569
Julia set and not the Mandelbrot set I
 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.860
Julia set and not the Mandelbrot set I
still don't exactly understand the

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870
still don't exactly understand the
 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.390
still don't exactly understand the
difference so I apologize for acting as
