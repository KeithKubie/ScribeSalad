00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.989
So now as you might have guessed I've graphed the lines y equals x plus 10 over

00:00:04.989 --> 00:00:09.834
the quantity x plus 2 times the quantity x minus 2, and of course our x axis.

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:14.824
What are we interested in finding now? Well because we have a less than 0 here

00:00:14.824 --> 00:00:19.784
we want to see where the pink curve lies below the purple curve or below the X

00:00:19.784 --> 00:00:24.689
axis. This region down here, this sort of upside down u definitely does. And as

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.434
you would expect, the x values here lie between negative 2 and 2, although this

00:00:29.434 --> 00:00:34.224
curve will never actually have points with either of these two x values. We'll

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:39.002
talk about that more in a few lessons. Get excited, it's pretty cool stuff. For

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:43.150
the other part of our solution Where x lies between negative infinity and

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.190
negative ten. We once again, have a bit of a hard time telling that the curve

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.158
drops below the x axis here. But of course, you could plug in values for x that

00:00:51.158 --> 00:00:55.210
are less than negative ten, and test this out yourself. I think this is pretty

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.642
cool though. You can use multiple graphs to demonstrate the same solution sets.

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:03.344
And we can see how 2 inequalities look completely different, or at least pretty

00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:05.718
different to me, yield the exact same solutions.
