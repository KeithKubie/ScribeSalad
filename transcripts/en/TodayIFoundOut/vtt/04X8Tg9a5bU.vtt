00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:19.570
The Female Pirate Whose Armada Took on the
Chinese, British, and Portuguese Navies and

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.970
Won

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.790
While female pirates weren’t uncommon off
the coast of Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.330
one woman stood above them all.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.500
Her birth name isn’t known, but this Cantonese
pirate went by the name Ching Shih (also,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.840
by Zhèng Yi Sao, “wife of Zhèng”, and
Zhèng Shì, “widow of Zhèng”.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.710
For the purpose of this article, I’ll just
refer to her as Ching Shih to avoid any confusion.)

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.540
Ching Shih was born sometime around 1775 (the
exact date isn’t known).

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.800
At the age of 26, she found herself working
as a prostitute in a floating brothel in Canton.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.600
While there, she caught the eye of Zhèng
Yi, already a successful pirate with a small

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.670
fleet of ships at his command, known as the
“Red Flag Fleet”.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.480
Exactly how the two ended up together is disputed.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.220
Some historians hold that Zhèng Yi sent a
raid to plunder the brothel and asked his

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.581
men to bring back his favorite prostitute,
Ching Shih, for his portion of the loot, while

00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:13.110
others claim he simply went there himself
and proposed that they wed, which she only

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.220
agreed to after he consented to give her equal
share of his plunder and to allow her to help

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.890
run the organization.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.900
Whatever the case, once married, Ching Shih
did indeed begin helping Zhèng Yi run the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.280
Red Flag Fleet.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.131
During the next six years, their fleet grew
initially from about 200 ships to 600 with

00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:34.090
some key alliances, including forming the
Cantonese Pirate Coalition with pirate Wu

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.160
Shi’er, and then to 1700-1800 ships by 1807,
as more and more pirates flocked to their

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160
banner.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.549
Unfortunately for Zhèng Yi, on November 16,
1807, he found himself caught in a typhoon

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.230
and didn’t manage to survive the ordeal.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.549
Rather than step aside, handing over the organization
to someone else, Ching Shih convinced Zhèng

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.190
Yi’s second in command, 21 year old Chang
Pao, to support her in taking over the Red

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.190
Flag Fleet.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.420
Chang Pao was the son of a fisherman and had
actually been captured by Zhèng Yi when Chang

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.220
Pao was just 15.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.460
He was then forced into the life of a pirate.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.690
He quickly gained favor in the eyes of Zhèng
Yi due to his intelligence, bravery, and skill

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.770
in a fight and was adopted by the pirate captain
and Ching Shih as a son and made second in

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.020
command of the fleet.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.030
With Chang Pao leading their troops in raids
and the like, Ching Shih focused on the “business”

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.370
side of things, continuing to plan military
strategy and also to govern and grow the organization

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.870
into something that went beyond just partnered
pillaging pirates.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.650
At the Red Flag Fleet’s peak in 1810, she
commanded about 1800 ships, both big and small;

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.030
70,000-80,000 pirates (about 17,000 male pirates
directly under her control, the rest being

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.370
other pirate groups who agreed to work with
her group, then female pirates, children,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.410
spies, farmers enlisted to supply food, etc.);
controlled nearly the entire Guangdong province

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.210
directly; held a vast spy network within the
Qing Dynasty; and dominated the South Chinese

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.210
Sea.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.220
She didn’t just rely on looting, blackmailing,
and extortion to support her troops either.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.879
She setup an ad hoc government to support
her pirates including establishing laws and

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:08.879
taxes.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.879
Because she controlled pretty much the entire
criminal element in the South Chinese Sea,

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.930
she also was able to guarantee safe passage
through it to any merchants who wanted to

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.930
pay.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.970
Of course, if they didn’t pay, they were
fair game for her pirates.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.330
In order to manage her ruffians and get them
all to do what she said without question,

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.390
she setup a strict system of law within the
Red Flag Fleet which basically equated to,

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.050
“You don’t follow the rules or I think
you aren’t and you get your head chopped

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.050
off.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.050
No exceptions.”

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.400
Specific laws included:

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.270
If you disobey an order, you get your head
chopped off and body thrown in the ocean.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.569
If you steal anything from the common plunder
before it has been divvied up, you get your

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.080
head chopped off and body thrown in the ocean.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.599
If you rape anyone without permission from
the leader of your squadron, you get your

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.239
head chopped off and your body thrown in the
ocean.

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.810
If you have consensual sex with anyone while
on duty, you get your head chopped off and

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.409
your body thrown in the ocean and the woman
involved would get something heavy strapped

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.720
to her and also tossed in the ocean.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.420
If you loot a town or ship of anything at
all or otherwise harass them when they have

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.670
paid tribute, you get your head chopped off
and your body thrown into the ocean.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.920
If you take shore-leave without permission,
you get your head chopped off and body thrown

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.920
into the ocean.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.959
If you try to leave the organization, you
get your head… ha, just kidding, in this

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.539
case you get your ears chopped off.

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.889
Captured ugly women were to be set free unharmed.

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.599
Captured pretty women could be divvied up
or purchased by members of the Red Flag Fleet.

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:34.020
However, if a pirate was awarded or purchased
a pretty woman, he was then considered married

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.460
to her and was expected to treat her accordingly.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.620
If he didn’t, he gets his head cut off and
body thrown in the ocean.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.710
She didn’t just restrict herself to sea
battles either.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.389
She used her numerous shallow-bottomed boats
to good advantage along rivers to raid towns

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.500
along the way, including defeating any armies
that came against her.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.409
For instance, two towns once banded together,
raised an army, and sent it against her forces.

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.300
The Red Flag Fleet won the battle and she
subsequently marched her army to the two towns

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.099
and ransacked them, including beheading every
male found there.

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:05.639
Now, a pirate controlling a large portion
of the Emperor’s land and subjects didn’t

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.939
sit well with him.

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:10.729
As such, he raised a fleet of ships to attack
Ching Shih’s fleet.

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.300
Unfortunately for him, Ching Shih was also
a brilliant military strategist and rather

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.650
than running from the Emperor’s armada,
she sailed out to meet it with her fleet,

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.869
which defeated the armada quite easily.

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:26.720
Not only this, but she managed to steal 63
of the large ships sent against her and convinced

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.830
most of the surviving crews to join her…
by letting them choose between being nailed

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.620
to the deck by their feet and then beaten
to death or becoming members of the Red Flag

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.360
Fleet and celebrating the victory with the
rest of the pirates.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.050
Needless to say, she found herself with plenty
of replacements for the pirates she’d lost

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.419
in the battle.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.990
As for the Admiral of the fleet sent against
her, Kwo Lang, he committed suicide before

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.930
he could be captured by Ching Shih.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.300
The attacks on her fleet didn’t stop there.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.000
However, now without a fleet large enough
to take her on alone, the Qing Dynasty government

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.030
enlisted the aid of the super-power British
and Portuguese navies, as well as many Dutch

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.270
ships, paying them large sums for their help.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.780
These combined forces waged war on Ching Shih’s
organization for two years with little success.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.589
She won battle after battle until finally
the Emperor decided to take a different tack.

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:17.619
Instead of trying to defeat her, he offered
her and most of her organization amnesty.

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:20.710
Ching Shih initially rejected the terms of
the amnesty treaty.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.389
However, in 1810 she unexpectedly showed up
at the home of the Governor General of Canton

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:28.190
with the intention of working out a peace
treaty.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.979
The deal that she struck was that the fleet
would disband, including giving up most of

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.419
their ships, and in return, they would nearly
all be granted amnesty and allowed to keep

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.539
any loot they had acquired during their time
as pirates.

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:46.569
The exceptions were 376 of her crew of which
126 were executed and the other 250 received

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:49.000
some punishment or other for their crimes.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.260
All the rest got off scot-free and as part
of the agreement any who wanted it were to

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.300
be allowed to join the military, including
her second in command and now husband, Chang

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.300
Pao.

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.770
He was given command of 20 ships in the Qing
Dynasty navy to command.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.639
Ching Shih was also given money to distribute
to her crew to help offset the cost of them

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:07.880
switching from a life at sea, to one in the
mainland.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.659
As for Ching Shih herself, she negotiated
the rights to keep the fortune she’d accumulated

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:16.619
and acquired a noble title, “Lady by Imperial
Decree”, which entitled her to various legal

00:07:16.619 --> 00:07:19.039
protections as a member of the aristocracy.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:22.439
She then retired at the age of 35, opening
a gambling house/brothel in Guangzhou, Canton,

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:25.429
which she managed until her death at the age
of 69.

00:07:25.429 --> 00:07:28.819
During this time, she also became a mother
to at least one son and a grandmother.

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:32.919
One can only imagine the bedtime stories she
told her son and grandchildren.

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:38.520
So not only was she arguably the most successful
pirate of all time, but unlike pretty much

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.240
every other famous pirate in history, she
also managed to escape being executed or punished

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.479
in any way for her crimes and retired extremely
wealthy and a member of the aristocracy.

00:07:48.479 --> 00:08:22.009
The Dread Pirate Roberts has nothing 

00:08:22.009 --> 00:10:48.939
on her.
