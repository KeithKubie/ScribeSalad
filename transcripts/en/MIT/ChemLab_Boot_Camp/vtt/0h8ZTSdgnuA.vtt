00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.680
NARRATOR: MIT was founded just
a few years before Canada,

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.520
just a few miles from the
birthplace of the American

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.710
Revolution.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.140
And that revolutionary spirit
still haunts this place.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.040
From the transistor radio
to computer networks to

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.470
pharmaceuticals the stuff that
gets dreamed up, built, and

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.510
tested here affects millions.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.100
But MIT's geniuses all have
to somewhere, as freshmen.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.350
Freshmen like--

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.610
Every January, the chemistry
department runs a four-week

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.530
lab class for freshmen.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.790
The class is called 5.301,
and it teaches practical

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.560
techniques that chemists
use every day.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.870
DR. JOHN DOLHUN:
Recrystallization to

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.770
distillation to column
chromatography, protein

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.720
assays, and it ends with a
research project, where the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.670
students actually synthesize a
penicillin derivative and test

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.480
it on live bacteria.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.360
NARRATOR: And those who
pass get a UROP.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.380
ANU: A UROP stands for
undergraduate research

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.080
opportunities program, and
it lets you do real

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.930
research in a lab.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.010
KATHERINE: It's a great
opportunity for people to get

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.030
experience in a lab, figure out
if research is right for

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.380
them, and get publications
on your resume.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.830
NARRATOR: This year, 5.301
has 14 students.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.680
Let's meet a few of them.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.630
ANTHONY: My family basically
consists of my mother and my

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.200
sister and now my nephew.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.840
ANTHONY'S NEPHEW: M, I, T.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.420
ANTHONY: Yay!

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.050
I'm the first, actually, in my
family to go to college.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.990
My mom is the best person
in the world.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.370
When I go home at night and call
her and tell her what I

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.410
did in lab, she's always like,
oh, that's interesting.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.465
I think I saw that
in CSI one day.

00:02:07.465 --> 00:02:08.630
I'm in the logs.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.050
We run around like crazy men
on Valentine's Day and

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.885
interrupt classes and
sing to people.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:18.360
I'm either Course 5 or Course
10-- for non-MIT, either

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.980
chemistry or chemical
engineering.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.150
If I enjoy being in lab, then
Course 5 is probably a really

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.440
good choice.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.710
EMILY: If you want to, you could
definitely just lock

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.845
yourself in your room and
study all the time.

00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:30.830
I just wanted to show
you guys my room.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.820
Here I have a bunch of formulas
for derivatives,

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.240
integration by parts, common
polyatomic ions, your basic

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.490
kinematic equations
for physics.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.740
So it's kind of up to you
if you want to go

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.520
out there and explore.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.950
In high school, I was on the
varsity tennis team, so I

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.470
definitely try to do
a lot of that here.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.690
I'm taking a taekwondo class,
which should be interesting.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.570
I'm thinking Course 5, which
is chemistry, or Course 10,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.600
which is chemical engineering.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.800
ETHAN: I do love science, but I
also have that soft spot for

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.960
Robert Frost and Walt Whitman.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.040
Instead of writing a
valedictorian speech in high

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.230
school, I actually just wrote
a poem that they published,

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.900
because I guess I do sort of
like poems more than speeches.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.120
But since my parents want me to
come out of college and be

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.740
able to get a job, they
decided that I

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.890
will be doing sciences.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.080
And I'm completely
cool with that.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.060
I am the student manager for the
basketball team, so I go

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.620
to all the practices
and the games.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.760
I feel that's a really
cool way to relax, I

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.680
guess, after class.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.510
LINA: I've always been into
the secret tunnels thing.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.060
Now we're down in the tunnels,
the famous MIT tunnels.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.180
I love playing pranks.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.180
I used to play pranks on my
high school teachers.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.820
Well, my chemistry teacher, back
in high school, he was

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.440
really known for giving a lot
of lab reports and grading

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.530
them pretty harshly.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.600
So I got my entire AP classes to
give me their lab reports.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.480
We took the front covers of all
these lab reports, and we

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.930
just wallpapered his entire
wall with them.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.980
I hope that 5.301 will help me
want to do more research.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.060
IKE: Hey.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.110
What's up, what's up?

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.380
This is Ike, AKA,
Smooth Scholar.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.740
Ravens fan-- we're going to win
the Superbowl this year.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:13.940
So watch out.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.450
This is my first time in lab.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.680
Don't feel intimidated, because
you're going to come

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.649
across people who have taken
crazy classes in

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:23.365
high school, you know?

00:04:23.365 --> 00:04:25.960
And some of you probably have
never even taken calculus

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.230
before, like me.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.220
You're still here, right?

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.520
You still made it, so
it still counts.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.790
That's it for now.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.430
NARRATOR: Everyone's excited
to get started.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.850
YI-SHIUAN: I haven't had that
much lab experience.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.080
HANSOL: I haven't worked in a
music lab-- just high school.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.370
JULIE: I haven't done any
research yet in a lab.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.550
JASON: I'm actually
pretty excited.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.300
LEALIA: I'm excited.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.380
DAN: I'm really excited.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.560
YI-SHIUAN: Definitely excited.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.213
JULIE: Really eager to get into
the lab and get hands on

00:04:50.213 --> 00:04:50.940
right away.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.330
DAN: I can't wait
to get started.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.770
NARRATOR: But they have no
idea what they're in for.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:28.960
