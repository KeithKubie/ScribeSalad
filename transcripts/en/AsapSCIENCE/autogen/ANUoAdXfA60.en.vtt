00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.819
 An opportunity to be you or someone you know vegetarians - has made us think of making an intellectual experience. 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.300
 What would happen if everyone in the world became vegetarians? 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.010
 What impact will this have on our lives and the planet? 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.619
 Before we begin, we fully declare: None of the vegetarian AsapSCIENCE 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.640
 The global rate of vegetarians is slim, ranging from 4-5% in the US and Canada 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.769
 And just over 30% in India. As a result, there are about 20 billion chickens, 1.5 billion cows and over one billion sheep 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.039
 And about one billion pigs in the world. 

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:39.079
 Without humans eating meat to form a market, whole herds of domestic animals 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:39.989
 It will disappear 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.670
 This Massiverg large tracts of land. About 33 million square kilometers 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.629
 Of the land used for grazing - an area the size of the continent of Africa. 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.289
 This does not even include agricultural land designated for animal feed crops. 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.690
 Some of them will be used to increase vegetable crops, but most of the land is currently used as pasture 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.189
 Are actually drier than grow crops. Without the addition of humans to industrial fertilizers, these lands 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.920
 May become a deserts, but if managed properly, agricultural land may revert to its natural state of 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.880
 Pastures and forests, which will help to overcome global climate change 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.320
 In the end, remove the trees consumed for carbon dioxide from the atmosphere for planting 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.100
 Was the main cause of high levels of carbon dioxide in the world. 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.610
 Cows and other herbivores also affect the climate by producing amounts of methane, 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.799
 Which has a 25 times greater capacity than carbon dioxide to heat the planet. In addition to loss 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.469
 Forests and other impacts, livestock production accounts for 15% of emissions 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.549
 Global warming, more than the combined aircraft, trains and cars of the world combined. 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.289
 In fact, many scientists believe that reducing meat consumption may be one of the best strategies 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.119
 Effective management of climate change. 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.710
 The plant diet will also reduce water consumption by about 70% of the world's drinking water 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.020
 Consumed in agriculture. It takes 15,000 liters of water to produce a kilogram of beef 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.920
 6000 liters of pork, and 4000 liters of chicken meat compared this to 1600 liters of grain crops 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.709
 900 liters for fruits and 600 liters for garden vegetables. Patakid, a kilogram of meat is rich 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.260
 With lots of calories to meet the weight of the fruit, but even if compared to the proportion of water 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.690
 For calorie calories from available food energy, beef is still 5 times thick with water 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.090
 More fruits, 7 times thicker vegetables and 20 times thicker grains 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.260
 If there are any defects in the plant diet? Well we will leave without a cheap source 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.150
 For many animal products such as animal skins or grease 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.250
 Which are used in the manufacture of cosmetics, candles and detergents. While the plant alternatives 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.730
 Exist, but their production has to be increased, which means more land to be used for crop production 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.980
 And change them from their nature. 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.860
 The more complex truth is that raising and caring for animals is a full-time job 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.730
 To more than a billion people - mostly small farmers in developing countries 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.470
 Some may move to produce milk, eggs or even vegetable crops 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.549
 But many of them will face a life-changing life 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.680
 Of course, any attempt to increase vegetarian thought will be more gradual than a categorical shift. 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.000
 Surprisingly, trends actually go in the opposite direction 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.010
 In places like India and China, people have become richer than before, and as a result, they are consuming more meat 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.959
 Eliminating the declines in other countries 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.000
 So, we tried to become vegetarians for 21 consecutive days as a kind of experiment 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.299
 In our class AsapTHOUGHT. Watch the section if you want to see how it went, and teach us 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.159
 Of experience and how we felt about it.
