00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.260
We're on problem 195 and they
have drawn a little

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.230
bit of a grid here.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.510
Let me try to draw it as well.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.646
1, 2, 3.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.300
And then they do this in
the other direction.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.050
1, 2, 3.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.900
And they call this
First Street.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.660
And there's actually 4
going that direction.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.350
Let me draw that one.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.390
So, there's another
street like that.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.710
And they call this First Street,
Second Street, Third

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.340
Street, Fourth Street.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.200
And Avenue A, B, and C.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.140
And they say that this point
right here-- I'll do that in a

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.450
different color.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.690
That point right there
is x, and that point

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.830
right there is y.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.590
Pat will walk from intersection
x to intersection

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.970
y along a route that is confined
to the square grid of

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.320
4 streets and 3 avenues
shown on the map.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.150
How many routes from x to y
can Pat take that have the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.450
minimum possible length?

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.120
So essentially the minimum
possible length so he doesn't

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.930
waste time.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.550
So let's think about
it this way.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.920
So he could go this way-- so we
could think about how many

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.580
different ways can you get to
each point on this graph.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.720
So to get there, there's
one way.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.250
One possible way.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.595
To get there-- this seems to be
a very similar problem to

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:32.390
what I saw on a Computer
Science exam a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.280
long, long time ago.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.170
But there's one way
to get there.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.300
That's obvious.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.500
So, how many ways are
there to get here?

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.780
Well, you can view it as-- well,
to go from this path to

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.170
this path and this path to this
path, you can sum the two

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.050
ways to get there.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.900
So it's 2.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.480
Which makes sense.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.170
You could go like that or
you could go like that.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.560
How many ways are there
to go here?

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.950
Well, there's only one
way to go here.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.720
Likewise only one
way to go here.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.400
Now this is where it
gets interesting.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.229
How many ways are there
to go here?

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.770
I can either come from there,
and there's only one way to

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.890
get there, so that's one path.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.790
Or I could come from here.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.800
But there's two ways
to get here.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.180
So there's two ways to get
here via this path, and

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.020
there's one way to get
here via this path.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.110
So there are three
ways to get here.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.750
So essentially I just added
the one and the two.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.360
You think of the same
logic here.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.920
How many ways are there
to get there?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.620
Well, I can come via this path,
and that'll be-- there's

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.720
only one way to get here so
there's only one way to get

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.130
from this direction.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.130
Or I could come from this
direction, but there's two

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.910
ways to get here.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.240
So there's two ways to come
from this direction.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.200
So, there's three ways to
get from that direction.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.720
If you use the same logic,
there's one way to get here.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.930
You just go straight up.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.470
How many ways are there
to get here?

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.960
Well, one way to get there,
three ways to get there, so

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.460
there are four ways to get
here because you can go

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.200
through that one way or through
these three ways.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.130
So how many ways are
there to get here?

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.890
You go three ways to there,
three ways to there, and I can

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.420
come from either here or here.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.400
So there are six ways.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.960
So, how many ways to get to y?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.040
Four ways to get here, six ways
to get here, 6 plus 4.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.650
Ten ways to get here.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.660
I could either come from one
of the six ways from this

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.510
direction, or one of the four
ways from this direction.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.980
So ten ways.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.710
And that is choice C.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.720
Next problem.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.220
196.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.070
The ratio, by volume, of soap
to alcohol to water in a

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:52.850
certain solution is
equal to 2:50:100.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.940
The solution will be altered so
that the ratio of soap to

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.750
alcohol is doubled,
while the ratio of

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.243
soap to water is halved.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:30.010
If the altered solution will
contain 100 cubic centimeters

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.950
of alcohol, how many cubic
centimeters of

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.710
water will it contain?

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.260
So, let's think about what
the new ratio is.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:56.100
The old ratio of soap
to alcohol was 2:50.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.390
Now they want to double
this ratio.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:03.360
So the new ratio of soap to
alcohol is going to be 4:50.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.650
Fair enough.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:12.110
Now the old ratio of soap
to water was 2:100.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.500
Now what's the new ratio
of soap to water?

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.540
It's going to be halved.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.040
So, that equals soap to water.

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.580
We want to half this ratio, so
now the new ratio of soap to

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.770
water is 1:100.

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.120
So let's see how we can
think about it.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.000
Let's try this as a ratio
of 4 to something.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.700
So that's the same.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:41.330
1:100 is the same
thing as 4:400.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.010
So, let's see if we can
rewrite these ratios.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:51.050
So the ratio of soap to alcohol
to water now becomes

00:05:51.050 --> 00:06:01.260
4:50 and the ratio of soap
to water is 4:400.

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.160
So, they give us alcohol and
they want to figure out water.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:14.370
So the ratio of alcohol to
water is equal to 50:400.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.070
And that's another way
of saying 1:8.

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.720
Alcohol to water is
equal to 1:8.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:28.210
And they're saying that
we have 100 cubic

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.830
centimeters of alcohol.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.620
So, how much water?

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.410
So 100 over water
is equal to 1:8.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.460
And you can even eyeball that.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.910
That's 100 over 800.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.350
So, water has to be equal to
800 cubic centimeters.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.760
And that's choice E.

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.010
Next question.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.100
197.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:57.850
If 75% of a class answered the
first question on a test

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:05.820
correctly-- so 75%, let's say
3/4, question one correctly.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.290
55% answered the second

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.970
question on the test correctly.

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.110
Let me write it this way.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:16.180
Question one, 75% true.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.070
Question two, 55% answered the
second question correctly, and

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.290
20% answered neither of the
questions correctly.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.580
So three, 20%.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.500
So, that's not question three.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:35.020
20% neither.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.240
What percent answered
both correctly?

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.970
So 3/4 answered question one
correctly and 1/4 answered it

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.890
incorrectly.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:51.840
Q1, they got it wrong.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.820
They're telling us that 20%
got neither correct.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:59.300
So that means that they
got Q2 wrong, as well.

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.900
And this is 20% of the
entire population.

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.230
So this is 1/5.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.280
This is 1/5 of the entire
population.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.800
So my question is, if this is
1/5 of the entire population,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.900
what fraction of this
population was it?

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:23.270
Well, of these people, the
fraction that got Q2

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.320
incorrect, let's write
that as x.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:31.710
So, x times 1/4 is
equal to 1/5.

00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:33.150
Multiply both sides
by a fourth, you

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.730
get x is equal 4/5.

00:08:35.730 --> 00:08:38.809
So, what we know is since this
is 1/5 of the entire

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:42.600
population, that of the people
who got question one

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:49.930
incorrect, 4/5 also got question
two incorrect.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.350
And if you want to know what
percentage that is of the

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.670
whole population, multiply
1/4 times 4/5.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.890
And you get 1/5 which is that
data that they had given us.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:57.650
But this helps us.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:00.250
Because this tells us, of these
people who got question

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.660
one incorrect, what fraction
got it right?

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.440
Got question two right?

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.280
Well, if 4/5 got it wrong, 1/5
got question two correct.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.350
So let me just take
a step back.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:18.940
I want to make sure I'm not
doing this the slowest

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.450
possible way.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:25.060
They tell us that 75% got
question one right and 55% got

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.350
question two right.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.730
So let's think about it.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:38.590
So of this, some percentage
got question two wrong.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.720
Actually, let's think
of it this way.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.770
Of this, some percentage
got question two right.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.850
Let's call this y.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:56.740
Let's call that y and let's
call this-- I'm

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:58.010
going to use x again.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:00.220
Let's call this x.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:00.850
I'll use x.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.720
This is a different x.

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.920
So, first of all, what is the
total proportion of people who

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.460
got question one wrong and
then question two right?

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.150
Well, it's 1/4 times 1/5.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:17.260
So, it's 1/20 of the people
got question one wrong and

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.450
question two right.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.030
And that's equal to x.

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.690
Now, what percentage of the
people got question one right

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.470
and question two wrong?

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:29.510
Well, that's going to be y.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.510
Now if you think about--
and y is actually what

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:33.160
we're solving for.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.130
They want to know how
many students

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.900
answered both correctly.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.850
So, if you think about it, y
plus 1/20, that represents all

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.360
of the people who answered
question two correctly.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.140
All the people who answered
question two correctly-- I

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.240
know it's a little confusing--
are those

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.950
people and those people.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.720
That's all the question twos
answered correctly.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.660
We already know that this is
1/20 of the population.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:05.970
And we know that y plus 1/20 of
the population is equal to

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.610
55% of the population.

00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:11.440
So, we can write that
as 55 over 100.

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:15.430
Or, we could divide both by
5 and you get 11 over 20.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:19.490
This is 11/20 of
the population.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:20.930
So, what is y?

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.580
Well, subtract 1/20 from both
sides. y is equal to-- 11/20

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:31.720
minus 1/20 is equal to 10/20,
which is equal to 1/2.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:37.050
So, 1/2 of the population got
both the first and the second

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:38.760
question right.

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.120
Actually, we didn't even have to
use-- well, we did have to

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.990
use this 3/4 information
to get this 1/4 here.

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.770
But anyway.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:46.390
And let's see if that's
one of the choices.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:46.740
Right.

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.170
D.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.100
50%.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.370
And I'm all out of time.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:52.380
See you in the next video.
