00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.220
Well we already know that
definite integrals can help us

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.240
figure out areas underneath
curves or between curves.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.930
What we'll show in this video
is that you can actually use

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.950
pretty much the exact same
principles to figure out the

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.580
volumes of rotational solids.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.490
So what do I mean?

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.060
So let me just draw a
couple of examples.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.220
So let me start with a fairly
straightforward function.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.980
That's my y-axis.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.930
This is my x-axis.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:32.885
Let me draw my function.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.500
I'm going to draw y equals the
square root of x, but I'll keep

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.090
it general right now, just so
this applies generally

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.210
to a lot of things.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.560
So y equals the square root of
x looks something like that.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.590
It keeps going.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.685
Actually, let me redraw that,
because I didn't want it

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:51.990
to curve down like
that at the end.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.410
It goes up like that,
and then it just keeps

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.260
going up like that.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.210
That's better.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.980
OK.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.910
So we'll call that f of x.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.900
This is our x-axis.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.220
This is our y-axis.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.390
And we already know that if
we wanted to figure out

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.980
the area under this curve
between two points.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.445
Let's say between the point
a-- well, we can do it

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:16.060
between any two points.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.950
Let's say this point a and this
point b, and we wanted to find

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.390
this area between
the two curves.

00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:26.700
I'm drawing everything
crooked today.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.980
Let me do a different color.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.990
If we wanted this area right
here, we would essentially just

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.690
be-- just as a review-- be
summing up a bunch of small

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.060
squares, where each square has
a bunch of rectangles, has a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.240
width dx, and its height at
that point would be whatever x

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.530
value here is-- it
would be f of x.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.100
And if we take the sum of all
of these areas, of all of these

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.990
rectangles, we would get
the area to this curve.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.430
And we learned in the definite
integral video that that's just

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.930
equal to the definite integral
from a-- that's a lower bound--

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.440
from a to b of f of
x times d of x.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.100
Where each [? rafter ?]

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.810
angle is f of x times d of x.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.030
And hopefully this makes a
little bit of intuitive

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.480
sense to you.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.370
I think a lot of people go
through calculus just learning

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.160
how to do it mechanistically,
just learning you know how to

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.040
do it like a robot without
really understanding

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.320
necessarily what's going on.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.180
And if you understand what's
going on, you'll never be

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.210
really lost when you see
something a little bit

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.170
different than what you
might have practiced.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.340
So with that out of the way,
let's think about something.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.690
What if we took this
function and we rotated

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.270
it about the x-axis.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.440
So this might take a little bit
of visualization, but what you

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.650
imagine is-- let me
see if I can draw.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.370
So I take this curve and if I
were to rotate it about the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.370
x-axis, it would look
something like this.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.650
It would look like a
sideways copper vase.

00:03:09.152 --> 00:03:12.730
It would look like that, where
that would be the opening.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.080
That would be the
opening on the inside.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.570
I can even shade it.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.610
Show you my drawing skills.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.220
OK.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.890
Hopefully that make sense.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.580
You know, that would be the
y-axis there, and the x-axis

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.050
would pop out the middle.

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.000
That's if you took this and
you rotated it around.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.210
So let me draw an arrow to show
that we're rotating it around.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.980
And if we did that, what would
be the volume created by--

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.830
well let's use the same
boundaries, between a and b.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.240
So if we took this piece and we
rotated it around, what would

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.110
it look like between a and b.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.325
It would look
something like this.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.360
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.910
So you would have a-- whoops,
I'm not trying that well.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.370
This is really testing the
limits of my ability to use

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.750
this computer to draw things.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.700
It'd be kind of a circle on one
end, and then it would curve

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:25.030
down a little bit and it would
be another circle

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.180
on the other end.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.480
And if I were to draw the
x-axis, the x-axis would

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:34.370
kind of pop out of the
middle right there.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.810
That right there would be
the point b, x equals b.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.340
If we were to kind of go behind
or look into the object we

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.950
would see the other surface
of this rotational solid.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.925
And this point right
here, that would be a.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.520
That would be a.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.500
And then of course the x-axis
would keep going, and then

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.570
that would be the y-axis.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.770
The visualization really
is the hardest part

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.280
about these problems.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.620
So first just actually
imagine what you're doing.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.960
So I just did this section, if
I rotated it about the x-axis.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.680
But if I were to draw the whole
curve, the whole curve would

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.920
look something like this.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.330
It would look something
like that, and we're

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.410
just rotating it around.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.215
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:31.810
We're rotating it
around that way.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.640
So how do we do that?

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.540
Well we use the exact
same principle.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.870
When we figured out the area,
we would figure out the area of

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.920
each of these small squares,
and then we would take the sum

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.780
of an infinite number of
infinitely small squares,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.000
and we got this.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.220
So to do the volume, what we
do is instead of having each

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.170
rectangle, we kind of rotate
each of these rectangles

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.650
around the x-axis.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:10.920
If that's the rectangle,
it has width dx, and

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.070
it has height f of x.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:22.240
So this height right here,
that's f of x at this point.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.930
If I were to rotate this
rectangle around the x-axis,

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.860
what do I end up with?

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.040
Well I'll end up with a disk.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.460
Let me see if I can draw
that reasonably well.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.430
I'm trying to show you some
perspective when I draw.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.670
So that would be the top
surface of the disk.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.030
And this would be the
side of the disk.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.010
And so this is the top
surface at the disk.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.360
And what would be the radius
of this disk, what would

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.610
be this height right here?

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.260
Well that radius, that's
going to be f of x.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.630
That's this height.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:08.310
Imagine if you took this and
rotated it around, that's the

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.050
same thing as this height
right here, right?

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.050
So that height or the radius
of the disk is f of x.

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.230
And then what's the
width of the disk?

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.350
Well that's just d of x.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:21.430
That's the same thing as this.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.080
We just rotated it around.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.390
So what would be the
volume of this disk?

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:29.520
It would be the
area of this side.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:35.780
It'll be this area right
here times this height.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.930
Well what's the area?

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.310
Well we know the radius, right?

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.805
Area is equal to pi r squared.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.550
What's this radius?

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.060
My radius is f of x, right?

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:55.620
So the area of this disk is
equal to pi times the radius

00:07:55.620 --> 00:08:03.100
squared, it so it's pi times f
of x, the whole thing squared.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.010
So what would be the volume
of this entire disk?

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:10.620
So it'll just be
this area times dx.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.890
I'm running out of
space and colors.

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:19.700
So the volume of that disk is
going to be equal to area of

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:25.010
that disk, pi f of x squared.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.500
The whole function, whatever
length this is at any point

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.390
squared, that gives us the
area, times the depth you

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.980
can say, so that's d of x.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.340
Now that gives us just the
volume of this one disk

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.880
when it's rotated around.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:42.080
So if we wanted the volume of
this entire object that I drew

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.900
here, we would just sum up
a bunch of these disks.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.910
We would take each of these
rectangles, rotate them around,

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.370
figure out the volume of that
disk it creates, and

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.780
then sum them up.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:57.980
And so essentially we're going
to take an infinite sum of a

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.250
bunch of these small
little disks so we can

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.380
take the integral.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.160
So this is the volume
of each disk.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.450
We could call that a
volume of a disk.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.720
So what's the volume
of the whole thing?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.700
Well we just take a sum,
an integral sum of

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.110
each of these disks.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:19.040
So the volume when you rotate
it is going to be equal to the

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:22.370
definite integral between-- and
remember, our boundaries were a

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:29.920
and b-- between a and b of this
quantity right here--

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:39.950
pi f of x squared dx.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.820
So hopefully that
makes sense to you.

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.340
Just remember, this is
the width of each disk.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.900
This is the radius of the disk,
or the radius of the surface,

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.555
so it would be squared, and
that makes sense, that's

00:09:50.555 --> 00:09:51.390
the height, f of x.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.520
And we have pi r squared, so
that's where the pi comes from.

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.780
Some people just memorize that.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.140
I don't recommend you do that,
and we'll see that later.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.290
But I'm out of time.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.450
In the next video I'll
actually apply this

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.685
to an actual problem.

00:10:02.685 --> 00:10:02.940
See you soon.
