00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So we're halfway then--we've got one of the two numbers we need

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to know our position on the earth--latitude.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So, this unit is about covered up but not quite. Longitude is much more difficult.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Do you have some intuition for why longitude is so much more difficult. Let's take a look at these lines.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Here we've drawn five lines of the longitude and in the middle we have, of course, the equator.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, the equator wasn't chosen randomly.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The earth rotates around an imaginary axis that goes through the center of the earth.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now the equator define this sort of flat plane through the middle of the earth--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that makes a right angle with the axis of rotation.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The equator isn't some sense real. It's based on actual physical property of the earth.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now let's see. Which of these lines is the 0 line of longitude.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Is it line 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, and I've labeled them here.

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you can't tell these to my drawing, you can also select this option.
