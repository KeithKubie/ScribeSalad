00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.395
Hey guys.

00:00:00.395 --> 00:00:01.800
I'm Nate, I'm the new Hacksmith,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.000
and today on Make It Real,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
we're going to be showing you
how to heat treat steel

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.731
at a permanent edge
to your knives.

00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:08.361
I said this was a temp position.

00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:08.980
Oh.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:21.580
[Music]

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.500
Guys, of course,
I'm not taking over.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.800
But Calli and I
are here in Canada,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.200
and we decided to stop

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.847
by the Hacksmith here
at HackSmith Industries.

00:00:28.847 --> 00:00:30.600
We've got a fun project to do.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.200
Yeah, today, we're going to be
heat treating steel to show you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.400
how to give a solid
edge to your knives,

00:00:35.406 --> 00:00:37.356
or any kind of weapons
you want to make,

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:39.106
like we make
on the Hacksmith channel.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:40.649
So to do some tests
on the steel,

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.800
we thought James would probably
have some really good equipment,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.200
and maybe some stylized weapons

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.700
that we could really
use a stress test.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.200
This is the best day of my life.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.560
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.750
We're going to show
how to heat treat and temper

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.956
some high carbon steel,

00:00:56.956 --> 00:01:00.000
and then show some side-by-side
comparisons of what happens

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.100
if you hit each one
with Thor's hammer.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.400
I may not be worthy.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.200
This is why I

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.400
don't actually get to take
over the channel as you...

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.060
Can't.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.720
I just can't.

00:01:10.723 --> 00:01:13.700
So we ordered some steel
delivered to your shop.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.400
Did you get that?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.600
Those special steel that we
want to use for this video?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.300
Yeah, I believe it was
a 1084 carbon steel.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.280
1084.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.040
Yeah.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.200
We put it on
this box right here.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.332
So Calli, you can go
ahead and open it up,

00:01:24.332 --> 00:01:26.100
and get started
on this experiment.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.100
Says do not open.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.700
Do it.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.200
Okay.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.800
Oh, look at that.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.900
Do open.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.000
Yeah, read between the lines.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.000
That seemed too easy
given the way that--

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.200
Do I want to know
what's about to happen to me?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.000
No, you're fine.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.840
If this is a jump scare.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.000
So where's our steel, James?

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.940
Over there.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.760
I'm going back to America.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.060
All right.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.900
Well, our steel was
not actually in Pandora's Box.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.200
So this, this looks
kind of like the steel

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.900
that you would get
at Home Depot or Lowe's,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.100
any hardware type store,

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.100
but it's not the
highest quality steel,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.900
which for a lot
of things doesn't matter.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.671
It works so well
for so many things.

00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:22.100
This specifically is a type
of high carbon steel,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.500
and as you were saying,
it's 1084 steel.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.471
This is usually used as
a knife making steel.

00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:29.700
So the 84 stands
for 0.84% carbon,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.150
which is how much carbon is
actually in the steel.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.000
And what that means

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.800
is we can actually heat treat
this to make it even harder

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.700
than it is right now.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.640
And we'll show you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.740
how hard it is by actually doing
a few destructive tests before

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.334
and after we heat treat it.

00:02:43.334 --> 00:02:43.584
Okay.

00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:44.900
So James, destructive test.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.700
This is my favorite thing
I've ever heard of.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.000
So I think we should at
least try a file on one.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.900
Let's try and see
if we can bend one.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.800
What weapons do you have
that we could use against these?

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.820
I think the
bending one, MjÃ¶lnir.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.453
We actually used Mjolnir
as a variable swing press

00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:00.900
for forming sheet metal.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.700
The way that this steel arrives
when you order it.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.279
This is in what's called
an annealed state.

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:08.000
It has had a heat treatment,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.800
but that heat
treatment is basically

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.500
what weakens it the most.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.700
It just brings it
to a relatively soft stage.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.000
Obviously, it's still hard.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.300
It's still a bar of steel.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.560
It's not like putty clay
or glass or anything like that,

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.900
but it's not as hard
as we want it to be

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.742
if we're actually going
to use it as a tool.

00:03:24.742 --> 00:03:26.392
So that's, that's
the whole point,

00:03:26.392 --> 00:03:28.800
to see what we can do to change
it and we need a baseline.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.917
So Calli was saying
we'll use a file.

00:03:30.917 --> 00:03:33.441
You're saying we can use
Mjolnir to try and bend

00:03:33.441 --> 00:03:34.712
or maybe even shatter it,

00:03:34.712 --> 00:03:37.000
and let's test it out
before we heat treat it,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.100
and heat treat it,
and test it again after.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.900
All right.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.330
So we've got our control steel,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.500
which is as we bought it
from the steel company.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.400
So it's basically just
annealed right now.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.224
Then we're going

00:03:46.224 --> 00:03:48.800
to heat up these pieces
so it will be heat treated,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.627
and we'll be quenching those,

00:03:50.627 --> 00:03:54.275
and then the tempered ones, we,
exact same as the heat treat,

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:56.100
but after we've quenched them,

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.640
we're she going to reheat them
in the oven to temper them

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.466
to make it
as strong as possible.

00:04:00.466 --> 00:04:00.999
All right.

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.300
So let's start by actually heat
treating these pieces of steel.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.500
So we've got our,
our control steel,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.921
which we're going
to leave over here.

00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:09.500
And then we're actually
going to be doing

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.000
the same heat treating process
to all four of these,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.060
and we've got a kiln here.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.100
Now, the Kiln is actually,
it's pretty power-hungry.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.200
So we've got
an arc reactor here.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.000
Boom.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.800
And you want it 25.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.780
Yeah.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.400
It was set to 809 moment.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.067
Different types of steel
are going to have

00:04:25.067 --> 00:04:27.100
different temperatures
that need to get them up to.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.300
What we're using,
this 1084 steel.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.278
One of the reasons we're using
it is it's actually probably

00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:35.000
the most forgiving type
of high-carbon steel there is.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.933
It's one of the easiest to get
a good heat treatment on.

00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:39.035
There are some types

00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:41.900
where you need very precise
temperatures for a really

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.110
precise amount of time,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.900
and then to cool it down
in exactly the right material

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.500
for the exact right
amount of time.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.800
The heat we're going to be using
for our steel is at 815 Celsius,

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.300
which is about
1,500 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.200
Yeah, let's see how many
we can fit in at one time.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.700
Yeah.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.799
Once this is all heated up,

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:02.600
and our steel is nice
and orange hot,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.000
the next step is going
to be quenching it in oil.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.800
Would cooking oil work?

00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:08.088
Actually, yes.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.042
For some types of steel,

00:05:09.042 --> 00:05:11.400
you have to be pretty particular
about what you quench it in.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.205
But again, this 1084
usually quite forgiving.

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:16.500
So we are going
to use vegetable oil.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.231
However, to make it work
a little bit better,

00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:19.700
it needs to be
a little bit thinner,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.400
and to do that,

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.700
we're going to heat it up
to about 55 degrees Celsius,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.680
or around 130 Fahrenheit.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.340
It's not there.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.340
What's your plan?

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.200
You guys want to put
your safety glasses on?

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.700
Yes.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.100
Nice.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:44.740
[Music]

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.000
Is this not how most people heat
up their cooking oil?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.470
This is how I cook break--

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.500
This is how I cook.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.500
This is--
This is normal.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.000
&gt;&gt; Let's say that's--
&gt;&gt; I think we're good.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.900
So we're now
at a temperature like,

00:06:00.902 --> 00:06:02.180
I can stick my finger in,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:03.349
and after a few seconds,

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:05.700
it starts to get a little
bit painful, like, oh,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.400
that's hotter than I want,

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.800
which is kind of
what we're going for.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.300
About 110 Fahrenheit is
sort of upper limit of

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.865
what you can leave your hand in
without it starting to burn,

00:06:14.865 --> 00:06:15.554
and so the fact

00:06:15.554 --> 00:06:17.400
that it is getting
too hot is a good sign.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.400
Our Kiln has reached 815.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.220
Well, it's actually
gotten up to 822,

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.105
right in the range
we're looking for.

00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:24.964
So at this point,

00:06:24.964 --> 00:06:27.307
the steel and the carbon
have begun to change

00:06:27.307 --> 00:06:28.520
how they're interacting.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.100
And at this temperature,
the steel has begun to form

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.820
a crystalline structure
called austenite.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.280
That's a phase of the steel

00:06:35.288 --> 00:06:38.700
where it's just the carbon
is not actually interacting much

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.852
with the iron inside,

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.500
and as a result of being heated
up and forming that austenite,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.458
it should have actually
lost its magnetism,

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:47.279
which is a good way
for us to test

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:50.015
if the steel is actually
as hot as we want it.

00:06:50.015 --> 00:06:51.882
James, what have you got there?

00:06:51.882 --> 00:06:52.967
I've got a magnet,

00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:55.800
and as you can tell,
the steel is very magnetic.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.940
But hypothetically,

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.939
the red hot steel
in there should not be

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.429
very magnetic anymore.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.960
Yep.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.720
Well.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.820
Not really magnetic.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:05.740
Let's go over the first one.

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:07.200
So Calli's can open the Kiln.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.500
I'm going to grab one of these,

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.700
pull it out, and put
it right into the oil,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.700
and gently swirl it around.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.100
I probably don't actually need
to be gentle with this stuff

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.300
because it's quite thick.

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.400
I don't think we have
to worry about these just

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.576
straight steel bars.

00:07:19.576 --> 00:07:20.700
The first few seconds,

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:23.000
so where really changes
temperature the most,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.900
and that should be

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.140
where it changes state
from austenite to martensite.

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.160
I mean, I might pull it
right out of my pliers.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.653
Yeah.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.000
It's back to magnetic.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.140
Yeah.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.400
And now it's there forever.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.880
It's back to very magnetic.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.399
All right, so putting
the hot steel into the oil

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:41.000
probably raise the overall
temperature the oil a bit.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.459
We're going to add just
a little bit of cool oil

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.500
to drop the temperature
back down again.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:59.940
[Music]

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.240
All right, last one.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.800
All right, so we've quenched
the first three using oil,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.500
but I'd like to use a technique

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.401
that we use with some
of our projects,

00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:09.200
and that's quenching
with styrofoam.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.955
And Calli, I just want
you to drop the piece

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.800
of steel right there.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.800
I've never been
happier about something.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.000
Yep.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.700
Let's do this.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.060
[Music]

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.340
There's your fire.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.500
And that head is gone.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.000
All right, so because a lot
of the steel actually flaked off

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.300
from the heating,

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.900
we actually lost
our scribe mark.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.549
So I'm just going to write down
which ones are which again,

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:34.837
and we're going to go ahead,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.420
and continue the
tempering process.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.680
All right.

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.720
Let's take these the kitchen.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.440
This kitchen, huh?

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.660
Good kitchen.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.380
What a kitchen.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.680
I love it.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.180
Kitchen.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.760
Oh and you--

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.440
&gt;&gt; A can of gasoline.
&gt;&gt; We store gas is there.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.600
We put in,
heat it up in the oven.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:55.900
Yep.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.300
So we'll just set it at 425.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.600
Let it heat up in the oven.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.500
We're going to let

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.700
that run for two hours,
turn the oven off,

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.600
and let it cool down
in the oven as well.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.476
All right, so we've gone
ahead and let our metal heat

00:09:06.476 --> 00:09:07.300
for two hours,

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.100
and then we let it
just cool down.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.540
It's time to take it out,
and see what's happened.

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:13.960
So we've got
our plane annealed steel.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.740
Then we have
our heat treated steel,

00:09:15.746 --> 00:09:17.800
and then we have
our heat treated

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.959
and tempered steel.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:22.100
So now, all we have
to do is test it out.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.499
See the difference
between them all.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.580
This particular version
of Mjolnir weighs how much?

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:27.360
73 pounds.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:32.820
It bent.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:33.800
Yeah, a nice little bend there.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.266
This is the untreated.

00:09:35.266 --> 00:09:38.000
This is just the steel
as it arrives to us.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.300
I'm going to put some safety
glasses on this time.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.500
This has been heat treated,
but not tempered.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.800
That's how you use
a variable swing press.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.100
That was beautiful.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.700
It didn't even try to survive that.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.760
Just snapped right off.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.380
Look at that difference
between plain steel,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.240
which is bent a little bit,
and hardened steel.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.300
This is sort of a universal law
of solid materials.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.700
The harder something gets,
the less flexible it is.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:16.474
And we've made this quite
a bit harder, and so,

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.260
it's a lot less flexible.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.000
Calli, you want
to smash one right here?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.500
I do.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.120
I really do.

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.960
I am worthy.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.680
Shoot!

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.300
There you go.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.100
Nice.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:38.640
[Music]

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.840
Now, if everything has gone
just right with our tempering,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.300
this piece should
not crack the same way.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.000
Ideally, it will sort of spring.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.176
It will actually like take
some impact and bounce back,

00:10:51.176 --> 00:10:53.235
so it won't bend
and it won't break.

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:55.440
With the other one,
I was able to shatter.

00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.000
There should be, technically,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.940
if we did this right,
no way that even with Mjolnir,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.300
I shouldn't be able
to break this.

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:04.000
Got a lot of faith
in our tempered steel.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
No, I don't.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.000
Okay.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.800
Ready?

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:13.900
It's like a spring.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.500
That flexed a lot,

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.500
and then just
nope, right back.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.796
So, our three types of steel,

00:11:18.796 --> 00:11:21.178
what would we get if we made
knives out of each of these?

00:11:21.178 --> 00:11:22.200
Well, for the first one,

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.889
what you're going to get
is you're gonna be able

00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:24.720
to file it down.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.375
It's going to look pretty,

00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:26.800
and then you're going
to try and use it,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.100
and it's going to dent
and be useless.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.600
So you don't keep
an edge on this at all.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.400
Second one, the heat treatment.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.300
What would we get
with a knife out of this?

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:35.973
Now, with that,

00:11:35.973 --> 00:11:37.900
you would be able to get
a really sharp edge,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:41.900
but if you encountered
any other stronger materials,

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.400
you're going to chip it,
you're gonna dent it.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:44.980
Not Dent.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.340
Sorry.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.360
It's gonna chip.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:46.655
Yeah.

00:11:46.655 --> 00:11:48.900
And it's going to make
a useless knife,

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.939
because then you got a burr
and then won't cut nice anymore.

00:11:51.939 --> 00:11:54.000
Then we've got
our tempered bar of steel,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.100
and this is what we want.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.039
So we would shape it
without doing any heat treating,

00:11:59.039 --> 00:12:01.300
and then you heat treat it
and temper it,

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.758
and if you make
a knife out of that,

00:12:02.758 --> 00:12:03.800
you get something useful.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.500
You get something
that's much harder,

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.749
but also isn't so brittle.

00:12:06.749 --> 00:12:08.300
We saw how well
that sprung back

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:11.000
after we hit it with the hammer
compared to the annealed steel,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.300
which just bent.

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.920
Stayed that way.

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:15.600
If you do hit something
hard with the blade,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.600
you'd be able to straighten
it back out, you'd be able

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:18.564
to hone it, sharpen it.

00:12:18.564 --> 00:12:20.199
It's going to do
what you want it to do,

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:22.799
and if you even want to get
a little rougher with it,

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:24.287
maybe do a little bit of prying,

00:12:24.287 --> 00:12:26.100
which isn't what knives
are usually for.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.350
But these things come up.

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:28.600
It's got some flex to it.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.669
It's not just going to snap off

00:12:29.669 --> 00:12:31.152
the first time you try
something like that,

00:12:31.152 --> 00:12:32.564
or even if you just
drop it on the ground

00:12:32.564 --> 00:12:33.200
if you're unlucky.

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.300
That's the difference.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:34.799
We can see

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:37.199
what happens to the steel
with the heat treating,

00:12:37.199 --> 00:12:38.400
and why we want to do that.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.500
You've probably seen some of the
cool stuff in the background,

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:41.799
or us interacting with it.

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:44.250
He's almost certainly got
a video or two or more

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:46.700
on his Channel showing
how he made those things.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.900
They're super cool.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.300
You've got to go check them out.
