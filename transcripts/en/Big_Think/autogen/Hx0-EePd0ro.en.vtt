00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540
vacations need to be something that is
 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.410
vacations need to be something that is
beyond the specific vacation and we need

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420
beyond the specific vacation and we need
 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.319
beyond the specific vacation and we need
to be very worried about doing the

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329
to be very worried about doing the
 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.790
to be very worried about doing the
comfort rather than the real pleasure
