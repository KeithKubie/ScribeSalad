00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.703
WAS IN FULL SWING,

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.671
BUT TO GAIN ENTRY
TO THIS EXCLUSIVE EVENT,

00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:07.307
I'D NEED
AN AGE-APPROPRIATE ESCORT.

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:09.443
I DON'T HAVE A DATE MYSELF.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.111
NO DATE TO THE PROM.

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:13.280
BUT JUST LIKE
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:16.049
EVERY TEENAGE GIRL I ASKED
ALREADY HAD PLANS.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:18.385
THAT'S QUITE HURTFUL,
BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.687
EXCUSE ME, I DON'T HAVE
A VISITOR'S PASS,

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.723
SO I NEED TO MAKE THIS
REALLY QUICK.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.157
HEY, I'M LOOKING FOR A DATE
TO YOUR SENIOR PROM,

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:25.492
AND I DON'T CARE
WHO I GO WITH.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.127
HANG ON, NOW.
ALL RIGHT.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.662
OOP, THERE'S THAT
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.063
WHO WAS GIVING ME GRIEF
BEFORE.

00:00:30.097 --> 00:00:32.232
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
IN THE BUILDING.

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:36.803
EVENTUALLY, MY SEARCH
FOR A HUMAN PROM TICKET

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:39.173
LED ME TO MY OWN LIVING ROOM.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:42.209
I SEE YOU FOUND
THE SANDWICHES.

00:00:42.242 --> 00:00:44.845
MEG CARMICHAEL, A SENIOR
AT NEARBY FRANKLIN HIGH,

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.314
WAS OUR SITTER.

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:50.317
[classical music playing]

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.085
â™ª

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.321
[music stops]

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:57.691
MEG, THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.727
YOU'RE A SENIOR
IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW, YES?

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:02.329
- Y-YEAH.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.365
- AND YOU'VE GOT A PROM
COMING UP, RIGHT?

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.934
- YEAH.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.970
- HAS ANYONE ASKED YOU
TO YOUR SENIOR PROM YET?

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.608
- NO.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:17.744
- HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO YOUR PROM WITH ME?

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.519
- OKAY.
- YES!

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.921
OH, GOODY!
I'M--I'M GLAD. I'M GLAD.

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:31.959
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A VERY GOOD TIME.

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:34.795
NOW I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.897
I ARRIVED AT 6:00 SHARP

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.766
TO FIND MY DATE LOOKING
ELEGANT AND LADYLIKE.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.535
[chuckles]
LOOK AT THAT DRESS.

00:01:41.568 --> 00:01:45.105
OH, MY GOODNESS, IT MATCHES
YOUR WHOLE PERSONALITY.

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.441
AFTER A BRIEF PHOTO SHOOT
ON THE FRONT LAWN...

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:48.876
THIS IS SORT OF AN EXCITING
MILESTONE

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.377
FOR PARENTS, ISN'T IT?

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.146
WHO KNOWS WHAT'S IN STORE
FOR US TONIGHT?

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.448
- WE WERE ON OUR WAY.
