00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.980
That was back in the late 90's, and

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.050
what was really cool was this holistic
notion of, of the human motion.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.830
We also didn't have a large database.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.150
You have a small number of,
of examples, so

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.060
it's not sort of the large
discriminative database learning kind of

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.650
stuff that goes on in
action recognition now.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.572
What we're going to do next time is,

00:00:19.572 --> 00:00:21.940
we're going to take a look at
a different approach that takes some,

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.350
look at, looks at videos as a time
series, time series analysis.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.690
And just some basic
approach to doing that.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.610
And again, this will be something where
much like the SVM's that we just talked

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910
about, we said we can only give
you a sm, small taste of it, and

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.685
if you want to know about it, you should
take the course in machine learning.

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:43.090
We're going to show you a very simple
notion of a form of a graphical

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.550
model approach to doing
action recognition, and

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.260
if you want to do more that that,
again, you'll take machine learning.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.670
But that's what we're
going to do next time.
