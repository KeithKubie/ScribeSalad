00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.110
Most Traits have a distribution in a population, or

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.660
they exist on a Spectrum. This is what we would

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.070
call a Normal Distribution or a Bell Curve, looking

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.280
at the shape. It looks like a dome-shaped bell. Let's

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.950
imagine that this the Risk distribution curve for Breast

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.120
Cancer in a population of women. What this means is

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.600
that we took a population of women, let's say in

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.630
the United States or elsewhere. And we tally each individual's

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.610
risk for breast cancer. And then after tallying everything

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.710
up we put it in this graph here. On

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.680
the horizontal, or X axis, we have the risk

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.810
of breast cancer, which is measured as a probability

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.090
or a percent. And the vertical axis, or the

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.840
Y axis here, shows how many women have that

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.810
particular risk. For example, in this particular normal distribution,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.940
the most number of women have a breast cancer risk

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.800
of about 12%. You can see the height of

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.840
the bell curve is here. About 30% of women

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.730
have a 12% risk of breast cancer. This number

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.580
right in the middle, the average, this means that 12%

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.980
of women develop breast cancer during their lifetime. Another

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.350
way to say this, is that the average woman has

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.110
about a 12% risk for developing breast cancer. This

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.180
is how we can turn population data into a risk

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.830
assessment for an individual person. As the bell curve

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.180
indicates, most women's risks will be close to the average

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.840
of 12%. And as you get farther away from

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.430
the middle, fewer and fewer will have an average risk.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.550
The women down here will have a lower risk

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.030
of developing breast cancer. And the women over here will

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.910
have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. But

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.970
as you can see, most women fall into the category

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.060
near the average risk.
