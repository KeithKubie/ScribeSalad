Global illumination is when one object affects another's appearance. Light

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.454
traveling through stained glass and hitting the floor is a case of global

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:12.210
illumination as the glass affects the color of the light hitting the floor.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.525
Similarly, the bottom of the pool has caustics placed where the light gathers

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:20.830
due to the water rippling. Even an object casting a shadow on another object is

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.870
a form of global illumination, in that one object effects the other. The

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.710
Lambertian, in other words diffuse, and the Blinn-Phong equation are local

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.005
illumination models. They are computed using just the information from the

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.070
object itself, not using other surrounding objects.
