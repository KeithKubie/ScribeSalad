[MUSIC].

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.266
And we're back. We just saw an exciting athlete threshold competition, where we

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.866
tested to see how high-pitched our contestants could hear.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.733
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And now we're going to go to another absolute threshold competition, but this

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
time we're going to measure how quiet of a sound our contestants can perceive.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
Let's go to you Susan.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.533
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Hi guys, this event is similar to our pitch event except we're going to be

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
measuring volume. We're going to start with 60 decibels, which is about the

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.266
sound of the average speaking voice. So, hopefully everybody will hear that and

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.133
raise their hands. Then we're going to lower it to 50, 40, 30 decibels, which

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.133
is about the sound of a whisper. We'll keep lowering those until there's only

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
one contestant remaining.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
It looks like they're ready to start. I need to clear the floor.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks Susan. We're going to let you keep an eye on things there.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.866
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is really exciting. I, wonder how low, the volume will go. Susan mentioned

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
that 60 decibels is the volume of normal speaking.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.733
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And 30 decibels is the volume of a whisper. So, what do you think will be the

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
lowest volume that our contestants will be able to hear?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.866
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, Andy, I would say a whisper is a lot quieter than normal conversation, so

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
many 25 decibels?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Actually, it's probably going to be a lot closer to zero.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Zero? Isn't that no sound at all?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, not quite. Decibels are a funny unit.
