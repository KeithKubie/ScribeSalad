VAN RIPER: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.290
This is Van Riper.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.090
I'm the Google Developer
Groups program

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.290
manager here at Google.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.620
And this is our second
edition of Google

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.610
Developers Tech Roundup.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.190
And here with me, my
co-host Stephanie.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.240
STEPHANIE LIU: Hi, everyone.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.410
My name is Stephanie Liu.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.430
I also work on the Developer
Relations team, leading the

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.720
Global Programs team.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:22.750
VAN RIPER: And Adriana?

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.770
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.450
I'm Adriana Cerundolo, the
community manager for Google

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.440
Developer Groups.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.356
VAN RIPER: And our special
guest today is Fred.

00:00:29.356 --> 00:00:30.290
FRED SAUER: Hi, Van.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.050
Thanks for having me,
Stephanie, Adriana.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.810
I'm a developer advocate
on the Google

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:35.960
Cloud Platform team.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.010
I'm really excited
to be here today.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.400
And I have actually a little
demo in store for later, if

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.230
you let me.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.740
VAN RIPER: Oh, definitely.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.580
So we thought we'd start off
today, given that we're in the

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.190
summer blockbuster season, and
we were talking about movies.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.430
And we started talking about
our favorite hacker movies.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.250
So we thought we'd go around
and talk about what our

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.310
favorite hacker movies were.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.070
So how about you, Stephanie?

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.920
STEPHANIE LIU: OK, it's the
question of the day.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.170
OK, I won't say that this is one
of my favorites, but it's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470
definitely the one that has
stuck in my mind the most.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.340
I think it happened during
my formative years.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.110
I saw thin in high school
before perhaps some more

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.340
iconic hacker movies.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.270
But it was "Antitrust." I
don't know if you guys

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.990
remember Ryan Phillippe.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.530
A young Ryan Phillippe--

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.435
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
Cannot go wrong.

00:01:16.435 --> 00:01:20.950
STEPHANIE LIU: --as a computer
whiz and like fake Bill Gates

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.040
and this whole thing.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.040
And it was action packed.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.120
There was murder and intrigue.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.663
And also I think it was
the first time I

00:01:28.663 --> 00:01:30.250
saw a command prompt.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.250
It was like a Unix
command prompt--

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580
he's like hacking the system
from like a daycare or

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.870
something--

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.370
on a movie screen.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.040
And there's also a nice open
source message at the end.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.605
So I thought it was a
fun, again, kind of

00:01:43.605 --> 00:01:46.690
a mainstream computer--

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.152
the protagonist being
a computer program.

00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:49.750
VAN RIPER: Cool.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.660
What about you, Adriana?

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.630
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: I really love
action movies and great

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.470
special effects.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.860
So I'm going to have to say
"Tron." So I don't know if

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.120
that constitutes technically
the hacker movie.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.210
I feel like it is.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.890
But I totally enjoyed it.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.220
And Jeff Bridges is just an
awesome actor, so you can

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.270
never can go wrong with him.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.100
FRED SAUER: So the remake,
not the original "Tron."

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.590
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: It's
not a remake.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.580
It's a sequel.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.500
STEPHANIE LIU: Well--.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.420
FRED SAUER: Sequel.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.890
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
Yes, the sequel.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.390
I guess I have to go back in
time and actually watch the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.280
original first.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.070
So I'll put that on my list of
things to do this summer.

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:25.300
VAN RIPER: So how
about you, Fred?

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.940
FRED SAUER: It's going to
have to be "War Games."

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.631
VAN RIPER: Great choice.

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:33.440
FRED SAUER: It's a real easy
one, because it really brings

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.800
kind of the computer hacker
culture-- the original meaning

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.580
of hacker is not someone
necessarily trying to break

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.640
systems, but someone who is
sort of a geek and fiddles

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.010
with stuff.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.630
And yeah, they know
how it works.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.790
But he sort of inadvertently
uncovers a government program,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.630
and ends up breaking into
the wrong computer.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.790
And everything's
very physical.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.790
There's a dial up modem.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.670
You hear the squelch
of the dial up.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.380
He has these 5/4 inch floppy
disks the puts

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.830
in and loads programs.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.480
There's a number of things in
the movie that aren't quite

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.380
real or possible, but
that's kind of OK.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.390
It's on that edge between
Hollywood and reality.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.370
But it's a lot of fun.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.330
It talks about back doors.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.550
And I think it really introduced
a bunch of computer

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.320
concepts to the general
audience.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.350
And I've watched
it many times.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.000
So definitely number
one movie.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.660
VAN RIPER: Yeah, that's

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.610
definitely one of my favorites.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.140
I guess I'll throw another
one in there.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.220
I also liked "Sneakers." One of
the things in that one is I

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.600
thought it, at least, it kind
of portrays them as not just

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.440
these nerdy geeks, at least the
head guy, who's played by

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.140
Robert Redford as kind
of this cool guy.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.924
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Cool guy.

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:44.690
VAN RIPER: Kind of thing.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.050
And actually, the plot of that,
there's some things

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.310
about it that, if you think
about it in the context of

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.480
current events around the NSA
and what was going on in that

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.335
one, it's kind of
a freaky story.

00:03:59.335 --> 00:03:59.800
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.379
paralleled some of the
fictitious stuff that's been

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.052
going on lately.

00:04:04.052 --> 00:04:04.530
Anyway.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.320
STEPHANIE LIU: So actually, I
ended up watching "Sneakers"--

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.020
I only watched it the first
time within the

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.590
last five or six years.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.870
And I recognized--

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.760
there's a lot of iconic San
Francisco stuff in there,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.280
including the Google
office in SF.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.940
So they do the handoff in the
Hills Plaza building, which is

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.320
where we are now.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.209
VAN RIPER: Awesome.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.750
STEPHANIE LIU: Before Google
existed or whatever.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.402
VAN RIPER: What a
good connection.

00:04:23.402 --> 00:04:23.910
Awesome.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.980
So we'd love to hear from all
of you what your favorite

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.160
movies are.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.170
We're on Google+.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.840
You can just shout out at us
with the hashtag gdtech and

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.800
hashtag quoteoftheday,
and share with us

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.000
your favorite movies.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.710
Actually, our producer for
today's show, Brian Grady in

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.690
the back here, was telling us
that he believes the first

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.510
ever hacker movie was "Hot
Millions" in 1968.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.780
So if you know of an earlier
movie than that, let us know.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.560
So with that, I think
we'd like to move on

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.360
to a few news items.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.420
I want to preface this by
saying, obviously, this is not

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:00.860
a comprehensive news report.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.960
In fact, even inside of Google,
it's hard for us to

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.860
keep track of everything
that's happening.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.010
And that's why we thought it
would be important with this

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.480
show to highlight for you a few
interesting things that we

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.840
think you may have missed in all
the great happenings going

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.550
on here from Google.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.930
So with that, we'll start with
an update from Stephanie.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.240
STEPHANIE LIU: Well, I just
wanted to talk about, I've

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.430
been poking around a little
bit with Polymer.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.950
So for those of you who haven't
seen it, it's in a

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.060
pre-alpha release.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.690
So people who like living
on the edge.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.740
Definitely check it out.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.330
It's interesting if you
just want to see

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.380
where the web is going.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.150
It's a whole bunch of libraries
built on top of Web

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.500
Components and trying to
evangelize the use of the

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.330
custom element and making
program more declarative.

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.100
Again, trying to make web
programming more easier.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.330
Making life easier
for developers.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.710
So again, if you like living
on the edge, check it out.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.190
It's in pre-alpha.

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:55.900
They're looking for feedback.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.340
Give it a look.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.760
VAN RIPER: Sounds good.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.470
And I think you had something
to share as well.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.010
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Yeah.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.220
I just want to share the
BigQuery updates I think are

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.340
really important.

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.900
BigQuery is great
for processing

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.850
large amounts of data.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.154
So this is really important
for anyone

00:06:10.154 --> 00:06:11.820
who need to do that.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.920
But for new features,
you can output

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.800
larger results per query.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.290
So before, you couldn't
do that.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.020
So now, if you have a lot of
data, get ready for some

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.710
really large tables.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.500
And then also we can now get
more out of our data.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.810
So we can have new ways to rank
and traverse results and

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.290
explore distributions
and percentiles.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.500
So it's really good to have
these new features to more

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.790
effectively just get more
information and analysis of

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.240
data that we're collecting.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.310
So one great example of this
actually is the Data Sensing

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.290
project that we did at
Google I/O this year.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.300
So in the last episode of the
Roundup, we actually had Kim

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.120
Cameron from BigQuery
team come in.

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.740
And she did a little deep dive
on what the Data Sensing

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.530
project was all about.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:00.270
Go check that out if you haven't
seen that already.

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.090
But just the essence of that, in
short, is that we collected

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:07.730
some great environmental data
at Moscone West from I/O and

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.640
got some analysis on that
using BigQuery.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.990
So for example, we got the
temperature and air quality

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.120
throughout different parts
of the building.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.670
We were able to get the median
temperature over each room.

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.220
And then we were also able to
rank, for example, the rooms

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.110
by their coldest median temp.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.570
So it's just some fun stuff
that we were able

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.390
to get using that.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.030
So also just back to the
updates, just kind of icing on

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.250
the cake, too, is that there
is now query caching.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.710
So BigQuery now remembers the
values that you previously

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:38.320
calculated.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:39.470
It's just going to make
the whole process

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.900
a lot easier, simpler.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.640
So great news for all you big
data crunchers out there.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.480
VAN RIPER: Yeah.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.070
So also in the cloud space,
like the big data work, we

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.800
recently had some Android
related announcements.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.680
So Android Studio now has
integrated support for

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.660
building your backend
applications using Google App

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.360
Engine for the backend.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.650
And this is actually another
thing that you'd find on the

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.840
Google Cloud Platform blog, as
well as we had just announced

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.010
with the BigQuery.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:11.820
What's really nice about this
is you can manage your

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:15.060
application backend, frontend
all in one place in Android

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:15.750
Studio now.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.620
Especially if you're a Java
developer, and your Java cloud

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.160
backend, and take advantage of
the Google Cloud Messaging

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.210
that's built in.

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:27.300
You will need, on your account,
to actually set up

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.200
enabling Google Cloud
Messaging and

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.120
also get an API key.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.850
But once you've done that,
Android Studio takes care of

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:34.640
everything.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.165
Pulls down all the
dependencies.

00:08:36.165 --> 00:08:38.570
The App Engine project is
done using Apache Maven.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:41.250
So it'll pull all your App
Engine dependencies down and

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.450
actually pulls down even the
dependencies for Google Cloud

00:08:43.450 --> 00:08:45.990
Messaging Support into
your Android App.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.490
So you'll get that
automatically, that

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.760
synchronization across
all platforms.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.330
So it's a really exciting
update.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.600
Makes it even easier for the
experienced developer to work

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.510
all in one integrated
environment.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.365
And if you're actually a new
developer to App Engine,

00:09:00.365 --> 00:09:03.060
Fred's actually going to talk
to us about something that

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.740
makes it really easy for
you to get started.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.310
So I'm going to turn it
over to Fred now.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.480
FRED SAUER: OK.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.070
You talked about the Google
Cloud Platform blog.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.900
And actually, just about a week
and a half or so ago, we

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:17.560
did a blog post about the Google
Cloud Playground, which

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.990
is something that I've been
working on in my 20% time for

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.600
some time now.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.780
And maybe before I show that
you, we should talk a little

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:30.390
bit about the background of
how we kind of got there.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.150
I've been working on App Engine
for the last four and a

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:34.440
half years or so.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.540
And one sort of consistent piece
of feedback I get from

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.560
developers who are on the
platform is, we really like

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.130
the platform.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.730
We like the productivity.

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.680
It's just so nice not to have
to manage machines.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.470
People, once they buy into
or start using a managed

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.150
platform, they really don't
want to go back into doing

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.590
things themselves.

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:59.500
At the same time, when I talk to
new developers, I find that

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.330
there's a big kind of hurdle
to that first Hello World

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.730
program, if you will, where
you're trying to get your

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.570
environment set up,
these new tools.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.940
And you just want to figure
out how to run the thing

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.160
end-to-end, and you get
those two simple

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.200
words on the screen--

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.250
Hello World.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.660
And so taking a step back,
looking at these two different

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.460
stories, it really feels like
we're sort of asking

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.110
developers to make an investment
in our platform.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.840
Download this stuff.

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.530
Get it installed.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.200
Deal with the software
conflicts,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.030
administrative rights.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:33.420
Do all that stuff.

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.420
And maybe that takes
you half an hour.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.440
Maybe you spend four or five
hours on it, because there's

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.240
something weird going on
with your machine.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.320
So we're asking you
to invest first.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.230
And then we're telling you,
surely you'll fall in love.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.620
And it seems a little bit
backwards to do it that way.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.590
I feel like maybe you should
go on a date first or you

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:55.110
should have a chance to fall in
love before you make that

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.660
commitment, net investment.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:01.760
So with that in mind, I thought,
well, how can I bring

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:07.100
dating to the Cloud platform
and particularly to--

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.020
let's start with App Engine,
because I've been working

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.930
there a long time.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:15.460
So right here on this Chrome
Book, I've brought up the App

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.040
Engine documentation, the
Getting Started Guide.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.610
And along with that blog post,
we launched these little green

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.940
buttons onto the
Getting Started

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.340
documentation for Python.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:31.080
And this is sort of the
Try Me Out button.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.165
The let's go on a date, a
quick 60-second date.

00:11:35.165 --> 00:11:37.025
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
[INAUDIBLE].

00:11:37.025 --> 00:11:39.810
FRED SAUER: Let's go have
a root beer float.

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:40.760
Let's go together.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.890
STEPHANIE LIU: Fred is building
dating applications.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:43.141
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:46.230
FRED SAUER: And the button's
green, so let's click on that.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.940
And what it does, it takes
you right into the Cloud

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.480
Playground here, loads up
the same source code.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.750
And let me just enlarge
that a bit for you.

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:58.210
And this is our Hello World
sample code that

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.190
we tell you to use.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:04.000
And with one click, I can see
the output, and I can see

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.440
Hello World right there.

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.000
Now that was a lot easier than
configuring a machine and

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.860
downloading software, and am I
doing it right, and watching a

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.170
bunch of YouTube videos.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.450
And could go on and on about how
long it takes to get here.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:20.770
And I get this realtime
experience.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.210
So let's change the code.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.310
Let's say, Hello Tech Roundup.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.710
Oh, and we need a hashtag.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.940
So gdtech, right?

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:33.320
VAN RIPER: Or we'll put
a little yee haa.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.652
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:36.652 --> 00:12:37.604
VAN RIPER: Sorry.

00:12:37.604 --> 00:12:38.645
FRED SAUER: We could.

00:12:38.645 --> 00:12:40.261
We could.

00:12:40.261 --> 00:12:42.630
If only we could add
sound effects.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.346
That's a future request
right there.

00:12:44.346 --> 00:12:45.160
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Let's
just put that in the

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.245
queue for next time.

00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:49.380
FRED SAUER: Very good.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:51.520
So we've done Hello World, and
now you want to take it maybe

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.490
a step further.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:56.325
The drink's going well, and now
let's order an appetizer

00:12:56.325 --> 00:12:57.240
or something else.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.120
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: Dinner
maybe, you know?

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.600
FRED SAUER: Maybe
a full dinner.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.950
Let's go back to the
main screen.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.360
So I just clicked on the
Cloud Playground there.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.660
And I'm going to take our next
App, which is the Guest Book.

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:14.870
And we pop into that project,
and we have a look there.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:19.220
Let's just run it and see
what it looks like.

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.230
And there's our Guest Book.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.060
Pretty simple application.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.410
If you walk through our
documentation, and you go

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.730
through the different steps, at
the end, you're Hello World

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.590
is transformed into
a Guest Book.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.400
So this is exactly kind of the
Getting Started experience,

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.000
but a little bit accelerated
for this speed dating

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.710
experience.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.670
So let's sign our Guest Book.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.240
I'm the first visitor here.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.150
And so I'm going to sign
it with my name.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:47.810
This is actually persisting this
data into the App Engine

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:50.720
Data Store, zero
configuration.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.850
App Engine is replicating this
data to multiple data centers.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:56.640
If a meteor comes down and hits
one of the data centers,

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.450
my app still keeps running.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.990
It's kind of amazing technology,
and it's all

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:03.020
behind this little
green button.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.030
VAN RIPER: The Easy button.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.470
FRED SAUER: The Easy button.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.780
So that's it.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.200
It's a really simple demo.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.530
But you can see how you
can play around with

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.060
the real APIs here.

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:17.820
You can try out URL Fetch and
connect to another service on

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.260
the internet.

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.160
You can try the users API,
see what Auth looks like.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.340
You can play with the App
Engine Data Store.

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.980
You can even configure Cloud
SQL to play with

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:28.200
a relational database.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.750
There's just any number
of APIs that you

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.990
can use on App Engine.

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.100
You can try them out here.

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.370
And then once you're really
invested and you

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.750
say, you know what?

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:36.070
This is a great experience.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:37.860
I would like to take
it up a level.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.350
I want to download the
tools, and I want to

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:41.550
be productive offline.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:43.116
That's still there.

00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:45.150
VAN RIPER: Sounds great.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:46.450
Did you have some questions?

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:48.630
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
I do, actually.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.700
So what will be the next
languages that will be

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.932
available then after Python?

00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:54.220
FRED SAUER: That's a
very good question.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.540
That's kind of a persistent
question on

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.410
the App Engine team.

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.960
We just launched the
PHP runtime.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:05.180
We'd had already have an
experimental Go runtime.

00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:10.180
In production, we have Python
2.7 and Java runtimes.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.340
So that's a pretty
good question.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:15.160
The Cloud Playground I started
with Python 2.7, because that

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.650
was just the easiest
thing to do.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:20.290
Python is a scripted language
where you can

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.920
evaluate source code.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.890
So it's really easy to kind
of create this Playground

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:26.470
experience, because I can take
your source code and just pass

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:30.350
it to an eval function,
and viola, it's there.

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:35.570
With compile languages like Java
and Go, there's obviously

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:36.750
a compile step.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:38.990
And so that requires a
little bit more work.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.040
And I've been sort of looking
at that since our blog post

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.310
went out and thinking maybe I
can use Compute Engine to

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:50.460
combine with App Engine and kind
of do this compile step.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.440
But what was interesting is the
blog post went out, and

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:56.460
that same day, I had two or
three people walk into my

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.235
office and say, how do we
get my language going?

00:15:59.235 --> 00:16:01.710
I had the Go there, the
Java guy there.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.480
I even had Seth, the
Dart guy there.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.730
He's like, can I run Dart?

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.240
Maybe so.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.920
Let's see what we can do
in the Playground.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.870
With a Compute Engine
instance, it's a

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:16.700
regular Linux VM.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.920
You can run any software
you want.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.480
You can compile it.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.310
Maybe we can create some really
cool experiences.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.300
I'm also looking for feedback
from the community.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.560
Like what's the most interesting
thing to do next?

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.300
What would make people
the most productive?

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.150
VAN RIPER: So Google Compute
Engine is one of the building

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.890
blocks that makes this
all possible?

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.380
FRED SAUER: Currently this
is just App Engine.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:40.460
But if I were to expand it and
include Compute Engine, then

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:44.350
the capabilities really
get expanded there.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:47.390
And combining the two has a lot
of benefits, because App

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.960
Engine allows this kind
of managed platform.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.840
Instances are scaled up
automatically for you.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.630
You don't have to worry
about a lot of things.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.300
And Compute Engine gives you
this flexibility to run

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.240
arbitrary binary code.

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.030
So combining those two things,
maybe together with some APIs

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:07.970
to allow you to deploy like a
private version of Playground

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.066
so that you can play around with
just your source code,

00:17:11.066 --> 00:17:12.932
it's all possible.

00:17:12.932 --> 00:17:14.599
STEPHANIE LIU: So you've touched
on the architecture,

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.170
like the backend architecture
a little bit.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.215
So one of the questions from the
Google Moderator that we

00:17:20.215 --> 00:17:21.099
sent out when we
were staying in

00:17:21.099 --> 00:17:22.589
Colorado was about AngularJS.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:24.700
So do you want to talk a little
bit about the frontend

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.149
of how you built this?

00:17:26.149 --> 00:17:27.940
FRED SAUER: Yeah.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.430
So the Cloud Playground right
now is kind of a stack, a

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.080
two-layer cake, if you will.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.990
A two-layer desert cake.

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:37.840
The bottom layer is this
evaluation layer that just

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.950
takes your source code and
executes it, and gives you the

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.940
results back.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:46.840
And it's the part in this demo
that displays this bottom

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.610
green box here.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.000
That's where the output is.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.670
And there's no real UI for it.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.550
It's just running your code.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.860
And that piece, in the Open
Source Repository that was

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:56.740
called Mimic.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:00.460
Because it's trying to mimic a
real application environment,

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.660
doing some tricks.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.780
On top of that, the top layer
of the cake or the icing, is

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:05.890
this user interface.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.310
And that's the Cloud Playground,
everything that

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:08.960
you've seen in the demo.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.910
And its an AngularJS app,
because Angular's just really

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.800
easy for building web
applications.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:21.580
And one thing that I really
like about Angular is that

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.880
when you view source--

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:30.330
and let's do that right here
and actually let's grab the

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:32.540
project page.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.090
Maybe the main page,
the main HTML page.

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.580
So typically when you're
building web applications, you

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.970
would have some sort
of templating

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.460
language on the server.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.860
And the server would take
whatever code you've written

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.560
in some template-- maybe it's
Django, maybe it's Jinja2,

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.570
maybe it's something
else, GSPs--

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.710
translated to HTML, send it down
to the browser, and the

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:54.270
browser would interpret it.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.650
And so as a developer, you're
always doing this mental math

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:01.090
or this mental transformation,
where you're looking at the

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.640
template language and you're
trying to imagine in your head

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.940
what the HTML is going
to look like.

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.970
And then what the browser is
going to do with that HTML and

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.600
then what the UI is going
to look like.

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.310
And so you're sort of always
one level removed from the

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.520
actual HTML that you're
trying to build, which

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.360
is the native language.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.260
So if you look at an Angular
HTML page and you look at the

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.180
source code, you can
actually read it.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.540
It is the template itself.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.950
So right here, I just search
for this Angular expression

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:35.840
called ng-repeat, which tells it
to repeat certain elements.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.250
So you see here I have a
heading, which is My Projects.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:44.570
And then I have this
table with a

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.940
table row that's repeated.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:50.650
And it's repeated once for every
project that I have.

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.700
So what does that look like?

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.400
That's right here, these
two projects.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.410
These are two rows
in the table.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:01.660
And so I can look at this code,
and I can write all my

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.760
HTML, and I don't have to do
this kind of mental math.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:06.160
VAN RIPER: You can actually
look at that on a browser.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.840
FRED SAUER: You can
look in a browser.

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.100
VAN RIPER: All the data isn't
there, but you get some sample

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.470
data in what you've done.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:12.710
FRED SAUER: Exactly.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.310
So you can debug applications.

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.570
And I think one of the tag
lines, to kind of paraphrase

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:24.160
it for AngularJS, is it's the
HTML development experience if

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.120
HTML had been written for
dynamic web applications.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.460
And I think that really kind of
sums it up for me, is that

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.610
HTML was designed
for static apps.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.650
We've done all these hacks
to make it dynamic.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:40.190
But once you throw in Angular,
it feels like you're in a

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.900
natural development environment,
and you want to

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.800
build more apps.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.800
And that's, ultimately, I think
what we're out and about

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.930
in Google Developer Relations,
is making the development

00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:55.300
experience really good
for developers.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:57.660
Having that best experience for
your productive, you're

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.050
building stuff, you want
to build more stuff.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.220
Getting that excitement
back into development.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:03.520
That's what Angular is about.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:04.770
And that's what the Cloud
Playground's about.

00:21:07.142 --> 00:21:09.860
STEPHANIE LIU: So going back to
architecture a little bit.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:13.980
We had the Python,
Ruby, JavaScript

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.620
evaluators in the browser.

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.710
It has been really great.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:20.410
What were some of the
main challenges?

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.860
Was your approach any different
than some of those

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.100
evaluators?

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:23.770
FRED SAUER: It was.

00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.750
I looked at a lot of different
playgrounds.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:31.350
You have, obviously, the sites
like jsFiddle that allow you

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:34.920
to manipulate some JavaScript,
HTML, and CSS and sort of try

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.370
out widgets or little things
in a web browser.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:42.820
There's a lot of tools out there
that lets you evaluate a

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:47.590
snippet of code in a web
browser, GoLang, for example.

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:51.780
If you look at the Google I/O
concurrency slides, there's a

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.280
nice little HTML 5 slide deck
with code snippets and a

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.130
little Run button.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.490
And every time you click Run,
the code executes in the

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:58.780
server, and you see
the results.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:01.340
And you can kind of interact
with the code.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.850
Even the GoLang tour.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.550
The Dart language has similar
tour where you can go through

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:10.360
and edit code in the
browser and run it.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.790
But almost all of these
Playgrounds

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:15.990
are our snippet based.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.170
They're sort of about
learning the

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:18.780
fundamentals of the language.

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:20.450
What does print do or print F?

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:24.990
Or how do I calculate
Fibonacci numbers?

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:28.060
Or how do I do simple stuff?

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:29.310
But none of them are--

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.480
as soon as you want to go to
something more, you end up on

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:38.310
the other end of the spectrum
with kind of a full-fledged

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.340
cloud development experience,
a cloud IDE.

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:48.150
like Codenvy or what's
the other one?

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:48.690
STEPHANIE LIU: Cloud9?

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.525
VAN RIPER: Dev?

00:22:49.525 --> 00:22:50.720
FRED SAUER: DevTable.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.830
Yes, DevTable's the other.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:55.260
Just two of the ones that come
to mind that have kind of App

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.150
Engine integration.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.450
So on the one end of the
experience, you have these

00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.110
little snippets.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:01.950
Let's learn the language.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.340
The other end, you have the
cloud IDE or desktop IDE,

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.880
which is a full rich
environment.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.860
Lots of functionality,
lots of productivity.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.090
But there's kind of a steep
learning curve.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.200
And there was very little
in between.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.270
And that's where the Cloud
Playground tries to fit.

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.240
It gives you access to sort
of many projects.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.200
So here, I have four different
source files in my project.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.580
And I can play around
with that.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:27.810
I can have one file here.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.440
This is my Python file where
the code executes.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.570
And I have this index
of HTML, which is

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.880
my server side template.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.975
Old-fashioned way of
using Angular.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.040
So we're trying to strike this
balance of let's get you doing

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.420
something simple like Hello
World, a Guest Book, something

00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:51.090
more than a trivial snippet of
code, without the learning

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:54.650
curve required once you go
to a full development.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.120
VAN RIPER: So that kind of is
half an answer to my next

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.200
question, which is going to
be some people were asking

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.940
whether you have integration for
cloud-based code editors

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.282
like Codenvy?

00:24:06.282 --> 00:24:09.880
FRED SAUER: I haven't really
thought a lot about it.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.930
But I think that's something
that's really interesting.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:16.630
Because what I showed here was
sort of the, I'm reading about

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.620
App Engine from the
documentation.

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:22.310
Let's upgrade me to a place
where I can edit code snippets

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.960
or tiny little projects.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.960
And the natural extension to
that is, let's say I play

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.560
around with this for a couple
hours, and I'm actually

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.010
starting to build something
interesting or I want to do

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:36.750
some tighter integration with
mobile, and I want to use

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:38.180
Cloud Endpoints.

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.850
Or I'm just doing more, and I'm
starting to get invested

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.800
in the platform.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.310
How do I take what I've
built so far and move

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.830
onto the next step?

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:49.620
So one easy way to do that might
be to have a download my

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.660
sources zip or push it to a get
repository so I can play

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:53.500
around with it.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.060
But I think another great option
would be let's export

00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.036
it to Codenvy.

00:24:59.036 --> 00:25:01.640
And let's upgrade my experience
from this

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.950
Playground to a full-fledged
IDE.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.490
STEPHANIE LIU: Is that
like going steady?

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:07.000
FRED SAUER: Yeah.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.945
VAN RIPER: It's gone past
the dating stage.

00:25:08.945 --> 00:25:09.795
FRED SAUER: Yeah.

00:25:09.795 --> 00:25:11.456
It's like getting engaged.

00:25:11.456 --> 00:25:13.087
STEPHANIE LIU: Let's see
how long we take

00:25:13.087 --> 00:25:14.150
this metaphor out.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:14.780
Keep it getting.

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.395
FRED SAUER: I think when you
push your code to production--

00:25:16.395 --> 00:25:17.888
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: You're now
watching movies at home, when

00:25:17.888 --> 00:25:18.572
you're on the couch.

00:25:18.572 --> 00:25:20.940
FRED SAUER: I think when you
ultimately push your code to

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:23.140
production and do a full deploy,
I think that's like

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:23.966
getting married.

00:25:23.966 --> 00:25:26.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:26.942 --> 00:25:29.820
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: That
was a good run.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.640
STEPHANIE LIU: Then we took
it all the way to the end.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.900
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO: We did.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:35.643
VAN RIPER: And that does bring
us to the end, I think.

00:25:35.643 --> 00:25:38.100
STEPHANIE LIU: Did you have
any final thoughts?

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.180
You mentioned feedback
a little earlier.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.470
FRED SAUER: Yeah, I'd love
to get feedback.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.860
Maybe the best place is on the
blog post on the Google Cloud

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:49.980
Platform, just comments there.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.700
Reach out via email,
of course, is

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.500
always great as well.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:54.220
Just discussion online.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.110
I'd love to see what people
build and then also would

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.070
really like to hear where we
should go next with the Cloud

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.255
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:00.255 --> 00:26:01.970
VAN RIPER: Great.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:05.350
So all the things we talked
about today, we'll have links

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:09.110
in the show notes and stuff.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:11.970
I was going to do a few quick
shout outs before we end this

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.180
week's show.

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:15.830
As was mentioned, Codenvy,
we recently had some

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:19.390
announcements about the third
party ability to edit code on

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.670
Chrome Books in the cloud.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:22.400
So you should check that out,
especially if you're a Chrome

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.700
Book or Chrome Pixel,
like Fred is.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.860
As some of you may know, we
recently had the two-year

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.200
birthday celebration
for Google+.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:38.040
That was June 28 in 2011
that it was launched.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.080
And Chris Messina has a nice
post on G+, of course.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.100
Properly hashtagged, I assume.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.750
And that will be in
the notes as well.

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:50.250
And then I wanted to end with
a shout out particularly for

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:52.920
our community folks, the Google
Developer Groups.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.440
There was this recent Android
Developer Days

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.960
in Ankara in Turkey.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.780
But it wasn't just the
GDGs in Turkey.

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:00.930
There were actually 14 separate
GDGs from multiple

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.170
countries that collaborated on
bringing together the Android

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:06.160
Developer Days in Ankara, and
there were more than 1,000

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.380
participants.

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.990
So that really deserves a
special shout out in terms of

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:11.920
community development efforts.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.910
And if you would like your
community efforts, your

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.620
developer-- it doesn't have to
be a Google Developer Group.

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.350
Just Google Developer
related technology.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.480
You can kind of shout out to
us on Google+ with the

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.820
hashtags gdtech about it.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.620
We're going to end with a
magic moment from the

00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:32.850
Developer Days in Ankara,
a photo from there.

00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:34.670
And if you'd like to see your
photos at the end of some

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:38.500
future segment, just add the
gdtech hashtag and hashtag

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:41.315
magic for magic moments.

00:27:41.315 --> 00:27:45.032
And with that, I think
call it a wrap.

00:27:45.032 --> 00:27:46.130
FRED SAUER: I think
that's a wrap.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:47.740
ADRIANA CERUNDOLO:
That's a wrap.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:48.040
STEPHANIE LIU: Totally.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:48.940
VAN RIPER: [WHIP  SOUND]

00:27:48.940 --> 00:28:00.340
