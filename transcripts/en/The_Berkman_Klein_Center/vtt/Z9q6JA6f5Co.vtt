00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.120
 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.810
Many cases implicating
the fair use doctrine

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.420
have been decided by the
federal courts since 1976,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.826
when section 107 was added
to the federal statute.

00:00:34.826 --> 00:00:38.520
The most important of those cases are,
of course, the three United States

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.830
Supreme Court decisions that I
reviewed in the previous segment

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.350
of this lecture.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.240
But those three decisions
leave many issues unresolved.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.020
Some but not all of the gaps
left by the Supreme Court

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.010
have been filled by the
lower court's rulings.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.550
In this segment of the lecture, I'll try
to describe the shape of the fair use

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.070
doctrine today.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.220
I'll attempt both to identify the
dimensions of the doctrine that are now

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.320
reasonably well settled and to highlight
the dimensions that remain contested.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.990
For this purpose, I'll be using the
now familiar map of copyright law.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.920
As we've seen, courts almost always
analyze their fair use defenses

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.990
by considering the four
factors listed in section 107.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.640
I will follow their lead in this regard.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.470
In other words, I will describe to
you what each factor has come to mean

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.780
and the role it has come to play in
the overall landscape of fair use.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.730
The first factor, as you now know,
concerns the purpose and character

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.050
of the defendant's activity.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.000
The courts look askance
at some kinds of behavior

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.200
and regard much more favorably
other kinds of behavior.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.750
Four subfactors under
this general heading

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.130
can be distilled from the case law.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.420
These so-called subfactors
identify the kinds of things

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.520
that the courts attend
to when discussing

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.567
the character of the
defendant's behavior.

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:12.400
The first subfactor is
whether the defendant

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.000
is engaged in commercial or
non-commercial activities.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.800
As you might imagine, the more
commercial the defendant's conduct,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.300
the less likely is the defendant to
be given the benefit of fair use.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.350
This subfactor, as we've already
seen, figured prominently

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.340
in the Betamax case.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.177
It has been declining
in importance since then

00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:33.635
but has not disappeared altogether.

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:36.160
 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.920
You might think that the
application of this subfactor

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.740
would be straightforward,
and often it is.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.220
But difficulties arise out of the
ambiguity of the term "commercial."

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.300
Courts rarely define
that term explicitly.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.630
Most often, they seem tacitly to
assume that "commercial" means revenue

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.760
generating or perhaps profit making.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.410
But occasionally, in
borderline cases, courts

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.270
will attempt to define
the term more precisely.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.000
One such definition can be
found in the Harper &amp; Row case.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.190
There, Justice O'Connor
defined "commercial"

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.380
as "whether the user stands to
profit from the exploitation

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.200
of the copyrighted material without
paying the customary price."

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.330
This would be an altogether
conventional definition

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.810
but for the term
"customary," which seems

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.110
to imply that some potentially
profit-making activities are

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.020
nevertheless not commercial in character
if it's not customary for firms engaged

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.700
in the activity at issue to pay for
access to works of the sort claimed

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.750
by the plaintiff.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.300
It's unlikely that
Justice O'Connor intended

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.735
to narrow the meaning of
"commercial" in quite this way.

00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:48.740
But judicial definitions sometimes
assume lives of their own,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.530
and this one has.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.690
So for example, the phrase
set forth on your screen

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.070
can be found in the 11th Circuit's
opinion in the Letterese case

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.437
and the Fourth Circuit's
opinion in the AV case.

00:04:03.437 --> 00:04:05.770
A much more generous definition
of the term "commercial"

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.220
can be found in the Ninth Circuit's
opinion in the Napster case.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.810
Now, we'll discuss
Napster in some detail

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.610
in the 11th lecture when
we examine, as I said,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.990
the doctrine of contributory
copyright infringement.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.029
But the basic facts of
the Napster case are

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.630
undoubtedly familiar to most of you.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.780
The Napster file sharing service did not
itself redistribute sound recordings,

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.950
but it facilitated unauthorized copying
and distribution of sound recordings

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.250
by its subscribers.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.152
One of the issues in
the infringement suit

00:04:40.152 --> 00:04:42.110
brought against Napster
by the record companies

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.660
and the music publishers was whether
the conduct of Napster subscribers

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.510
qualified as fair uses, just as
the conduct of Sony's customers,

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.650
as we've seen, qualified as
fair uses in the Betamax case.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.710
The Ninth Circuit concluded no.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.210
One of the steps in the Ninth Circuit's
analysis that led to this conclusion

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.090
was the judgment that the behavior
of the individual Napster users

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.980
should be considered
commercial in character.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.750
That highly counter-intuitive finding
rested upon the capacious definition

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.250
of "commercial" set
forth on your screen.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.250
In the Ninth Circuit's judgment,
the term included, quote,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.870
"repeated and exploitative
copying in order

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.060
to save the expense of
purchasing legitimate copies."

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.930
Thus, even though the Napster
users were not making any money,

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.670
they were engaged in commercial
behavior, said the Ninth Circuit,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.640
because they were avoiding paying money.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.530
This is an outlier position.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.500
It's far from clear that other
courts in analogous circumstances

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.510
would follow the Ninth Circuit's lead.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.420
 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.040
In some fair use cases,
the defendant's behavior

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.380
does not give rise directly
to an increased revenue stream

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.890
but contributes to an overall
process or enterprise whose

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.700
ultimate objective is
plainly commercial.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.850
The courts have not yet worked out a
consistent way of handling such cases.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.260
So here are two influential decisions
involving this general issue

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.040
that resolved it in different ways.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.810
The first case is Sega
Enterprises versus Accolade,

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.490
which was decided by the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 1992.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.690
To understand the decision
requires a bit of background.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:37.130
In the context of computer software,
the term "interoperability"

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.750
refers to the ability of one program
to talk or work with another.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.170
An especially important context
involving interoperability

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.040
concerns the relationship between
operating systems and application

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.960
programs.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.530
The intellectual property
questions implicated by this issue

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.460
have been examined most thoroughly
by Julie Cohen, who teaches copyright

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.720
at Georgetown.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.690
As Cohen observed in an
article some time ago,

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.970
there are three main
business models adopted

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.590
by different groups of
software firms pertaining

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:11.530
to the issue of interoperability.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.520
The first approach,
exemplified by Microsoft,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.550
grants the developers of application
programs free or more or less free

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.630
access to the interfaces
necessary to render

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:29.410
their programs compatible with
a proprietary operating system.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.710
The second business model, which
was pursued at least at one time

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.020
by several game console
manufacturers, including Nintendo,

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.250
entails permitting the developer
of application programs--

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.810
in this case, games-- to
manufacture and distribute

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:47.420
games that would run on a
proprietary operating system console,

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:53.010
but only if the game
developers pay license fees.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:58.160
The third strategy, exemplified
by MAI Systems Corporation,

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.480
repudiates interoperability.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.630
Manufacturers adopting
this approach seek

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.440
to maintain complete control
over application programs

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.950
as well as their operating systems.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.010
The Sega case involved the
second of these three approaches.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.380
The plaintiff, Sega,
manufactured and sold

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:20.050
game consoles which
included operating systems.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:22.750
A small piece of the
operating system consisted

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.470
of a bit of code known
as a lockout program.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:30.580
Sega's own games as well as the
games produced by independent

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.730
but licensed game
manufacturers included the key

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:40.470
necessary to open the
lock on Sega's system.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.179
The defendant in this case, Accolade,
wished to manufacture and distribute

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:48.310
games compatible with the Sega system
without obtaining a license from Sega

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:51.420
and without paying the
associated license fees.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.370
To do this, Accolade
engineers make copies

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.560
of significant portions
of Sega's software,

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.170
used decompilers to ascertain
the crucial piece of source code,

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.320
and then included the
essential bit in its own games,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.630
thereby rendering them
compatible with the Sega system.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:15.350
Sega brought suit asserting,
among other things,

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.280
that by copying Sega's software in
the course of this reverse engineering

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.910
process, Accolade had engaged
in copyright infringement.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.660
The Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.900
ruled that Accolade had indeed
violated section 106(1) of the statute,

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:35.840
but it escaped liability
under the fair use doctrine.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.710
The central theme in the
Ninth Circuit's opinion

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:44.190
was that Accolade's purpose was
legitimate and socially beneficial.

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:47.470
It's not altogether
obvious why, unless one

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:49.900
believes that increasing the
availability of video games

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.890
enhances social welfare.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.710
But in any event, our
main concern here is

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.820
with the portion of the
court's opinion that

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:01.190
addresses the nature and character
of the defendant's activity

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:04.800
and specifically whether
Accolade's conduct should

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.524
be described as commercial or not.

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:10.440
The Ninth Circuit, when
addressing that issue,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.860
conceded that Accolade
was a for-profit company

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.080
and the ultimate ambition
of the challenged behavior

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.050
was, of course, to enhance
Accolade's profits.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.260
Nevertheless, the Ninth
Circuit refused to classify

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:27.990
Accolade's unauthorized copying
as commercial in character.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.280
Here's the relevant
passage from the opinion.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.370
Quote, "Taken together,
these facts indicate

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.170
that although Accolade's
ultimate purpose was

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:41.820
the release of Genesis-compatible games
for sale, its direct purpose in copying

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.410
Sega's code, and thus its direct
use of the copyrighted material,

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:51.280
was simply to study the functional
requirements for Genesis compatibility

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.670
so that it could modify
existing games and make

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.160
them usable with the Genesis console.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.210
Moreover, no other method of studying
those codes was available to Accolade.

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.940
On these facts, we
conclude that Accolade

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:10.630
copied Sega's code for a legitimate,
essentially non-exploitative purpose

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.380
and that the commercial
aspects of its use

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:17.440
can best be described as
of minimal significance."

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.840
OK, that's one approach.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.140
The second case was decided a few
years later by the Court of Appeals

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.570
for the Second Circuit.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.710
The essential facts were as follows.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:34.700
Texaco employed between 400
and 500 researchers nationwide.

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.570
Their job was to conduct
scientific research in order

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:42.910
to develop new products and
technologies in the petroleum industry.

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:46.390
Texaco subscribed to
various scientific journals.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:50.170
However, it did not purchase
enough copies of those journals

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:53.950
to serve fully the needs
of its many researchers.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.530
A custom seems to have
developed within the Texaco

00:11:56.530 --> 00:12:00.490
facilities under which individual
scientists would either

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.000
make themselves or ask
to be made for them

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.230
xerox copies of articles
contained in the print journals

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.910
that the scientist might find
useful in their own research.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.480
The publishers and copyright
owners of the articles

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.160
challenged this practice
as copyright infringement.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:25.670
Texaco's primary line of defense
for this behavior was fair use.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.040
The Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.570
ultimately sided with the publishers
and rejected the fair use defense.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.080
The step in the court's analysis
with which we are primarily concerned

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:42.130
here involves whether the behavior of
the scientists qualified as commercial.

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.970
The Court of Appeals
equivocated on this point.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.280
Unlike the Ninth Circuit,
the Second Circuit

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.040
did not discount altogether
the profit-making objective

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.380
of the company as a whole.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.040
However, it too accorded
some weight to the fact

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:02.300
that the immediate objective
of the scientists was research.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:06.190
Here's the key passage in
the Second Circuit's opinion.

00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:10.580
Quote, "In this particular case, the
link between Texaco's commercial gain

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:16.630
and its copying is somewhat attenuated,
the copying at most merely facilitating

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.060
Chickering's research--"
Chickering was one

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:22.230
of the scientists-- "that might
have led to the production

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:25.040
of commercially-valuable products.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:30.150
Still, we need not ignore the for-profit
nature of Texaco's enterprise,

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.830
especially since we can
confidently conclude

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:36.130
that Texaco reaps at least some
indirect economic advantage

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.660
from its photocopying.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:42.740
As the publishers emphasized,
Texaco's photocopying for Chickering

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.010
could be regarded simply as
another factor of production

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:51.660
utilizing Texaco's efforts to
develop profitable products.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:56.170
Conceptualized in this way, it is
not obvious why it is fair for Texaco

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:59.700
to avoid having to pay at least
some price to copyright holders

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:05.910
for the right to photocopy
the original articles."

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:10.280
So where does the combination
of these two cases leave us?

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.070
The answer is, unfortunately,
without clear guidance.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.630
When employees within
a for-profit enterprise

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:21.420
engage in unauthorized copying
whose immediate purpose might

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.390
be characterized as research
or study, the employer

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:30.400
may be able to contend that it should
not be hit with the label "commercial."

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.350
But how much latitude it
will be given on this score

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.900
is, unfortunately, hard to predict.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:39.745
 

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:42.120
As I said, the question of
whether a defendant's behavior

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.940
is commercial or
non-commercial in character

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.910
remains a significant part
of the fair use inquiry.

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:53.640
However, that subfactor is
being eclipsed increasingly

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.800
by the second subfactor
highlighted on your screen, which

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.680
asks whether the defendant's
behavior is transformative.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.800
As we saw, this theme was highlighted
by the United States Supreme Court

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.100
in the Campbell case.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.230
Since the Campbell decision,
the issue of transformativeness

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.140
has grown further in importance.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.180
Today, it's fair to say that
defendants unable to persuade

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.170
a court that their
activities are transformative

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.240
are unlikely to prevail
on fair use grounds,

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.110
whereas defendants who are able to
assume the mantle of transformativeness

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.240
are quite likely to prevail.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.440
As one might expect,
litigants now spend much

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.590
of their time struggling
over who has the better

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.380
of the argument on this issue.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.890
Unfortunately, as we will see,
there remains significant ambiguity

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:46.910
concerning the possible meaning or
meanings of the term "transformative."

00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:50.970
This uncertainty destabilizes
fair use analyses

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:55.340
and increases the notorious
unpredictability of the doctrine

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.644
as a whole.

00:15:57.644 --> 00:15:59.560
The only dimension of
this issue that is clear

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.840
cut concerns the status of parody.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:06.430
It's now well settled that
parodies, even bad parodies,

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:10.010
do qualify as transformative uses.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.200
Plaintiffs no longer contended parodies
of their works are not transformative.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:19.000
Instead, plaintiffs seek to persuade
tribunals that, in borderline cases,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.620
the defendants' works do
not constitute parodies.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:26.020
Much hinges on this issue.

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.780
When evaluating disputes of
this sort, courts commonly

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.310
make reference to the
definitions of parody

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:34.510
that were offered by the
Supreme Court in Campbell.

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.030
You've seen these definitions
once before in this lecture.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.550
Here they are again.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:44.480
Quote, "Modern dictionaries describe a
parody as a 'literary or artistic work

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.790
that imitates the characteristic style
of an author or work for comic effect

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:52.350
or ridicule' or as a 'composition
in prose or verse in which

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:56.550
the characteristic turns of thought and
phrase in an author or class of authors

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:01.480
are imitated in such a way as to
make them appear ridiculous.' For

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:06.410
the purposes of copyright law, the nub
of the definitions is the use of some

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:11.310
elements of a prior author's
composition to create a new one that,

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:16.680
at least in part, comments
on that author's works."

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:22.180
The ambit of this definition is
perhaps best illustrated by example.

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.579
Annie Liebovitz, as you likely know, is
a famous and accomplished photographer.

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:32.900
In 1991, she took a nude photograph
of the pregnant Demi Moore

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.460
which appeared on the cover of the
August 1991 issue of Vanity Fair

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.370
magazine.

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:44.172
The photo plainly alluded to
Botticelli's Birth of Venus.

00:17:44.172 --> 00:17:44.880
Here's a closeup.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.610
 

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:55.820
In 1994, Paramount Pictures began to
promote its upcoming movie Naked Gun 33

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.590
1/3.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:00.840
One of its posters included
this composite photo

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.290
of Leslie Nielsen, the star of the film.

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.730
Liebovitz brought a
copyright infringement suit.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:13.630
Interestingly, Paramount conceded that
its poster violated Liebovitz's rights

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:18.850
under section 106 but
sought refuge in fair use.

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:23.060
The district court granted summary
judgment for the defendant,

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:26.140
and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.110
A key step in the Court
of Appeals analysis

00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:31.740
was a determination that
the poster constituted

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.380
a parody of the Demi Moore photo.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.490
The court justified that
determination in the following terms.

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:43.390
Quote, "Being different from
an original does not inevitably

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:45.270
comment on the original.

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:49.270
Nevertheless, the ad--" meaning the
poster-- "is not merely different.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:52.120
It differs in a way that
may reasonably be perceived

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.740
as commenting through ridicule on
what a viewer might reasonably think

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.990
is the undue self-importance conveyed
by the subject of the Liebovitz

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.990
photograph.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.260
A photographer posing
a well-known actress

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:08.030
in a manner that calls to
mind a well-known painting

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:14.050
must expect or at least tolerate
a parodist's deflating ridicule.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.060
Apart from ridiculing
pretentiousness, the ad

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.010
might also reasonably be perceived
as interpreting the Liebovitz

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.630
photograph to extol the beauty
of the pregnant female body

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:30.030
and, rather unchivalrously, to express
disagreement with this message.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.380
The district court
thought such a comment

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:37.850
was reasonably to be perceived from the
contrast between a serious portrayal

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.000
of a beautiful woman taking great pride
in the majesty of her pregnant body

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.615
and a ridiculous image of a smirking,
foolish-looking pregnant man," close

00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:47.115
quote.

00:19:47.115 --> 00:19:49.900
 

00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:52.940
A very similar analysis
underlay the determination

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:56.660
five years later by the Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:00.340
that a series of photos
by Thomas Forsythe

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:06.710
constituted parodies of Mattel's
copyrighted character Barbie.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.540
Here's a familiar image of Barbie.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.110
Mattel owns copyrights
to parts of this figure--

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:18.570
specifically, in the court's words,
quote, "to the unadorned Superstar

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:24.080
Barbie head and parts of the figure,
including revisions to the hands, feet,

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:28.150
neck, shoulder, and
buttocks," close quote.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:33.350
Forsythe, without permission, took a
series of photos of naked Barbie dolls.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.660
Here are some of Forsythe's photos.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:21:08.210
 

00:21:08.210 --> 00:21:12.270
The Ninth Circuit, when the
case arrived at its doorstep,

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:17.930
concluded that Forsythe's photos
plainly qualified as parodies.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.360
Quote, "Mattel, through
impressive marketing,

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:27.110
has established Barbie as the ideal
American woman and a symbol of American

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.150
girlhood for many.

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.870
As abundantly evidenced in the
record, Mattel's advertisements

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.470
show these plastic dolls
dressed in various outfits,

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:40.160
leading glamorous lifestyles, and
engaged in exciting activities.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.320
To sell its product,
Mattel uses associations

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.850
of beauty, wealth, and glamour.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:48.350
Forsythe turns this
image on its head, so

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:51.480
to speak, by displaying
carefully-positioned, nude, and

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.990
sometimes frazzled-looking Barbies
in often ridiculous and apparently

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.010
dangerous situations.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.750
His lighting, background,
props, and camera angles

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.780
all serve to create a context
for Mattel's copyrighted

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.830
work that transform Barbie's meaning.

00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:09.880
Forsythe presents the viewer with
a different set of associations

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.540
and a different context
for this plastic figure.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.160
In some of Forsythe's photos, Barbie
is about to be destroyed or harmed

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.160
by domestic life in the
form of kitchen appliances

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.310
yet continues displaying her well-known
smile, disturbingly oblivious

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.259
to her predicament.

00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:28.300
As perpetrated in some of
Forsythe's photographs,

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.390
the appliances are
substantial and overwhelming,

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.530
while Barbie looks defenseless.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:36.840
In other photographs, Forsythe conveys
a sexualized perspective of Barbie

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.000
by showing the nude doll in
sexually-suggestive contexts.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.270
It's not difficult to see the
commentary that Forsythe intended

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:49.570
or the harm that he perceived in
Barbie's influence on gender roles

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:55.020
and the position of women
in society," close quote.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:58.990
An important procedural
issue lurks in this passage.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:02.600
The Ninth Circuit is not interested
in what the public at large

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.930
thinks of Forsythe's photos.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:08.460
Indeed, it approved the
trial court's refusal

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.580
to consider a survey that Mattel
had commissioned on the issue.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:13.650
Why?

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:18.040
Because, quote, "the issue of whether a
work is a parody is a question of law,

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:21.560
not a matter of public
majority opinion," close quote.

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.780
 

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.150
OK, so those are two cases in
which the defendant successfully

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:31.030
invoked the privileged
status of parodies.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:35.370
To repeat, parodies are not per se
entitled to the fair use defense,

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:39.700
but attaining that status
helps you a great deal.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:41.720
In part because of the
importance of this issue,

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.160
courts are not always so
receptive to defendants' claims

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.670
that their works constitute parodies.

00:23:47.670 --> 00:23:52.720
For example, the Second Circuit brushed
aside the contention of Jeffrey Koons

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.500
that when he used this
photograph as the reference work

00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:01.200
for this painted wooden
sculpture he meant

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.600
to mock the conventional,
saccharine character of the photo.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.330
The court rejected Koons' claim that his
work was a parody of the plaintiff's.

00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.870
Its rejection was based
in part on the fact

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.910
that the photograph in the
upper left of this slide

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:19.330
was not widely known to the public,
and thus most viewers of the sculpture

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:22.080
would not know what it was aimed at.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:24.860
But in addition, the
court was not persuaded

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.720
that the sculpture meant
to critique the photo.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.740
Quote, "The problem in the
instant case is that even

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:33.810
given that String of Puppies
is a satirical critique

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:37.680
of our materialistic society,
it is difficult to discern

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:42.340
any parody of the
photograph Puppies itself.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:46.580
We conclude, therefore, that this
first factor of the fair use doctrine

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:49.360
cuts against a finding of fair use.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.270
The circumstances of this case indicate
that Koons' copying of the photograph

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:58.430
Puppies was done in bad faith
primarily for profit-making motives

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:04.760
and did not constitute a
parody of the original work."

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.590
The same court was similarly unimpressed
by the efforts of the defendants

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:13.040
in the Castle Rock case, which I
discussed in the preceding lecture,

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.260
to establish that their trivia book
was a parody of the Seinfeld television

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.230
series.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:24.940
The defendant argued, our trivia book,
quote, "is a quintessential example

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.700
of a critical text of
the TV environment,

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:31.590
exposing all of the show's nothingness
to articulate its true motive

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:36.040
forces and its social
and moral dimensions."

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.650
The court was unmoved.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.920
Quote, "Any transformative purpose
possessed by the defendant's book

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.830
is slight to nonexistent.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:46.390
We reject the argument that it was
created to educate Seinfeld viewers

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:50.450
or to criticize, expose, or
otherwise comment upon Seinfeld.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.560
The book's purpose, as
evidenced definitively

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:57.360
by the statements of the book's
creators and by the book itself,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.790
is to repackage Seinfeld to entertain
Seinfeld viewers," close quote.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:05.430
 

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:05.930
OK.

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:11.610
So to repeat, parodies definitively
qualify as transformative

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.490
under factor number one.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:18.270
What about a defendant's work
that criticizes a plaintiff's work

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:20.520
but does not mock it?

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:26.140
These too are highly likely to
be treated as transformative.

00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.500
Here's an example.

00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:33.010
One of John Lennon's most
famous songs is "Imagine."

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:38.111
Portions of its lyrics are
critical of organized religion.

00:26:38.111 --> 00:26:38.860
Here's an excerpt.

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.812
 

00:26:41.812 --> 00:26:45.748
It isn't hard to do.

00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:58.048
Nothing to kill or die
for, and no religion too.

00:26:58.048 --> 00:27:01.000
 

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.960
Imagine all the people--

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.670
In this case, the defendant,
without permission, included

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:13.780
this segment of Lennon's recording
of the song in a movie that

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:19.600
defended theories of intelligent design
and criticized theories of evolution.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.670
The Southern District of
New York ruled that the use

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.930
of the excerpt from Lennon's
song was transformative

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.180
because its purpose was, quote, "to
criticize what the filmmakers see

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:34.120
as the naivete of John
Lennon's views," close quote,

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:36.415
and the court went on to rule
in the defendant's favor.

00:27:36.415 --> 00:27:39.320
 

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.120
That non-parody criticism
counts as transformative is not

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.730
quite so clear as the proposition
that parody counts as transformative.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:52.670
Indeed, at least one case,
the Free Republic decision

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:56.300
decided by the Central
District of California in 2000,

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.700
seems to stand for
the opposite position.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:04.655
But the privileged status of criticism
nowadays approaches that of parody.

00:28:04.655 --> 00:28:07.960
 

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.230
Beyond this point, the
meaning of "transformative"

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:14.441
becomes increasingly
contested and murky.

00:28:14.441 --> 00:28:17.410
Here's a graphic
representation of the nature

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:20.650
of the ongoing debate on this front.

00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:24.120
Parody, as we've seen,
clearly qualifies.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.320
A work by a defendant that
criticizes the plaintiff's work

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.760
is also highly likely to
qualify as transformative.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.910
Outside of this central
zone, there are currently

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:38.180
four main competing interpretations
of "transformation."

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.910
The first treats works
that physically modify

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.710
the plaintiff's work as transformative.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.560
The second equates the term
"transformative" with "socially

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.700
beneficial."

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.100
The third attaches the term
"transformative" to works

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.360
by defendants that
have purposes that are

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.590
different from the purposes
of the plaintiff's works.

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:04.660
And the fourth associates
the term "transformative"

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:09.250
with creative uses of plaintiff's works.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:13.190
This diagram intentionally depicts
these interpretations as overlapping

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.130
because, as you might
imagine, some works

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:19.460
will qualify as transformative
under more than one interpretation.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.820
But in its current form, the
diagram is misleading to the extent

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.190
it suggests that each
category has crisp boundaries.

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.840
In truth, they're all matters of degree.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.510
For example, one defendant's work
might be slightly socially beneficial,

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:38.680
while another might be strongly so.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.460
Thus, a more accurate
depiction would recognize

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:46.520
that each category varies in
density-- strong near the core, weaker

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.040
near the edges.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:53.200
If one maps onto this diagram the
leading cases involving fair use,

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.950
the result would look
something like this.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.750
I've tried, by locating
each case or set of cases,

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:07.140
to suggest which and how many of
the meanings of "transformative"

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:09.810
they might qualify for.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:14.530
The colors of the case names
indicate who won or was favored.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.990
In the green cases, the defendant
prevailed-- in other words,

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:20.060
the court either ruled
in the defendant's favor

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.120
or indicated the fair use was likely.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.870
In the red cases, the plaintiff
prevailed in the same sense.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:32.800
In the black cases, the issue
of fair use was never resolved.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.010
Some of these cases
you already know about.

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:37.337
Others I will discuss
later, and still others

00:30:37.337 --> 00:30:39.420
will be addressed in the
classes and seminars that

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.640
accompany this lecture series.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.820
One of the functions of this map
is to suggest the relative strength

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:52.950
of these four competing interpretations
within the current case law.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:56.230
For a while, the physical
modifications approach

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:01.390
seemed to have a significant
following, but it has since faded.

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.470
Why?

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.650
Most likely because
this interpretation is

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:08.800
hard to reconcile with the
proposition that, as you know,

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.530
copyright owners enjoy under
section 106(2), the right

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:16.280
to control the making
of derivative works.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:19.210
Thus, as you'll notice, many
of the cases within this zone

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.090
are red, meaning that the
fair use defense failed.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.870
 

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:27.480
More popular is the
second approach, which

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:30.190
looks to the degree to which
a defendant's conduct can

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:33.050
be thought of as socially beneficial.

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:39.120
However, you'll also see
some red cases in this zone.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:43.850
More popular still is the
different purposes approach.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:48.220
Most of the cases in this zone,
especially recent cases, you'll see

00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:50.550
are green.

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:54.550
The last approach finds as yet only
modest support in the case law,

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:58.000
although it figures more
strongly in scholarship.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.340
We'll return to this
fourth option when we

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.620
discuss cultural theory
in the next lecture.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:10.240
So that's where things currently
stand with respect to transformation.

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.060
Because of the prominent place of this
issue in modern fair use doctrine,

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.340
the struggle over the
meaning of this term

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:21.050
will likely continue for some time.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:25.220
I've devoted disproportionate
attention to the first two subfactors

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:30.050
of factor number one because
they're particularly important.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.810
The current status of
the other subfactors

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:38.610
and of the second and third
factors in the list in section 107

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:41.600
can be described much more quickly.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.190
You'll recall that Justice
O'Connor in Harper &amp; Row

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:49.100
decreed that fair use presupposes,
quote, "good faith and fair dealing,"

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.520
close quote.

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.780
As you might expect, lower
courts give that statement

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.880
some weight, but as it
turns out, not much.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:00.270
Here's a representative
statement by the Second Circuit.

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:03.300
Quote, "Just how much weight
within the first factor

00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.130
should a court place on
this subfactor of bad faith?

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:10.370
Campbell provides support
for the proposition

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.870
that while the good or
bad faith of a defendant

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.300
generally should be
considered, it generally

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.550
contributes little to fair use analysis.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.650
We believe this analysis further
supports our conclusion that a finding

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:26.060
of bad faith is not to be weighed
very heavily within the first fair use

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.160
factor and cannot be made
central to fair use analysis.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.450
The Court recognized the continuing
relevance of Harper &amp; Row

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:37.520
but clarified that the bad faith
subfactor can be de-emphasized

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:45.420
and will not be dispositive of
the first factor or fair use."

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.000
The Harper &amp; Row opinion
also included a statement

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.610
suggesting that
customary activities were

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:55.310
more likely to qualify as
fair than unconventional ones.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:34:00.260
Quote, "The fair use doctrine was
predicated," said Justice O'Connor,

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:04.380
"on the author's implied consent
to reasonable and customary use

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:09.380
when he released his work
for public consumption."

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:14.270
This perspective associates
the concept of fair use

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:21.380
with a implicit license
issued by a copyright owner.

00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.610
Some scholars-- for example, Lloyd
Weinreb in an influential article

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:29.590
in the Harvard Law Review--
have endorsed this perspective.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.489
But it has little following
currently in the case law,

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:35.050
in part because so many
fair use cases nowadays

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:39.190
involve new technologies as to which
custom is essentially irrelevant.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:41.780
 

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:45.780
If the first statutory factor
focuses on the defendant,

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.730
the second focuses on the plaintiff.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.449
The basic idea here is that
some kinds of copyrighted works

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:57.450
deserve stronger protections against
unauthorized activities than do others.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.240
The way this is achieved
is by making it harder

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.750
for defendants to assert
fair use when they

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:08.230
make unauthorized uses of
the former than the latter.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:12.020
So what kinds of works are
more deserving of protection?

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:16.410
There are two well-recognized answers to
that question and one additional answer

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:20.710
that is implicit in the case law
but not expressly recognized.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.230
The two well-established
variables are A,

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.940
unpublished works get more
protection than published works,

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:33.680
and B, creative works get more
protection than factual ones.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.530
The Second Circuit's
decision in the Blanch case

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:40.440
summarizes these two variables nicely.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:44.570
Quote, "Two types of distinctions as
to the nature of the copyrighted work

00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:48.270
have emerged that have figured
in the decisions evaluating

00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:50.740
the second factor--
one, whether the work is

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:55.920
expressive or creative, such as a
work of fiction, or more factual,

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:59.160
with a greater leeway being
allowed to a claim of fair use

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:03.890
where the work is factual
or informational; and two,

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:05.860
whether the work is
published or unpublished,

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:10.416
with the scope for fair use involving
unpublished works being considerably

00:36:10.416 --> 00:36:10.915
narrower."

00:36:10.915 --> 00:36:11.705
Close quote.

00:36:11.705 --> 00:36:14.510
 

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:20.120
This point bears emphasis,
because it's not often recognized.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:25.230
Not all works, it turns out, enjoy
the same degree of protection.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:27.300
The closer you are to
the bottom left corner

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.450
of this diagram, the
stronger your legal shields.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:37.020
The closer you are to the upper right
corner, the weaker your shields.

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.370
The implicit supplement
to these two variables

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:43.900
is that, in practice,
computer software seems

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:48.060
to get less protection than
other sorts of copyrighted works.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:53.000
In other words, in the software context,
defendants have an easier road to hoe.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.890
The third factor is the least surprising
component of modern fair use doctrine.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:03.490
The more you take from a plaintiff's
work, the weaker, in general,

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:05.830
is your fair use defense.

00:37:05.830 --> 00:37:09.140
As from the Harper &amp; Row case,
the inquiry under this factor

00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:12.350
is both quantitative and qualitative.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:16.080
If you take a small slice but it's a
very important part of the plaintiff's

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.840
work, you're in trouble on this front.

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.440
Note that, at least
ostensibly, it doesn't

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.230
matter whether the slice you take
forms a large or small portion

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:27.910
of your own work.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:33.195
It's only relevant whether it's a large
and important part of the plaintiff's.

00:37:33.195 --> 00:37:35.824
 

00:37:35.824 --> 00:37:37.990
The only thing that's
surprising about this variable

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:42.090
is how often it does not prove decisive.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:44.180
Think of the cases we've
considered thus far.

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:48.320
In the Betamax case, the
VCR users were making

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.300
verbatim copies of
entire copyrighted works

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.172
and yet were found to
have engaged in fair use.

00:37:54.172 --> 00:37:57.760
In Harper &amp; Row, by contrast,
the Nation took some 300 words

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.220
from Ford's vastly larger
manuscript and still lost.

00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:05.670
 

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:08.915
We come finally to factor number four.

00:38:08.915 --> 00:38:13.330
For many years, this was said
to be the most important factor.

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:16.770
Today, it may have to play
second fiddle to factor

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:21.190
number one and the transformativeness
inquiry in particular,

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:24.570
but it's still given great weight.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:27.550
The core idea is straightforward.

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.890
The greater the injury
sustained by the plaintiff

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.970
as a result of the defendant's
conduct, the less likely

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:36.810
it is that the defendant's
conduct will be deemed fair.

00:38:36.810 --> 00:38:39.140
But as we'll see,
complexities and conflicts

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:41.500
lie just under the
surface of that statement.

00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:48.880
The first guideline when applying this
factor is that not all kinds of what

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.070
might be considered injuries count.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:55.950
In particular, it's now
reasonably clear that four types

00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:59.790
of what might be considered
losses by the plaintiff

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:02.980
are excluded from consideration.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.900
First, a plaintiff cannot claim that he
suffered economic harm because he was

00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:12.780
prevented from charging the
defendant a license fee.

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:16.670
Among the reasons that foregone
license fees from the defendant

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:19.690
are excluded from the analysis is
that otherwise the fourth factor

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:25.880
would always favor the plaintiff,
which was plainly not Congress' intent.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.070
Second, loss of revenue resulting
from the plaintiff's inability

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:33.220
to charge the defendant
or others for the right

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:38.690
to make transformative uses of the
plaintiff's work also do not count.

00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:43.030
As you can see, this subfactor
dovetails with the first factor.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.410
It reinforces the privileged
position within the fair use

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:50.700
calculus of transformative uses.

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:55.740
To illustrate, a plaintiff cannot assert
under the auspices of the fourth factor

00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:00.440
that he suffers economic losses because
of his inability to charge parodists

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.890
fees.

00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:08.030
Third, as we saw in the Campbell case,
plaintiffs cannot assert as economic

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.040
injuries diminution in their markets
resulting from defendants' criticism

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.230
or ridicule of their works.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:19.270
The borderline question, the
answer to which is not yet clear,

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:22.710
concerns injuries arising from
what might be called tarnishment

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:25.210
of the plaintiff's
work-- in other words,

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:31.930
corrosion as result of the defendant's
conduct of the positive associations

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:35.820
that the plaintiff's work has
in the minds of consumers.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:38.600
 

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.110
Finally, at least one court has
held that a plaintiff can only

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:45.350
complain of injuries to the market
for the copyrighted work at issue

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:51.802
in the case, not collateral
injuries to other copyrighted works

00:40:51.802 --> 00:40:52.760
owned by the plaintiff.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:55.400
 

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.810
These exclusions are important, but they
leave many opportunities for plaintiffs

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:02.320
to identify economic harms.

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.430
In particular plaintiffs may
count under the fourth factor

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:10.810
not only damage to the existing
markets for the copyrighted works

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:15.660
but also damage to, quote, "potential
markets," close quote, for the work,

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.060
and they may also claim
injuries that have not yet

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.850
occurred as a result of
the defendant's behavior

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.815
but that will occur if the defendant's
conduct becomes widespread.

00:41:23.815 --> 00:41:26.650
 

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:32.950
The most important and fraught word
in this formula is "potential."

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:36.790
As I say, it's now clear that
injuries to potential markets

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:39.080
count in the plaintiff's favor.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:44.360
What's unclear is what
constitutes a potential market.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.400
One can find in the case
law a broad spectrum

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:49.340
of approaches to this key question.

00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:53.000
Near one extreme is the
position apparently taken

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.750
by the Ninth Circuit in the Galoob case.

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:58.680
Potential markets consist of
markets that the plaintiff

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.890
has developed or is likely to develop.

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:04.300
This approach would exclude,
for example, markets

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:08.190
that the plaintiff lacks the
technical capacity to exploit

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:12.280
or that are within the
defendant's control.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.070
Near the opposite extreme is
the position that, as we saw,

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:20.020
was taken by Justice Blackmun
dissenting in the Betamax case.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:23.430
Any group of people who would pay
for access to the plaintiff's work

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:28.650
constitute a potential market,
even if the plaintiff is

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:31.530
unable or uninterested
in exploiting that market

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:34.480
and even if the market would not
exist but for the defendant's

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:38.850
initiative or technological innovation.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:43.190
In between these positions are
several intermediate options.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:47.430
The formulation that seems to
appear most often in the case law

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:51.870
is the one listed on the
third tier on the chart.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:55.340
The markets cognizable under
the fourth factor include,

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.730
quote, "traditional, reasonable,
or likely to be developed markets,"

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.630
close quote.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.970
But some courts expressly
or implicitly adopt

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:07.865
positions more favorable to plaintiffs
or more favorable to defendants.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:15.190
A possible explanation for why this
crucial issue remains unresolved

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:18.020
is that no court has
convincingly connected its stance

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:21.880
on this question to any of the
underlying theories of copyright.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:24.580
Until that happens,
litigants and judges will

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.195
struggle to define the set
of harms that plaintiffs

00:43:27.195 --> 00:43:32.820
may point to when resisting
fair use defenses.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:36.060
This concludes our examination of
the current state of the fair use

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.180
doctrine in the United States.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.410
In the final segment of
the lecture, I will briefly

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:45.180
examine the ways in which some other
countries address the kinds of issues

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:49.940
that here in the US are
handled using section 107.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:55.300
Your job will then be to decide
which approach is optimal.

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:56.075
