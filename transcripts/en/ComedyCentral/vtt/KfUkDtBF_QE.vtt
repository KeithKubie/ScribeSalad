00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:02.903
Microsoft has announced plans
to acquire LinkedIn

00:00:02.936 --> 00:00:04.972
for $26.2 billion,

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.508
making history
as the most anyone has ever paid

00:00:07.541 --> 00:00:09.142
for a list of people
without jobs.

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:10.577
-(laughter)
-Now,

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:12.779
hopefully,
Microsoft does something

00:00:12.813 --> 00:00:14.515
about all the e-mails sent to me

00:00:14.548 --> 00:00:17.084
asking me to join LinkedIn
even after I've opted out!

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:18.719
Every single time.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.121
LinkedIn is basically
"It follows, the Web site."

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:22.623
(laughter)

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.591
And I imagine
Microsoft just bought it

00:00:24.625 --> 00:00:26.293
so they could (bleep)
stop getting e-mails

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.495
from LinkedIn, as well.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.864
-(applause)
-And...

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:33.867
Also...

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:36.870
Extremely...
extremely ironic and sad,

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:38.672
because Clippy, the paper clip,

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:43.710
has been a LinkedIn power user
since being laid off in 2008.

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:46.380
Tough times for Clippy.
Oh, no.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:49.483
-(laughter) -Oh. That's too bad.
-Oh, Clippy.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:51.852
(in high-pitched voice):
I can stretch my body

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:54.855
and do a reach-around

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.890
for five more.

00:00:56.924 --> 00:00:58.659
Microsoft is calling it a deal

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:00.661
between the world's
leading professional cloud

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.429
and the world's
leading professional network

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:04.631
which is what I plan
on telling my children

00:01:04.665 --> 00:01:05.899
to help them fall asleep.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.535
Comedians,
what's an even worse merger?

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.804
-Horatio.
-Oh, my penis and my zipper.

00:01:10.838 --> 00:01:12.606
(laughter)

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.775
-(applause and cheering)
-Yes.

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:17.277
That is, uh...
that's the other LinkedIn.

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:19.713
Points for you.
Nick Swardson.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.782
Uh, Ecstasy
and my family reunion.

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.884
-HARDWICK: All right.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:26.753
-Points. Mary Lynn.
-The Catholic Church and Grindr.

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:30.157
-(laughter and groaning)
-HARDWICK: Well, I don't know.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.257
-Wait a minute.
Think about it. -(applause)
