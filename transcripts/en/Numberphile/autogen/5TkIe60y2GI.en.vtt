we're gonna do all the numbers on

we're gonna do all the numbers on
 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.290
we're gonna do all the numbers on
numberphile we've done a lot of the

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300
numberphile we've done a lot of the
 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.390
numberphile we've done a lot of the
numbers some would say but we haven't

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400

done all the numbers originally we did

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290
done all the numbers originally we did
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.440
done all the numbers originally we did
the whole numbers and these are the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450
the whole numbers and these are the
 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.720
the whole numbers and these are the
classics Mica's we've done 11 that was

numbers sitting here but then there are
 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.269

other types of numbers if we go one step

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279
other types of numbers if we go one step
 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.040

out the rational numbers the ones that

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050
out the rational numbers the ones that
 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.170
out the rational numbers the ones that
are ratios these are you know you get a

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180

over a twelve you get all sorts of sand
 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.230
over a twelve you get all sorts of sand
there you got all the rational numbers

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
there you got all the rational numbers
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.609

so Simon did a fantastic video about

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
so Simon did a fantastic video about
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.410
so Simon did a fantastic video about
algebraic numbers and when you go

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
algebraic numbers and when you go
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.050
algebraic numbers and when you go
outside transcendental numbers I mean

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
outside transcendental numbers I mean
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.399

you can draw it if it's higher than that
 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.890
you can draw it if it's higher than that
you can't so the cube root of two is an

you can't so the cube root of two is an
 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.210
you can't so the cube root of two is an
algebraic number and then outside

so you've got things like pi pi lives

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400
so you've got things like pi pi lives
 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.060
so you've got things like pi pi lives
out here pi is transcendental e is

numbers this is the fringe of kind of
what we understand in mathematics and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680
what we understand in mathematics and
 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.040
what we understand in mathematics and
what we've done on numberphile so it was

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050
what we've done on numberphile so it was
 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:15.449
what we've done on numberphile so it was
the first number that was proven to be

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459
the first number that was proven to be
 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.560
the first number that was proven to be
transcendental and so that was proven in

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570
transcendental and so that was proven in
 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.080
transcendental and so that was proven in
1873 so reasonably recent given that

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090
1873 so reasonably recent given that

is I call this an artificial number
because Champa noun just went can I find

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:08.190
because Champa noun just went can I find
 

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.940
because Champa noun just went can I find
a number which is normal and he came up

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:10.950
a number which is normal and he came up
 

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.350
a number which is normal and he came up
with this procedure he just went right

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360
with this procedure he just went right
 

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.850
with this procedure he just went right
you just put all the numbers in order

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:13.860
you just put all the numbers in order
 

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.880
you just put all the numbers in order
all the integers in base 10 and you

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:16.890
all the integers in base 10 and you
 

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:18.320
all the integers in base 10 and you
don't and it's true right because

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.330
don't and it's true right because
 

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:19.700
don't and it's true right because
whatever you want to find it's in there

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:19.710
whatever you want to find it's in there
 

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.070
whatever you want to find it's in there
eventually because it's just all the

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.080
eventually because it's just all the
 

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.250
eventually because it's just all the
whole numbers listed out and then turned

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:25.260
whole numbers listed out and then turned
 

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.020
whole numbers listed out and then turned
into digits but that's all numbers are

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:27.030
into digits but that's all numbers are
 

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.000
into digits but that's all numbers are
right whole bunch of digits perfectly

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.010
right whole bunch of digits perfectly
 

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:30.710
right whole bunch of digits perfectly
valid number right but and it is

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720
valid number right but and it is
 

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.810
valid number right but and it is
computable right so actually it's like

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:32.820
computable right so actually it's like
 

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.030
computable right so actually it's like
the least efficient way of doing it it

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040
the least efficient way of doing it it
 

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.740
the least efficient way of doing it it
is there's a slightly more efficient one

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:36.750
is there's a slightly more efficient one
 

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:40.010
is there's a slightly more efficient one
the Copeland air dish number is the same

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:40.020
the Copeland air dish number is the same
 

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:44.810
the Copeland air dish number is the same
idea but only the primes so it's 2 3 5 7

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:44.820
idea but only the primes so it's 2 3 5 7
 

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.220
idea but only the primes so it's 2 3 5 7
1 1 1 3 so on 1 7 etc so exactly the

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:49.230
1 1 1 3 so on 1 7 etc so exactly the
 

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.870
1 1 1 3 so on 1 7 etc so exactly the
same idea slightly more efficient it's

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880
same idea slightly more efficient it's
 

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.790
same idea slightly more efficient it's
also normal so we didn't start with

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800
also normal so we didn't start with
 

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.320
also normal so we didn't start with
these numbers and go I wonder if they're

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.330
these numbers and go I wonder if they're
 

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:56.720
these numbers and go I wonder if they're
normal these people sat down and went

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:56.730
normal these people sat down and went
 

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.910
normal these people sat down and went
I'm gonna make a normal number how can I

00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920
I'm gonna make a normal number how can I
 

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.830
I'm gonna make a normal number how can I
do that and they generated these now

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:00.840
do that and they generated these now
 

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.680
do that and they generated these now
champignons number is transcendental so

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:03.690
champignons number is transcendental so
 

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:05.840
champignons number is transcendental so
this is it in base 10

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:05.850
this is it in base 10
 

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:08.269
this is it in base 10
you can do it in different bases and it

00:11:08.269 --> 00:11:08.279
you can do it in different bases and it
 

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:11.629
you can do it in different bases and it
is computable it is normal and is

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639
is computable it is normal and is
 

00:11:11.639 --> 00:11:13.490
is computable it is normal and is
transcendental so transcendental means

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:13.500
transcendental so transcendental means
 

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.519
transcendental so transcendental means
it's outside algebraic it's there and
