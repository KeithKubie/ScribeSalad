00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710
as a category in medical science in
 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.340
as a category in medical science in
evidence-based medical science today in

the 21st century it existed in the
nineteenth century people were able to

nineteenth century people were able to
 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.940
nineteenth century people were able to
talk about those diseases of the

talk about those diseases of the
 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.260
talk about those diseases of the
african-americans that caused them to

run away from slavery they were able to
 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.390
run away from slavery they were able to
talk about the diseases of the Jews that

talk about the diseases of the Jews that
 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.070

they became races which is very weird

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500
they became races which is very weird
 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.779

because of course they weren't so
