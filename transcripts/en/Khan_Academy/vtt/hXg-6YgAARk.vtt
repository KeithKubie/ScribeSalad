00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.450
I thought I would do
a few more examples

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.991
of taking antiderivatives, just
so we feel comfortable taking

00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:08.810
antiderivatives of all
of the basic functions

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.990
that we know how to
take the derivatives of.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.989
And on top of that, I
just want to make it clear

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.580
that it doesn't always
have to be functions of x.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.230
Here we have a function
of t, and we're

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.170
taking the antiderivative
with respect to t.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.160
And so you would
not write a dx here.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.240
That is not the notation.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.637
You'll see why when we
focus on definite integrals.

00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:29.220
So what's the antiderivative of
this business right over here?

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.310
Well, it's going to be the same
thing as the antiderivative

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.680
of sine of t, or the indefinite
integral of sine of t,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.500
plus the indefinite integral,
or the antiderivative,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.580
of cosine of t.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.500
So let's think about what
these antiderivatives are.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.375
And we already know a
little bit about taking

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.070
the derivatives
of trig functions.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.380
We know that the derivative
with respect to t of cosine of t

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.910
is equal to negative sine of t.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.327
So if we want a
sine of t here, we

00:01:07.327 --> 00:01:09.701
would just have to take the
derivative of negative cosine

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:10.270
t.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.260
If we take the derivative
of negative cosine t,

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.190
then we get positive sine of t.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.405
The derivative with
respect to t of cosine t

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:18.360
is negative sine of t.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.651
We have the negative out front.

00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:21.730
It becomes positive sine of t.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.970
So the antiderivative of sine
of t is negative cosine of t.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.280
So this is going to be equal
to negative cosine of t.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.200
And then what's the
antiderivative of cosine of t?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.880
Well, we already know that
the derivative with respect

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.700
to t of sine of t is
equal to cosine of t.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.690
So cosine of t's
antiderivative is just

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.080
sine of t-- so plus sine of t.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.770
And we're done.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.064
We've found the antiderivative.

00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:52.980
Now let's tackle this.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.896
Now we don't have a t.

00:01:53.896 --> 00:01:57.900
We're taking the indefinite
integral with respect

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.610
to-- actually,
this is a mistake.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.380
This should be
with respect to a.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.070
Let me clean this up.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.970
This should be a da.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.678
If we were taking this
with respect to t,

00:02:05.678 --> 00:02:08.270
then we would treat all of
these things as just constants.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.276
But I don't want to
confuse you right now.

00:02:10.276 --> 00:02:11.150
Let me make it clear.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.284
This is going to be da.

00:02:13.284 --> 00:02:14.950
That's what we are
integrating or taking

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.560
the antiderivative
with respect to.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.920
So what is this
going to be equal to?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.920
Well once again, we can rewrite
it as the sum of integrals.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.010
This is the indefinite
integral of e to the a da,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.120
so this one right
over here-- a d

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.430
I'll do it in green-- plus
the indefinite integral,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.580
or the antiderivative,
of 1/a da.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.862
Now, what is the
antiderivative of e to the a?

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:45.720
Well, we already know a
little bit about exponentials.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.450
The derivative with
respect to x of e to the x

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.130
is equal to e to the x.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.815
That's one of the reasons why
e in the exponential function

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:55.370
in general is so amazing.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.930
And if we just replaced
a with x or x with a,

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.626
you get the derivative with
respect to a of e to the a

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:05.846
is equal to e to the a.

00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:08.050
So the antiderivative
here, the derivative of e

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.220
to the a, the antiderivative
is going to be e to the a.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.190
And maybe you can shift it
by some type of a constant.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.690
Oh, and let me
not forget, I have

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.990
to put my constant
right over here.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.380
I could have a constant factor.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.360
So let me-- always important.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.070
Remember the constant.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.230
So you have a constant
factor right over here.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.410
Never forget that.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.710
I almost did.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.330
So once again, over here,
what's the antiderivative of e

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:34.440
to the a?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.626
It is e to the a.

00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:40.410
What's the
antiderivative of 1/a?

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.175
Well, we've seen that
in the last video.

00:03:42.175 --> 00:03:47.080
It is going to be the natural
log of the absolute value of a.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.860
And then we want to have the
most general antiderivative,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.050
so there could be a constant
factor out here as well.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.120
And we are done.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.937
We found the antiderivative
of both of these expressions.
