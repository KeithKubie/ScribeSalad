00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.040
I just feel like we've drifted apart

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.800
ever since my burrito podcast started to take off.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.480
But I love your podcast.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.120
I just don't...think you love it for the right reasons.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.780
I love burritos.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.180
Not enough.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.600
All right boys, she's single.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.260
Lets get to work.  What's in the pantry, Phil?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.480
Uh, we got Doritos, queso, and

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.300
Oh!  Two boxes of Debbie Little Cakes.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.820
We're good.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.720
What kind of Doritos?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.120
Uh, Cool Ranch.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.720
Good.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.600
Mitch, what are we looking like on the Blue-Ray

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.020
Rom-Com situation?

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.920
Uh, pretty comprehensive collection here.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.400
We have the Notebook, some early Aniston flicks,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.520
and Clueless if she's feeling nostalgic.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.000
Lets get her some Joseph Gordon Levitt.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360
What she needs right now is something quarky and charming.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.200
Copy that, Jogo Labs coming in hot.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.700

Download the dating app.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.680
Uh, it's too soon for that, isn't it?

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.500

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.780
Dammit ma'am, she's not going to hold.

Yes she will!  She's strong!

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.160

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.600
Aww.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:28.020
Show me!

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.580
Maybe it's time for a rebound?

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.980
What did you say?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.320
Rebound.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.360

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.460

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.480
Uh, except uh...

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.060
What is it?  What's wrong?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.920
He's a ginger.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.560
Well...

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.640

Good job boys!  She made it out of there alive!

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.640
Mitch, pull some of the dick picks on screen.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.460
Ma'am, I deleted those.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.940
Oh.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.420
Good.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.960
That was a test.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.700
Hey!  Don't pick up your curling iron by the hot part.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:50.760
It hurts a lot.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.840

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.100
