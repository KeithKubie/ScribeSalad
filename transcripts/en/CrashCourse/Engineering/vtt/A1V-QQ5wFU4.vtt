00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.300
Mechanical engineers have changed the world.

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:07.470
You could even say: the course of history.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.380
Not just once but countless times.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.560
Because they’ve identified problems that were
holding humanity back, and they solved them.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.920
Things were too big and heavy to move.
Travel was too difficult.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.600
Distances too far.
Our bodies were too weak.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.060
If you can think of an invention that
revolutionized the way people live, odds are
it was created by mechanical engineers.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.840
And I don’t think I’m being biased.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.280
Theirs is the field of engineering that focuses
on the design, construction, operation, and
maintenance of machines and mechanical systems
– pretty much anything that moves.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.780
And since the beginning, mechanical engineering
has faced a great many challenges, and solved
a lot of problems.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.920
The examples are too many to count, but consider
things like the steam engine, airplanes, robots, and
biomechanical suits.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.760
The engineers behind all of these devices
were able to find solutions to big problems.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.640
And of course, they faced difficulties along
the way.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.040
But great efforts almost always do.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:09.080
[Theme Music]

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.780
Back in the day, if you wanted to get somewhere,
you would have had two options: your own two
feet or a horse.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.540
And if you wanted to take a heavy load with
you, you needed a carriage. Wheels.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.940
The invention of the wheel is one of the oldest roots
of mechanical engineering, along with all of the simple
tools that went into building the carriage itself.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:33.960
If we include the simple levers that were used to
open gates and bring down bridges, we’d have a great,
but primitive, base of early mechanical engineering.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.220
But horse-drawn carriages aren’t very fast.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.400
A horse needs rest and food, so it would be generous
to say you could cover 80 kilometers a day.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.979
This gave the engineers of the past a problem.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.480
As the world opened up, it became more
important to cover distances in less time,
and horses just weren't cutting it.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.100
They needed something faster.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.660
They needed an engine.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:02.300
Making its first appearance in the early 18th century,
the steam engine marked a major turning point in the
development of modern mechanical engineering.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.860
It was proposed that a steam engine could
do the work of ten, fifteen, or even twenty horses!

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.020
And you wouldn’t need to bother with any
hay...or manure.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.600
This brings us to Thomas Newcomen, the British
inventor who developed the first successful steam
engine with a piston in 1712.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:25.320
In his design, atmospheric pressure pushed
the piston down, after the condensation of steam
had created a vacuum in the cylinder.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.840
Its original use was to draw water out of the
Cornish tin mines, after Newcomen found how
expensive it was to use horses to pump the water.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.420
Then along came the Scottish inventor James
Watt.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.740
In 1763, while repairing one of Newcomen’s engines,

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.060
Watt realized that about three quarters of the
energy from the steam was going to waste, used
only to heat the chamber of the engine.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.600
His solution was to have a separate condenser.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.900
The steam would then be condensed in a
chamber separate from the piston chamber, so that
the condensed steam didn't go to waste.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.180
Keeping the two processes separate allowed
for continued rotary motion, which was really
important,

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.600
because it allowed for a more consistent
source of power.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.580
Watt’s invention came to be widely used
to run machines in the factories that drove
the Industrial Revolution.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.100
Watt went on to be the first engineer to be
commemorated in Westminster Abbey, with a large,
white marble statue erected in his memory.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:20.520
He also had his last name recognized as a
unit of power, which is perhaps one of the
highest honors that an engineer can get.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.580
But steam engines really came into their own,
especially in the realm of transportation, in the
locomotives of the 19th century.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:35.740
George and Robert Stephenson, an English father-son
duo, are famous for their early steam locomotive, which
they called, aptly enough, “Locomotion.”

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:43.640
In 1825, it became the first public passenger train,
carrying 450 people at 24 kilometers per hour.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.500
Quite a bit faster than a horse!

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:53.700
But while wheeled vehicles allowed people to travel
more quickly on land, transportation was still limited
by bodies of water and rough, mountainous terrain.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.799
If engineers could figure out a way to get
people to fly, all of that could be avoided!

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.939
This problem-solving led to the invention
of aircraft.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:09.580
The first powered aircraft to take flight was the Wright
Flyer in 1903, which was designed by Wilbur and Orville
Wright and used a 12-horsepower gas engine.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.080
Orville flew the Wright Flyer on its maiden
voyage, traveling 36 meters in 12 seconds.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.200
But the best flight of the day belonged to Wilbur,
who traveled over 255 meters in 59 seconds,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.800
or a speed of about 15 kilometers an hour,
earning him some serious bragging rights.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.640
Soon after the Wright brothers’ accomplishment,
World War I sparked a burst of aircraft innovation.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.980
Engineers began using metal in the structures
of the airplanes, and better engines, allowing
them to reach higher speeds and altitudes.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.919
Then, in 1930, Sir Frank Whittle obtained
his first patent for a turbo-jet engine.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.280
But it wasn’t until the outbreak of World War II
that the British government had a compelling
reason to support his work.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.740
By 1941, Whittle’s engine featured a multistage
compressor, a combustion chamber, a single turbine,
and a nozzle –

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:01.980
which was a big improvement, since previous
engine designs only had an internal-combustion
engine and a propeller.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.040
Jet engines outperformed the older designs,
flying farther, faster, and cheaper too.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:13.680
These advances ultimately made commercial
air travel possible, and soon people were traveling
where once only the birds had ruled.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.240
But mechanical engineering doesn’t stop
in the air!

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:22.860
Beyond planes, we’ve sent satellites into
orbit, astronauts to the moon, and spacecraft
carrying rovers all the way to Mars.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.819
The aerospace side of engineering actually
arose from the mechanical field.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:33.460
And much of what has allowed us to build these
machines that move us is another big part of the
mechanical engineering field: robotics.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.900
For most of industrial history, humans have
been at the center of our workforce.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:39.540
But humans have their limits.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.700
Some things are too big and too awkward to
move, while other processes needed a finer
precision than the human hand allows.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.420
Industrial environments are also often uncomfortable
and sometimes even dangerous.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.780
And that’s where robots and automation come in.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.100
The first industrial robot, called Unimate,
appeared around 1960.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:03.780
It was designed by American inventor George
Devol, Jr., who worked with engineer and entrepreneur
Joseph Engelberger to get it into factories.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:12.680
Unimate robots had up to six fully programmable
axes of motion and could handle parts weighing
up to around 225 kilograms at high speeds.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:20.640
They soon joined the assembly line at a General
Motors plant, where they took die castings from
machines and welded them onto auto bodies.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.860
Since then, robots have gone beyond manufacturing,
showing up in our homes to clean the floors, and
even hospitals to perform surgeries.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.860
But as their applications get more advanced,
engineers have more and more factors to consider.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:38.720
They need to worry about how well robots sense
their surroundings, how they move and manipulate
their environments, and much more.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.200
It’s possible one day that we’ll have
robots in many of the places you could
imagine a human working.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.189
I mean, we’re seeing that now.

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:53.340
And speaking of humans, you can think of the human
body as just a super complex mechanical system of
its own, made of links and connecting joints.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.440
And this is where biomechanics comes in.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:03.040
Engineers need to take into account the stress,
load, and impact that our bodies can withstand,
and apply it to machines that are modeled on us.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.080
Advanced biomechanics is one of the newest
divisions of mechanical engineering.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:15.320
From it, we’re already seeing the beginnings of
exoskeleton-suits, limbs that move like their biological
counterparts, and other robotic implants.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.680
One of the more impressive projects is the
Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton.

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.840
Funded by the Defense Advanced Research
Project Agency in 2000,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:31.980
this device is designed to provide mechanical
support to allow nearly anyone to carry larger, heavier
loads than they could ever lift on their own.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.440
The ability to carry heavy loads is often a problem
for soldiers and disaster relief workers, so finding
a solution to this is pretty important.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.990
But the problems are many.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.650
For one thing, power sources for exo-suits
are often too heavy or cumbersome.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:50.540
But the BLEEX, as it’s called, overcomes
this by using a small hybrid power source

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.420
that delivers hydraulic power for the suit’s
locomotion and electrical power for its computer.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:08:03.840
The first prototype was recently introduced,
consisting of two powered, anthropomorphic legs,
a power unit, and a backpack-like frame.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.940
Using the frame, a person can carry a heavy
load, but only have it feel like a few pounds.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:16.480
In similar fashion, Berkeley is also behind the
Austin project, which aims to develop exoskeleton
systems for people with mobility disorders.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:22.600
So it’s almost as if we’ve gone full circle,
from the inventors who developed the first
steam engine to replace the horse,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:29.300
to the biomechanical engineers who are
using robotics to simulate the most basic
means of transportation: walking.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.440
Those are some of the very big problems that
mechanical engineers have managed to solve.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.180
And when it comes to the problems that we
still face today – from driving in traffic to getting
food and water to remote areas –

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:42.380
you can bet that mechanical engineers
will be there to tackle them.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.260
So today we learned all about many different
areas of mechanical engineering, beginning
with the steam engine.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.260
We then moved on to aircraft and the work
behind them.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:54.640
And we finished by going into the more modern
areas of robotics and biomechanics.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:09:00.320
In the next episode we’ll explore electrical
engineering, its history, and the work that
electrical engineers do.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.200
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you then.
