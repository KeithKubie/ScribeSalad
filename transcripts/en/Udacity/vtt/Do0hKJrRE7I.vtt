00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.900
So here're some of the properties
of DEC_POMDPs that probably worth

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:03.880
knowing about.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.620
As you pointed out,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.189
there's elements of game theory and
POMDPs mixed together deliciously.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.640
And as a result,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.460
member POMDPs, well like I told
you the POMDPs are not computable.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.440
So DEC-POMDPs are also not computable,
but in the finite horizon, POMDPs are P

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.495
space complete which is probably
definitely kind of hard.

00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:28.763
DEC-POMPDPs are actually known
to be NEXP-complete which is

00:00:28.763 --> 00:00:30.100
non-deterministic.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.875
It's like NP except with
an X in the middle,

00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:35.800
non-deterministic exponential
time complete.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.680
&gt;&gt; That sounds difficult.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean so the best that we
know how to solve non-deterministic

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.630
exponential time problems
is double exponential time.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.575
The shortest that it could possibly be
solvable is single exponential time.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:51.770
[LAUGH] So it's somewhere between
single and double exponential.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.390
&gt;&gt; Like 1.2 exponential.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.980
&gt;&gt; Well, it could be, could be 1,
could be 2, could be 1.8.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.050
&gt;&gt; As long as we have choices.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.140
&gt;&gt; One of the the beauties of this
model, one of the reasons that people in

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.460
spite of this computational challenge,
like to think about it, is because,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.050
just like POMDPS are useful because
they let you think about actions to gain

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.420
information, DEC POMDPS let you
think about actions to communicate.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.990
An optimal solution to a DEC POMDP has
to balance the cost of communicating

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.380
with the cost of not communicating.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.310
So is it worth saying this at time?

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:24.740
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.146
That sounds like some of the other
discussions about POM DPs, and

00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:29.030
exploration versus
exploitation trade offs.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.040
&gt;&gt; Right.
But it gets into some of these

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.400
interesting questions
about communication.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.960
So this is model that's fun to think
about if you're a multi-agent person or

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.280
maybe a natural language person or
a met natural language dialogue person

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.974
where you actually have to reason
about what's worth saying.

00:01:42.974 --> 00:01:43.860
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.340
&gt;&gt; And there are some algorithms and
heuristics that are known,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.425
there are some applications
that are known and

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:52.460
just the last thing I want to do is
run us through a quick example, so

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.910
you can have a concrete example,
what it feels like to be in a DEC POMDP.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.410
&gt;&gt; Okay.
