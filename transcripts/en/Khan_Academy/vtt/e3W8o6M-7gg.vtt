00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.110
We're on problem 27.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.080
They tell us if i is equal to
the square root of minus 1,

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:16.750
then what is 4 times i-- that's
an i-- times 6 times i?

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.330
Well, multiplication
is associative.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.780
You can switch the
order around.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.720
So this is the same thing as 4
times 6 times i times i, or

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.670
the same thing as 24 times
i squared, right?

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.010
If we square both sides of this,
you get i squared is

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.940
equal to negative 1.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.160
So this is 24 times
negative 1.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.220
So this is minus 24,
which is choice C.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.550
Next problem, 28.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.120
They want to know what
an equivalent

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.660
form of 3 plus i is.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.830
A lot of times, people don't
like either when you have a

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.640
square root in the denominator
or they don't like it when you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.950
have an a complex number
in the denominator.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.300
A complex number is just
something that has part real

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.230
and part imaginary.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.350
So the way you can do it with
this case is you multiply

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.270
times the conjugate
of this number.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.450
I know that sounds like a fancy
word, but all it means

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.700
is you take the opposite
of the imaginary part.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.950
So what's the conjugate?

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.610
Remember, the only way you
cannot change a fraction is if

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.220
you multiply the numerator and
the denominator by the same

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.540
thing, because then you're
multiplying by 1.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.690
So what's the conjugate
of this?

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.980
The conjugate of 3 plus
i is 3 minus i.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.480
You have to do 3 minus
i over 3 minus i.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.510
I'm doing that because when you
multiply a complex number

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.150
by its conjugate, you end up
actually with a real number.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.010
Then you're going to end up with
a complex number up here.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.050
A conjugate, all it means is
you keep the real part the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.330
same, and you change the sign
on the imaginary part.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.160
That's all that word means.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.540
All right, now let's figure
out what this is equal to.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.570
2 times 3, just same
distributive

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.440
properties as always.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.740
Let me do it in green.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.540
2 times 3 is 6.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.240
2 times minus i is minus
2i, all of that over

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.790
3 times 3 is 9.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.960
3 times minus i is minus 3i.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.680
i times 3 is plus 3i.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.910
Then i times minus i, you can
view that as minus i squared.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.930
Let's think about what
this is equal to.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.390
Well, this plus 3i and the
minus 3i cancel out.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.230
What's i squared?

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.360
Well, this is equal
to negative 1.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.980
So you end up with a minus
of a negative 1.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.360
Minus a negative
1 is a plus 1.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:54.690
So you're left with 6 minus
2i over 9 plus 1 over 10.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.250
Actually, we can reduce
this some.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.880
We can divide the top
and the bottom by 2.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.300
So that becomes 3
minus i over 5.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.690
We just divided both the
numerator and the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.340
denominator by 2.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.730
That is choice B.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.110
Problem 29, these go
fast. No systems of

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.060
equations and all that.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.530
What is the product of the
complex numbers 3 plus

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.040
i and 3 minus i?

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.020
They just asked us that.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.035
That was in the last problem.

00:03:26.035 --> 00:03:28.740
When we multiplied 3 plus
i times 3 minus

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.740
i, what did we get?

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.440
We got 10.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.110
We did this whole thing.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.590
3 times 3 is 9.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.800
We did the whole thing.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.570
They're just repeating
the same question.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.430
That equals 10.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.170
That's choice B.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.300
Rewind the video and see
what I did here.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:48.010
3 times 3 is 9 times minus 3i
plus 3i minus i squared.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.400
These terms cancel out and you
get a minus i squared, which

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.000
is minus negative 1.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.090
So you have 9 plus 1,
so that equals 10.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.420
So that is choice B.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.520
That's crazy.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.220
They just gave us the same
problem twice in a row.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.120
All right.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.360
They're giving us more and more
imaginary problems. But

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.920
these are fun, especially if
they're going to repeat the

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.019
same question.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.980
Problem 30, if i is equal to
the square root of negative

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.710
1-- well, I'll just keep writing
it because they keep

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.120
writing it.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.190
It's good as a reminder. i is
equal to the square root of

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.860
negative 1 and a and b are
non-zero real numbers.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.140
What is 1 over a plus bi?

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.490
Well, once again, if they kind
of want us to rewrite this,

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.980
they probably just want us to
get rid of the i's in the

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.410
denominator.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.850
So we multiply times
the conjugate of

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.270
this complex number.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.780
So we multiply times a plus
bi, the conjugate over the

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.580
conjugate, a plus bi.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.330
The conjugate isn't
this whole thing.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.570
The conjugate is
just a plus bi.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.410
Oh sorry, we should be
multiplying times a minus bi.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.860
a minus bi over a minus bi.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.720
The conjugate of a plus bi,
just so you get the

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.940
terminology right, is
just the a minus bi.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.490
But I'm doing a minus
bi over a minus bi.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.150
So I'm not changing this
fraction because this

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.020
obviously is 1.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.690
x over x is the same
thing as 1.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.450
So let's see what this
is equal to.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.350
Well, the numerator just becomes
a minus bi times 1,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.840
which is a minus bi.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.720
Then you have a times a,
which is a squared.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.810
a times minus bi, so
it's minus abi.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.830
Then you have bi times
a, which is plus abi.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.800
I'll write it down here.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.600
They cancel out.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.450
Then you have bi
times minus bi.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:48.830
So that's minus b squared
i squared.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.420
These cancel out.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:56.810
So you're left with a minus
bi over a squared

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.970
minus b squared i squared.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.360
We know what i squared is.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.970
i squared is equal
to negative 1.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.970
You square both sides of that
and you get i squared is equal

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.470
to negative 1.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.100
So if we multiply, this
becomes a negative 1.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.990
But then this negative and this

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:15.100
negative, they cancel out.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.270
You get a plus.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.830
So then we get a minus bi over
a squared plus b squared.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.980
That is choice B.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.000
Next problem.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.510
All right, what are the
solutions to the equation x

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:46.140
squared plus 2x plus 2?

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.610
All right, now, if you see an
equation like this and you're

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.130
like, OK, let's see,
can I factor it?

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.130
Oh, that is equal to 0.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.370
You say, OK, what number when
I multiple them equal 2 and

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:00.540
when I add them equal 2?

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.430
Well, that's a hard one.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.720
Whenever you get stuck, the
easiest thing to do is just

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.540
use the quadratic equation,
just as a reminder.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.400
If the equation is Ax squared
plus Bx plus C-- maybe I

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.750
should have done them all in in
capital letters-- is equal

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.560
to 0, the solution to this and
the proof of this we've done

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.805
in the Khan Academy, it comes
from completing the square,

00:07:22.805 --> 00:07:26.580
but it's useful to memorize,
is negative B.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.200
So the solutions are x are equal
to negative B plus or

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:37.710
minus the square root of B
squared minus 4AC, all

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.820
of that over 2A.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:42.340
So in this case, what is A?

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.720
A is the coefficient
on x squared.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.650
So A is equal to 1.

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:46.260
What is B?

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.590
B is the coefficient on x.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.540
So B is equal to 2.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.210
What is C?

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.410
C is just a constant term.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.930
So C is equal to 2.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.740
We could just solve like that,
just substitute these values.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:02.780
So you get x is equal to minus
B, which is minus 2, plus or

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:07.170
minus the square root of
B squared, so that's 4,

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.230
minus 4 minus A.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:20.080
So 4 minus 4 times A, 4 times
1, times 2, all of that--

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.100
that's an ugly looking radical--
all of that over 2A,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.780
2 times 1 is 2.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:29.760
So that equals, let's see, we
get minus 2 plus or minus the

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:33.929
square root of 4 minus--
this is 8, right?

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:35.240
4 times 1 times 2.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:45.410
4 minus 8, which is minus 4, all
of that over 2, which is

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.990
equal to minus 2
plus or minus.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.380
So the square root of minus 4,
we could rewrite that as the

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:56.210
square root of 4
times minus 1.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:01.290
So that equals 2 plus or minus
the square root of 4 times the

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:06.960
square root of minus 1, all of
that over 2, which is equal to

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.750
minus 2 plus or minus-- the
square root of 4 is 2 and the

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:15.950
plus or minus is dealing with
positive or negative 2-- times

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:17.560
the square root of negative 1.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.620
Well, we learned that's
i multiple times.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:24.510
The square root of negative 1
is i, all of that over 2.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.560
We can simplify this
a little bit.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.750
I'll do it in a different color,
just because I've run

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.600
out of space at the
bottom here.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.390
So this is equal to divide
everything by 2, you get

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:39.140
negative 1 plus or minus i.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.770
Let's see what the
choices are.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:45.520
That's choice C, because
negative 1 plus or minus i

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.660
could also be written as
negative 1 plus i as one value

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.670
for x, and then the other one
could be negative 1 minus i.
