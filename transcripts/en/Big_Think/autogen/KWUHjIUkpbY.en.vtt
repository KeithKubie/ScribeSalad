if you need a little extra energy or you
 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.270
if you need a little extra energy or you
need to pay really close attention to

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280
need to pay really close attention to
 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.760
need to pay really close attention to
something today here's what you should

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770
something today here's what you should
 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.070
something today here's what you should
do you should make a prediction about

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080
do you should make a prediction about
 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.830
do you should make a prediction about
anything it can be a prediction of how

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840
anything it can be a prediction of how
 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.750
anything it can be a prediction of how
many emails you'll get in the next hour

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760
many emails you'll get in the next hour
 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.550
many emails you'll get in the next hour
it could be a prediction about who's

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560
it could be a prediction about who's
 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.589
it could be a prediction about who's
gonna win the baseball game tonight it

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599
gonna win the baseball game tonight it
 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.859
gonna win the baseball game tonight it
could be a prediction of how many

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
could be a prediction of how many
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.780
could be a prediction of how many
jumping jacks can you do with 60 seconds

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:30.790
jumping jacks can you do with 60 seconds
 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.389
jumping jacks can you do with 60 seconds
make a prediction and then just wait to

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:33.399
make a prediction and then just wait to
 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.440
make a prediction and then just wait to
see if you were right or not every time

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:37.450
see if you were right or not every time
 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.780
see if you were right or not every time
that you make a prediction you get a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790
that you make a prediction you get a
 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.420
that you make a prediction you get a
little bump of dopamine in the reward

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430
little bump of dopamine in the reward
 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.060
little bump of dopamine in the reward
pathways of your brain and the reason

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070
pathways of your brain and the reason
 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.650
pathways of your brain and the reason
why you get a little dopamine bomb is

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660
why you get a little dopamine bomb is
 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.950
why you get a little dopamine bomb is
that your brain is preparing itself to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960
that your brain is preparing itself to
 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.650
that your brain is preparing itself to
learn so we often think of dopamine as

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660
learn so we often think of dopamine as
 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.070
learn so we often think of dopamine as
the reward neurochemical when there's

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080
the reward neurochemical when there's
 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.410
the reward neurochemical when there's
something we really want like a cookie

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420
something we really want like a cookie
 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.660
something we really want like a cookie
or a pat on the back and we get this

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670
or a pat on the back and we get this
 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.090
or a pat on the back and we get this
dopamine hit in anticipation of it so we

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100
dopamine hit in anticipation of it so we
 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.069
dopamine hit in anticipation of it so we
think about it as being really related

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079
think about it as being really related
 

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:08.340
think about it as being really related
to pleasure and and fun and satisfaction

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350
to pleasure and and fun and satisfaction
 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.580
to pleasure and and fun and satisfaction
but the reason why dopamine feels good

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590
but the reason why dopamine feels good
 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.149
but the reason why dopamine feels good
is that the brain is actually trying to

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159
is that the brain is actually trying to
 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.419
is that the brain is actually trying to
trick us into learning or improving our

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429
trick us into learning or improving our
 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.999
trick us into learning or improving our
strategies for being successful or

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009
strategies for being successful or
 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.050
strategies for being successful or
getting what we want

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060
getting what we want
 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.179
getting what we want
so dopamine is going to prime your brain

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189
so dopamine is going to prime your brain
 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.669
so dopamine is going to prime your brain
to pay closer attention to process

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679
to pay closer attention to process
 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.919
to pay closer attention to process
information more effectively to be more

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929
information more effectively to be more
 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.639
information more effectively to be more
engaged with what's going on

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649
engaged with what's going on
 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.840
engaged with what's going on
and-and-and-and so just make a little

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850
and-and-and-and so just make a little
 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.179
and-and-and-and so just make a little
prediction about anything you'll get the

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189
prediction about anything you'll get the
 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.889
prediction about anything you'll get the
dopamine hit your brain will go into

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899
dopamine hit your brain will go into
 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.109
dopamine hit your brain will go into
high gear and you could really use this

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119
high gear and you could really use this
 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.749
high gear and you could really use this
in in very strategic ways for example if

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759
in in very strategic ways for example if
 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.669
in in very strategic ways for example if
you're giving a presentation ask your

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679
you're giving a presentation ask your
 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.020
you're giving a presentation ask your
audience at the beginning of your

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030
audience at the beginning of your
 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.480
audience at the beginning of your
presentation to make a prediction it

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490
presentation to make a prediction it
 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.099
presentation to make a prediction it
could be about your presentation it

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109
could be about your presentation it
 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.969
could be about your presentation it
could be about something in their own

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979
could be about something in their own
 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.010
could be about something in their own
lives you've given them a dopamine hit

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020
lives you've given them a dopamine hit
 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.050
lives you've given them a dopamine hit
now they're paying attention they're

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060
now they're paying attention they're
 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.730
now they're paying attention they're
gonna actually learn more from what

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740
gonna actually learn more from what
 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.949
gonna actually learn more from what
you're about to say so make a prediction

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959
you're about to say so make a prediction
 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.260
you're about to say so make a prediction
it's a really easy way to get the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270
it's a really easy way to get the
 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.389
it's a really easy way to get the
benefits and the learning benefit

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399
benefits and the learning benefit
 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.459
benefits and the learning benefit
specifically of a dopamine pump you'll

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469
specifically of a dopamine pump you'll
 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.540
specifically of a dopamine pump you'll
also just feel happier which is good too

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550
also just feel happier which is good too
 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.610
also just feel happier which is good too
