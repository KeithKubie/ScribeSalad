[Background voices]
IRENE KHAN &gt;&gt; This year the sheen of success

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.680
has worn off and people are talking about
crisis. Um-yet a lot of the people who are

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.500
here were part of the group that created the
crisis so I think it needs to be a much broader

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.150
debate on the issues that are here. Ah-the
issues are very important. How do we bring

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.919
prosperity back but also how do we ensure
that growth is actually shared more evenly-um-because

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.100
this crisis-this economic crisis is going
to hit the poorest and the most vulnerable

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.080
in society in the worst possible ways.
Um-so what do the richer half come to tell

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.440
us-the political leaders, the business leaders-how
do they make sure that those who are on the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.530
fringes of society-the ones who have been
excluded-are actually brought into the debate?

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.690
Because unless that is done, social cohesion
will be threatened. Instability and insecurity

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.559
will be-become more prominent issues in this
year. And that has to be taken into account.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.070
Davos is not only about stability and growth.
Davos says, well, this is an economic forum.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.479
It talks about creating a post-crisis, but
we're still in crisis.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.830
We need a much broader debate with all state
colors, and many of them are not here.
