Aileen: Judson is open arms.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.860
Judson is big mama.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.700
Judson is, "Come in, whatever you need, we're
gonna try to give it to you."

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.720
Yvonne: Ruth Emerson and Steve Paxton and
I went to audition.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.760
Al Carmines said, "I didn't quite know what
I was looking at, but I sensed

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.380
that it was important."

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.990
Al: They were doing things in their dance
that I and everyone else I knew did every

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.920
day of their life: walking, running, stooping,
standing, touching, screaming.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.120
Carolee: We looked out the window for possible
movement ideas, people walking in the street.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.580
Valda: It was a new palette.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.540
All these materials were right there to give.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.940
Carolee: You may not have known what the hell
you were doing, but we were very, very rigorous

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.840
about how we did it.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.360
Aileen: It just rocked my boat, you know?

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.360
I don't mean I liked it all.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.360
I didn't.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.040
It scared the living daylights out of me,
a lot of that stuff.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.240
But, wow.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.940
It sure made me think.
