00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:08.344
(light piano music)

00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:12.429
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.929
Bipedal, naked, large-brained,

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:21.717
long the master of fire,
tools and language,

00:00:21.717 --> 00:00:25.954
but still trying to understand ourselves,

00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:29.263
aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.430
yet, filled with optimism.

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:34.136
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:37.564
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.564 --> 00:00:39.647
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.997 --> 00:00:43.758
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:44.758
of the past.

00:00:46.474 --> 00:00:50.155
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines,

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:54.322
to exchange insights on who
we are, and how we got here.

00:00:56.355 --> 00:01:00.093
An exploration made possible
by the generosity of humans,

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:00.926
like you.

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:25.650
(light electronic music)

00:01:27.684 --> 00:01:31.434
(mid-tempo electronic music)

00:01:46.852 --> 00:01:50.573
- So, some of you know my
interests in anthropogeny,

00:01:50.573 --> 00:01:53.960
originated from studies in
sialic acid, biology changes,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.627
and human evolution.

00:01:56.564 --> 00:01:58.105
And my background as a physician

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:02.383
led me to explore human specific diseases.

00:02:02.383 --> 00:02:04.023
So, what, then, am I doing here,

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.690
talking about death
awareness and mortality?

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:11.545
In 2005, I lectured at
the University of Arizona,

00:02:11.545 --> 00:02:13.158
and ventured beyond my expertise,

00:02:13.158 --> 00:02:16.968
of pining about the
evolution of human cognition.

00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:17.969
At the lunch that followed,

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.360
a local professor sat next to me and said,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.127
"You are all asking the wrong question!"

00:02:25.127 --> 00:02:26.947
Danny Brower's point was, perhaps,

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:30.459
we should not be asking
how human minds evolved.

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:31.629
There have been highly-intelligent,

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.576
warm-blooded social creatures around

00:02:33.576 --> 00:02:35.997
for tens of thousands of years.

00:02:35.997 --> 00:02:39.419
Elephants, carver birds,
apes and dolphins.

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.713
So, why are we not having to compete

00:02:40.713 --> 00:02:42.919
with these other species?

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.503
Danny suggested that it's not just

00:02:44.503 --> 00:02:48.471
that something unusual happened
during human evolution,

00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:50.181
but also, that all these other species

00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:53.034
were blocked in progression,

00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:56.401
by a cognitive barrier that
only we had broken through.

00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:58.466
So, I was really intrigued
by this contrarian view,

00:02:58.466 --> 00:03:01.660
and we talked a long time
after everyone was gone.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.699
And I strongly recommended
that he publish.

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.629
Seeing nothing in print,
after more than a year,

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.158
I followed up with
emails, got no responses,

00:03:10.158 --> 00:03:12.509
looked up his phone
number on the Internet,

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.676
only to find his obituary.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.338
Danny had died, very suddenly,

00:03:18.338 --> 00:03:21.106
of an unusual disease,
called aortic dissection.

00:03:21.106 --> 00:03:23.036
I contact his friend, Sean Carroll,

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:24.758
who said Danny had indeed been working

00:03:24.758 --> 00:03:27.486
on some novel idea, but never published.

00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:29.990
After more than two decades
of exploring anthropogeny,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.241
I could see some real important
potential in Danny's idea,

00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:36.491
and I just could not let it die with him.

00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:38.891
Fortunately, the editor of
Nature, Philip Campbell,

00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:40.142
allowed me to write a letter

00:03:40.142 --> 00:03:42.383
about Danny's idea, with
some embellishments.

00:03:42.383 --> 00:03:43.474
I thought I had done my duty,

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:46.391
and could leave it to
experts, to follow up.

00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:47.224
But a week later,

00:03:47.224 --> 00:03:50.406
I got an email from Danny
Brower's widow, Sharon,

00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:51.700
thanking me for writing the letter,

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.831
told me that Danny has started a book,

00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:55.957
and asked if I would like to read it.

00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:57.965
Looking at his draft, I
realized that his thinking

00:03:57.965 --> 00:04:00.496
had progressed very much
in the way mine had,

00:04:00.496 --> 00:04:03.779
and we had come to very similar
conclusions, independently.

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.998
But, there were great challenges
in completing this book.

00:04:06.998 --> 00:04:10.469
First, one author was dead.
(crowd laughing)

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:12.556
And the other wanted to
preserve the original intent

00:04:12.556 --> 00:04:14.048
and prose.

00:04:14.048 --> 00:04:17.080
Second, I really had no time
to do full justice to it,

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.805
because of my lack of expertise,

00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:21.365
and also, lack of time.

00:04:21.365 --> 00:04:23.734
And last, but not least,
who would care about a book

00:04:23.734 --> 00:04:26.172
by a dead insect geneticist,

00:04:26.172 --> 00:04:27.762
and a living physician-scientist,

00:04:27.762 --> 00:04:30.169
who claim to have
explained the human mind?

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.250
(crowd laughing)

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.843
So, I sat on this for a while,

00:04:33.843 --> 00:04:36.272
but, fortunately, a friend
of mine, Abraham Verghese,

00:04:36.272 --> 00:04:39.654
an author, put me in touch
with his agent, Mary Evans,

00:04:39.654 --> 00:04:41.723
who saw the potential in the book,

00:04:41.723 --> 00:04:44.440
and contacted Cary
Goldstein of Twelve Books,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.509
to help me with it.

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.538
And so, I went on.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:52.619
Strike four, was I wouldn't
talk about a Superstorm Sandy.

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:54.851
Strike five, was poor
follow-through on my part,

00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:58.012
because of lack of
expertise, and lack of time.

00:04:58.012 --> 00:04:59.524
(crowd laughing)

00:04:59.524 --> 00:05:01.283
And last, but not least, was a book title

00:05:01.283 --> 00:05:05.366
that the publisher insisted
on, which was Denial.

00:05:07.155 --> 00:05:08.306
So, for a while, I thought that this

00:05:08.306 --> 00:05:11.331
was a hackneyed, old phrase,
that had so many meanings,

00:05:11.331 --> 00:05:14.254
that it didn't really
say what I wanted to say.

00:05:14.254 --> 00:05:16.167
And in fact, if you looked on Amazon,

00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:18.605
you would find not only
the famous, important book,

00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:21.966
related to this topic, Denial of Death,

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:23.937
but numerous books with
the word denial in them.

00:05:23.937 --> 00:05:26.317
(crowd laughing)

00:05:26.317 --> 00:05:27.150
The more I thought about it,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.028
I'd realize that, actually,
the publisher and agent

00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:32.647
were right.

00:05:32.647 --> 00:05:35.265
All these books are talking,
really, about various versions

00:05:35.265 --> 00:05:37.207
of the same phenomenon,

00:05:37.207 --> 00:05:40.539
the human penchant for denying reality.

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.257
And, in fact, as you read more,

00:05:42.257 --> 00:05:46.498
I found other books by
many famous authors,

00:05:46.498 --> 00:05:47.897
all of which, are on different topics,

00:05:47.897 --> 00:05:50.736
but all contain pieces of the same story,

00:05:50.736 --> 00:05:53.955
a human ability to ignore reality.

00:05:53.955 --> 00:05:56.195
Let me give you some practical examples.

00:05:56.195 --> 00:05:58.460
As a physician, I am
acutely aware of the fact

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.754
that lack of exercise,
unhealthy diet, tobacco use,

00:06:01.754 --> 00:06:05.425
ignoring obesity, high
blood pressure, sleep apnea,

00:06:05.425 --> 00:06:09.846
poor hygiene, and excessive
red meat are bad for you.

00:06:09.846 --> 00:06:13.227
But, I'm not gonna ask for
a show of hands, because...

00:06:13.227 --> 00:06:15.375
(crowd laughing)

00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:19.363
Physicians, like myself,
are equally guilty.

00:06:19.363 --> 00:06:21.894
Then, we have massive denial
of scientific reality.

00:06:21.894 --> 00:06:25.893
Biological evolution, climate
change, magical cures,

00:06:25.893 --> 00:06:28.816
vaccines don't work, worse,
still, they cause autism,

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:33.106
despite of being
debunked, UFOs, of course,

00:06:33.106 --> 00:06:35.335
weird cancer risks, not real ones,

00:06:35.335 --> 00:06:37.887
and here, in San Diego,
fluoride in the waters,

00:06:37.887 --> 00:06:39.196
a Communist plot.

00:06:39.196 --> 00:06:42.708
(crowd laughing)

00:06:42.708 --> 00:06:44.731
And then, there are many
examples of societal denial

00:06:44.731 --> 00:06:46.057
of practical reality.

00:06:46.057 --> 00:06:50.748
National debt, each of
you owes 150,000 dollars.

00:06:50.748 --> 00:06:54.776
Health care costs, end of
life costs, covert racism,

00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:57.769
population growth, and
insistence on rebuilding,

00:06:57.769 --> 00:07:00.459
in exactly the places where
the worth earthquakes, floods,

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:02.792
and hurricanes have occured.

00:07:04.955 --> 00:07:07.498
And then, of course, the
examples of political distortion

00:07:07.498 --> 00:07:10.505
of reality.
(crowd laughing)

00:07:10.505 --> 00:07:11.413
I'm not gonna read this slide.

00:07:11.413 --> 00:07:12.893
You know what I'm talking about.

00:07:12.893 --> 00:07:14.701
(crowd laughing)

00:07:14.701 --> 00:07:17.029
But, to be fair, there
are plenty of examples

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:18.690
of distortion of reality,

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.740
at the other end of
the political spectrum.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.300
I think Calvin puts it well to Hobbes.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.908
"It's not denial.

00:07:25.908 --> 00:07:28.726
"I'm just very selective
about the reality I accept."

00:07:28.726 --> 00:07:32.026
(crowd laughing)

00:07:32.026 --> 00:07:35.257
So, after writing the book,
I had much difficulty,

00:07:35.257 --> 00:07:36.807
finding a single word, or phrase,

00:07:36.807 --> 00:07:38.507
that encompasses phenomenons,

00:07:38.507 --> 00:07:41.366
and when to use the phrase
identified in the dictionary,

00:07:41.366 --> 00:07:43.047
reality denial,

00:07:43.047 --> 00:07:44.440
which I'm defining as some kind of

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.405
subconscious defense mechanism,

00:07:46.405 --> 00:07:49.085
characterized by refusal to acknowledge,

00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:52.245
or rationalization of
unwanted, or unpleasant facts,

00:07:52.245 --> 00:07:54.637
realities, thoughts, or feelings.

00:07:54.637 --> 00:07:57.388
Now, so, I think we have
to add reality denial

00:07:57.388 --> 00:07:59.847
to the long list of
unusual and exaggerated

00:07:59.847 --> 00:08:01.556
cognitive features of humans,

00:08:01.556 --> 00:08:03.869
some of which, are listed here.

00:08:03.869 --> 00:08:05.219
But, for most of these other features,

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:08.136
we can think of good reasons
why they might have evolved,

00:08:08.136 --> 00:08:10.513
in terms of benefiting humans.

00:08:10.513 --> 00:08:12.696
But, at the reality
denial, there's a mystery.

00:08:12.696 --> 00:08:15.578
Excessive reality denial are
the kind that humans practice,

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:18.167
should be an evolutionary maladaptation.

00:08:18.167 --> 00:08:19.990
Excessive reality denial should result

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.995
in excessive risk taking
in the individuals

00:08:21.995 --> 00:08:23.821
who have the genetic ability to do that,

00:08:23.821 --> 00:08:27.722
should disappear.
(crowd laughing)

00:08:27.722 --> 00:08:30.392
So, how, and why, did
excessive reality denial

00:08:30.392 --> 00:08:32.891
risk taking evolve in humans?

00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:37.367
And what benefits outweigh
those negative consequences?

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:40.217
So now, this brings me another
extension of Danny's idea,

00:08:40.217 --> 00:08:43.648
that the independent
evolution of self-awareness,

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.401
in the very same intelligent creatures

00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:47.241
that we've discussed before,

00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:49.209
although, lots of arguments
about the techniques

00:08:49.209 --> 00:08:51.159
used in the real conclusions,

00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:54.050
it's reasonably clear that chimpanzees,

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.510
and perhaps, elephants,
dolphins and magpies,

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.452
can recognize themselves in the mirror,

00:08:59.452 --> 00:09:01.243
and have some kind of sense of self.

00:09:01.243 --> 00:09:03.970
It's hard to define exactly what it is.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.020
But, they certainly do have this.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:10.191
So, are animals and birds with
awareness of their own self,

00:09:10.191 --> 00:09:12.060
also aware of the self-awareness

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.222
of others of their own kind?

00:09:14.222 --> 00:09:16.193
I asked myself that question,
and did some reading,

00:09:16.193 --> 00:09:18.663
and realized I was
thinking about something

00:09:18.663 --> 00:09:21.763
that's been well-studied,
called theory of mind,

00:09:21.763 --> 00:09:24.384
the ability to attribute
mental beliefs, desires,

00:09:24.384 --> 00:09:27.420
intentions, and perspectives, to oneself,

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.800
and to others, and to
understand that others, also,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.331
have beliefs, desires,
intentions, and perspectives,

00:09:32.331 --> 00:09:35.500
that are similar, or
different, from one's own.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:36.664
There are many other related terms,

00:09:36.664 --> 00:09:39.392
intentionality, et cetera,
that I won't go through.

00:09:39.392 --> 00:09:41.534
But, they are overlapping terms.

00:09:41.534 --> 00:09:44.503
After reading further, I
realized there's a continuum

00:09:44.503 --> 00:09:46.767
in the cognitive development
of theory of mind,

00:09:46.767 --> 00:09:48.520
and intentionality.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.429
A two year old human
passes the mirror test.

00:09:51.429 --> 00:09:52.401
A three-to-four year old human

00:09:52.401 --> 00:09:56.182
has a more rudimentary
theory of mind, that emerges.

00:09:56.182 --> 00:09:58.668
A five year old human has
a full theory of mind,

00:09:58.668 --> 00:10:02.835
and can tell excellent lies.
(crowd laughing)

00:10:05.477 --> 00:10:07.645
But, adult humans have
something that I might call

00:10:07.645 --> 00:10:11.485
extended theory of mind, or
multi-order intentionality.

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:13.714
Their ability to do what
we are doing right now.

00:10:13.714 --> 00:10:16.466
You're reading my mind,
I'm reading your mind,

00:10:16.466 --> 00:10:18.535
and there are a hundred people,
or several hundred people,

00:10:18.535 --> 00:10:20.762
across the world, on the live Internet,

00:10:20.762 --> 00:10:23.248
watching and thinking of what
you're thinking, or perhaps,

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:24.717
something different.

00:10:24.717 --> 00:10:25.788
And with the Internet, of course,

00:10:25.788 --> 00:10:28.328
we can have millions of minds
melted across the world,

00:10:28.328 --> 00:10:29.686
at the same time.

00:10:29.686 --> 00:10:31.706
So, the question, and this
is, of course, a continuum,

00:10:31.706 --> 00:10:34.484
the question arises, why is
this extended theory of mind

00:10:34.484 --> 00:10:36.147
so well developed in adult humans,

00:10:36.147 --> 00:10:38.527
and apparently, not in other species?

00:10:38.527 --> 00:10:41.418
So, here's my expansion of Danny's idea.

00:10:41.418 --> 00:10:45.258
I suggest that there was a
psychological evolution barrier

00:10:45.258 --> 00:10:48.547
that held back all these
other intelligent species,

00:10:48.547 --> 00:10:51.809
at about this point in the
evolution of theory of mind.

00:10:51.809 --> 00:10:53.751
What might that barrier be?

00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:55.881
We can now come back to the
theme of this symposium,

00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:57.656
and suggest there's also a continuum

00:10:57.656 --> 00:10:59.114
in the awareness of death risk,

00:10:59.114 --> 00:11:01.474
and understanding of personal mortality.

00:11:01.474 --> 00:11:03.427
I may not have my numbers exactly correct,

00:11:03.427 --> 00:11:08.303
but, seems to me that you first
have an automated reaction

00:11:08.303 --> 00:11:11.165
to death risk, which, as Joe pointed out,

00:11:11.165 --> 00:11:14.311
many species, or all species should have.

00:11:14.311 --> 00:11:16.732
Some kind of awareness of death risk.

00:11:16.732 --> 00:11:18.334
And if some kind of self-awareness

00:11:18.334 --> 00:11:19.985
was enhanced at that time,

00:11:19.985 --> 00:11:21.805
you would, maybe, become
aware of the death

00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:23.755
of another individual.

00:11:23.755 --> 00:11:26.753
But, if I substitute
crows for magpies here,

00:11:26.753 --> 00:11:28.350
it's the very same animal birds,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.173
and birds the seem to evolve

00:11:30.173 --> 00:11:32.288
some kind of awareness
of death we heard about

00:11:32.288 --> 00:11:34.314
earlier in the symposium,

00:11:34.314 --> 00:11:38.715
that seems right on the
cusp of what humans have.

00:11:38.715 --> 00:11:41.150
And yet, just short of it.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:43.829
So, the operative word
here, is mortality salience.

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:46.061
Conscious understanding and realization

00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:48.740
of one's personal mortality.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.247
So, if we go down this continuum, well,

00:11:51.247 --> 00:11:55.212
death anxiety may require
extended theory of mind.

00:11:55.212 --> 00:11:58.625
Truly understanding the
death of another individual

00:11:58.625 --> 00:12:00.535
would result in
understanding the mortality

00:12:00.535 --> 00:12:02.294
of other individuals.

00:12:02.294 --> 00:12:04.542
And this conscious
awareness would exaggerate

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:06.282
the systems we've heard about,

00:12:06.282 --> 00:12:09.220
that extensive, and
not just actual events,

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.262
but even thinking about it,

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:13.173
at the level of
consciousness, as Joe said.

00:12:13.173 --> 00:12:16.737
Such individuals would then have reduction

00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:19.225
in reproductive fitness.

00:12:19.225 --> 00:12:21.245
Evolution doesn't care if you survive.

00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:23.755
Evolution cares if you reproduce.

00:12:23.755 --> 00:12:25.227
And I suspect that those individuals

00:12:25.227 --> 00:12:26.965
who first ran into this barrier,

00:12:26.965 --> 00:12:29.853
and maybe it happened many
times, in many species,

00:12:29.853 --> 00:12:31.743
had reduction in reproductive fitness,

00:12:31.743 --> 00:12:34.074
and could not transmit their genotype.

00:12:34.074 --> 00:12:36.343
So then, the emergence of
extended theory of mind

00:12:36.343 --> 00:12:39.382
would result in awareness of mortality,

00:12:39.382 --> 00:12:43.260
and again, a failure to fix
the genotype in two species.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.232
We've already said that reality
denial should be negative,

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:48.932
so, what of these two
unusual, cognitive features

00:12:48.932 --> 00:12:52.252
emerged in the same
minds, at the same time,

00:12:52.252 --> 00:12:54.603
a rare, negative, double-negative,

00:12:54.603 --> 00:12:58.022
which could result sufficient
tolerance of death anxiety,

00:12:58.022 --> 00:13:01.003
to establish the combination of species.

00:13:01.003 --> 00:13:04.164
Thus, perhaps, two rare
evolutionary maladpatations,

00:13:04.164 --> 00:13:06.811
or negatives, could
have coincided to allow

00:13:06.811 --> 00:13:10.314
this mind over reality transition.

00:13:10.314 --> 00:13:11.835
I have a much more extended view of this,

00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:13.443
that we don't have time to discuss.

00:13:13.443 --> 00:13:16.193
(crowd laughing)

00:13:17.572 --> 00:13:19.247
I need to talk to the experts to it,

00:13:19.247 --> 00:13:22.117
before I go any further with that.

00:13:22.117 --> 00:13:23.964
But, "Any theory that makes progress,

00:13:23.964 --> 00:13:26.858
"is bound to be initially
counterintuitive."

00:13:26.858 --> 00:13:29.647
So, I'd like to suggest
that this hypothetical

00:13:29.647 --> 00:13:31.586
singular phase in human evolution,

00:13:31.586 --> 00:13:35.400
which mortality salience and
maladaptive death anxiety

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.830
were triggered by acquiring
extended theory of mind,

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:42.209
which result in an understanding
of personal mortality.

00:13:42.209 --> 00:13:44.090
But then, one time only,

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.368
were stabilized by
simultaneous acquisition

00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:49.372
of general reality
denial, in the same minds.

00:13:49.372 --> 00:13:51.148
I remember asking Danny, there couldn't be

00:13:51.148 --> 00:13:53.798
a death denial module.

00:13:53.798 --> 00:13:56.257
But, he came to the
same conclusion I have.

00:13:56.257 --> 00:13:58.187
We just deny anything we don't like.

00:13:58.187 --> 00:13:59.867
(crowd laughing)

00:13:59.867 --> 00:14:01.580
So, there are other consequences.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.674
After-life myths,
superstitions, religiosity,

00:14:04.674 --> 00:14:07.272
self-deception,
over-confidence, risk-taking,

00:14:07.272 --> 00:14:10.502
and last, but not least,
the optimism bias.

00:14:10.502 --> 00:14:13.692
Humans are well known to
be irrationally optimistic.

00:14:13.692 --> 00:14:17.253
Many studies have shown
this, even in fMRI studies.

00:14:17.253 --> 00:14:18.484
And evolutionary modeling...

00:14:18.484 --> 00:14:21.862
(crowd laughing)

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:24.100
Shows that reacting, in
an overconfident manner,

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.137
can have fitness benefits,

00:14:26.137 --> 00:14:28.082
as long as the contested resources

00:14:28.082 --> 00:14:31.234
are sufficiently large, compared
to the cost of competition.

00:14:31.234 --> 00:14:32.682
Now, if you combine overconfidence

00:14:32.682 --> 00:14:36.849
with extended theory of
mind, you got big success.

00:14:37.892 --> 00:14:39.860
Of course, here's a case, I believe,

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.982
of initially successful, but eventually,

00:14:41.982 --> 00:14:44.399
fatal case of reality denial.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.220
So, how important is reality denial?

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.322
Let's do a thought
experiment, and delete it.

00:14:51.322 --> 00:14:53.073
Well, some other features of humans,

00:14:53.073 --> 00:14:56.431
would condemn the partially eliminated,

00:14:56.431 --> 00:14:59.960
but let's not dim theory of
mind, and eliminate that.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.530
And you find that most of these unusual,

00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:03.841
exaggerative cognitive features of humans,

00:15:03.841 --> 00:15:06.839
while they could still be
present, would be greatly dimmed.

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:09.105
So, I suggested this combination

00:15:09.105 --> 00:15:11.640
could give you this transition,

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.319
which is consistent so
far, with all-known facts,

00:15:14.319 --> 00:15:16.501
compatible with the other theories,

00:15:16.501 --> 00:15:18.380
not negated by currently-known facts,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.423
but is not not directly testable

00:15:20.423 --> 00:15:22.054
by experimental reproduction,

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:25.734
or directly falsifiable by
experimental approaches.

00:15:25.734 --> 00:15:27.484
Now, "The great tragedy of science

00:15:27.484 --> 00:15:30.012
"is the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:33.333
"by an ugly fact."
(crowd laughing)

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.324
And I've been searching for that fact,

00:15:35.324 --> 00:15:38.183
to destroy this hypothesis.

00:15:38.183 --> 00:15:39.843
If you can find it, let me know.

00:15:39.843 --> 00:15:41.884
But, it can't just be, I don't like it.

00:15:41.884 --> 00:15:44.986
(crowd laughing)

00:15:44.986 --> 00:15:48.176
So, when did this occur in
human evolution, finally?

00:15:48.176 --> 00:15:49.877
We know that about two million years ago,

00:15:49.877 --> 00:15:52.498
our ancestors from Africa,
some stayed behind,

00:15:52.498 --> 00:15:54.620
and some spread all across the old world,

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.847
to give rise to neanderthals
and many other species.

00:15:57.847 --> 00:16:01.365
And this went down for
almost two millions years,

00:16:01.365 --> 00:16:04.538
leaving behind many
species and subspecies.

00:16:04.538 --> 00:16:07.286
But, the types of things
that you might think

00:16:07.286 --> 00:16:09.797
might be related to theory of mind,

00:16:09.797 --> 00:16:13.840
reality denial leaves no
signal that I could think of.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.188
But, symbolic art, complex tool making,

00:16:16.188 --> 00:16:20.821
personal ornamentation,
burials with added materials,

00:16:20.821 --> 00:16:23.760
all occur around 100-to-200,000 years ago.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.917
Again, the experts would be
much more precise than I am.

00:16:27.917 --> 00:16:29.278
This happens to be about the time

00:16:29.278 --> 00:16:30.593
that the human migration

00:16:30.593 --> 00:16:32.488
and the peopling of the world occurred,

00:16:32.488 --> 00:16:35.376
in which species evolved in Africa,

00:16:35.376 --> 00:16:37.277
and then gradually
spread across the world,

00:16:37.277 --> 00:16:40.157
and essentially took over the planet.

00:16:40.157 --> 00:16:42.676
And we are now, unlike
most of the subspecies,

00:16:42.676 --> 00:16:43.968
where there are multiple species,

00:16:43.968 --> 00:16:48.348
we are the lone survivors and
the masters of the planet.

00:16:48.348 --> 00:16:50.966
So, while we can't be
sure, I'd like to speculate

00:16:50.966 --> 00:16:54.536
that the evolution of
anatomically-modern humans,

00:16:54.536 --> 00:16:56.753
into behaviorally modern humans,

00:16:56.753 --> 00:16:59.064
which is seen in the archeological record,

00:16:59.064 --> 00:17:01.545
although it's quite incomplete,

00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:05.345
may have, at least, partly
involved this transition.

00:17:05.345 --> 00:17:08.865
So, it so happens this theory can provide

00:17:08.865 --> 00:17:11.173
a unifying explanation,

00:17:11.173 --> 00:17:13.811
for several unusual
exaggerated features of humans,

00:17:13.811 --> 00:17:16.792
such as theory of mind, which
is beneficial for many things,

00:17:16.792 --> 00:17:19.663
reality denial, strong
tendency to self-deception

00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:22.458
and false beliefs,
overarching optimism bias,

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:25.674
risk-taking behavior,
recent emergence, perhaps,

00:17:25.674 --> 00:17:29.943
as the dominant species, and
replacement of everybody else.

00:17:29.943 --> 00:17:33.365
Remember, this would have
to have a genetic basis.

00:17:33.365 --> 00:17:35.084
There are some examples
of supporting evidence

00:17:35.084 --> 00:17:37.275
I don't have time to talk about.

00:17:37.275 --> 00:17:39.371
And issues arising, and future directions,

00:17:39.371 --> 00:17:41.193
I don't have time to talk about, but...

00:17:41.193 --> 00:17:42.351
(crowd laughing)

00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:44.253
I would point out that
some of the brain regions

00:17:44.253 --> 00:17:47.483
involved in optimism
bias, anxiety and so on,

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:50.864
are related to some of these things.

00:17:50.864 --> 00:17:54.568
So, finally, let me close, by
coming back to Danny Brower.

00:17:54.568 --> 00:17:58.626
From Danny Brower's 2007 draft manuscript,

00:17:58.626 --> 00:18:01.664
"We are polluting the earth
and changing the climate

00:18:01.664 --> 00:18:05.798
"in ways that we can't predict,
and likely at some point,

00:18:05.798 --> 00:18:07.487
"can't easily reverse.

00:18:07.487 --> 00:18:10.828
"If we're so smart, why do
we continue to sow the seeds

00:18:10.828 --> 00:18:12.857
"for our eventual destruction?

00:18:12.857 --> 00:18:14.598
"Perhaps, because we
are saddled with a brain

00:18:14.598 --> 00:18:15.878
"that is designed by selection

00:18:15.878 --> 00:18:18.055
"to cope with the
ultimate disaster, death,

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.846
"by denying that it will occur,

00:18:19.846 --> 00:18:21.875
"and so we treat other impending disasters

00:18:21.875 --> 00:18:24.565
"by denying that they will ever happen.

00:18:24.565 --> 00:18:25.655
"Indeed, it it is arguable

00:18:25.655 --> 00:18:29.067
"that we are destined to
destroy ourselves as a species."

00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.658
2007.

00:18:30.658 --> 00:18:32.608
You don't have to listen
to climate scientists,

00:18:32.608 --> 00:18:35.287
just look at the HSBC banks projection

00:18:35.287 --> 00:18:37.046
for what they're gonna run into,

00:18:37.046 --> 00:18:39.651
in terms of extreme weather events.

00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:41.525
Personally, I think this is a case

00:18:41.525 --> 00:18:46.128
where legitimate fear
mongering is appropriate.

00:18:46.128 --> 00:18:48.589
It's global and local climate destruction,

00:18:48.589 --> 00:18:49.710
not just climate change,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.779
affecting you and everybody
else that you know

00:18:51.779 --> 00:18:53.309
in your backyard.

00:18:53.309 --> 00:18:56.017
Again, this quote I found
in Danny's manuscript,

00:18:56.017 --> 00:18:58.953
"A man who carries a cat by the tail

00:18:58.953 --> 00:19:01.842
"learns something he can
never learn in any other way."

00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:04.592
(crowd laughing)

00:19:07.032 --> 00:19:10.671
We have caught the
climate tiger by the tail,

00:19:10.671 --> 00:19:12.912
and we better let go soon.

00:19:12.912 --> 00:19:14.656
Finally, from Danny's manuscript here,

00:19:14.656 --> 00:19:16.819
a lot of cartoons I couldn't
reproduce in the book,

00:19:16.819 --> 00:19:20.278
for copyright reasons, but
I'm just showing one of them.

00:19:20.278 --> 00:19:21.918
Dr. Dutz.

00:19:21.918 --> 00:19:25.358
"The bad news is you've
got advanced-stage humans.

00:19:25.358 --> 00:19:27.332
"The good news is they've
just about run their course

00:19:27.332 --> 00:19:29.050
"and you should be on the mend soon."

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.478
(crowd laughing)

00:19:32.478 --> 00:19:34.138
So, that, I'd like to close with the idea

00:19:34.138 --> 00:19:36.683
that two, rare evolution maladaptions,

00:19:36.683 --> 00:19:39.112
this is just a theory for discussion,

00:19:39.112 --> 00:19:40.296
might have coincided to allow

00:19:40.296 --> 00:19:42.337
the mind over reality transition.

00:19:42.337 --> 00:19:43.527
Thank you.

00:19:43.527 --> 00:19:46.627
(crowd applauding)

00:19:46.627 --> 00:19:48.519
- In the 1860s or so,

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:52.588
a Scottish essayist, and I'm
very fond of, Alexander Smith,

00:19:52.588 --> 00:19:55.360
wrote, "It is our knowledge
that we have to die

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:57.108
"that makes us human."

00:19:57.108 --> 00:20:01.275
And, couple of decades later,
William James, in the 1890s,

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.515
he'd called death "the worm at the core

00:20:05.515 --> 00:20:07.379
"of the human experience."

00:20:07.379 --> 00:20:10.752
And then, if we fast
forward a couple of decades,

00:20:10.752 --> 00:20:14.464
almost a century after that, in the 1970s,

00:20:14.464 --> 00:20:17.422
the cultural anthropologist,
Ernest Becker,

00:20:17.422 --> 00:20:21.560
he won a Pulitzer Prize for
his book, The Denial of Death,

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:23.569
in which he basically elaborated

00:20:23.569 --> 00:20:28.064
on that basic idea, it is our
knowledge that we have to die,

00:20:28.064 --> 00:20:29.740
that makes us human.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.079
And he did so, by trying
to frame these ideas,

00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:38.166
in both an evolutionary,
as well as an existential,

00:20:38.166 --> 00:20:39.861
psychodynamic fashion.

00:20:39.861 --> 00:20:42.313
And what Becker does,

00:20:42.313 --> 00:20:44.162
even though this may sound a tad dated,

00:20:44.162 --> 00:20:45.323
given some of the ideas

00:20:45.323 --> 00:20:48.144
that we've already been exposed to today,

00:20:48.144 --> 00:20:50.107
is to just start with, I think,

00:20:50.107 --> 00:20:53.120
the relatively simple
Darwinian assumption,

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:57.116
that people are very similar
to all other forms of life,

00:20:57.116 --> 00:21:01.177
in that we're biologically
predisposed to survive,

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:03.374
both in an interest of self-preservation,

00:21:03.374 --> 00:21:07.896
as well as reproducing, and
extending our chance overtime.

00:21:07.896 --> 00:21:11.191
On the other hand, Darwin
noticed, very early on,

00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:13.309
that there's lots of ways,

00:21:13.309 --> 00:21:15.251
over billions of years of evolution,

00:21:15.251 --> 00:21:18.110
that different forms of
life have accomplished,

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:21.239
that most arduous task
of persisting overtime,

00:21:21.239 --> 00:21:23.340
so everything from the turtle shells,

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.762
to the eagle's eyesight,
and it raises the question

00:21:26.762 --> 00:21:28.487
of what is it,

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:32.262
that is responsible for
our fantastic success?

00:21:32.262 --> 00:21:34.381
And the answer is there's lots of things,

00:21:34.381 --> 00:21:37.588
of both physical and psychological,

00:21:37.588 --> 00:21:40.920
including our relatively-large forebrain,

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.544
that gives us the capacity
to think abstractly,

00:21:43.544 --> 00:21:47.245
and symbolically, to
the point Becker notes

00:21:47.245 --> 00:21:50.092
that only human beings,
as far as we can tell,

00:21:50.092 --> 00:21:52.893
can imagine something
that doesn't yet exist,

00:21:52.893 --> 00:21:55.253
and then, have the audacity
to take our dreams,

00:21:55.253 --> 00:21:57.964
and render them into reality.

00:21:57.964 --> 00:22:00.004
Some of you have probably
seen a few head shakes.

00:22:00.004 --> 00:22:01.154
I know it's late in the day.

00:22:01.154 --> 00:22:04.323
Who's seen da Vinci's
drawings of helicopters

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:06.143
in the 1500s?

00:22:06.143 --> 00:22:09.955
And when he did that, people
said, wow, that's crazy.

00:22:09.955 --> 00:22:12.601
And yet, today, we are
routinely transported

00:22:12.601 --> 00:22:14.409
by what was originally denounced

00:22:14.409 --> 00:22:16.650
as the doodlings of a madman.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.692
And so, abstract, symbolic thought,

00:22:19.692 --> 00:22:22.136
has certainly served us very well,

00:22:22.136 --> 00:22:25.429
and I like how Otto Rank, one
of Freud's disciples, put it,

00:22:25.429 --> 00:22:30.164
when he said that "Only human
beings make the unreal real."

00:22:30.164 --> 00:22:31.505
What Becker then does, though,

00:22:31.505 --> 00:22:34.416
is to move back in time,
a couple of decades,

00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:36.822
and to think about this idea in light

00:22:36.822 --> 00:22:41.052
of the Danish existential
philosopher, Soren Kierkegaard,

00:22:41.052 --> 00:22:43.565
and it was Kierkegaard who pointed out,

00:22:43.565 --> 00:22:46.342
that human beings are so smart,

00:22:46.342 --> 00:22:49.509
that we come to realize that we exist,

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.940
self-awareness, complex theory of mind.

00:22:55.134 --> 00:22:57.009
The way that Kierkegaard put it,

00:22:57.009 --> 00:23:00.631
it takes a ridiculously-sophisticated,
cognitive apparatus,

00:23:00.631 --> 00:23:03.061
to render yourself, the object,

00:23:03.061 --> 00:23:06.100
of your own subjective inquiry.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.629
And what Kierkegaard did,

00:23:07.629 --> 00:23:10.259
in a little book called
Fear and Trembling,

00:23:10.259 --> 00:23:11.576
that I always recommend you buy

00:23:11.576 --> 00:23:14.665
for your in-laws' coffee
table, as a holiday gift,

00:23:14.665 --> 00:23:16.425
what Kierkegaard said,

00:23:16.425 --> 00:23:20.153
was that there are emotional ramifications

00:23:20.153 --> 00:23:22.972
of being explicitly self-aware.

00:23:22.972 --> 00:23:27.139
And he described them as being
both awesome and dreadful.

00:23:28.755 --> 00:23:32.665
Kierkegaard said, you know
what, it's really great

00:23:32.665 --> 00:23:36.255
to be self-aware, and to be alive.

00:23:36.255 --> 00:23:38.086
Who's ever had one of those magic moments,

00:23:38.086 --> 00:23:40.585
you wake up on a
beautiful day, like today.

00:23:40.585 --> 00:23:42.106
You didn't win a Nobel Prize,

00:23:42.106 --> 00:23:44.277
or you didn't win a great fortune,

00:23:44.277 --> 00:23:46.515
and yet, you're just
sublimely appreciative

00:23:46.515 --> 00:23:48.167
of the fact that you're alive.

00:23:48.167 --> 00:23:50.088
Everybody does look pretty happy today.

00:23:50.088 --> 00:23:52.157
(crowd laughing)
I grew up in New Jersey.

00:23:52.157 --> 00:23:53.460
So, it's a little dicier.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:57.030
But, I think, for the most
part, we all understand,

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.011
just the sublime and
spontaneous exuberance

00:24:00.011 --> 00:24:03.460
that comes from being alive,
and knowing that we're here.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.520
On the other hand, Kierkegaard
turns right around,

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.396
and he says, yeah, but it's
also dreadful to be alive,

00:24:10.396 --> 00:24:14.304
and to know it, because less
GB, either a small child,

00:24:14.304 --> 00:24:16.215
or neurologically impaired,

00:24:16.215 --> 00:24:18.419
if you're smart enough
to know that you're here,

00:24:18.419 --> 00:24:20.459
you're also smart enough to know that,

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:21.739
like all living things,

00:24:21.739 --> 00:24:24.180
your life is a finite duration.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:26.646
Moreover, you're smart enough to realize

00:24:26.646 --> 00:24:28.746
that your life could end in any time,

00:24:28.746 --> 00:24:32.145
for reasons that you could
never anticipate, or control.

00:24:32.145 --> 00:24:35.169
And that, from a purely
biological perspective,

00:24:35.169 --> 00:24:37.265
you're a breathing piece
of defecating meat,

00:24:37.265 --> 00:24:40.417
that is no more fundamentally
significant, or enduring,

00:24:40.417 --> 00:24:42.298
than a lizard, or a potato.

00:24:42.298 --> 00:24:44.399
And, what Becker argued,

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:47.621
is that the explicit awareness

00:24:47.621 --> 00:24:50.160
of the reality of the human condition,

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.658
we will all someday die.

00:24:51.658 --> 00:24:54.059
We can die at any time.

00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:57.678
We're breathing pieces of
meat, cold cuts with attitudes.

00:24:57.678 --> 00:24:58.511
We're Spam.

00:24:58.511 --> 00:25:00.835
We're the plan boat, if you've got no can,

00:25:00.835 --> 00:25:04.668
would literally debilitate
us with paralyzing,

00:25:05.518 --> 00:25:07.439
existential terror.

00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:11.180
And what Becker proposed,
is that human beings

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:14.309
manage the terror that is engendered

00:25:14.309 --> 00:25:16.731
by the awareness of their mortality,

00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:18.648
by embedding ourselves,

00:25:19.583 --> 00:25:21.734
in what the anthropologists call culture,

00:25:21.734 --> 00:25:24.932
humanly-constructed beliefs
about the nature of reality,

00:25:24.932 --> 00:25:27.413
that we share with our
fellow human beings,

00:25:27.413 --> 00:25:30.340
that give us a sense
that life have meaning,

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:32.119
and that we have value.

00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:34.911
And what Becker points
out, as an anthropologist,

00:25:34.911 --> 00:25:39.189
is that all cultures have
stories, or accounts,

00:25:39.189 --> 00:25:41.070
of the origin of the universe.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.289
All cultures have prescriptions
for how we ought behave

00:25:44.289 --> 00:25:45.520
while we're here.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.008
All cultures offer hope of
immortality, either literally,

00:25:49.008 --> 00:25:50.930
through the heavens,
souls, and afterlives,

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:52.930
of the world's great religions,

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.790
or symbolically, through the belief

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.218
that while you may not be here,

00:25:56.218 --> 00:25:58.381
and I may not be here forever,

00:25:58.381 --> 00:25:59.832
we're comforted by the prospect

00:25:59.832 --> 00:26:02.662
that some manifestation of our existence

00:26:02.662 --> 00:26:05.712
will persist over time,
perhaps, from having children,

00:26:05.712 --> 00:26:07.892
perhaps, from amassing great fortunes,

00:26:07.892 --> 00:26:12.059
perhaps, from producing great
works of art and science.

00:26:13.486 --> 00:26:15.659
Moreover, what culture does for us,

00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:17.581
is to give us, each, social roles,

00:26:17.581 --> 00:26:20.080
with associated standards of conduct,

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.222
that if we meet, or exceed them,

00:26:22.222 --> 00:26:25.469
allow us to think that
we're persons of value,

00:26:25.469 --> 00:26:26.819
in a world of meaning.

00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:29.452
And when we do think
that way about ourselves,

00:26:29.452 --> 00:26:31.710
Becker called that self-esteem.

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:35.689
His argument is that because
our beliefs about the world,

00:26:35.689 --> 00:26:38.960
and because self-esteem are so important,

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.451
that whether we're aware of it, or not,

00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:43.871
most of our behavior from day to day,

00:26:43.871 --> 00:26:48.350
is motivated in the service
of maintaining those beliefs.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.572
Alright, two questions.

00:26:49.572 --> 00:26:51.461
One question is, so what?

00:26:51.461 --> 00:26:55.592
And the other is question,
is any of this true?

00:26:55.592 --> 00:26:58.271
The so what question, in our world,

00:26:58.271 --> 00:27:01.708
is generally framed in
transit conceptual power,

00:27:01.708 --> 00:27:03.739
what is it that you could understand,

00:27:03.739 --> 00:27:07.905
if you momentarily accept the
voracity of Becker's claims,

00:27:07.905 --> 00:27:11.602
that it might be less easy
to understand otherwise,

00:27:11.602 --> 00:27:13.526
and then, the second question is,

00:27:13.526 --> 00:27:15.337
well is there any evidence,

00:27:15.337 --> 00:27:18.007
in support of these views?

00:27:18.007 --> 00:27:19.546
What we did, and when I say we,

00:27:19.546 --> 00:27:21.366
I mean, my buddies Jeff Greenberg,

00:27:21.366 --> 00:27:22.866
now, at the University of Arizona,

00:27:22.866 --> 00:27:25.917
and Tom Pyszczynski, now at
the University of Colorado,

00:27:25.917 --> 00:27:27.751
at Colorado Springs.

00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:31.278
We developed a very simple
laboratory paradigm.

00:27:31.278 --> 00:27:34.238
It's called the mortality
salience paradigm,

00:27:34.238 --> 00:27:37.155
and the logic, I think,
is disarmingly simple.

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:40.545
We just said, alright, if
these ideas are correct,

00:27:40.545 --> 00:27:43.906
if our beliefs about
reality serve to mitigate

00:27:43.906 --> 00:27:48.279
death anxiety, well, let's
bring people into the lab,

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:52.149
and let's remind them
that they're going to die.

00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:55.061
And in controlled conditions,
let's remind them,

00:27:55.061 --> 00:27:56.259
it's not as glorious as it sounds,

00:27:56.259 --> 00:27:58.774
let's remind them, in
controlled conditions,

00:27:58.774 --> 00:28:01.394
of something unpleasant, but not fatal.

00:28:01.394 --> 00:28:04.156
For students, think about your next exam.

00:28:04.156 --> 00:28:07.222
For regular people, think
about going to the dentist,

00:28:07.222 --> 00:28:10.130
and needing a root canal
without anesthesia.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.539
Think about being in a car crash,

00:28:12.539 --> 00:28:14.510
and having a limb amputated.

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:18.301
All unpleasant, but
not particularly fatal.

00:28:18.301 --> 00:28:20.315
Alright, in our typical paradigm,

00:28:20.315 --> 00:28:23.366
we bury in a bunch of personality scales,

00:28:23.366 --> 00:28:24.808
two open-ended questions,

00:28:24.808 --> 00:28:26.640
"Please briefly describe the emotions

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.530
"that the thought of your
own death arouse in you,"

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:32.192
and "Jot down, as specifically as you can,

00:28:32.192 --> 00:28:35.359
"what you think will happen
to you as you physically die."

00:28:35.359 --> 00:28:37.257
Alright, we do this in
a lot of ways, though.

00:28:37.257 --> 00:28:39.498
Sometimes, we go outside the lab,

00:28:39.498 --> 00:28:43.396
and we stop people, either in
front of the funeral parlor,

00:28:43.396 --> 00:28:46.258
or a hundred meters to either side,

00:28:46.258 --> 00:28:49.157
thinking that when you're in
front of a funeral parlor,

00:28:49.157 --> 00:28:52.507
death may be on your mind,
even if you don't know it.

00:28:52.507 --> 00:28:54.927
And then, the most subtle paradigm,

00:28:54.927 --> 00:28:57.426
we call it subliminal death primes.

00:28:57.426 --> 00:28:59.644
If you come to my office at Skidmore,

00:28:59.644 --> 00:29:02.195
you can your email, and
while you're doing that,

00:29:02.195 --> 00:29:06.154
we'll flash the word
death for 28 milliseconds,

00:29:06.154 --> 00:29:10.856
so fast, that you don't know
that you have been exposed

00:29:10.856 --> 00:29:13.236
to that rather unwelcome stimulus.

00:29:13.236 --> 00:29:14.815
Alright, so, that's what we do.

00:29:14.815 --> 00:29:17.866
All of these methods
produce the same outcomes.

00:29:17.866 --> 00:29:19.549
And so, let's briefly talk about

00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:21.787
some of the areas of inquiry.

00:29:21.787 --> 00:29:26.358
A lot of them, Ajit mentioned
earlier, in his fine talk.

00:29:26.358 --> 00:29:27.316
Alright, so what do we know,

00:29:27.316 --> 00:29:30.936
based on almost 40 years of research?

00:29:30.936 --> 00:29:33.568
Our original interest
was trying to understand

00:29:33.568 --> 00:29:35.908
why people can't get
along with other people,

00:29:35.908 --> 00:29:38.936
who don't share their beliefs
about the nature of reality.

00:29:38.936 --> 00:29:40.731
And what Ernest Becker said

00:29:40.731 --> 00:29:43.633
in a book called Escape from Evil,

00:29:43.633 --> 00:29:48.043
is that other people pose
an existential challenge

00:29:48.043 --> 00:29:49.941
to our belief systems,

00:29:49.941 --> 00:29:53.981
because if you accept an
alternative conception of reality,

00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:56.422
you do so, by undermining the confidence

00:29:56.422 --> 00:29:59.432
with which you subscribe to your own.

00:29:59.432 --> 00:30:03.252
And when you do that,
you undermine the beliefs

00:30:03.252 --> 00:30:06.622
that serve to minimize your anxiety.

00:30:06.622 --> 00:30:07.455
And what he proposed,

00:30:07.455 --> 00:30:10.285
is that when we run into
people who are different,

00:30:10.285 --> 00:30:13.344
the first thing we do is to
denigrate or belittle them.

00:30:13.344 --> 00:30:17.042
While we do that, we
simultaneously try to get them

00:30:17.042 --> 00:30:20.792
to get rid of their ideas,
and adopt ours instead.

00:30:20.792 --> 00:30:22.951
And if that doesn't work,
just kill those people,

00:30:22.951 --> 00:30:26.869
thus proving that my god
is better than your god,

00:30:26.869 --> 00:30:29.191
and we will kick your ass to prove it.

00:30:29.191 --> 00:30:31.142
Now, in support of that view,

00:30:31.142 --> 00:30:34.166
what we know in several hundred studies,

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:36.154
conducted all over the world,

00:30:36.154 --> 00:30:38.782
by our people and independent researchers,

00:30:38.782 --> 00:30:42.822
is, for example, Christians
reminded of their mortality,

00:30:42.822 --> 00:30:45.187
they like fellow Christians a lot more,

00:30:45.187 --> 00:30:47.048
and they hate Jewish people.

00:30:47.048 --> 00:30:49.447
If you go to Israel,
and remind Jewish people

00:30:49.447 --> 00:30:52.170
of their mortality,
they love Jewish people,

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.321
and they hate Arabs and Christians.

00:30:54.321 --> 00:30:56.344
Germans reminded of their mortality

00:30:56.344 --> 00:30:59.293
sit closer to fellow Germans,

00:30:59.293 --> 00:31:01.104
and they sit further away from people

00:31:01.104 --> 00:31:03.112
who look like Turkish immigrants.

00:31:03.112 --> 00:31:05.726
Iranians reminded of their mortality,

00:31:05.726 --> 00:31:08.807
become more supportive of suicide bombers,

00:31:08.807 --> 00:31:12.920
and more willing to become
a suicide bomber themselves.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:15.007
In America, as you know,
we're very practical.

00:31:15.007 --> 00:31:16.646
We're not about to blow ourselves up,

00:31:16.646 --> 00:31:18.716
but we're happy to blow up other people.

00:31:18.716 --> 00:31:21.198
When we remind Americans
of their mortality,

00:31:21.198 --> 00:31:23.879
they become more supportive
of the preemptive use

00:31:23.879 --> 00:31:27.003
of biological, nuclear,
and chemical weapons,

00:31:27.003 --> 00:31:30.732
against countries who pose
no direct threat to us.

00:31:30.732 --> 00:31:34.899
Another area of inquiry,
for us, that's not funny,

00:31:36.328 --> 00:31:40.871
has been understanding
how existential anxieties

00:31:40.871 --> 00:31:43.561
have a radical effect on
political preferences.

00:31:43.561 --> 00:31:46.063
Max Weber, the German sociologist

00:31:46.063 --> 00:31:48.525
at the beginning of the 20th century,

00:31:48.525 --> 00:31:51.473
coined the term charismatic leader.

00:31:51.473 --> 00:31:54.507
He said that in times
of historical upheaval,

00:31:54.507 --> 00:31:58.065
and existential anxieties
are apt to be aroused,

00:31:58.065 --> 00:32:00.727
that we often embrace a certain kind

00:32:00.727 --> 00:32:03.925
of seemingly larger than life leader,

00:32:03.925 --> 00:32:06.117
who he called charismatic.

00:32:06.117 --> 00:32:07.455
And he said that, very often,

00:32:07.455 --> 00:32:09.896
these are people who believe to be,

00:32:09.896 --> 00:32:14.125
either divinely ordained,
or self-appointed,

00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:15.915
in order to rid the world of evil.

00:32:15.915 --> 00:32:18.086
And we got interested in this,

00:32:18.086 --> 00:32:21.909
in the aftermath of September 11th, 2001.

00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:24.904
Old-timers may remember
that in a three-week period,

00:32:24.904 --> 00:32:28.315
President George W. Bush
went from the least liked,

00:32:28.315 --> 00:32:31.627
to the most liked president
in American history.

00:32:31.627 --> 00:32:35.995
We did a lot of studies,
leading up to the 2004 election,

00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:40.137
where we showed that Americans
preferred Senator John Kerry

00:32:40.137 --> 00:32:44.087
to President Bush, in
a benign state of mind.

00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:47.355
However, when they were reminded
of their mortality first,

00:32:47.355 --> 00:32:49.645
they liked President Bush a whole lot more

00:32:49.645 --> 00:32:51.657
than Senator Kerry.

00:32:51.657 --> 00:32:53.076
Ditto, on this election.

00:32:53.076 --> 00:32:55.868
This summer, we found in several studies,

00:32:55.868 --> 00:32:58.980
that our respondents
preferred Secretary Clinton

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.090
to now-President Trump,

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:05.133
when they were in a
psychologically-benign state of mind.

00:33:05.133 --> 00:33:08.520
However, when they were reminded
of their mortality first,

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.910
their affection and support

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:13.835
for the President Trump
increased, and they now liked him,

00:33:13.835 --> 00:33:16.334
more than they did Secretary Clinton.

00:33:16.334 --> 00:33:17.332
Alright, let's keep going,

00:33:17.332 --> 00:33:21.294
and let's see how death
anxiety fosters an alienation

00:33:21.294 --> 00:33:25.265
from nature, and contempt
for the environment.

00:33:25.265 --> 00:33:27.923
John Locke, in the 1890s,

00:33:27.923 --> 00:33:29.473
in The Second Treatise on Government,

00:33:29.473 --> 00:33:32.306
pointed out that anything that's natural,

00:33:32.306 --> 00:33:34.712
it is of finite duration.

00:33:34.712 --> 00:33:36.825
And, of course, that's what we chafe at,

00:33:36.825 --> 00:33:38.814
and that may have been
the psychological impetus

00:33:38.814 --> 00:33:42.305
for the construction of the supernatural.

00:33:42.305 --> 00:33:44.177
And to the extent, that's true.

00:33:44.177 --> 00:33:47.710
When death is on our mind, we
should chafe at the prospect

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:49.350
that we're animals,

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:52.209
and we should be uncomfortable in nature.

00:33:52.209 --> 00:33:54.060
And that's exactly what we find.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.985
People, who are reminded
of their mortality,

00:33:56.985 --> 00:34:00.890
that take issue with claims
that humans are animals.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.479
They have more negative
attitudes towards animals,

00:34:03.479 --> 00:34:05.327
and think it's okay to kill them,

00:34:05.327 --> 00:34:09.626
for reasons other than
food, and medical research.

00:34:09.626 --> 00:34:11.896
People reminded of their mortality,

00:34:11.896 --> 00:34:16.063
become more uncomfortable,
when they're out in nature.

00:34:16.943 --> 00:34:19.535
And people reminded of their mortality,

00:34:19.535 --> 00:34:22.406
become more willing to greedily exploit

00:34:22.406 --> 00:34:24.951
non-renewable natural resources.

00:34:24.951 --> 00:34:27.842
And, of course, we can't
talk about the plundering

00:34:27.842 --> 00:34:32.204
of the environment, without
a concurrent consideration

00:34:32.204 --> 00:34:36.371
of our seemingly insatiable
desire, for money and stuff.

00:34:37.414 --> 00:34:40.645
I like how Big Daddy in Cat
on a Hot Tin Roof put it,

00:34:40.645 --> 00:34:43.510
when he said, "The human
animal is a beast that dies,

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:45.739
"and if he's got money, he
buys, and buys, and buys,

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:48.940
"and I think the reason he buys
everything that he can buy,

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.301
"is that, in the back of his mind,

00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:53.201
"he has the crazy hope
that one of his purchases

00:34:53.201 --> 00:34:55.218
"will be life ever-lasting."

00:34:55.218 --> 00:34:57.680
And research shows that Big
Daddy's right on the money.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:01.020
People reminded of their mortality,

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:04.570
say that they have higher
fiscal aspirations.

00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.066
And they say it would take more money,

00:35:07.066 --> 00:35:10.152
before they would perceive
themselves as wealthy.

00:35:10.152 --> 00:35:13.550
People reminded of their
mortality want more stuff.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:16.773
Not just any stuff, they want
high-status luxury items,

00:35:16.773 --> 00:35:18.940
like a Lexus, and a Rolex.

00:35:19.971 --> 00:35:22.404
When people are reminded
of their mortality,

00:35:22.404 --> 00:35:25.021
and you ask 'em to draw pictures of money,

00:35:25.021 --> 00:35:26.440
they draw bigger pictures,

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:30.202
as if money looms larger,
when death is on their mind.

00:35:30.202 --> 00:35:33.981
And just giving people
money to count, not to keep,

00:35:33.981 --> 00:35:37.564
just counting money,
reduces death anxiety.

00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:42.596
If you like cookies, and
you're reminded of death,

00:35:42.596 --> 00:35:43.765
you eat more cookies.

00:35:43.765 --> 00:35:46.575
If you smoke cigarettes, and
you're reminded of death,

00:35:46.575 --> 00:35:47.724
you smoke more cigarettes.

00:35:47.724 --> 00:35:51.290
If you drink alcohol, and
you're reminded of death,

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:53.207
you drink more alcohol.

00:35:54.275 --> 00:35:56.786
(stammers) Well, so,

00:35:56.786 --> 00:35:59.096
Thomas Hardy, one of my
favorite novelists, said,

00:35:59.096 --> 00:36:01.119
"If a way to the better there be,

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:04.846
"it comes from taking a
close look at the worst."

00:36:04.846 --> 00:36:07.389
And just to follow up
on some of the things

00:36:07.389 --> 00:36:08.747
that Ajit talked about

00:36:08.747 --> 00:36:10.664
at the end of his talk,

00:36:11.655 --> 00:36:15.756
I would argue that
malignant manifestations

00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:17.936
of death anxiety,

00:36:17.936 --> 00:36:20.836
surely, do not bring out the best in us.

00:36:20.836 --> 00:36:25.111
They seem to turn us into
hateful, warmongering,

00:36:25.111 --> 00:36:27.543
proto-fascist, plundering the planet,

00:36:27.543 --> 00:36:29.581
in our insatiable quest for dollars,

00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:32.800
and draws in a television, alcohol, drug,

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:35.049
Facebook, Twitter-induced stupor.

00:36:35.049 --> 00:36:36.991
And...
(crowd laughing)

00:36:36.991 --> 00:36:40.408
And Danny Brower might be right, in 2007,

00:36:41.912 --> 00:36:45.329
when he said that, wow, an ironic effect,

00:36:46.578 --> 00:36:50.745
or to deny death, may be that
we are the first form of life

00:36:51.988 --> 00:36:53.669
to have the ignominious distinction

00:36:53.669 --> 00:36:56.690
of being responsible for our extinction.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:57.729
Alright, having said that, though,

00:36:57.729 --> 00:36:59.593
let me close on a more positive note,

00:36:59.593 --> 00:37:00.983
and just point out,
(crowd laughing)

00:37:00.983 --> 00:37:05.043
usually, I stop now, and
I go, thank you very much.

00:37:05.043 --> 00:37:06.611
On a more positive note, though,

00:37:06.611 --> 00:37:09.452
human beings, we have a good
track record, historically,

00:37:09.452 --> 00:37:11.382
of extricating ourselves

00:37:11.382 --> 00:37:13.777
from some very difficult circumstances,

00:37:13.777 --> 00:37:17.846
once we understand what underlies them.

00:37:17.846 --> 00:37:21.158
In the middle ages, when people
were dropping like flies,

00:37:21.158 --> 00:37:22.421
from the plague,

00:37:22.421 --> 00:37:24.830
when we thought that it
was caused by evil spirits,

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:26.792
we really didn't get anywhere.

00:37:26.792 --> 00:37:29.909
On the other hand, when we
realized that it was bacteria,

00:37:29.909 --> 00:37:33.096
then, we were able to develop penicillin,

00:37:33.096 --> 00:37:36.094
and that led to modern medicine.

00:37:36.094 --> 00:37:38.390
Similarly, what I would like to think,

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:40.701
even if this appears naively optimistic,

00:37:40.701 --> 00:37:44.990
is that if we could
collectively come to recognize

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:46.860
the incredible problems,

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:50.934
that excessive death denial has produced,

00:37:50.934 --> 00:37:54.859
then, maybe, we can
also collectively deploy

00:37:54.859 --> 00:37:58.618
our remarkable creativity, and ingenuity,

00:37:58.618 --> 00:38:02.687
in order to nudge our
species into a more benign,

00:38:02.687 --> 00:38:05.189
or maybe, even more benevolent direction.

00:38:05.189 --> 00:38:08.228
I like how Camus put it,
"Come to terms with death.

00:38:08.228 --> 00:38:10.767
"Thereafter, anything is possible."

00:38:10.767 --> 00:38:12.065
Maybe an overstatement,

00:38:12.065 --> 00:38:15.594
but no harm in using this as
a standard to approximate.

00:38:15.594 --> 00:38:16.427
Thank you very much.

00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:20.105
(crowd applauding)

00:38:20.105 --> 00:38:21.135
- And such, you said,

00:38:21.135 --> 00:38:24.360
we thought we should discuss
this issue of suicide

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.800
at this meeting, because it is something,

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.353
which is almost certainly,

00:38:28.353 --> 00:38:32.516
had a major bearing on
history of our own species.

00:38:32.516 --> 00:38:37.247
I've shown the panel from
a late Roman ivory casket,

00:38:37.247 --> 00:38:39.130
which is in the British Museum.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.977
You'll see, it shows two very
different examples of humans,

00:38:42.977 --> 00:38:46.436
who brought death on
themselves deliberately.

00:38:46.436 --> 00:38:49.344
Jesus, who had no desire to stop living,

00:38:49.344 --> 00:38:53.054
but who believed his death
would benefit all mankind.

00:38:53.054 --> 00:38:56.496
And then, Judas, who had no
thought of benefiting others,

00:38:56.496 --> 00:39:00.385
(stammers) but assumed that his own death

00:39:00.385 --> 00:39:05.076
would at least put an end to
his own intolerable guilt.

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:08.857
Suicide used to be called self-murder.

00:39:08.857 --> 00:39:11.227
It may seem hard to associate,

00:39:11.227 --> 00:39:15.299
harsher to say, to associate
suicide with murder.

00:39:15.299 --> 00:39:16.132
But, if we're looking

00:39:16.132 --> 00:39:18.718
for the evolutionary
antecedents of suicide,

00:39:18.718 --> 00:39:22.869
I think this does, in fact,
get us off on the right foot.

00:39:22.869 --> 00:39:25.702
Humans have always been murderers.

00:39:26.639 --> 00:39:28.446
First, of course,

00:39:28.446 --> 00:39:31.498
they've been killers
of other living beings.

00:39:31.498 --> 00:39:34.539
First, of course, they were
killers of animal prey,

00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:36.674
for food, and everybody in the community

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:39.790
would've been involved directly, in that.

00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:43.151
But, they were also killers
of other human beings.

00:39:43.151 --> 00:39:45.666
Not everyone would've
had firsthand experience

00:39:45.666 --> 00:39:47.325
of assassination.

00:39:47.325 --> 00:39:50.178
But, everyone would've known
about it, and talked about it,

00:39:50.178 --> 00:39:52.425
and note, celebrated it.

00:39:52.425 --> 00:39:55.045
And then, the idea dawned.

00:39:55.045 --> 00:39:59.846
Here's how psychiatrist
Erwin Stengel has put it.

00:39:59.846 --> 00:40:03.466
"At some stage of evolution,
man must have discovered,

00:40:03.466 --> 00:40:06.475
"that he can kill not only
animals and fellow-men,

00:40:06.475 --> 00:40:08.589
"but also himself.

00:40:08.589 --> 00:40:11.226
"It can be assumed that
life has never since

00:40:11.226 --> 00:40:13.047
"been the same for him."

00:40:13.047 --> 00:40:15.961
But, I think it wasn't
so much the discovery,

00:40:15.961 --> 00:40:18.764
that he can kill himself,
that would've changed things.

00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:21.763
It was the discovery
of what killing himself

00:40:21.763 --> 00:40:23.313
would've amounted to,

00:40:23.313 --> 00:40:24.735
that it would've amounted to

00:40:24.735 --> 00:40:27.835
removing himself from the world.

00:40:27.835 --> 00:40:30.418
A human could choose not to be.

00:40:31.654 --> 00:40:34.246
That's why non-human
animals don't, and can't,

00:40:34.246 --> 00:40:35.731
commit suicide.

00:40:35.731 --> 00:40:38.705
At any rate, even if
they do kill themselves,

00:40:38.705 --> 00:40:40.864
as perhaps, these whales did,

00:40:40.864 --> 00:40:42.832
we shouldn't call it suicide.

00:40:42.832 --> 00:40:46.556
Though, that BBC headline
clearly did suggest we might.

00:40:46.556 --> 00:40:49.165
The whales can't have been choosing death,

00:40:49.165 --> 00:40:50.683
because, so far, as we know,

00:40:50.683 --> 00:40:54.804
they haven't discovered what death means.

00:40:54.804 --> 00:40:57.086
But, humans, of course, have done.

00:40:57.086 --> 00:40:59.037
Humans can choose death,

00:40:59.037 --> 00:41:01.986
knowing pretty well what it'll
mean for them personally.

00:41:01.986 --> 00:41:04.041
Now, I think Stengel's right to say,

00:41:04.041 --> 00:41:08.205
that this discovery has
been transformative.

00:41:08.205 --> 00:41:12.069
But, we still have to ask,
transformative in just what ways?

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:14.411
And if we're thinking
about human evolution,

00:41:14.411 --> 00:41:18.080
the question must be,
what effects, good or bad,

00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:21.997
did this discovery have
on biological survival?

00:41:23.319 --> 00:41:26.288
Other kinds of killing
can clearly be adaptive.

00:41:26.288 --> 00:41:30.978
It's easier to explain the
survival advantages of hunting.

00:41:30.978 --> 00:41:34.180
It's not difficult to explain
the advantages of war,

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.180
or homicide.

00:41:36.078 --> 00:41:39.358
But, common sense would seem
to say that self-killing

00:41:39.358 --> 00:41:42.641
must be the ultimately
disadvantageous act,

00:41:42.641 --> 00:41:45.671
a sure path to genetic oblivion.

00:41:45.671 --> 00:41:48.161
Yes, the stark fact is,

00:41:48.161 --> 00:41:51.670
that suicide is alarmingly
common, right across the world.

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:52.950
Someone in the United States

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:55.830
kills themselves every 12 minutes.

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:57.247
That's 120 a day.

00:41:58.088 --> 00:42:01.129
Across the world, more
people die from suicide,

00:42:01.129 --> 00:42:04.379
than all wars, and homicides, combined.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.631
We surely have to ask, then,

00:42:07.631 --> 00:42:11.214
is suicide biologically
adaptive after all?

00:42:12.182 --> 00:42:14.019
Well, the answer's not going to be simple.

00:42:14.019 --> 00:42:15.918
As I implied with my first slide,

00:42:15.918 --> 00:42:17.706
I think we need to distinguish

00:42:17.706 --> 00:42:20.547
two rather different kinds of suicide.

00:42:20.547 --> 00:42:23.006
And we can call them as their kind did,

00:42:23.006 --> 00:42:26.436
altruistic suicide and egoistic suicide.

00:42:26.436 --> 00:42:28.544
And I want to suggest a correspond

00:42:28.544 --> 00:42:33.318
to two rather different
conceptions of what death does.

00:42:33.318 --> 00:42:35.660
The first, and simplest conception,

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:39.782
is that death results in the
annihilation of the body.

00:42:39.782 --> 00:42:42.049
The dead person is no longer an actor

00:42:42.049 --> 00:42:44.702
in the physical, or social world.

00:42:44.702 --> 00:42:46.403
And corresponding to this,

00:42:46.403 --> 00:42:50.013
when people choose to bring
about their own death,

00:42:50.013 --> 00:42:53.252
they're, maybe, trying to
make things better for others,

00:42:53.252 --> 00:42:56.344
by giving up their own bodily presence.

00:42:56.344 --> 00:42:57.522
Jesus died on the cross,

00:42:57.522 --> 00:43:01.382
in the hope of becoming
the savior of all mankind.

00:43:01.382 --> 00:43:04.294
Or, for a more straightforward
example, Captain Oates,

00:43:04.294 --> 00:43:06.293
stumbled out to die in the snow,

00:43:06.293 --> 00:43:08.366
in the hope of relieving the burden

00:43:08.366 --> 00:43:12.876
for the remaining members
of Scott's polar expedition.

00:43:12.876 --> 00:43:15.938
Altruistic suicide, we can call that.

00:43:15.938 --> 00:43:18.916
But, could this kind
of suicide be adaptive?

00:43:18.916 --> 00:43:20.254
It certainly could be,

00:43:20.254 --> 00:43:23.885
provided it benefits the
subject's kin, or social group.

00:43:23.885 --> 00:43:24.924
In fact, it's possible,

00:43:24.924 --> 00:43:28.582
that a propensity for altruistic suicide,

00:43:28.582 --> 00:43:31.722
has been selected in humans,
in rather the same way

00:43:31.722 --> 00:43:34.091
that something like it has been selected

00:43:34.091 --> 00:43:36.398
in the social instance.

00:43:36.398 --> 00:43:39.608
So, maybe, humans are
genetically predisposed,

00:43:39.608 --> 00:43:42.581
like ants or bees, to
sacrifice themselves,

00:43:42.581 --> 00:43:44.237
for the common good,

00:43:44.237 --> 00:43:47.288
in times of famine, or plague, or war,

00:43:47.288 --> 00:43:49.096
or simply, when they become too old

00:43:49.096 --> 00:43:51.517
and decrepit to carry on.

00:43:51.517 --> 00:43:54.103
But now, let's look at
another kind of suicide,

00:43:54.103 --> 00:43:56.471
perhaps, corresponding
to a second conception

00:43:56.471 --> 00:43:58.204
of what death does.

00:43:58.204 --> 00:44:02.250
It says that death results in
the annihilation of the mind.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.745
The dead person is no longer
a thinker, or a feeler.

00:44:05.745 --> 00:44:08.194
In correspondence to this conception,

00:44:08.194 --> 00:44:10.055
when people kill themselves,

00:44:10.055 --> 00:44:13.837
they're, maybe, trying to make
things better for themselves,

00:44:13.837 --> 00:44:17.056
by giving up on their
own conscious presence.

00:44:17.056 --> 00:44:19.575
Judas Iscariot sought conscious oblivion,

00:44:19.575 --> 00:44:24.254
because he could not live with
his internal sense of shame.

00:44:24.254 --> 00:44:27.282
This young couple could not bear the pain

00:44:27.282 --> 00:44:29.922
of being forbidden by
their families, to marry.

00:44:29.922 --> 00:44:32.385
This is egoistic suicide.

00:44:32.385 --> 00:44:35.463
And this, in many ways,
they're absolute opposite

00:44:35.463 --> 00:44:36.975
of altruistic suicide.

00:44:36.975 --> 00:44:39.146
Far from hoping to benefit others,

00:44:39.146 --> 00:44:42.135
these self-killers are
motivated, primarily,

00:44:42.135 --> 00:44:43.523
by self interest.

00:44:43.523 --> 00:44:46.205
They either don't care
about the effect on others,

00:44:46.205 --> 00:44:50.434
or, sometimes, they even
intend some kind of vengeance.

00:44:50.434 --> 00:44:52.195
And whether they intend it, or not,

00:44:52.195 --> 00:44:56.244
the effects on family and
friends are often devastating.

00:44:56.244 --> 00:44:59.533
Now, here's the problem from
an evolutionary point of view.

00:44:59.533 --> 00:45:03.861
The fact is, that 90 percent
of suicides are egotistical.

00:45:03.861 --> 00:45:06.374
The World Federation of
Mental Health, for example,

00:45:06.374 --> 00:45:10.537
reports that the most common
situations, or life events,

00:45:10.537 --> 00:45:12.980
that might cause suicidal thoughts,

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.070
that don't have to do
with helping other people,

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:19.313
that grief, sexual abuse,
financial problems, remorse,

00:45:19.313 --> 00:45:22.962
rejection, relationship
breakup, and unemployment.

00:45:22.962 --> 00:45:24.831
And anthropologist, Charles MacDonald,

00:45:24.831 --> 00:45:28.703
having surveyed suicide across
the whole world, concludes,

00:45:28.703 --> 00:45:32.322
"A cross-cultural comparison
shows that grief over,

00:45:32.322 --> 00:45:35.088
"and conflict between
closely related people,

00:45:35.088 --> 00:45:38.147
"together with sheer
physical pain and discomfort,

00:45:38.147 --> 00:45:40.069
"cause, or promote suicide

00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:42.539
"more often than any other circumstances.

00:45:42.539 --> 00:45:46.129
"The suicide simply
wants to stop hurting."

00:45:46.129 --> 00:45:49.142
What their egoistic
suicide wants to achieve,

00:45:49.142 --> 00:45:52.370
is basically self-euthanasia.

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:55.011
Well, could this be adaptive?

00:45:55.011 --> 00:45:57.130
Though, how could it possibly be?

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:00.047
Most egoistical suicides are young.

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:01.896
Across the world,

00:46:01.896 --> 00:46:04.223
it's the second-most
common cause of death,

00:46:04.223 --> 00:46:06.043
amongst teenagers.

00:46:06.043 --> 00:46:08.452
If they've not died by their own hand,

00:46:08.452 --> 00:46:10.533
this couple hadn't died by their own hand,

00:46:10.533 --> 00:46:12.911
they would, almost certainly,
have got over the hurt,

00:46:12.911 --> 00:46:16.861
and gone on to make a
success of their lives.

00:46:16.861 --> 00:46:18.341
Egoistic suicides,

00:46:18.341 --> 00:46:21.461
will end not only their
own biological fitness,

00:46:21.461 --> 00:46:23.952
but those other related individuals, too.

00:46:23.952 --> 00:46:25.661
So, what's going on?

00:46:25.661 --> 00:46:29.072
Why do these tragic deaths
happen so frequently?

00:46:29.072 --> 00:46:31.301
I think the answer's all too obvious.

00:46:31.301 --> 00:46:33.361
Humans, and humans alone,

00:46:33.361 --> 00:46:35.811
understand that by killing themselves,

00:46:35.811 --> 00:46:39.483
they can, indeed, stop the hurting.

00:46:39.483 --> 00:46:41.152
So, there must be circumstances,

00:46:41.152 --> 00:46:45.462
when they may well look on
suicide as a rational act.

00:46:45.462 --> 00:46:48.095
They feel sad, or jealous, or unloved,

00:46:48.095 --> 00:46:50.475
or inadequate, or whatever.

00:46:50.475 --> 00:46:54.103
These are feelings that
death will make go away.

00:46:54.103 --> 00:46:57.020
Nothing hurts less than being dead.

00:46:58.004 --> 00:47:02.262
In Hamlet's (stammers)
sorry, that once more,

00:47:02.262 --> 00:47:05.515
as the poetry of suicide,
continue to reminds us,

00:47:05.515 --> 00:47:09.303
this solution to the hurting
may not only be rational,

00:47:09.303 --> 00:47:12.533
it must, often be, relatively easy.

00:47:12.533 --> 00:47:14.992
In Hamlet's notorious soliloquy,

00:47:14.992 --> 00:47:17.462
"Who would bear the
whips and scorns of time,

00:47:17.462 --> 00:47:20.405
"The oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely,

00:47:20.405 --> 00:47:24.007
"The pangs of despised
love, the law's delay,

00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:26.898
"When he himself might his quietus make

00:47:26.898 --> 00:47:28.366
"With a bare bodkin?"

00:47:28.366 --> 00:47:29.399
A dagger.

00:47:29.399 --> 00:47:31.208
As some would recognize is,

00:47:31.208 --> 00:47:34.557
there's an unfortunate
truth about being human,

00:47:34.557 --> 00:47:37.997
probably more true of humans,
than any other animal,

00:47:37.997 --> 00:47:41.247
and it is that hurting is part of life.

00:47:42.237 --> 00:47:45.308
The part of Ceasuri
Provezi, said it explicitly,

00:47:45.308 --> 00:47:49.238
everyone, every human, has
a good reason for suicide.

00:47:49.238 --> 00:47:51.912
The philosopher, Wittgenstein,
once told a friend,

00:47:51.912 --> 00:47:54.898
that all his life, there
had hardly been a day,

00:47:54.898 --> 00:47:58.120
in which he hadn't thought
suicide a possibility.

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.910
More typically, among today's
American high school students,

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:05.480
60 percent say they've
considered killing themselves.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.151
14 percent have thought
about it seriously,

00:48:08.151 --> 00:48:09.660
in the last year.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.391
And five percent have attempted it.

00:48:12.391 --> 00:48:15.532
That's more than one
million students a year.

00:48:15.532 --> 00:48:19.340
Susan Sontag has written,
"How thin the line,

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:23.070
"between the will to
live, and the will to die.

00:48:23.070 --> 00:48:25.122
"How about a hole?" she asks.

00:48:25.122 --> 00:48:28.329
"A really deep hole, which
you put in a public place,

00:48:28.329 --> 00:48:29.888
"for general use.

00:48:29.888 --> 00:48:33.282
"In Manhattan, say, at the
corner of Seventieth and Fifth.

00:48:33.282 --> 00:48:37.179
"A sign beside the hole
reads: 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM,

00:48:37.179 --> 00:48:41.277
"Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays, suicide permitted.

00:48:41.277 --> 00:48:42.110
"Just that.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.355
"A sign.

00:48:43.355 --> 00:48:45.053
"Why, surely people would jump

00:48:45.053 --> 00:48:48.191
"who had hardly thought of it before."

00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:51.082
As I said, it's not only
rational, sometimes,

00:48:51.082 --> 00:48:52.901
but it's also very easy.

00:48:52.901 --> 00:48:55.110
Now, this is a CARTA symposium.

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.101
And we want to understand how humans,

00:48:57.101 --> 00:48:58.950
against all the odds, perhaps,

00:48:58.950 --> 00:49:02.274
have, in the end, survived and prospered.

00:49:02.274 --> 00:49:03.107
And it looks as though,

00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:06.346
suicide might be a very significant drain

00:49:06.346 --> 00:49:09.173
on the fitness of our ancestors.

00:49:09.173 --> 00:49:11.440
Looks as though it might
have been a major downside

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.834
of their growing sufficiently clever,

00:49:13.834 --> 00:49:16.321
to understand their own mortality.

00:49:16.321 --> 00:49:18.963
The very sequence Ajit talked about.

00:49:18.963 --> 00:49:19.796
It wouldn't have been bad,

00:49:19.796 --> 00:49:22.530
because (stammers) dangerous,
because they feared death,

00:49:22.530 --> 00:49:25.142
but because they were attracted to it.

00:49:25.142 --> 00:49:26.912
But, surely, natural selection, then,

00:49:26.912 --> 00:49:29.055
would've sorted this out long ago.

00:49:29.055 --> 00:49:33.028
Why haven't humans evolved to
have better innate defenses

00:49:33.028 --> 00:49:36.117
against suicide, built into their minds?

00:49:36.117 --> 00:49:38.717
Well, of course, Ajit thinks they have.

00:49:38.717 --> 00:49:41.097
When reality becomes too much to bear,

00:49:41.097 --> 00:49:42.930
people simply deny it.

00:49:44.235 --> 00:49:47.903
But, I confess, I don't see
this working as he says,

00:49:47.903 --> 00:49:50.013
or, at least, not in these contexts.

00:49:50.013 --> 00:49:52.379
I see no evidence that humans have evolved

00:49:52.379 --> 00:49:55.499
to have any kind of natural immunity

00:49:55.499 --> 00:49:58.520
to what I've called the lure of death.

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.420
To the contrary, I'm led
to think that in the past,

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.990
if not today, suicide might
have spread like measles,

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:07.768
in an unprotected population.

00:50:07.768 --> 00:50:09.628
In fact, measles is a surprisingly,

00:50:09.628 --> 00:50:12.188
alarmingly apposite analogy,

00:50:12.188 --> 00:50:17.096
because the suicide meme
happens to be highly infectious.

00:50:17.096 --> 00:50:18.753
It jumps from mind to mind,

00:50:18.753 --> 00:50:21.650
resulting in the
well-documented phenomenon

00:50:21.650 --> 00:50:23.740
of copycat suicides.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.441
As Durkheim wrote, "Suicide
is very contagious.

00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:29.609
"There is the well-known
story of the fifteen patients

00:50:29.609 --> 00:50:33.191
"who hung themselves, in
swift succession, in 1772,

00:50:33.191 --> 00:50:37.071
"from the same hook, in a
dark passage of the hospital."

00:50:37.071 --> 00:50:40.673
Suicide contagion has been
dubbed the Werther effect,

00:50:40.673 --> 00:50:43.521
after the hero of Goethe's novel,

00:50:43.521 --> 00:50:46.557
The Sorrows of Young Werther.

00:50:46.557 --> 00:50:48.861
In the novel, Werther kills himself,

00:50:48.861 --> 00:50:52.059
after falling hopelessly in
love with a married woman.

00:50:52.059 --> 00:50:54.959
Following its publication in 1774,

00:50:54.959 --> 00:50:58.390
there were literally hundreds
of copycat deaths in Germany.

00:50:58.390 --> 00:51:01.911
Recent researchers confirmed
just how strong the effect is.

00:51:01.911 --> 00:51:05.922
Every time a celebrity
suicide is given exposure

00:51:05.922 --> 00:51:09.570
in a newspaper, or TV,
the copycats follow.

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:11.834
It's estimated that
Marilyn Monroe's death,

00:51:11.834 --> 00:51:16.001
in August 1962, was responsible
for 200 actual suicides,

00:51:16.852 --> 00:51:17.865
within a month.

00:51:17.865 --> 00:51:20.144
After a popular South Korean actress,

00:51:20.144 --> 00:51:24.695
hung herself in 2008,
suicides jumped 66 percent

00:51:24.695 --> 00:51:25.583
that month,

00:51:25.583 --> 00:51:27.781
with young, hanging victims accounting

00:51:27.781 --> 00:51:30.350
for the most of the increase.

00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:33.411
But, 66 percent, that's nothing.

00:51:33.411 --> 00:51:35.319
There are some parts of the world today,

00:51:35.319 --> 00:51:38.877
where rates of suicide are ten
times the average elsewhere.

00:51:38.877 --> 00:51:42.865
And this turned out to be,
largely to do, with copying.

00:51:42.865 --> 00:51:46.342
Among these happy people,
on the island of Palawan,

00:51:46.342 --> 00:51:49.344
in the Philippines, MacDonald's
research has documented

00:51:49.344 --> 00:51:52.800
waves of suicides, spreading
through small villages.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:53.953
The question becomes, then,

00:51:53.953 --> 00:51:56.893
how prevalent was suicide
amongst our ancestors,

00:51:56.893 --> 00:51:59.244
say, 50,000 years ago?

00:51:59.244 --> 00:52:01.746
I don't think any paleoanthropologist

00:52:01.746 --> 00:52:03.856
has ever thought to ask.

00:52:03.856 --> 00:52:06.256
But, assuming humans, must by then,

00:52:06.256 --> 00:52:08.988
have required an understanding of death,

00:52:08.988 --> 00:52:12.836
we can be quite sure there were suicides.

00:52:12.836 --> 00:52:15.517
And let's remember, times were harsh,

00:52:15.517 --> 00:52:18.104
in the icy climate of central Europe.

00:52:18.104 --> 00:52:20.783
There would've been plenty
to be unhappy about,

00:52:20.783 --> 00:52:23.287
or think we shouldn't
allow the possibility

00:52:23.287 --> 00:52:24.574
that there were, indeed,

00:52:24.574 --> 00:52:27.192
recurrent plagues of egoistic suicide,

00:52:27.192 --> 00:52:30.562
with rates topping anything we see today.

00:52:30.562 --> 00:52:32.553
Well, if this is true,

00:52:32.553 --> 00:52:34.536
if there were these plagues of suicide,

00:52:34.536 --> 00:52:38.047
and I think it's a genuine,
scientific possibility,

00:52:38.047 --> 00:52:41.364
what could, and did,
bring it under control?

00:52:41.364 --> 00:52:45.315
Assuming humans have never
evolved adequate natural immunity

00:52:45.315 --> 00:52:48.716
to suicide, antidote, whatever it was,

00:52:48.716 --> 00:52:51.088
must have been cultural.

00:52:51.088 --> 00:52:53.337
And here, I have to say,
the picture's complicated,

00:52:53.337 --> 00:52:55.819
and not well-researched.

00:52:55.819 --> 00:52:58.388
Apparently, some of the
cultural barriers to suicide

00:52:58.388 --> 00:53:01.090
are, indeed, in plain view.

00:53:01.090 --> 00:53:03.600
In historical times, religious authorities

00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:07.336
have regularly issued
an athamus against it.

00:53:07.336 --> 00:53:09.858
Medieval Christianity
decreed that self-murderers

00:53:09.858 --> 00:53:11.568
would go to Hell.

00:53:11.568 --> 00:53:15.014
Victims would not be given
a decent burial, but rather,

00:53:15.014 --> 00:53:17.770
be buried at the crossroads, at night,

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:20.513
with a stake through the heart.

00:53:20.513 --> 00:53:22.528
In many countries, attempted suicide

00:53:22.528 --> 00:53:26.283
has also been made a crime,
under the common law.

00:53:26.283 --> 00:53:27.485
In the United Kingdom,

00:53:27.485 --> 00:53:31.652
attempted suicide was not
decriminalized, until 1961.

00:53:33.075 --> 00:53:37.242
In the ten years, pre-1961,
there were 6,000 prosecutions,

00:53:38.683 --> 00:53:42.850
5,400 attempted suicides were
filed guilty, and imprisoned,

00:53:44.125 --> 00:53:44.958
or fined.

00:53:45.863 --> 00:53:48.722
It was common practice
in the 1950s, in Britain,

00:53:48.722 --> 00:53:51.212
to have a policeman,
sitting at the bedside,

00:53:51.212 --> 00:53:55.273
of an unconscious patient,
in accident and emergency,

00:53:55.273 --> 00:53:59.440
waiting to interview the patient,
when he, or she, revived.

00:54:01.057 --> 00:54:03.501
There've also been attempts to
limit the spread of suicide,

00:54:03.501 --> 00:54:07.039
the suicide meme, by
limiting exposure to it.

00:54:07.039 --> 00:54:10.621
In Europe, after the
effect of Goethe's book

00:54:10.621 --> 00:54:14.208
became apparent, was soon
banned in several countries.

00:54:14.208 --> 00:54:16.420
In Germany, it was even forbidden to dress

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:20.527
like young Werther, in blue
coat, and yellow trousers.

00:54:20.527 --> 00:54:22.178
In most countries today,

00:54:22.178 --> 00:54:23.737
there are restrict press guidelines,

00:54:23.737 --> 00:54:26.578
intended to play down
the reporting of suicide,

00:54:26.578 --> 00:54:28.575
to keep it off the front page,

00:54:28.575 --> 00:54:31.678
and to avoid sensational headlines.

00:54:31.678 --> 00:54:34.105
So, we've had suicidal
acts being punished,

00:54:34.105 --> 00:54:36.525
and information about them suppressed.

00:54:36.525 --> 00:54:39.567
Do these measures actually work?

00:54:39.567 --> 00:54:41.579
My guess, I think there's reason to think,

00:54:41.579 --> 00:54:43.726
they actually, probably, do.

00:54:43.726 --> 00:54:47.044
Or, at any rate, there's no
reason to think that they don't.

00:54:47.044 --> 00:54:51.244
But, surely, more focused
methods ought to work as well.

00:54:51.244 --> 00:54:53.644
In place of punishment, or censorship,

00:54:53.644 --> 00:54:57.267
why not try to fight meme with meme?

00:54:57.267 --> 00:55:00.105
Why not oppose a destructive mind virus,

00:55:00.105 --> 00:55:02.494
with a redemptive one?

00:55:02.494 --> 00:55:06.633
What should we tell people,
who want to kill themselves?

00:55:06.633 --> 00:55:08.421
The English priest, Chad Varah,

00:55:08.421 --> 00:55:11.770
founded the Samaritans, in 1954,

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:15.262
a group dedicated to
talking suicides down,

00:55:15.262 --> 00:55:17.462
with words of reassurance.

00:55:17.462 --> 00:55:21.581
The message, there is hope,
may seem to verge on the banal,

00:55:21.581 --> 00:55:24.213
but, in fact, it's the
one message we can give

00:55:24.213 --> 00:55:25.566
with confidence.

00:55:25.566 --> 00:55:28.785
Research shows, that in
nine cases out of ten,

00:55:28.785 --> 00:55:31.017
the hurt isn't going to last.

00:55:31.017 --> 00:55:35.184
Here's Daniel Gilbert, who
actually quoted off of the book,

00:55:36.026 --> 00:55:38.078
Stumbling on Happiness,

00:55:38.078 --> 00:55:39.788
"Few of us can accurately gauge

00:55:39.788 --> 00:55:42.020
"how we will feel tomorrow, or next week.

00:55:42.020 --> 00:55:45.071
"We expect to feel devastated,
if our spouse leaves us,

00:55:45.071 --> 00:55:49.134
"or if we get passed over
for a big promotion at work.

00:55:49.134 --> 00:55:51.412
"But, when things like that do happen,

00:55:51.412 --> 00:55:54.369
"it's soon, 'She never was right for me,'

00:55:54.369 --> 00:55:58.038
"or, 'Actually, I needed more
free time for my family.'

00:55:58.038 --> 00:56:00.680
"People mistakenly expect such blows

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:04.353
"to be much more devastating
than they turn out to be."

00:56:04.353 --> 00:56:06.733
And since it's a pessimism bias,

00:56:06.733 --> 00:56:08.864
we think things are
going to be really bad,

00:56:08.864 --> 00:56:12.384
so bad, that we can do
nothing, but end our lives.

00:56:12.384 --> 00:56:14.683
But, the message of this
research, I suppose,

00:56:14.683 --> 00:56:16.814
is, don't jump now,

00:56:16.814 --> 00:56:21.071
because it's not what your
future self would choose.

00:56:21.071 --> 00:56:23.362
But, have we had to wait
for a Harvard psychologist

00:56:23.362 --> 00:56:24.851
to tell us this?

00:56:24.851 --> 00:56:26.012
No, thankfully not.

00:56:26.012 --> 00:56:27.411
The message is implicit.

00:56:27.411 --> 00:56:31.169
Perhaps, actually presumably,
for a good reason.

00:56:31.169 --> 00:56:34.931
In much of the hand-me-down
wisdom of our old cultures,

00:56:34.931 --> 00:56:38.240
in stories, and songs,
and proverbs, and so on.

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.083
And the good news for our species,

00:56:40.083 --> 00:56:43.714
is that on the whole, with
too many dreadful exceptions,

00:56:43.714 --> 00:56:46.712
hope can, and does, win out.

00:56:46.712 --> 00:56:48.782
And I think that's what basically

00:56:48.782 --> 00:56:53.463
has taken us out of the ice
ages, to where we are today.

00:56:53.463 --> 00:56:54.526
Okay.

00:56:54.526 --> 00:56:57.286
This is the closing talk of the symposium.

00:56:57.286 --> 00:57:01.764
We've heard a lot today, about
what a bad thing death is.

00:57:01.764 --> 00:57:03.033
We haven't actually heard much

00:57:03.033 --> 00:57:06.411
about what a good thing life
is, which is, in the end,

00:57:06.411 --> 00:57:08.762
of course, the whole point.

00:57:08.762 --> 00:57:11.470
So, I'll finish with a
passage from George Borrow's

00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:14.509
autobiographical novel, Lavengro,

00:57:14.509 --> 00:57:17.084
which echoes some of the things
actually Sheldon was saying.

00:57:17.084 --> 00:57:20.163
As Borrow tells it, he's
been reading Goethe,

00:57:20.163 --> 00:57:22.412
and it's an autobiography,
I think he had been,

00:57:22.412 --> 00:57:25.550
and he's toying with the idea of suicide.

00:57:25.550 --> 00:57:29.665
He gets into conversation
with a Romany gypsy, Jasper,

00:57:29.665 --> 00:57:31.967
who he's befriended on his travels.

00:57:31.967 --> 00:57:34.065
I'll read a passage from the novel.

00:57:34.065 --> 00:57:36.335
"'What is your opinion of death?' said I,

00:57:36.335 --> 00:57:39.014
"as I sat down beside him.

00:57:39.014 --> 00:57:41.594
"Jasper replies, 'Life is sweet, brother.

00:57:41.594 --> 00:57:43.835
"'Who would wish to die?'

00:57:43.835 --> 00:57:46.349
"'I would wish to die,'" says Borrow.

00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:48.978
"'You talk like a fool,' says Jasper.

00:57:48.978 --> 00:57:51.599
"'Wish to die, indeed.

00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:54.949
"'There's night and day,
brother, both sweet things;

00:57:54.949 --> 00:57:59.116
"'sun, moon, and stars,
brother, all sweet things.

00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:02.397
"'There's the wind on the heath, brother;

00:58:02.397 --> 00:58:07.006
"'if I could only feel that,
I would gladly live forever.'"

00:58:07.006 --> 00:58:08.326
Well, this painting is, in fact,

00:58:08.326 --> 00:58:10.425
called The Wind on the Heath.

00:58:10.425 --> 00:58:14.504
And I think the good news,
is that we've all been there.

00:58:14.504 --> 00:58:15.629
Well, thank you.

00:58:15.629 --> 00:58:17.727
(crowd applauding)

00:58:17.727 --> 00:58:21.477
