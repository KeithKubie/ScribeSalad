00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.020
- [Instructor] Having
become the first person

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:05.780
to complete the 1500-meter
freestyle swim at age 100,

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.750
a smile was worn by Mieko Nagaoka.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.050
So the way it's written right now,

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.620
it makes it seem like a smile, a smile,

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.370
was the first person to complete
the 1500-meter freestyle

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.730
swim at age 100, which
doesn't make much sense.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.160
And let's just think
about what's going on here

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.260
when you read this,
when someone is reading,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.370
when someone's reading, I'll
do this in a different color,

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.540
when someone is reading this part,

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.790
that I'll underline in red,
having become the first person

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.530
to complete the 1500-meter
freestyle swim at age 100,

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.610
and then there's the comma,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.830
your brain is expecting that
the first thing you read

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.870
is what was being described,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.470
the first person to complete
the 1500-meter freestyle swim.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.440
But then you see a smile, so
it looks like they're talking

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.800
about the smile was the
first person to complete

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.820
the 1500-meter freestyle
swim, but we of course know

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.220
that we're not talking about a smile,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.620
we're talking about Mieko Nagaoka.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.100
So this second part right over here,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.100
I want it to start with
Mieko, Mieko Nagaoka,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.810
was wearing a smile, maybe.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.773
So I definitely wanna change it.

00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:12.460
I definitely, definitely wanna change it.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.470
So let's see, having
become the first person

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.530
to do all this stuff,
happiness was evident.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.360
Well no, now it seems like
happiness was the first person

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.740
to complete the 1500-meter freestyle swim.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.380
So I don't like that choice.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.511
Having become the first
person to do all this stuff,

00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:31.120
Mieko Nagaoka wore a smile,
yep, that feels good,

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.470
'cause the first thing you see,

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.500
that was what was intended
to be the first person

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.860
to complete the 1500-meter
freestyle swim at age 100,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.530
so I'm liking this one.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.763
And this last choice,
it still has a smile,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.270
it's written, it makes
it seem like a smile

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.839
was the first person to
complete the 1500-meter

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:49.900
freestyle swim so I don't
like this one either

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.973
so I feel very good about this choice.
