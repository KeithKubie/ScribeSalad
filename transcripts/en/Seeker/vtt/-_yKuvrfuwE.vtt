00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.350
When people say they're "angry" and want to
vote to "restore" to some facsimile of American

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.700
past, does anyone else get deja vu?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:13.960
That's German for Deja-vu, by the wayâ€¦

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.120
Hey subjects and subjugators, you probably
recognize me, your friendly neighborhood Trace.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.380
According to the traditions and doctrines
of the United States of America, governments

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.220
should exist for the people, and be run by
the people.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.070
But sometimes, along the regular, legal path
of democracy, people elect authoritarian heads

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.410
of state.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.179
Authoritarians are those who favor or enforcing
strict obedience to authority, especially

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.440
that of the government, at the expense of
personal freedom.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.420
It's pretty obvious when one is around, and
is related to words like dictator, despot,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.809
draconian or tyrant.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.479
But why would anyone elect an authoritarian
government here?

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.550
Aren't we masses, yearning to be free?

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.739
In the 40s, political scientists began analyzing
authoritarian regimes to better understand

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.179
their rise.

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:00.309
Researcher Erich Fromm hypothesized people's
authoritarian voting stems from feelings of

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:01.309
insecurity.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.780
Hitler was elected, in part, because of German
fear of communism, and, according to researchers,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.000
when people are "faced with an uncertain world
and lack of direction, people will 'escape

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.760
from freedom,'" into security.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.539
In 1959, in the American Sociological Review,
a paper claims the working-class are the main

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.540
drivers of democratic authoritarianism.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.740
Researchers suggest authoritarianism can arise
not just out of political fear, but also from

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.920
a rapid rise of societal pluralism and threatened
economic interests.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.520
For example: the rise of ethnic minorities,
more sexual or social freedom, or the challenging

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.170
of some status-quo can all cause authoritarian
attitudes to grow.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.450
But that's not all, the authors of the book
"Psychology of Terrorism" say terrorism can

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.630
succeed by destabilizing the populace through
fear.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.549
In a democracy, the people drive the political
machine and if they are fearing for their

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.420
security, the overall democracy can become
vulnerable.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.600
Essentially, if a group of people feel their
economic stability is in jeopardy, their safety

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.030
is threatened in some way or their country
is no longer their own: then they may vote

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.069
for an authoritarian regime who they believe
can restore uniformity and security, and punish

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:08.069
difference.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.670
In the last 70 years, communication researchers
have crafted what's called authoritarian personality

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.180
theory to suss out who these voters may beâ€¦

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.130
They've found, some are predisposed to support,
without question, a candidate who they believe

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.530
is a strong, decisive, authoritative leader.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.210
Psychologists think this may be more common
in right-wing politics, but have to be careful

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.860
not to skew the research with the wrong questions.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.450
They can't simply ask if the voter will follow
orders without question, or if they dislike

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.750
certain groupsâ€¦ instead they ask if obedience
is a virtue, or if "people can be divided

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.030
into two classes: the strong and the weak."

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.480
What they've found is authoritarian personalities
tend to be thoses raised from childhood to

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.050
value conforming.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.420
They believe in obedience to people higher
up in social status than themselves, and defame

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.590
and mistrust those "below" them.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.560
The Social Psychology of Politics reads, "[Authoritarians]
believe obedience to authority is the only

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.790
morally-approvable position."

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.040
They'd then apply that opinion across their
life from work, to child-rearing, to politics

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.040
and government.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.380
So, when people raised in this way go to the
polls, they may be likely to vote for someone

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.050
who mimics this decisive, derisive and class-driven
worldview.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.090
If, due to fear, some voters were to choose
an authoritarian leader, there's no guarantee

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.880
that form of government would resolve those
fears.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.160
And if voters did,with free and legal elections
and a supportive Congress, vote in an authoritarian

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.480
leader, there's really nothing anyone could
do to stop them.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.250
As Conservative Supreme Court Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes Jr. said in 1920, "If my fellow

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.380
citizens want to go to hell, I will help them.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.380
It's my job."
