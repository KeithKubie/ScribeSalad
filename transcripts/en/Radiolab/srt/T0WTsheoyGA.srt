1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:05,930
You are listening to
radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:10,140
N y. S. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,010
[inaudible].

4
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,671
Okay. So Robert,

5
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:32,200
you know that like talking about music
in a way that's compelling can be kind of

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,630
hard, very hard, particularly the
music you like. Yeah, exactly.

7
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:39,140
It's really hard to sit to, to build a
bridge. And so when people do it well,

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,970
I just feel like you got
to give them prompts.

9
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,930
And I just ran into a really great
podcast that I think everyone should be

10
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:50,650
listening to. It's called meet the
composer. Uh, it's from Q2 music, uh,

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,400
which is sort of the digital
sister station of WQXR.

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,160
And it's kind of what it sounds, you know,

13
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:58,770
every episode they introduce
you to one composer,

14
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,080
but they do such a good job of seducing
you into listening and maybe caring

15
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:07,620
about music you wouldn't normally
listen to care about that.

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,570
I just thought, you know,

17
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:13,110
I really want to play some of their
latest episode for you because they just

18
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:16,590
focused on one of my favorite composers,
a guy by the name of John Luther Adams.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,270
Oh, the opera guy, John. No, no, no,
no, no, no. This is John Luther Adams,

20
00:01:21,271 --> 00:01:24,930
different John Adams and the other guy
I've heard of John Quincy Adams when he

21
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:26,820
was a former president United States. Yes.

22
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:31,821
This John Adams is a composer who makes
music that sort of conjures these wide

23
00:01:32,071 --> 00:01:36,780
open spaces that kind of invite you in
but also seems sort of indifferent to you

24
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:39,750
and maybe might kill you. It
has that kind of feeling to it.

25
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,910
I am intrigued. Okay. So,

26
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,430
so how does it be like we're going to
speak to this guy, this and this? The, uh,

27
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,160
the documentary begins, um, and by
the way, it's hosted by Nadia Sirota.

28
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:54,540
It begins, uh, with John Luther Adams
as a boy playing in a rock band.

29
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,730
Imagine 14 year old John in a cover
band in New Jersey opening for acts like

30
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:03,870
Buffalo Springfield and
playing predominantly the
three bs or the three base,

31
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:04,704
the Beatles,

32
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,090
the beach boys.

33
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,873
Okay.

34
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,060
So we started out as a cover band and
I got bored with that and so did my

35
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:22,560
buddies. And, uh,

36
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:27,561
over time we started trying our hand at
songwriting and I was a big fan of Frank

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,593
Zappa,

38
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,493
Frank Zappa,

39
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,610
the tee totalling 1960s and seventies
musician and polymath with wildly

40
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:46,540
eccentric tastes expanding from
rock to jazz to European modernism.

41
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,070
[inaudible] off as good as no should,
contemporary classical pieces.

42
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,470
And on the back of Frank's early LPS,

43
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,770
there would always be this
intriguing little quote,

44
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,290
the present day composer refuses to die
at Garver Rez and my little rock and

45
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:09,850
roll buddies. And I would read that and
scratch our heads and wonder how, Oh,

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,840
who is this for? Easy Guy, right? And

47
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:19,050
one day my friends take Einhorn was how
much Jane through the record bins and a

48
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:24,850
shopping in the West village and came
across this album with this mad scientist

49
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:29,860
on the cover with the great shock
of electrostatic green hair,

50
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:34,210
bushy eyebrows, stern countenance.

51
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:38,140
And the title was the music
of that guy for his volume.

52
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,780
So he bought it home and we

53
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,960
were Alpha groups.

54
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,720
It just all sounds like
a bunch of noise to me.

55
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,850
Her, this desert, this ocean.

56
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,600
This is forbidding mountains of, of sound.

57
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:06,370
And I remember thinking, I'll never
be able to know where I am in this.

58
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,740
I don't know what to hang on to.

59
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,590
So your response to what is this
music was just to immerse yourself.

60
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,130
Give me more. Yeah. Which has always
been my response to any new experience.

61
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:23,090
And I often encourage young musicians,

62
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,560
especially young composers, you know,

63
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:26,300
listen to everything you
can get your ears on,

64
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,330
especially the stuff you
think you don't like.

65
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,880
I started to realize, oh, okay,

66
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,920
there's that repeated note on the
oboe and okay, that's a landmark.

67
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:41,540
They can grab onto that. Oh, and here's
this place where there's sort of a,

68
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:43,290
a tattoo figure, what the snare drums,

69
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,990
and then these unisons stabs
in the rest of the percussion.

70
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,740
Gradually we began to learn how to
listen to the forbidding deserts of rent.

71
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,503
[inaudible]

72
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,523
[inaudible] [inaudible]

73
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,600
[inaudible] [inaudible].

74
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,880
Did that affect the music you
guys were making? Oh, sure.

75
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:28,300
It meant that the process that was
already underway was just accelerated.

76
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:30,570
We rapidly abandons the,

77
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,690
the one four five chords and the backbeat
and the four bar phrases and started

78
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,670
discovering cage and Feldman in nine.

79
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:43,570
Carol and Pauline Oliveros Wilson
were coffers and on and on,

80
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,450
so thank you Frank Salpa.

81
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,220
I love that. That was his
response to music that you know,

82
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:55,040
can be defined as very alienating. I
mean for Rez is not easy stuff, you know,

83
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,010
but instead of just writing it off
as ugly, he was like ugly. How? Yeah,

84
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,400
exactly. In case, just to
skip forward a little bit,

85
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:06,350
in the meeting composer hour from Q2,
John Luther Adams goes off to school.

86
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,160
He has a teacher named a,

87
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:12,050
I believe it's James Tenney is
one of his first big influences,

88
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:15,500
but he goes off to school at Cal Arts
and right afterwards he meets one of his

89
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,340
next big end [inaudible].

90
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,470
Well, I had just left cal arts,

91
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:29,710
hadn't yet gone to Alaska and I would
take long walks in the early morning and

92
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:36,851
again at dusk and I became
captivated by this singer.

93
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,090
Then I kept hearing deep in the woods
and I could never find the bird,

94
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,220
but I couldn't get enough of the song.

95
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,790
I started taking notes.

96
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,860
The birds became my
teacher after James Tenney

97
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,513
[inaudible]

98
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:05,550
and the result was a series of pieces
that I composed between 1974 and 79 called

99
00:07:08,441 --> 00:07:09,640
simply songbird songs.

100
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,273
Woo

101
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,593
[inaudible].

102
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,980
What was the translation process between
hearing this bird song that you just

103
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:45,021
couldn't get enough of and constructing
a narrative in working with the bird

104
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:49,530
songs? I just tried to take dictation.

105
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,650
I try to listen carefully to the birds
where they are as they're singing and

106
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,110
write down what I hear.

107
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,420
I'm not interested in
accuracy because if I were,

108
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:05,880
I just make recording
and play the recording

109
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,570
[inaudible]

110
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,500
I'm interested in what gets lost
in translation because after all,

111
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,240
this is music. This is perhaps a
language that we will never understand.

112
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,223
[inaudible]

113
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,110
also, there weren't very many field
recordings available in those days,

114
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,130
but there were some and I decided,
no, I'm not going to use though.

115
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:45,340
I really wanted to hear them
and to learn them for myself.

116
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,420
Now it's actually very different
from the way I work much of the time.

117
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:54,400
Rather than working with very specific
details of the music and then building a

118
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:55,234
piece up,

119
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,290
I usually sculpt away the whole field of
sound and I'll work with one big shape

120
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,770
or image or color or atmosphere then
that I have in mind that I can't quite

121
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,020
hear, but I want to hear and
try to hear that sense that,

122
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,420
write that down as clearly as I can.

123
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,870
And then all the moment to
moment details of the music.

124
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,300
We're listening to excerpts
from an hour from QT music,

125
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,530
from their fantastic series, meet
the composer. This one is on the, uh,

126
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,590
composer, one of my favorites,
John Luther Adams. No,

127
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:43,830
after the a songbird
piece, John is living in la

128
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,730
and he gets kind of fed
up. I hated [inaudible]

129
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,700
Los Angeles the whole
time that I was there.

130
00:09:51,701 --> 00:09:55,360
I felt lost and not in a good way.

131
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,730
It was such an interesting contrast
because it was one of the most explosive

132
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:05,680
periods of my life in terms of, of
discovery. But at the same time, uh,

133
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,730
there was this kind of inner knowing like
just felt lost in the freeways and all

134
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:13,750
that sprawl city that seemed
to just go on forever.

135
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,810
It made me long for home,

136
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:22,240
which I never felt that I had because
we moved all the time and I had grown up

137
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,020
here and there in equally
homogenous suburban surroundings.

138
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,760
So there was this deep in articulate
hunger to find a place to which I might

139
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,713
belong.

140
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,660
[inaudible]

141
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,130
the place where Adam's belonged,

142
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,210
it turns out was off the
grid in wild open spaces.

143
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,423
[inaudible]

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I went north in the summer of
1975 so I was 22 that summer.

145
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,960
And from the moment I arrived,
I knew I'd found home.

146
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,860
When you showed up in
Alaska, what did you see?

147
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,560
What did you hear that made you
feel like you knew you were home?

148
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,590
We're here to begin.

149
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,290
It all really starts in the summer of
1975 when I first canoed across admiralty

150
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,100
island, went into Glacier Bay,
hiked on the Tundra of Donnelley.

151
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,960
I eventually made my way to the
Brooks range to the Arctic. You know,

152
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:28,961
there was and still is in those places
a sense of openness and space and

153
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,180
possibility as well as danger.

154
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,780
These are big places
in which we feel very,

155
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,870
very small and we realized that we're
insignificant and the place doesn't care

156
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:51,520
if we are there or not. And uh,

157
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,620
the weather or the bear or the river can
rise up at any moment and snuff me out.

158
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,600
And you know, I find
a certain reassurance,

159
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:06,670
a certain profound comfort in that

160
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was trying to reconnect with the larger,

161
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,370
older world that we still want to have it,

162
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,640
but that we, that we forget

163
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,830
[inaudible]

164
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,830
then Alaska allowed me to feel like
I was the only person in that place.

165
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,463
[inaudible]

166
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,970
so in the summer of 1977,

167
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,440
I visited the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge and we flew over the crest of the

168
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:08,950
parks range and Allan to the coastal
plain, the Arctic coastal plain in there.

169
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,700
And the distance was the ice
Iceland. And of course the sun,

170
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:16,840
even even in mid summer, the sun
doesn't get very high on the horizon.

171
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:20,740
So there's this incredible deep, warm,

172
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,130
saturated light like the colors.

173
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,190
And the shadows and
everything just stands out.

174
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:32,191
And then you get out on the Tundra
and you lose all sense of scale.

175
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,130
I remember one evening was a buddy.

176
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,990
We are just so excited to be alive
and out in that Arctic evening.

177
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,824
Alight.

178
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:47,130
And we saw this white rock out across
the Tundra and this odd looking thing.

179
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:52,030
And I said, well, why don't we walk over
there? Why don't we hike to that rock?

180
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,620
We hiked and we high.

181
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:59,950
And of course the Tundra is not easy
to walk on, but we kept walking,

182
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:03,160
we kept walking, you know, the
rock didn't get any closer.

183
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,070
So we kept walking

184
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:13,450
and then suddenly we stopped
because the rock flew away.

185
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:19,720
Huh? The Rock was a snowy
owl sitting on the Tundra

186
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,630
and you know,

187
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,370
it could have been a 12 foot
outcropping of white stone. You just,

188
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,340
you lose yourself in that
place, in that light,

189
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,990
into that endless space. And
that's what I want in music.

190
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,600
That's so beautiful.

191

but we notice that I'm not, I'm not,
you're not running away scared. I'm,

234
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,170
that's good. I take that

the excerpts that you've been hearing
come from Q2 a wonderful series meet the

236
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:28,270
composer particular hour that they've
just produced on the composer John Luther

237
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:32,290
Adams, who after he moved to Alaska
began to make these amazingly huge,

238
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,500
sometimes serene,
sometimes violent pieces.

239
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,690
And you know what I think
about when I hear his work,

240
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,500
I remember when I first encountered looney
tunes and the way that the like them

241
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,600
them has this sort of an
inherent meaning to it.

242
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,350
It feels like falling it the music
of action. Yeah. Bumping, bumping,

243
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,940
tiptoeing. Yeah.

244
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,590
Bonking all of these things have a kind
of musical expression that feels almost

245
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:02,430
like a physical language that we came
into the world with and never had to

246
00:18:02,431 --> 00:18:05,280
learn. And when I went to music school,

247
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,610
it was so difficult in dense because
suddenly I was thrust into this world of

248
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:16,611
contemporary classical composition and
it was all about understanding the rigor

249
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:21,900
of serial 12 tone composition,

250
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:24,420
which is like you create these little
mathematical systems that guide your

251
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:27,000
choices. And I was like, I don't
know what this has to do with music.

252
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:29,670
I don't understand this. And then
you hear it and you're like, I might,

253
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,590
you can't pick up on it. I feel lost.

254
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,750
You feel like you're
literally in the forest.

255
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,100
But then I encountered composers like
John Luther Adams where it wasn't about

256
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:41,310
that at all. Something more primal.

257
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:44,910
It was about like the movement of
bodies, you know, masses of sound,

258
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:47,340
that sort of crescendo decrescendo waves.

259
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:47,731
Yeah.

260
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:52,731
I do think of the sounds of musical
forms and events as forces as natural

261
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:57,450
elements in some way.

262
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,840
And it may sound ridiculously
grandiose or laughably naive,

263
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,100
but I've always imagined that I might
be able to work in a space that's just

264
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:14,790
outside of culture. Of
course, it's patently absurd.

265
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,780
There's no way that we work outside
of, of culture and these days,

266
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,340
so many cultures. And yet
as my friend Barry Lopez,

267
00:19:23,341 --> 00:19:27,630
the Writers' says, landscape is the
culture that contains all human cultures.

268
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,700
And, uh,

269
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,660
I believe that everything we do,

270
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:36,570
everything we think,
everything we think we create,

271
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:41,670
anything we are derived from
the world that we inhabit,

272
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,370
our language, our music, our,
our minds, everything is,

273
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,430
is shaped by this incredibly complex
and wondrous world that we inhabit.

274
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,520
So ultimately this major culture or
dichotomy in a way doesn't exist,

275
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,820
but it's been a useful conceit for me to
feel that I'm after something that that

276
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,340
is not,

277
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,930
it's not part of a musical tradition.

278
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:18,660
It's not specifically cultural
that somehow more elemental

279
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:23,850
[inaudible].

280
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,290
Where does music come from?

281
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:29,280
How does a composer take an assignment
like write an 11 minute piece for string

282
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:33,510
quartet and translate those
instructions into a concept, into notes,

283
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,230
into a score for composer
John Luther Adams?

284
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,380
It seems almost like the
transformation happens in his sleep.

285
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,450
I try to resist composing
for as long as I can.

286
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,760
I really want to get
at something essential

287
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,500
before I start manipulating
notes, pushing things around.

288
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,510
I try to hold things in my mind's
ear as long as I can. It's a,

289
00:20:58,511 --> 00:21:01,720
it's maybe an inefficient way to work,

290
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:06,430
but it has worked for me. I find
that if I'm trying to remember,

291
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,690
I'm trying to hear something
that I can't quite name.

292
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,750
It focuses my attention in a certain way
and then I finally start composing when

293
00:21:16,661 --> 00:21:20,710
I can't not compose, when
I have to write it down.

294
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,250
I'm thinking about like the way that we
are discovering how memory and the brain

295
00:21:24,251 --> 00:21:28,150
works and every time you
remember something you're
actually recreating a story.

296
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,073
Yes.

297
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,890
So I really like that you have an idea
and you are continually remembering it.

298
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:37,030
So basically you're making a lot of
mental xeroxes of it over and over again

299
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:41,620
until it becomes something which is so
steeped in your brain stuff than it is.

300
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,570
It is a piece. Exactly.

301
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,380
So night after night when
I lie down to go to sleep,

302
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,440
I'm imagining this group of instruments
in this particular space and what they

303
00:21:56,261 --> 00:22:01,261
might sound like and how they might
move through the space physically and

304
00:22:01,441 --> 00:22:05,050
through the musical space of, of
the piece. And it's repetitive.

305
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:09,490
I'm doing it every night. At a certain
point I lose it and I drift off to sleep.

306
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:21,220
That nocturnal composition process is
apparently what happened with John Luther

307
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,010
Adams. Most recent, most famous piece.

308
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,080
This is a piece I literally tried to
copy during our recent apocalyptical tour

309
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:33,140
and it just won the Pulitzer
Prize. Apparently John was, uh,

310
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:36,770
spending some time near the Pacific Ocean
and he would fall asleep to the sound

311
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,410
of ocean waves and it
seeped into his dream.

312
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,280
And what emerged when he finally started
to compose was this orchestral piece

313
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:49,990
for three orchestras actually
it's called become ocean.

314
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,580
And what happens in the pieces that
over the course of about 40 minutes,

315
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,470
all three orchestras form
these massive swells of sound.

316
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,180
With these three huge crescendos,
like massive tsunamis coming crashing

317
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,733
[inaudible] [inaudible]

318
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,630
I'm talking about the title of the piece
become ocean. John Luther Adams said,

319
00:23:54,631 --> 00:23:56,730
life on this earth first
emerged from the sea.

320
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,520
As the polar ice melts
and sea levels rise,

321
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,870
we humans find ourselves facing the
prospect that once again we may quite

322
00:24:03,871 --> 00:24:05,550
literally become ocean.

323
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,183
Um,

324
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:11,540
well here he is in a conversation
with WQXR is Helga Davis.

325
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,430
This is a global warming piece

326
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,790
and I would say everything that
I do these days is in some way,

327
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,740
um, addressing the, the state of
the world and the delicate and,

328
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,260
and precarious position of we're
human animals in the world. Um,

329
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,960
and yet I will also have the other
side of my mouth insist that it has

330
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:34,520
absolutely nothing to do with,

331
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,970
with current events or
politics or activism and that
music must stand on its own

332
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,060
as music. And um,

333
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,390
like I like to believe that
we can have it both ways.

334
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:09,540
It is very, very outdoors.
Yeah. And it's, it's without,

335
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,470
it seems like it hasn't had people in
it all as just openness. Yeah. Yeah.

336
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,340
You're floating on the surface
if you're there at all, eh,

337
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:29,563
[inaudible]

338
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,500
one of the many reasons you should
go to iTunes and download Q2 meet the

339
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,630
composer hour with John Luther Adams is
that they play this unreleased track of

340
00:25:42,631 --> 00:25:46,260
his string quartet called the wind in
high places, which is just beautiful.

341
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:48,180
Go to radio lab.org.

342
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:51,930
We will link you to more information
about meet the composers.

343
00:25:51,931 --> 00:25:56,070
I highly recommend this podcast.
Thank you so much to Nadia Sirota,

Ambrose for allowing us to play some

345
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:05,190
excerpts. I'm Jad Abumrad. I remember
