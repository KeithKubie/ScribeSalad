6
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.050

Paul Versey,

7
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.920
the pride of Trenton,
New Jersey.

8
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.910
Oh,
the fucking tulip in the garden at the garden state.

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.650
Paul Versey is going to be playing the Gotham Comedy Club in New York City this

That's August 10th and August 11th.

13
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.250
Best friend in the world with the best club owners in the business.
The Mozillas,

14
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.520
the Mozillians brothers,
straight shooters.

15
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.531
My whole career,

16
00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:03.830
they always gave it to me straight right from the very beginning.
Bill,

17
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.000
you're not funny.
Find another career.
Okay.

18
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.720
Stop bugging us for spots.
Always was straight shooters.

19
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.430
<v 0>MMM.</v>

20
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.240
<v 1>You know what's funny is actually in Scarface,
they actually,</v>

21
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.910
that's the first pass at,
at first cut of that movie,
uh,

22
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.530
he actually said the [inaudible] brothers.
Hey,
fucked up.

23
00:01:26.531 --> 00:01:29.510
Fucking bacilli brothers,
right?
And then they're like,
Nah,
it's gotta sound.

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.570
It's got to sell some more Latino.

25
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.330
And as a bunch of white guys standing around and they were like,
ah,

26
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.330
DHEAS the about,
hey,
let's do it.
Fuck it.
Throw that in there.

27
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.850
Um,
speaking of things Latin that white people don't understand,
uh,

28
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:50.370
what the fuck is going on over at Taco Bell?

29
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.410
Can somebody explain to me how in such a sensitive day and age where people are

30
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:00.770
just,
you know,
having to apologize and,

31
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.410
and over any little fucking thing how they advertise on TV,

32
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.740
that they're bastardized version of Latin,
Latin,

33
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.830
probably the fuck you're supposed to say it.
Latino cuisine.

34
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.730
What is going,
what is that fucking incest you a shift that they keep,

35
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.160
but every time you think they can't get us one of their sandwiches to fuck

36
00:02:20.161 --> 00:02:24.120
another sandwich and make a new sandwich,
they somehow do it.

37
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.380
They don't fucking pay first.
They just had tacos.
They had Burritos,

38
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.430
they had case studies,

39
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.000
which I didn't even know of case it is that they even have those in Mexico.

40
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:33.834
I don't know.

41
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.250
I'm just a white guy who grew up in white schools listening to white history.

42
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.153
<v 0>Right.</v>

43
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.090
<v 1>They never took my entire time in school.
They never,</v>

44
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.620
they didn't even bring up Mexico

45
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.200
and it was the Spanish American war.
They would bring up.

46
00:02:51.201 --> 00:02:54.470
We thought it was in fucking Mexico and evidently it was in the South Pacific.

47
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.850
We didn't fucking know all they'd all I history every year started the same day.

48
00:02:58.851 --> 00:03:03.810
It started with the fucking pilgrims coming over on the May flower,

49
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.780
the Nina,
the Pinta in the center of Maria and I don't know who may flower was.

50
00:03:09.781 --> 00:03:13.050
Was that the,
the fucking Pete Best of the ships there?

51
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.050
Was that the Diana Ross?
I have no fucking idea.
All right.

52
00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:21.750
And then there was that other guy,
uh,
Jones or some shit.

53
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.470
He say he settled down there in,
uh,
Virginia,

54
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.600
<v 2>if I remember correctly.
He settled down in Virginia.
Right?</v>

55
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.700
The fuck is going on with my mix it here,
I don't know.

56
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.520
And he started banging that a native American chick,
right?

57
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.060
He got a fucking Mohawk,
got some moccasins,

58
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:43.370
started using a bow and Arrow and then they said stay,
stay,
stay.

59
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.290
Tried to say that the native Americans killed them.

60
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.470
I guess cause they didn't like him banging on one of their women.
But you know,

61
00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:53.480
I bet I actually think it might've been the white people.

62
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.720
They came over and they thought he was a sell out.
You're like,
hey dude,

63
00:03:56.721 --> 00:03:57.554
how can we don't have a

64
00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.200
<v 1>buckle on your hat?
You know,</v>

65
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.730
knocked on your gun isn't flaring out like Elmer Fudds at the end.

66
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.173
<v 0>You know,</v>

67
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.110
<v 1>why is your girlfriend got such a wonderful,
beautiful tan there?</v>

68
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.410
And then they took them out and then they blamed it on the native Americans.

69
00:04:13.411 --> 00:04:14.440
And then they said that,
you know,

70
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.670
they were standing their ground and they wiped them out.

71
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.460
And then afterwards they all moved to Florida

72
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.840
and they fucked each other.
Incestuously just like the food at Taco Bell.

73
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.250
And that's why you now to this day have this stand your ground fucking bro.

74
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:35.520
You know,
I finally saw the footage of that latest stand your ground thing.

75
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.520
I just,
I don't fucking understand how anybody can't say that.

76
00:04:38.521 --> 00:04:42.570
That's just fucking murder.
Second Degree fucking murder.

77
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.320
But I,
I,
you know,
you watch this guy will get acquitted.

78
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:51.450
Two things.
I'm always wrong on the stand.

79
00:04:51.451 --> 00:04:54.150
Your ground footage and [inaudible] the,

80
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:59.070
did he or did he not make a football move?
I never get those right.

81
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.650
I'm like,
that's a fucking touchdown there.
After further review,
you know,

82
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.180
that's murder after further reveal,

83
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.080
the white guy was,
was

84
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.730
clearly felt threatened as the black guy was walking away

85
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.820
through this latest one,
right?
This,
this,
this guy,
right?

86
00:05:23.821 --> 00:05:27.690
Black Dude with his wife or girlfriend.
I think there was a kid in the car.

87
00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.110
Not sure,
right?
They pull in,
they parked in the handicapped spot.

88
00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.400
So the white dude,
like the pussy that he is weights to,

89
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:40.050
the guy goes in the store and then starts yelling at this guy's girlfriend or

90
00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:44.790
wife.
The guy comes walking out,
the guy's yelling at his wife.

91
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.620
So he goes over and he pushes him down like a big brother sticking up for his

92
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:51.990
little sister.
He pushed him down like they were on the playground.

93
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.460
And this fucking asshole
pulls out a gun,

94
00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:01.010
like guy standing over him with an ax or something and the guy literally starts

95
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:04.130
to turn to walk away and he sees him take out the gun and he turns and looks

96
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:07.880
back at him like,
what the fuck?
And the guy shoots him in cold blood

97
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.710
Copeland.
I guarantee you he's going to get off.
He will get off

98
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.680
<v 2>fucking unreal.
It's unreal.
But that's what happens.</v>

99
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.850
That's what happens when you have a bunch of people fucking,

100
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.883
you know,

101
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.120
in the same puddle the way that they're doing with the food over there and Taco

102
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.730
Bell.
How do they get away with it?

103
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.190
<v 1>All this shit about appropriating culture and everything and they just,</v>

104
00:06:35.191 --> 00:06:37.210
they just,
I don't know.
I think they've just gone so fuck.

105
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:40.830
It's like the island of Doctor Moreau meets Mexican food.

106
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.300
It's kind of like Hanna Barbera too,
where they just,
they,

107
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.920
they only had like two or three ideas.

108
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.670
If somehow they spun it into like 40 different cartoons.
All right.

109
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.420
We got an idea for a cartoon.
You ever seen the honeymooners?
Yeah.
It's that,

110
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.770
except it's in the stone age.
It's called the Flinstones.
Oh,
we love it.

111
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.860
We love it.
You got any more ideas?
Yeah.

112
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:10.750
You know the honeymooners that we stuck in the stone age and was the Flinstones.

113
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.410
Now we'll stick it in the future.
It's called the Jetsons.
Oh yeah.

114
00:07:14.411 --> 00:07:18.560
You got any more shows?
I add.
It's a fucking,
uh,

115
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.593
is a bear.

116
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.213
<v 3>I Dunno.</v>

117
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.380
<v 1>Then this one is,
was a lion.
They're all the animals.
This one's a fucking a,</v>

118
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.430
there's always going to be one tall,
one in one short one.

119
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.990
I think the high watermark was jinxed the cat.

120
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:40.900
<v 0>All right.
Um,</v>

121
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.700
<v 1>I like chinks.
The cash.
He was,
he was really,
he was,
he was fucking cool.
Hey,
uh,</v>

122
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.870
like a,
what'd she scram Outta here?

123
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.250
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

124
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:56.550
<v 1>I'm sorry.
I literally doing a jinx.
The cat impression.
Well,
what do,</v>

125
00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.940
what do you want from me?
Huh?
What do you want from me up?

126
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:05.370
Just a white guy,
man.
All the doors swing wide open for me.
Um,

127
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:09.250
I watched an episode of Mannix the other day.
I'm loving me TV.

128
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.410
<v 0>I'm loving it.
You know,</v>

129
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.330
<v 1>it's just TV shows.
There's commercials,
there's a schedule.</v>

130
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.840
It's how I used to watch TV.
Okay.
There's,

131
00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:26.841
there's auto shape or white guys chasing down people half their age,

132
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.010
rolling over hoods of cars.
It's just like,
yeah,

133
00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.400
there's a live band that played the soundtrack.
I mean,
it's just,
it's,
I'm,

134
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.410
I'm doing,
what I shouldn't be doing right now is I'm,

135
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:45.000
I'm turning the wagon around and I'm going back to where I fucking was and I

136
00:08:45.001 --> 00:08:48.510
will quickly become irrelevant,
but I,
I can't,
I can't lay off BTBY.

137
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.970
I watched this episode of Mannix,

138
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.230
<v 2>right?
He drives a dodge dart,</v>

139
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:56.303
like the fucking

140
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.520
<v 1>gt version of some shit.
I didn't,
I never even heard of that car.</v>

141
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.600
You always had to have the cool car.
Right?
He's alone or he's not married.

142
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.340
They're always loan as though he's not married.

143
00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.060
That way they can get laid in every fucking,
every show.

144
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:15.880
It's totally this,
the show is just totally designed for unhappily married guys.

145
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.630
Right?
Like,
why did I get married?

146
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.350
I should've stayed single and fucking solve crime,

147
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:29.890
drive it around in a cool car and just fucking banging somebody different 34

148
00:09:30.581 --> 00:09:32.980
times a year.
That's basically how many episodes that did,
right.

149
00:09:32.981 --> 00:09:33.910
So I'm watching Mannix,

150
00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:37.930
and it's this episode where this is Hitman in a fucking phone booth,

151
00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.100
and he's talking about a murder he just committed.
And this woman staring at him,

152
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.210
then she starts staring at his lips and shit,
right?
And I'm like,

153
00:09:46.211 --> 00:09:48.970
what the fuck is this?
Right?
It turns out she's deaf.

154
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:51.580
What she steps are easy joke.

155
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.360
<v 3>MMM.
Okay.</v>

156
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.400
<v 1>So she knows what's up.
So they go to the cops,
the cops don't land.</v>

157
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:02.340
What's the guy look like?
What?
Get Out of here?

158
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:07.260
You Deaf Lady,
right?
They don't listen to her,
but man,
x happens to be walking by.

159
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.380
He's a private eye.
I don't know what he's doing down at the fucking,

160
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.820
at the police station.
Maybe he's down there fucking,
you know,

161
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.500
trying to get some work,
you know,
get a couple of fucking free donuts and coffee.

162
00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:22.720
I don't know why he's down there,
but he was down there.

163
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.900
He was fucking down there.
Right.

164
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:29.210
<v 3>So,
um,</v>

165
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.420
<v 1>he just wanted,
he sees them yelling at deaf chicken.
He sits like,
hey man,</v>

166
00:10:35.421 --> 00:10:39.650
you know,
uh,
that's an interesting story.
I think I can help you out with that.

167
00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:40.851
You know,

168
00:10:40.851 --> 00:10:44.240
cause she was like so surprised that she sought you so upset she couldn't really

169
00:10:44.241 --> 00:10:47.690
give them any details.
So man x,
because he's Mannix,

170
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.070
because he's a loner because he has no woman in his life that he has to answer

171
00:10:52.071 --> 00:10:52.550
to.

172
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.530
He actually has the fucking time spur of the moment to take on this fucking

173
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.740
case.
Right.

174
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.480
And what's funny is I just like,

175
00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:08.270
who the fuck was paying them the whole episode he did the,
he did it.

176
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.640
Was it pro bono?
Was that free?
Is that the right expression?

177
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.550
You know,
they were going down to report a fucking crime.
They weren't saying,
Hey,

178
00:11:17.551 --> 00:11:19.920
help solve this fucking crime.
He takes it on.

179
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:23.390
So they cut to the next scene and he's still,

180
00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.470
the deaf woman is freaking out because Maddox is yelling at her,
go,

181
00:11:28.471 --> 00:11:31.350
come on.
You got to remember,
we got to go through this again.
Right.

182
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.870
And her friend is going,
Jesus Christ,
dude,
take it easy.
He goes there,

183
00:11:34.871 --> 00:11:38.790
there's a woman's life at stake.
And the definitely,

184
00:11:38.791 --> 00:11:40.800
she's fucking holding her head and shit.

185
00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:46.250
They basically just verbally abuses her until she can fucking remember what this

186
00:11:46.251 --> 00:11:49.610
guy looks like.
And,
uh,
and it kind of goes from there.

187
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.040
<v 3>And,
uh,
I dunno,
I don't even want</v>

188
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.920
<v 1>him talking about this shit.
I'm just saying,
you got to watch me TV.</v>

189
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:02.200
It's fucking tremendous.
It's fucking Fermentis especially,
you know,

190
00:12:02.201 --> 00:12:06.220
you go on all these other shows and it's like 2018 and then you just turn the

191
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:09.970
fucking channel and it goes back to,
I,
I swear to God,

192
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.960
the way they treated women back then,
the parts that they gave him,

193
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:18.310
the way that they talk to them,
their idea,
like

194
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.600
what do the women would walk in and they were nothing but sex objects.

195
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.910
Every fucking woman right comes in and they just start playing a saxophone.

196
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.270
Trying to think what they played for the deaf woman.

197
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:37.220
You probably played like a muted trumpet or something,

198
00:12:37.221 --> 00:12:41.390
but still they played it in a sexy way.
Um,

199
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.640
I don't want to talk about,
but how about those Red Sox?

200
00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:48.660
Everybody dropping 20 runs 10 at night on a Toronto Blue Jays.

201
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.790
Hey Getty.
Lee,
you're liking that Shit,
Huh?

202
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.220
I'll never forgive that guy.

203
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.580
I remember reading an interview when he was at a blue jays game and he was

204
00:12:58.581 --> 00:13:01.610
fucking make it fun of Red Sox fans.
They were up there,
you know,

205
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.380
I'll never forget that.
I was just like,
oh,
okay gay.

206
00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:07.690
That's how you want to play it.
Huh?

207
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.310
With your fucking 12 string bass guitar and your songs about space or whatever

208
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:13.720
the fuck you talking about up there.

209
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:17.683
<v 0>MMM.</v>

210
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.250
<v 1>Honestly I have legit</v>

211
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:25.410
like a sports disliked.
Not,
not,
not,
not an honest dislike,

212
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:31.300
you know,
but if I ever met the guy,
I would definitely bring it up.
Um,

213
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.580
because I am a,
I'm childless anyways.

214
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.940
Red Sox keep winning.
Yankee suggest one to,
you know,

215
00:13:38.941 --> 00:13:41.040
all the Yankee fans had their fucking head in the oven.

216
00:13:41.041 --> 00:13:44.070
Then all of a sudden what happens to get a new picture?
He goes up,

217
00:13:44.071 --> 00:13:47.250
he strikes fucking everybody out and then the next night she,
the guy you,

218
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.530
you bought from the fucking Marlin's.
Yeah.

219
00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.510
Goes opposite field for a grand slam.

220
00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.800
I was checking out our fucking schedule,
man.
I can't wait.

221
00:13:59.801 --> 00:14:01.990
I cannot wait for that fucking astro series.

222
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.860
I can't believe how excited I am about baseball.
I don't know what happened.
I,

223
00:14:05.861 --> 00:14:09.790
I given up on the,
I know what happened.
All the fucking steroids I gave up on.

224
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:13.690
I was just like,
look,
either legalize them or get them out of the gate.

225
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:18.900
Stop having me get excited for shit that you're going to then tell me a fucking

226
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:20.890
five years later that it didn't really count.

227
00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.620
<v 0>You know,
um,</v>

228
00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:29.740
<v 1>anyone's excited state Indian series.
Oh,
I can't wait.
I can't wait.</v>

229
00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:35.070
And to sit here and be this far ahead of the Yankees knowing that it means

230
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:38.020
absolutely nothing because of the wild card.
It's just,

231
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:41.050
it's just such a wonderful feeling,
you know,

232
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.980
knowing that you're counting down days that mean nothing.

233
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.960
What's your magic number?
Uh,

234
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:55.160
17 more games plus four games in the playoffs.

235
00:14:57.890 --> 00:15:00.950
They ruin it.
Fucking greedy cuts ruined it.

236
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:03.013
<v 0>MMM.</v>

237
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.390
<v 1>You know,
back in the day,
I've told you this before,
back in the day,</v>

238
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:13.270
if you had the best record in the American league that was winning the pennant,

239
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.810
there was no playoffs to win the pennant.
It was the regular season.

240
00:15:19.090 --> 00:15:21.820
And then you immediately went to the world series.

241
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:26.550
So what you had to do was you had had the best record and they,

242
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.550
and all they had was like,
there wasn't division,
so it was just a,
you know,

243
00:15:30.551 --> 00:15:35.050
like eight teams in this division,
eight teams in that division of what and that,

244
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.790
uh,
sorry,
not division.
Um,
in that league,
like eight teams in the American League,

245
00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:43.660
eight teams in the National League and whoever the top guys were at the end of

246
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.180
the season,
you,
you won the pennant,
you went to the world series.

247
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:48.910
So that's why like,

248
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:53.020
no one's ever gonna win the way the Yankees won way back then.
First of all,

249
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:54.970
there's no way you're gonna,
you're gonna fucking,

250
00:15:55.930 --> 00:15:58.300
someone's going to be dumb enough to sell your babe Ruth then.

251
00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.910
Then you're going to draft Lou Gehrig,
Mickey Mantle,

252
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.010
a Joe Dimaggio right in a fucking row.
Um,

253
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.840
and then you go to the playoffs.

254
00:16:07.841 --> 00:16:10.630
You only have to wait for games and you got the fucking title.

255
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.620
You know what I mean?
But,
eh,
but I'm not just shitting on the Yankees.

256
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:18.460
Cause I know like,
uh,
back in the day,
um,
in hockey,

257
00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.570
all you had to do is you had to win eight,
get yet went to playoff series.

258
00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:24.040
Now you have to win twice as many.

259
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.530
I'm sure when the Celtics were winning all of theirs,

260
00:16:26.531 --> 00:16:31.531
I can't imagine you had to play any more than one or two rounds of 'em.

261
00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:38.170
Oh,
I'll play offs.
Right.
Play offs.
That's actually interesting.
Let me see.
Night

262
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:44.760
team 50 ml be steady.

263
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:51.340
The standings,
this stair dings.
All right,

264
00:16:51.341 --> 00:16:54.700
so here it was.
All right.

265
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.170
1950 there was one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight.

266
00:16:59.171 --> 00:17:03.340
Just like a guest.
All right.
The Yankees,

267
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:07.150
of course one that won the pennant,
one had the best record,

268
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.480
won the pennant tigers for three games back.

269
00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.400
Red Sox were for the Indians were six and that's the top four.

270
00:17:15.401 --> 00:17:18.280
And then the bottom for this works out mathematically cause you didn't have

271
00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:19.240
inner league play.

272
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.380
The twins were 31 games out the white sox for 38.

273
00:17:23.381 --> 00:17:24.850
The Orioles were 40.

274
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.350
And the probably Philadelphia athletics at that time.

275
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:32.020
<v 0>We're,
uh,</v>

276
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:37.120
<v 1>46 games up.
If not,
maybe they were in Kansas City at that point,
and then,</v>

277
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.270
and the national league,
the Phillies were in first place,

278
00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:47.200
then the Dodgers than the giants.
Then the Braves,
cardinals,
the reds,

279
00:17:47.201 --> 00:17:49.770
the cubs and the pirates.
That's it.

280
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:53.570
So then the Phillies and the Yankees played for the world series and we all know

281
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.950
fucking one that right.
All right,

282
00:17:55.951 --> 00:18:00.951
let's go 1962

283
00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.440
<v 4>and be a stair day.</v>

284
00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.340
The NBA standings.

285
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:14.910
<v 1>All right.
What do we got here?
Yeah,
there was,</v>

286
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:22.350
there was,
there was,
they call them divisions.
There was western divisions.

287
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.970
There was nineteens.
So the Lakers,

288
00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.260
well they Minneapolis then I think.
No,
they,
they moved to la by that.

289
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:37.580
Then there was the kings who I believe back then where the

290
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.840
Rochester royals

291
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.590
that became the Cincinnati royals

292
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.790
and then they became the Sacramento Kings,
I think.

293
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.000
What are the royals become?
The San Diego Clippers that became the La Clippers.

294
00:18:57.001 --> 00:19:01.110
I always forget that.
Anyways,
Detroit Pistons,
Atlanta hop St Louis Hawks.
Sorry.

295
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.680
They might've been in Atlanta at that point.
And then the Washington Wizards,

296
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:07.920
which will do look bullets.
That's weird.
They run that long.
I had no idea.

297
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.490
And then in the eastern division,
it was the Celtics,

298
00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:13.440
<v 0>uh,</v>

299
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.120
<v 1>the San Francisco Warriors,</v>

300
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:20.070
the 70 sixers in the next 31 games out.
Um,

301
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.970
yeah.
So that's it.
So you just,
yeah,
I guess you just won and then you played for,

302
00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.260
for games to see who was the champion?
Steph,

303
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.290
that's something that people don't fucking bring up a lot.
They always go,
oh,

304
00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.240
it was a bunch of fucking white guys on the YMC a fair enough.
Fair enough.

305
00:19:35.241 --> 00:19:39.470
But also you didn't have to win 20 rounds of the fucking playoffs.

306
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.860
And the only reason why they have all these rounds now is,
uh,

307
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:46.520
well mostly for money.
But you know,
in all fairness,

308
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.250
when there's only nine fucking teams,
I mean,

309
00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:52.370
do you really need to also make the playoffs if he came in second?

310
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:55.783
<v 0>MMM.</v>

311
00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.120
<v 1>I know they just kind of made a lot of the regular season null and void in a lot</v>

312
00:20:00.121 --> 00:20:04.410
of these sports.
Why am I not getting any fucking volume here?
I just seen it.

313
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.950
I hope this isn't too quiet again.
You know,

314
00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:10.560
I think I'm going to have to break down and actually get a goddamn producer on

315
00:20:10.561 --> 00:20:12.630
this fucking thing,
you know?

316
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.240
And then what do I do then when I do and I get somebody else I've got to fucking

317
00:20:15.241 --> 00:20:20.010
talk to.
That's not what I want to do.
Um,
all right,

318
00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.740
let's,
let's back up here.
All right,
let's read a little advertising hymns.

319
00:20:23.741 --> 00:20:25.690
Everybody.
Here's a problem.

320
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.520
66% of men lose their hair by age 35.
Hey man,

321
00:20:30.521 --> 00:20:31.810
that's offensive

322
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.460
thing is when you start to notice hair loss,
it's too late.

323
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.120
Uh,
well shit,
where the fuck was that when I needed it?
Easy.

324
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.820
It's easier to keep the hair you have than to replace the hair you've lost.

325
00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.770
Is that hairline slowly starting to move backwards,
backwards.

326
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:52.180
Any bald spots yet?

327
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.200
How will you feel a year from now if it's business as usual up there?

328
00:20:56.530 --> 00:21:01.530
Why do you guys turn to weird solutions or do nothing when they can turn to

329
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:06.210
medicine and science?
You know,
I'm real.
What do you,

330
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.960
what do you mean weird solutions?
Like what?

331
00:21:07.961 --> 00:21:12.340
Just fucking aging naturally shaving your head and all of a sudden everybody

332
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:16.840
thinks you know Jujitsu or possibly you have a fatal disease,
right?
Either way,

333
00:21:16.870 --> 00:21:18.730
you know people are clearing a path.

334
00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.770
What hymns does is connect you with real doctors and medical grade solutions to

335
00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:24.640
treat hair loss,

336
00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.630
well known generic equivalents to name brand prescriptions that help you keep

337
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:32.680
your hair.
No snake oil pills or gas station,
counter supplements.

338
00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.420
Prescription solutions backed by science.
No waiting room,

339
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:38.950
no awkward doctor visits.

340
00:21:38.951 --> 00:21:43.420
Save hours by going to four hymns for h I m s for him.

341
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.350
Is that.com answer a few quick questions.
Dr.

342
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:52.380
Review and prescribe you products or shipping or shipped directly to your

343
00:21:52.631 --> 00:21:53.230
doctor.

344
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:55.960
I always feel like those guys when they ask questions about hair loss is the

345
00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:58.540
first thing asks how much hair is on your back

346
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.710
so they can guess how quickly you're going to lose your hair.

347
00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.440
Cause those hairy motherfuckers,
they lose it.

348
00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:09.820
Like you know those kids who can grow a beard and like fucking junior high the

349
00:22:09.821 --> 00:22:11.770
second puberty's ended all of a sudden.
Yeah.

350
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:16.370
<v 2>You know,
they start looking like,
like,
I dunno.
I Dunno.</v>

351
00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:20.160
Pick somebody.
Pick somebody that Bill Murray or something.

352
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.911
<v 1>All right,
order.</v>

353
00:22:21.911 --> 00:22:26.911
Now my listeners get a trial month of him of hymns for just $5 today.

354
00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:30.970
Right now while supplies last.
See websites for full details.

355
00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:35.380
This would cost hundreds if you went to the doctor rather pharmacy,

356
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:36.483
go to him.

357
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:41.660
[inaudible] dot com slash bird that's for h I m

358
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:44.523
s.com/burr for him,

359
00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.030
[inaudible] dot com slash [inaudible] for [inaudible] dot com slash [inaudible]

360
00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.570
all right.
What's your box?
Hey,

361
00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:54.970
I fucked up when I say that you get free bacon for life.

362
00:22:54.971 --> 00:22:58.270
You get free bacon the first time.
That was that.
That was a tight vote.

363
00:22:58.271 --> 00:23:00.850
That wasn't my fault.
Somebody fucked that up.
All right.

364
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.910
What's your box delivers healthy 100% grass fed and grass finished beef free

365
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:09.520
range,
organic chicken and heritage bread.
Pork.

366
00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.220
The greatest pork chop I've ever had.

367
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.390
The incredible quality of butcher box meets starts with the commitment to

368
00:23:16.391 --> 00:23:20.320
raising animals humanely and free of antibiotics and hormones.

369
00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:25.560
Each box comes with at least nine to 11 pounds of meat with which is enough for

370
00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:29.590
24 individual sizes unless you're a fat bastard.

371
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.210
Then you got three meals you can choose from five different box types.
All beef,

372
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.570
beef and chicken,
beef and pork mixed box.

373
00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.830
Custom box lets you choose your own cuts.
All right,

374
00:23:41.831 --> 00:23:44.800
so the conservative guy is going to get all beef right?

375
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.900
The liberal out here in Hollywood's going to get a mixed box,

376
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:50.870
anti biotic slash hormone free books.

377
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:56.110
Your box believes in hell I healthier food system where everyone has access to

378
00:23:57.471 --> 00:23:59.240
meets the way nature intended,

379
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.800
free of antibiotics and hormones and humanely raised on an open pasture before

380
00:24:03.801 --> 00:24:04.634
they kill them.

Postmates when you want food but don't want to get up your ass.

There's Postmates,

everything that you need to get ready in the bathroom.

428
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.490
Any particular product that yeah,

429
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:18.480
have fallen in love with outside of the razor and why?
I guess that's for me,

430
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:23.040
right?
I'm allegedly getting the one wipe Charlie's dollar shave club.
Yes.

431
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:27.270
That's dollar shave club delivers everything.
Yeah.
Need to look,

432
00:27:27.271 --> 00:27:31.710
feel and smell your best.
You name,
Oh yeah.
Name Shampoo,

433
00:27:31.711 --> 00:27:36.240
conditioner,
body wash,
toothpaste,
Hair Gel.
Even a wipe that Alivia Tush.

434
00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:41.220
Elon typically clean there.
Evidently according to the copy,

435
00:27:41.221 --> 00:27:45.390
I am a big fan of their amber and lavender calming body cleanser.

436
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.850
I want to use that.
Put a red on my fucking head.

437
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.950
Never smelled anything like it for just five bucks young can get their daily

438
00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:57.870
essential status set.

439
00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:03.090
It comes with the body cleanser one way.
Cherry,

440
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.770
they're amazing,
but whites,

441
00:28:04.771 --> 00:28:08.730
they're world famous shave butter and their best razor.

442
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:13.590
The six blade executive.
Sure.
You're wondering why.

443
00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:15.900
I'll ask you to be here today.

444
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.420
Keep the blades coming for a couple of bucks more a month and add in shampoo,

445
00:28:21.421 --> 00:28:24.120
toothpaste,
or anything else you need for the bathroom.

446
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:29.010
Check it all out@dollarshaveclub.com slash [inaudible] that's dollar shave

447

All right.
Did I talk about everything I wanted to talk about?

448
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.230
Um,
I think that's it.
Football season,
starting up.

449
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.400
<v 2>Oh,
you know what I've got,
I always in the morning,
my job is,
I get,</v>

450
00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.990
I get my daughter out of bed,
right?

451
00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.610
You've got a whole little ritual I carry over.
I let her turn on the light,

452
00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.780
you know,
but it turn off the light when we leave the room and all of that stuff.

453
00:28:58.781 --> 00:29:02.920
And then whenever I bring up,
my wife always stays in bed.
You know what I mean?

454
00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:08.830
I'm,
I'm really learning.
I'm learning how to,
how to get along.

455
00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.430
I'm telling you it's,
it's actually,

456
00:29:12.431 --> 00:29:16.330
it's not that hard to get along with your class.

457
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.800
This is what you gotta do all right in the morning.

458
00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.470
It just snuggle up behind him.

459
00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.460
I know this is Sally's going to be weird and all you do just caress him a little

460
00:29:33.461 --> 00:29:37.930
bit.
Five minutes.
You do that five fucking minutes,

461
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.980
right?
The second you start doing it,
they go,
oh,

462
00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:46.420
<v 1>and you just fucking do that.
Keeps him in a good mood.</v>

463
00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.990
All right?
But you,
you know,
stocks that that'll get,

464
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:55.060
that'll give you peace until about 11:00 AM plus if you get up and you make the

465
00:29:55.061 --> 00:29:58.450
breakfast in your feed your kid,
right?
You sitting there like fucking,

466
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.060
I always feel like Joe Pesci in casino.
You know,

467
00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.900
cause I'm sitting here being a sweetheart,
I'm totally calm,
relaxed,

468
00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:09.970
you know,
totally enamored with my beautiful daughter,
right?
And I,

469
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.210
and I've been in my head,
I'm like,
I'm a piece of shit,
right?
So I always,

470
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:17.610
I always have like that fucking,
I'm a lunatic,
right?
So anyways,

471
00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:18.550
but here's the thing though,

472
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:23.950
and this isn't just a woman that just people in general,
they get used to ship.

473
00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.500
So you can't do it every day,

474
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:28.543
<v 0>all right?</v>

475
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:33.550
<v 1>But you got to do some version of that,
okay?
Just to,</v>

476
00:30:33.551 --> 00:30:37.060
just to fucking,
you know,
they're like rescue dog.
She just,

477
00:30:37.061 --> 00:30:39.610
you want to keep them calm.
You want to keep the ears down,

478
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.940
keep the fucking ears down.
All right.

479
00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.860
You're going to be good until about 11 in the morning.
All right.

480
00:30:47.890 --> 00:30:51.250
And I ran around 11 in the morning.
They,
they're starting to read that text.

481
00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:55.180
They got a couple of phone calls that can get crazy.
So your job is,

482
00:30:55.181 --> 00:30:59.050
you have to get out of the fucking house before that happens.

483
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.193
<v 0>Okay.</v>

484
00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:07.390
<v 1>And this is another thing that I learned.
Okay.
When they're bitching,</v>

485
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.640
just shut the fuck up and listen.

486
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:15.010
Every once in a while you have to make a noise or else then they get weirded out

487
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:19.810
religious be like,
oh,
I feel like I just like staring at me and judging big.

488
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:23.510
And then you got to keep your voice down.
Yeah.

489
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:26.440
You can't be like a fucking listen to you.
You can't do that.

490
00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:29.170
Cause then it's a fight.
You can't do that.

491
00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.710
You know you're going to want to do that because for the last 42 minutes you had

492
00:31:35.711 --> 00:31:36.430
the solution.

493
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.430
You had the logical solution to whatever the fuck they were talking about,

494
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:44.200
but you can't,
you know that that was the old man.

495
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.000
I would just break eight seconds in.
I would just be gone.

496
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:53.610
Well then don't be friends with her.
Don't be,
tell her to fuck off.
Yeah.

497
00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:56.560
Just stop hanging out with her and,
and you just can't do that.

498
00:31:56.800 --> 00:32:00.040
You just have to fucking,
you just have to sit there.

499
00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:05.750
You know what Song I,
you know,
when the,

500
00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:08.200
when they're in one of those things where they're just going to go for 40

501
00:32:08.201 --> 00:32:09.040
fucking minutes

502
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.310
is I just think of that white stripes song,

503
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:16.103
<v 0>uh,</v>

504
00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.850
<v 1>flat
Paradis Udall,</v>

505
00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.970
and I just had that fucking playing in a loop in my head.

506
00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:27.650
Not even the part where he sings.
It's just the guitar.
Well,
Jane

507
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.290
[inaudible],
it's like haunting and calming all at the same fucking time.

508
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.620
And every once in a while I just go like,
wow,
that's,

509
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:43.860
that's terrible.
Then what happened?
And you just,

510
00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:46.440
you just fucking stay in the pocket.
You can do that.
I'm telling you,

511
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:47.820
you're going to immediately,

512
00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:52.950
40% of your fights are gonna go out the fucking window.
Now that other 60%,

513
00:32:52.951 --> 00:32:54.570
I don't know how much I can whittle that down,

514
00:32:54.571 --> 00:32:58.320
but I am telling you guys right now,
I am 40% happier just doing that.

515
00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:01.650
Yeah,
rescue dogs.
Remember that?

516
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:05.160
You know you have no idea what the fuck happened to him before you got it.

517
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.440
Okay.
So you've got to figure out what the fuck makes them tick.

518
00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:13.470
Okay.
Cause if you don't,
they're going to be,
they're going to be on your neck.

519
00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:22.980
Thank you guys so much for listening and as I want to especially thank anybody

520
00:33:22.981 --> 00:33:27.270

00:33:34.131 --> 00:33:38.660

525
00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:44.580

The guy who didn't need it,

526
00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:48.570
he didn't take any fucking shortcuts or yarn.
Nay.

I think the giants have their first preseason game tonight.

531
00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:07.470
I also heard that football's back at the boys a back gate down.
Yeah.
Yeah.

532
00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:07.890
All right.

536
00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:21.900
years ago or maybe a couple of weeks ago.
I don't know.
I don't know how it works.

540
00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:48.750
they were all in love with Diane.
They were doing it in Texas.
Tommy plays,

541
00:34:48.751 --> 00:34:52.260
he had like a kid out in the writing of any logs like in Dallas.

542
00:34:52.261 --> 00:34:53.660
He was dancing with the train.

543
00:34:53.690 --> 00:34:56.660
They were all slept with guy and they were drinking from a fountain.

544
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.750
That was more in like

545
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:59.930
<v 6>the last coming down from the mountains.</v>

546
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.170
<v 7>I don't

547
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:24.603
[inaudible]

548
00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:27.540
<v 5>Mike flight</v>

549
00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:32.190
<v 6>from Los Angeles into Logan Airport.
Everything's going,
everything's going fine,</v>

550
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:37.920
right?
We take off from a lax.
Yeah.

551
00:35:37.921 --> 00:35:38.970
When you look down to the left,

552
00:35:38.971 --> 00:35:42.510
you see that little fucking barrier where Marine Del Rey is where Bravo airspace

553
00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.300
is.
You know where the helicopters go?

554
00:35:45.301 --> 00:35:48.930
150 feet off the fucking surface to transition the bravo airspace.

555
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:52.050
We're fucking up and over those countries.
We Bang a left.

556
00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.610
We're climbing up.
You know,
going back over Hollywood was so high up.

557
00:35:56.611 --> 00:36:00.570
I can see over the Hollywood hills.
I can see into the valley.
You know,

558
00:36:00.571 --> 00:36:02.310
I saw that Ucla campus.

559
00:36:02.311 --> 00:36:07.311
Then you see a la Colosseum when right over the fucking Rosebowl and then right

560
00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:11.280
off into the Mojave desert flew right over Vegas.
I looked down,

561
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:14.280
I saw this stratosphere,
right?

562
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.330
Then you're in the Utah.
You go over the continental divide,

563
00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:21.510
the fucking rocky mountains,
and then we out.
We're out of the great plagues,

564
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.820
the food supply.
Everybody,

565
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.970
that's where they poison it right there from the halls are Martez.

566
00:36:29.311 --> 00:36:32.400
Oh my God.
Bless America.
Right?

567
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:34.800
Flying Right over our food supply that for some reason,

568
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:37.550
some reason we're letting these countries poison it,

569
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.553
<v 0>right?</v>

570
00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:42.820
<v 6>Some reason we're going after the terrorist over there,</v>

571
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.730
but the fucking wants in the suits.
Soviets.
Okay.

572
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:51.500
So Kay spray the big casino all over it.
Keep the bugs off it.

573
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.340
Fantastic.
Ah,
just rented under the Faucet.

574
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:58.240
You'll be fine anyways.
Hey,

575
00:36:58.241 --> 00:36:59.800
feed that cow some more cow.

576
00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:02.143
<v 0>MMM.</v>

577
00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.570
<v 6>Cut The beaks off of them.</v>

578
00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:07.530
So you fly over that shit right then.
I don't know.

579
00:37:07.531 --> 00:37:12.360
By then the sun started going down and everything was fine.
And uh,
you know,

580
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:17.470
I was working on writing some stuff and a shooting the shit with this guy and I

581
00:37:18.951 --> 00:37:21.560
was telling me he's got this room,
he has a,
he's got a garage right?

582
00:37:21.561 --> 00:37:25.040
With a room over it,
which is my dream fucking house,
man.

583
00:37:25.041 --> 00:37:28.350
I always wanted to have an old house with a detached garage with a rum over.

584
00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.450
I already told you this shit.

585
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:34.870
I turned the upstairs into a drum room slash cigar bar slash hooker lounge slash

586
00:37:36.801 --> 00:37:39.320
sports bar like every man wants,
right?

587
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.260
<v 0>MMM.</v>

588
00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.890
<v 6>So he basically had that minus the hookers,
minuses to God by minus the drums,</v>

589
00:37:45.891 --> 00:37:48.030
whatever he had.
It's his fucking you pool table and all that shit.

590
00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.020
So we're just having a great time.
Just a good guy shooting the shit with,

591
00:37:51.021 --> 00:37:54.110
he wasn't coughing,
he didn't seem like he had a bowler was a nice time.

592
00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.360
So all of a sudden we,
we started our initial offense,

593
00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.030
the to the Boston area and um,
we're out over the fucking wall,

594
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:04.783
<v 0>you know,</v>

595
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:09.420
<v 6>and all of a sudden we were just doing like this circular pattern.</v>

596
00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:15.530
I think we went north of the city up by Newbury port in Marblehead and we're

597
00:38:15.701 --> 00:38:19.710
just doing like this fucking circle and we go round and we go around again and

598
00:38:19.711 --> 00:38:23.340
I'm thinking,
uh,
this is a holding pattern there.
Seems really low.

599
00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:28.160
And uh,
the guy comes on and he's like,
dad,

600
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.660
we haven't a little mechanical issue literally and tried to get it out in a lie

601
00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.340
on the ground shortly.
But I love that we're having,

602
00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.310
we're having a mechanical problem.
Uh,
but we expect to be on the ground shortly.

603
00:38:39.311 --> 00:38:41.020
That can be taken two different ways.

604
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.210
Either we're going to fix it and I'll be able to land this fucker or it's going

605
00:38:45.211 --> 00:38:47.410
to be a catastrophic failure of something,

606
00:38:47.411 --> 00:38:51.610
at which point gravity is going to take over and land this plane for us.
Right,

607
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.570
right.
To somebody back deck there.
Um,

608
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.000
so long story short,
um,

609
00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:06.190
I wasn't even paying attention.
That's the weird part.
I wasn't nervous at all,

610
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.410
which was another weird thing.
So,
uh,

611
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.290
he comes on the fucking thing and he would go in for the landing and he said,
ah,

612
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:18.860
okay,
we're gonna begin our initial descent to a final whatever,
blah,

613
00:39:18.861 --> 00:39:21.400
blah blah at Logan airport.
Uh,
just to let you know,

614
00:39:21.401 --> 00:39:23.980
there's gotta be some emergency vehicles on the runway.

615
00:39:23.981 --> 00:39:27.000
There's nothing to be concerned about.
This is just standard procedure.
Buh,
Buh,

616
00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.270
Buh,
Buh Buh.
It's like,

617
00:39:28.271 --> 00:39:31.480
what the fuck you mean is to see that would be nervous about the brought up the

618
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:33.610
fire trucks.
I know what this is for.

619
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:37.750
This is in case we're all covered in jet fuel in eight minutes and we're on
fire.

620
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.110
At which point you can't really save any of us.

621
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:45.640
You just preventing this airplane from burning down the rest of the airport as

622
00:39:45.641 --> 00:39:50.590
we cartwheel down the fucking runway.
So anyways,
long story short,

623
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:54.550
there was a flap that was stuck.
Um,

624
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.660
somebody said it was stuck up,
but we had to land faster than normal.

625
00:39:58.661 --> 00:40:02.250
So I don't think it was able,
I don't think it was moving,
you know,

626
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:07.300
don't you go flaps down or whatever to slow the fucking thing down when you go

627
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:09.450
to land.
Isn't that what all these years of flying?

628
00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:12.330
I believe that that's what happens.
Um,
what,

629
00:40:12.331 --> 00:40:15.500
what have we had to land faster than a,

630
00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:20.610
probably what you're supposed to probably outside the envelope is the pilot say

631
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:25.060
landed.
Not,
it didn't even land that hard,
you know,

632
00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:29.320
and everybody in the back applauds.
Nobody in FirstClass applauds,
you know,

633
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:33.490
cause they don't have any Sol's,
uh,
including myself,
you know,

634
00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:38.230
and as we land and,
uh,
we pull over whatever and it was,
uh,

635
00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:39.760
it was pretty fucking awesome,

636
00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:44.260
pretty awesome feeling knowing that the guy was that good.
But he basically just

637
00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.530
prevented us all from dying.
I guess.

638
00:40:47.531 --> 00:40:50.110
They all do it every time they landed safely.
But,
uh,

639
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:51.580
to be able to kind of handle that,

640
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.280
I just can't imagine being that pilot up there.

641
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:58.040
You only like comforting feeling I would have,
which you,

642
00:40:58.041 --> 00:41:01.630
you'd have more concerned for the people in the back then you did for yourself

643
00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.680
so you can kind of stay relaxed and just be thinking,

644
00:41:05.681 --> 00:41:09.610
I have to keep my wits so I don't kill these other people.
But other than that,

645
00:41:09.611 --> 00:41:13.720
what if,
what a responsibility can you imagine that if I fuck this up,

646
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:19.600
I'm going to kill 350 people,
you know?
And then even worse,

647
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.240
whenever you know,
a plane goes down,
they examine it.

648
00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:26.980
And if it comes down to being like,
even though that was a mechanical situation,

649
00:41:26.981 --> 00:41:29.590
you know,
at some point they tried,
they put it on the pilot,

650
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:34.090
insurance companies see,
you know what it was Chucky's fought da fuck,

651
00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.960
he wore the wrong kind of shoes and I use pushing too far.
Right,
right,
right.

652
00:41:38.961 --> 00:41:41.930
They'd figure out something that somehow to blame it on the pilot,
you know,

653
00:41:41.931 --> 00:41:46.490
so they can kind of keep the lawsuits.
Yeah.
At a minimum.
I don't know.

654
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.480
I W I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
So whatever,
um,

655
00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.590
this guy landed us there safely.
Thank fucking Christ.
And,
uh,

656
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:59.120
so I've been back here in my hometown for the last,
uh,

657
00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.380
since Friday and I've been,
I've been pretty good.
I have not,

658
00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.000
uh,
I have not hit one of my old,
uh,

659
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:11.810
eating haunts cause I put on a little bit of fucking weight there I was,

660
00:42:11.811 --> 00:42:16.550
I was sitting in the Writers' room writingF is for family or are pitching jokes

661
00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.280
as the writers write it.
And um,
you know,

662
00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.620
you know the deal.
I get like five,

663
00:42:23.621 --> 00:42:27.160
10 outside the fucking zone and I f I stand in the mirror and I felt shamed

664
00:42:27.161 --> 00:42:30.760
myself.
I give myself a little fucking halftime speech,
you know,

665
00:42:30.761 --> 00:42:32.260
what the fuck was that today?

666
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:35.480
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

667
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:40.360
<v 6>It out.
And then I,
I can I get myself back on the stick?</v>

668
00:42:40.361 --> 00:42:44.050
So,
uh,
I'm telling you all this shit that I say,

669
00:42:44.051 --> 00:42:47.290
despite the fact that I don't know why I didn't know anything about nutrition or

670
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:50.020
I know very little.
I'm telling you my tricks fucking work.

671
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:53.200
When you just can't stop yourself.
And you know you've got,

672
00:42:53.201 --> 00:42:56.740
you want to eat a large pizza and you fucking know it and you know you
shouldn't,

673
00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:01.820
you're actually stepping outside the craving,
you know,

674
00:43:01.821 --> 00:43:04.190
to be like,
dude,
what the fuck are you doing?

675
00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:08.900
Do not shove that fucking wheel his shit down your throat.

676
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:14.620
Walk away.
All right,
drop the fork and walk away.
Right?
You know it,

677
00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:19.240
you know what you're supposed to do.
But you kicked that,
that craving,
that sugar,

678
00:43:19.241 --> 00:43:21.850
salt,
fucking craving it just having you.

679
00:43:21.851 --> 00:43:24.310
It's like you're not even controlling your body.
You walk over there,

680
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:29.520
that's when you just have to fucking override it with common sense in order of

681
00:43:30.261 --> 00:43:34.190
fucking salad as quickly as possible.

682
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:37.640
Shove that down your fucking throat and immediately,

683
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:41.660
not immediately take about five minutes,
you levels,
whatever that is,

684
00:43:41.661 --> 00:43:46.661
that craving levels off cause you full fills you up and then you look at that

685
00:43:48.171 --> 00:43:50.870
page and you go,
what the fuck was I thinking?
Why the hell would I ever do that?

686
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.490
So I did that to myself.
I made a game plan before we even left.

687
00:43:56.690 --> 00:43:59.330
Um,
I went to the airport and they had one place you could actually get a salad

688
00:43:59.331 --> 00:44:02.990
right on.
I fucking shove that down my throat before I got on the plane.

689
00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:07.390
And then I got on the plane and then I was fine and I had a banana for the

690
00:44:07.391 --> 00:44:09.370
flight,
shove that down my throat.

691
00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:12.190
I kept pounding the waters to keep the stomach full.

692
00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.500
And at one point I had to give in.
I bought,
I got a fucking whiskey and uh,

693
00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.020
and then that was it.
I was like,
all right,
did a great fucking job.

694
00:44:20.021 --> 00:44:22.950
And then all of a sudden the plane broke and I was like,
God,
fuck,

695
00:44:22.951 --> 00:44:23.880
I should've got the Sunday.

696
00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:31.620
But is it too late to order some fog?
Uh,

697
00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:34.440
keep the drinks come in their suite at,
um,

698
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:39.560
<v 7>have we ended up fucking landing safely and uh,
I'm back on the stick.</v>

699

<v 5>Diane fiery auto crashes.</v>

700
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.730
Some will die and hopper three while sift things through my ashes self will fall

701
00:44:48.731 --> 00:44:51.490
in love of life and drinking from a fountain that is boring.

702
00:44:51.491 --> 00:44:53.710
Like an avalanche coming down the mountain.

703

<v 7>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

It's bill burr and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

August 9th,
2010.
How the hell are you?

707
00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:41.530
Are you doing good?
Are you feeling okay?

708
00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.013
Um,

709
00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.360
I actually tried to do this podcast last night and I was just too fucking beat

710
00:45:47.361 --> 00:45:49.220
from doing the road,
but uh,
believe it or not,

711
00:45:49.221 --> 00:45:52.950
I had one of my best road gigs of all time.

712
00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:58.320
I worked the comedy store down in La Jolla,
California,
La Jolla,

713
00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.830
La j o l l a I think.

714
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:06.330
I Dunno for all you fucking Caucasians out there.
Hey,

715
00:46:06.331 --> 00:46:08.310
I'll come at eight fucking Lajolla.

716
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:11.650
Lajolla okay.

717
00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:15.560
No one of the got such difficult time assimilating and you know how to fucking

718
00:46:15.561 --> 00:46:16.394
spell

719
00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:23.440
La Jolla is la fuck and h ow fucking want.

720
00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:28.240
Hey Buddy.
Um,
La Jolla,

721
00:46:28.241 --> 00:46:28.931
California.

722
00:46:28.931 --> 00:46:33.370
And I performed down at the comedy store and I had a tremendous time.

723
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:37.510
I stayed down at a hotel right down on Pacific beach,

724
00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:40.840
underrated Pacific beach.
I had a great time.

725
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:44.110
Evidently I heard late at night though.
The kids can get a little bit rowdy,

726
00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.140
but that's what kids do.
They don't know how to get pussy.
They don't,

727
00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:54.250
they're young.
So what do they do?
Walk around with their chest puffed out.

728
00:46:55.130 --> 00:46:58.000
They can,
that's going to make some broad come over and touch it.

729
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.690
And then when she doesn't,
you start drinking more,
right?

730
00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:07.150
And then you see somebody who is getting,
and then what do you do?
A,

731
00:47:07.151 --> 00:47:11.890
you take off your buttoned down.
He got your stupid fucking tank top on.
Oh,

732
00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:16.150
little bit of the folk of muscles over [inaudible] and then next thing you know

733
00:47:16.151 --> 00:47:19.360
there's a fight.
Is that how it goes down,
Bill?
I have no idea.

734
00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:22.690
Tell went down in the fucking eighties,
you know,

735
00:47:22.691 --> 00:47:24.700
everybody had their feathered mullets,

736
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:28.510
you know they have Bobby Brown steel toed dance shoes.

737
00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.800
You know,
back when Bobby Brown was fucking Bobbi Brown,

738
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:41.380
Mark Walberg had just started lifting weights,
talk in the 80s,

739
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:46.620
talking the fucking eighties.
Um,
yeah,
I had an unbelievable time this weekend,

740
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:48.790
this week after two weeks of alcohol abuse.

741
00:47:48.791 --> 00:47:53.791
I'm actually sitting here drinking a smoothie like a fag and I'm loving every

742
00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:58.240
second of it.
I'll tell you,
it's two days down on the beach.

743
00:47:58.270 --> 00:48:01.330
I'm just like,
I get it.
I totally get it.

744
00:48:01.331 --> 00:48:05.800
This whole east coast angry,
you know,
spend your life,

745
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.450
you know,
your teeth.
Grit,
holding her fucking shovel,

746
00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.320
waiting for the next nor'easter.
It's just not the way to live

747
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.980
was fucking people down there in La Jolla.

748
00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:22.300
Lajolla whenever the fuck you want to call it,
they,
they have life down.

749
00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:27.040
Everybody inside down there was in great shape.
You know,

750
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:30.220
people riding bikes,
people still rollerblading,

751
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:36.190
jogging,
doing yoga.
Sun was shining.

752
00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:41.710
So I went out and got a smoothie.
He said,
fuck it.
You know,
when in Rome,

753
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:46.960
but on some yoga,
stretchy pants and some flip flops.
And I didn't do that.

754
00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:50.290
I didn't take it that far.
But uh,
yeah,

755
00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:56.040
I was talking to a buddy of mine down there and he was explaining to me why,
uh,

756
00:48:57.100 --> 00:49:01.480
why sound like a fucking,
well,
why should you worry?

757
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:06.400
What's wrong with that?
Um,
he was telling me why.
Uh,

758
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:11.170
starting off with juice was a good thing.
Kind of equated it to do an engine.

759
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:13.120
You know,
you go out,

760
00:49:13.121 --> 00:49:16.180
you let your car fucking warm up first before you drive a hundred miles an hour

761
00:49:16.181 --> 00:49:17.140
down the street.
Don't you.

762
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.720
So rather than take it one of those fucking Goddamn breakfast sandwiches,

763
00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:24.940
that'll be the death yet,
you know,

764
00:49:25.330 --> 00:49:29.140
having some Nag and broaden your life and you compound that,
compile it,

765
00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.830
something with the sea.
That means in addition,
um,

766
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:38.440
you have a breakfast sandwich with the bacon or the sausage,

767
00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:42.880
which form of dead pig do you want on this fucking thing,
you know,

768
00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:45.760
that'll kill you.
So less like three,
four days.

769
00:49:45.761 --> 00:49:49.360
I've been drinking the smoothie to start off the damn day and I'm feeling great.

770
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:53.170
And I know right now all you guys are going to fucking go onto the EMM podcast

771
00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:57.580
and continue your fucking threads about what a pussy on becoming.

772
00:49:57.581 --> 00:50:01.810
And I gotta be honest with you,
I don't give a shit,
you know,

773
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:05.830
I'm like that fucking astronaut who just thinks spaces beauty,
beautiful.

774
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.990
And I just let go of the ship and everybody else is sitting there and horror,

775
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:16.240
you know,
is I just sort of float away with that stupid smile on my face.

776
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:19.990
At least he floated away doing what he loved.

777
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.950
Yeah.
That's where I'm gone.
I've got a lot of shit last week on my alleged fan.

778
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:32.240
You know,
only I would get trashed on my,
my,
my alleged fan page,

779
00:50:32.241 --> 00:50:35.720
the [inaudible] podcast.com if you haven't visited there,
uh,

780
00:50:35.790 --> 00:50:38.930
you're missing out because that's where all the cool kids are,
you know,

781
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:44.000
with the jeans rolled up,
listen to at the hop.
Um,

782
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:45.391
no,
I,

783
00:50:45.391 --> 00:50:48.860
I recommend youtube videos and all that shit when rather than having to go on

784
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:51.350
and search them yourself,
you can actually just,

785
00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.730
we do it for you at the m podcast.

786
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.690
It's sort of a mom and pop store with no mother or no father.

787
00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:00.380
It's a tragic story and I'm not going to get into it.
But anyways,

788
00:51:00.381 --> 00:51:05.240
I got trashed on my own alleged fan page about my,

789
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.960
uh,

790
00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.280
my alcohol tolerance because last week I was hung over because the night before

791
00:51:10.281 --> 00:51:14.390
he had two whiskeys and to Miller high life and uh,

792
00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:18.140
everybody was spear basically,
you know,
doing what people,

793
00:51:18.141 --> 00:51:22.070
that's all you would do.
Or I can fucking drink a fucking case and you know,

794
00:51:22.071 --> 00:51:24.020
go unload a fucking truck soak in.
I,

795
00:51:24.021 --> 00:51:28.250
when I was in my twenties it's called being 42 people.

796
00:51:29.090 --> 00:51:33.650
Do you think I'm proud of that shit?
This is the deal.
If I have one beer,

797
00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.860
just one beer late at night,
I wake up the next day.

798
00:51:36.861 --> 00:51:41.720
If I didn't drink a tall glass of water,
I feel the effects.
All right.
I'm like,

799
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.540
it's fucking 14 year NFL vet.

800
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.120
That's what my livers like.

801
00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:52.180
My liver is like the entire late seventies Pittsburgh Steelers brains right now.

802
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:59.490
What's really fucking bed,
whatever.
Um,
if I,

803
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:04.280
I can't handle it the way I used to.
All right.
You know,

804
00:52:04.281 --> 00:52:06.530
what did evil Knievel due at the end of his fucking life?

805
00:52:06.531 --> 00:52:11.360
Was he still jumping off of shit or is he fucking lane in agony?
Slumped over.

806
00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:14.810
A fucking Ottoman.
I mean,
you ask yourself the tough questions,
people,

807
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:17.570
you're going to get the answers you need.
You need to hear,

808
00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:23.450
God dammit.
That smoothie is delicious.
So that's why.
Yes people.
So you know,

809
00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.580
but I am a man and I am competitive.

810
00:52:25.581 --> 00:52:28.850
So now I gotta tell you some fucking drinking and not even drinking stories.

811
00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000
I'm just going to rattle off some striking stats from earlier on in my career.

812
00:52:34.341 --> 00:52:37.010
And this is no steroids by the way,
people,
okay.

813
00:52:37.011 --> 00:52:41.480
This is pre steroids era in baseball.

814
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:47.810
And what a fucking joke,
by the way,
her
Goddamn a rod.
I don't care.

815
00:52:47.811 --> 00:52:52.400
I don't get this shit.
The fucking 20 minute memory sports fans have.

816
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:56.150
Why were they doing the countdown to a rod 600th home run?

817
00:52:56.151 --> 00:52:59.150
Can anybody explain that to me?
Oh,

818
00:52:59.151 --> 00:53:02.330
you mean the Gal did roids and patted his fucking stats.

819
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:04.880
A monumental achievement.

820
00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:09.620
Like Babe Ruth looked like he was in his second trimester is eating a fucking

821
00:53:09.621 --> 00:53:14.150
hot dog at the plate and he banged out.
What,
713 is that what it is?

822
00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:18.710
Dependent on RP 713 if I actually got that right,
that the level of,

823
00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.520
of patheticness to my social life.
Um,

824
00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:27.990
yeah,
I used have,
back in the day I could drink a 12 pack,
no fucking problem.

825
00:53:27.991 --> 00:53:31.440
And then I'd go on to Mcdonald's.
I get a quarter pounder with cheese,

826
00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:36.210
a cheeseburger,
you know,
large fry never liked it and nuggets.

827
00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.230
Coca,
what else would I get?
I'd have to get maybe two cheeseburgers.

828
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:45.360
I needed a lot of bread in there,
fucking squirrel me.
And then I would,
you know,

829
00:53:45.361 --> 00:53:49.830
go to bed and I would wake up literally three,
four hours later,
go to my job.

830
00:53:49.831 --> 00:53:53.850
And other than being sleepy,
I felt fine and I would go down there,

831
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:57.320
I unload trucks,
you know,
kind of felt like ship.

832
00:53:57.321 --> 00:54:00.930
And when the Roach coach showed up at 10 15 I'd go out there and maybe get a

833
00:54:00.931 --> 00:54:04.770
slice of pizza,
you know,

834
00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.760
just to kind of sop up the rest of the alcohol.
And I was good to go.

835
00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:13.710
I was good to go.
But let me tell you something,
you do that for 20 fucking years.

836
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.010
It catches up with you,
catches up with you.

837
00:54:17.011 --> 00:54:20.910
So one day you're 42 you have a couple of fucking whiskeys,
you know,

838
00:54:20.911 --> 00:54:23.640
a couple of middle highlights and you're banged up the next morning.

839
00:54:23.641 --> 00:54:26.760
And I'm not gonna apologize.
Okay?

840
00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:32.580
There's too many people in this country that are obsessed with the youth
culture.

841
00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:35.820
Now,
Jane,
when people say that,
you know,
says that old people,

842
00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:40.980
because they're not fuckable anymore and they can't emotionally come to terms

843
00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:45.750
with it.
We are a youth obsessed culture.
Tell me another,

844
00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.840
and then they always got to bring up Japan.
How they respect their elders,

845
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:53.880
you know,
really,
how much do they respect them?
Are they,

846
00:54:53.881 --> 00:54:57.720
are they walking up to them at a fucking single's bar?
You know,

847
00:54:57.721 --> 00:55:01.500
I've always been turned on by 80 year olds.
You know your wisdom.

848
00:55:01.730 --> 00:55:05.610
You're a fucking chicken neck.
Yeah,

849
00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:08.340
I got to understand.
I'm like Brett Farve.
Okay.

850
00:55:08.341 --> 00:55:10.380
Every time people think I'm going to fucking retire,

851
00:55:10.381 --> 00:55:12.150
I come back for another goddamn round.

852
00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.310
No,
maybe if I took the roids that guy's taken.

853
00:55:17.311 --> 00:55:20.850
I could actually fucking drink the way I used to.
You know,

854
00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:24.150
I'm actually in a debate,
a debate with a buddy of mine.
I think he did.

855
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:28.770
He took something for last season.
That guy was on the jets.
Okay.

856
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:33.630
He looked,
he looked like Neil O'Donnell.
Okay.

857
00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:38.850
And then all of a sudden he has air quotes off season surgery and this guy

858
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:43.080
fucking comes back.
And
when he was like 39,

859
00:55:43.110 --> 00:55:47.130
he looked like fucking George Blanda.
Then he comes back at 40,

860
00:55:47.131 --> 00:55:51.420
and all of a sudden he looks like that kid who took his helmet off and the

861
00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:55.500
Superbowl was it [inaudible] 97 I blocked it out.

862
00:55:55.501 --> 00:55:57.480
And you don't ever tell you guys I was at that super bowl.

863
00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:00.330
I was at that super bowl and Brett Farve took his helmet off and ran down the

864
00:56:00.331 --> 00:56:03.300
street like a Douche.
Huh?
That's back when,
you know,

865
00:56:03.301 --> 00:56:05.730
I think he's the reason why you're not allowed to do that anymore.

866
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:09.570
Right in the middle of the Superbowl.
He takes his fucking helmet off in,

867
00:56:09.571 --> 00:56:12.450
runs down the fucking field,
you know,

868
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:17.940
with an earpiece in his agent going,
yeah.
Now smile real big and yell Wheaties,

869
00:56:19.070 --> 00:56:23.830
you know,
to fucking sad moment in sports.

870
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:29.530
Do you guys watch any of that hall of fame game,
by the way?
Um,
what was it?

871
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:33.940
The fucking,
the cowboys versus the Goddamn Bengals.

872
00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:40.200
How awkward was it watching a tio in Ochoco Sinco when he goes,

873
00:56:40.850 --> 00:56:44.420
uh,
on Batman and then the other dudes like,
and I'm Robin.

874
00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.850
All right,
so you're his ward
mean,

875
00:56:48.851 --> 00:56:52.420
haven't they long talked about the gay relationship between Batman and Robin

876
00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:57.720
does fucking teenager who's have no relation to uh,

877
00:56:58.030 --> 00:57:01.750
Adam West,
whatever his fucking name is.
Am I really going to do that hacky bit?

878
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:04.360
I think I got to start boozing again.

879
00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:09.640
I give this podcast a half a fucking thumb down.
All right,

880
00:57:09.641 --> 00:57:13.990
let's get into this shit here.
Um,
so when he was,
I was down in uh,
sandy off.
Fuck.

881
00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:17.110
All right.
Start off,
Bill.
Regroup.
You actually have some information.

882
00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:21.370
You know what?
I got jury duty,
so I need you guys' help.
Okay.

883
00:57:21.371 --> 00:57:24.940
This is a free damn podcast and I would appreciate a little bit of fucking

884
00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:29.650
reciprocation.
How the fuck do I get out of this shit?
You know,

885
00:57:30.250 --> 00:57:33.400
I was thinking of memorizing the Mel Gibson tapes and just go

886
00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:39.970
and just when they say my name,

887
00:57:39.971 --> 00:57:44.380
I'm just gonna start reciting some of his dialogue.
William Byrd,

888
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:48.820
I'm just going to go sit in there with your pussy hanging out the back of your

889
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:53.260
dress.
Look,

890
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:57.460
we all know the line.
I all you not line I need to mutter is,

891
00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:02.020
is that the over the top racist one?
And I will never get jury duty again,

892
00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:07.360
but uh,
there's gotta be a better way.
Okay.
There has to be a better way.

893
00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:13.150
Is there a race of people out there left that you can sort of go off on where

894
00:58:13.151 --> 00:58:17.650
you can come off as racist but it doesn't hold the same weight?
You know,

895
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:24.130
I mean,
I think the Yankees and red sox of race or blacks and Jewish people,

896
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:28.270
you know,
you trash either one of them,
your career is fucked,
but then you know,

897
00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:32.560
you've got the middle of now the level ones,
you know,
like the twins,
you know,

898
00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:34.510
if you go off on Italian people,

899
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:40.540
I do it all the time.
Oh look at my phone can take top.
Oh,

900
00:58:40.541 --> 00:58:41.710
nobody gives a shit.

901
00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:47.580
Jersey shore is an entire show making fun of Italian fucking people tell you

902
00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:51.880
fucking juice heads and all this shit and half of those costs in that show,

903
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.750
they're not even Italian.
You know what I mean?

904
00:58:55.751 --> 00:58:58.690
Could you do that with blacks?
That Jewish people?
You could not.

905
00:58:59.710 --> 00:59:02.020
That's what I'm talking about.
That's why they're the upper.

906
00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:06.880
That's why the here are the tier one are the Yankees or red sox.
Alright.

907
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:09.340
If you want to destroy your career,

908
00:59:09.341 --> 00:59:13.090
say some shit about either one of those groups,
the shit is over.
All right?

909
00:59:13.091 --> 00:59:16.720
You want to dip your toe into a little bit of racism.
I'd go with the Italians,

910
00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:20.560
Irish people,
you can go off on Polish.
You know,

911
00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:23.600
cause that sort of comes into way.
Uh,

912
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:27.530
now you just sort of making fun of white people in more of a specific sort of

913
00:59:27.531 --> 00:59:29.810
way.
But uh,
you know,

914
00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:33.440
and no one really knows what the fuck bad shit happen to any of us.
Whatever.

915
00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:37.400
What a bad ever happened to with Italians.
You know,
they got gorgeous women,

916
00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:41.540
you know,
some of them a little hairy and we'll give you that.
You know,

917
00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:44.930
especially in the tramp stamp area.
Never seen that.

918
00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:48.470
Ever see a girl with little little extra hair there and you're like,
Jesus,

919
00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:53.780
your old g Geesh.
You know,
just thinking of what that Goddamn fucking,

920
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:58.160
who has going to look like.

921
01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.040
It's going to look like decided George Michael's face and about fucking 1987.

922
01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:12.050
So you look at this going off on Italian women,
I'm not even nervous,

923
01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:17.540
I'm not worried about it.
And then you move on to,

924
01:00:17.541 --> 01:00:19.300
I'll tell you know who's moved up in the rankings,

925
01:00:19.301 --> 01:00:23.510
sort of like a Texas tech that turned its program around there with some genius,

926
01:00:23.511 --> 01:00:27.020
new coach was Asians.
When I started in stand up comedy,

927
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:31.430
you could do a half hour on Asians and nobody gave a shit.

928
01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:38.590
She's fucking going off going off on agents and then somewhere along the line

929
01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:44.360
they will like a,
wait a minute,
didn't we teach you guys martial arts?

930
01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:47.540
You know when did the master,

931
01:00:47.541 --> 01:00:51.200
because I mean the student become the dose and start yelling at us.

932
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:55.440
So then they turned around and I think they've leap frog past the fuck you,

933
01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:59.840
it was a problem with fucking Italian people is if I can be so bold,

934
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.930
they should pussies are hanging now is um,

935
01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:08.810
the bad shit that you guys do.
I don't even know if it's cool,

936
01:01:08.811 --> 01:01:13.310
but it's been so fucking glamorized that,
you know,
I mean,

937
01:01:13.311 --> 01:01:17.480
look at good fellas,
at least the beginning of good fellas.

938
01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:22.970
I love that.
I hate when the second fucking,
uh,
Henry becomes a rat,

939
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:26.600
you know.
I know I've talked about that before.
You know,

940
01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:30.740
that fucking asshole actually has the balls to come out in public now and he

941
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:34.850
signed shit,
I want to go there.
And you know,

942
01:01:34.851 --> 01:01:39.851
and p I if people like equate that guy with Ray Liotta is character.

943
01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:42.620
This guy was,

944
01:01:42.621 --> 01:01:46.790
was he fucking ran everybody out at one and after he did exactly what they told

945
01:01:46.791 --> 01:01:50.240
them not to do,
he got himself into that fucking situation.
Granted,

946
01:01:50.241 --> 01:01:52.460
if the movie is exactly how it went down a real life,

947
01:01:52.461 --> 01:01:56.150
so why would you go down there and get,
get the uh,

948
01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:01.160
get the autograph as somebody who told on his friends.
I'm asking you.

949
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:04.310
So anyways,
what I'm saying is,
uh,
yeah,

950
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:11.270
is much as Italians or Ricoh or acquainted with fucking organized crime.

951
01:02:11.271 --> 01:02:15.680
I think people look at it the way you look at the beginning of,
um,

952
01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.710
of good fellas when they're all hanging out in front of the coffee shop,

953
01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:23.700
breaking balls,
they got on nice suits.
They got the cars,
they got the women,

954
01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:29.490
they're not taking any shit,
you know,
it's like fucking Walker,

955
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:32.400
Texas ranger without,
I mean it was even like Walker,

956
01:02:32.401 --> 01:02:35.760
Texas ranger was annoying because he's such a fucking do good are all the time.

957
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:41.880
It's on the right side of the law,
wears a condom.
He's annoying those guys.

958
01:02:41.881 --> 01:02:43.470
They don't give a shit.
Joe Pesci,
you know,

959
01:02:43.471 --> 01:02:47.040
sitting there having a fucking business conversation and he pushes that girl's

960
01:02:47.041 --> 01:02:49.920
head down onto his dick.
Who doesn't want to do that?

961
01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:55.200
Let's talk about racism this week.
People.
Out of all the stereotypes,

962
01:02:55.201 --> 01:02:57.060
I would have to say that Italians,

963
01:02:57.061 --> 01:02:58.920
they have some of the best stereotypes out there.

964
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:06.900
Irish,
what did we got?
Pasty phase.
Drunks,
potato,
Wheaton.

965
01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:10.650
Shitheads I'm half,
I'm mostly German and then I'm,
I'm Irish.

966
01:03:10.651 --> 01:03:15.630
So basically what do you fucking Nazi.
I got that.
And uh,

967
01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:19.710
and then everybody else is just a fucking booze bag.

968
01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:23.940
Going to church every week.
A and having like 18 kids.

969
01:03:25.990 --> 01:03:27.750
All right.
What if,
okay,

970
01:03:27.751 --> 01:03:31.920
so now we got to go all the way down to the cellar here,

971
01:03:33.270 --> 01:03:35.130
the fucking Kansas city royals.

972
01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:38.540
And I'm not equating this to who the people are.

973
01:03:38.541 --> 01:03:41.400
I'm just saying as far as a standup comedian,
like the,
the team,

974
01:03:41.401 --> 01:03:43.350
you can just fucking,
you know,

975
01:03:43.351 --> 01:03:46.650
you can just score seven runs on them and there's nothing they can fucking do.

976
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:53.040
Um,
I don't really know if that exists now the way it's so politically correct,

977
01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.600
native Americans just because of the odds of one of them actually being off the

978
01:04:00.631 --> 01:04:03.420
reservation and in the crowd is,

979
01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:09.540
hey,
you know what,
so many,
uh,
um,

980
01:04:10.440 --> 01:04:12.840
sent me an email this week and uh,

981
01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:15.720
this is just a great fucking email and it's just classic,

982
01:04:15.721 --> 01:04:18.930
just shows how full of Shit I am is,
I'm,

983
01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:23.220
I always compared like the Yankees and the red sox to what they're doing to
like,

984
01:04:23.221 --> 01:04:26.880
you know,
a Walmart or like a best buy.
Um,

985
01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:31.590
and evidently this guy sent me an email and of course I didn't do the research,

986
01:04:31.591 --> 01:04:35.670
but one of the higher ups at one of the owners of Walmart actually owns the

987
01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:36.960
Kansas city royals.

988
01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:42.920
So he was basically saying that if that guy wanted to win is bad as the Yankees

989
01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:47.840
and the Red Sox,
um,
do that actually they,

990
01:04:47.841 --> 01:04:52.290
they would say rooting for Kansas City is like rooting for Walmart or something

991
01:04:52.291 --> 01:04:56.280
like that.
And,
uh,
I think there might be simple validity in that point.

992
01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:02.830
Um,
I mean,
God knows I can't back it up because I didn't read about it.
So,
uh,

993
01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:04.890
once again,
once again,

994
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.980
I am exposed to how full of Shit I am,

995
01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:12.420
but there's a passion in my full of shitness.
All right.

996
01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:15.350
I feel like this is fucking winding down again.
Let's go to,

997
01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:20.800
let's go to the board here.
Um,
last week I discussed,
uh,

998
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:25.870
clapping in the airport for veterans when they get off the plane.
You know,

999
01:05:25.871 --> 01:05:29.860
that point they walk by and everybody's just like,
whew,
you know,
good game,

1000
01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:35.000
good gay.
Uh,
and it was one of those,
you know,

1001
01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:36.670
one of those weird things where it's like,

1002
01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:41.671
it just felt I didn't clap cause it just felt weird and it was like,

1003
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:44.350
and,
and I'm sitting there feeling guilty why I want to show this guy.

1004
01:05:44.351 --> 01:05:48.400
I appreciate the fact,
you know,
that he went over there and everything,

1005
01:05:48.401 --> 01:05:49.770
but it's like,
I don't want to watch,

1006
01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:53.710
I know clapping isn't it?

1007
01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:57.700
So we actually had a couple of veterans chimed in here,

1008
01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:04.360
um,
or people in active service.
Okay,
here's what they have to say.
All right.

1009
01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:08.920
Listening to the late,
your,
uh,
your latest
podcast.
Yes.

1010
01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:11.710
It was a little weird getting off the plane in Atlanta,

1011
01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:17.760
coming back from 13 months in Iraq and having strangers clap as I was going up

1012
01:06:19.091 --> 01:06:24.090
the escalator.
Uh,
that being said,
I couldn't keep the rye smile off my foot,

1013
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:28.810
my face,
I guess it's better than nothing.
Or the Vietnam scenario that you,

1014
01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.650
uh,
that you described.
Um,
so I wrote the guy back,

1015
01:06:32.651 --> 01:06:36.130
so I was saying clapping is okay.
And he said,
uh,

1016
01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:40.120
he goes,
yeah,
absolutely.
Again,

1017
01:06:40.121 --> 01:06:43.780
it's weird leaving that militarized environment and trying to

1018
01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:47.320
readjust to stepping foot in America.

1019
01:06:47.321 --> 01:06:50.830
So it's a little weird to have people actually happy to see you,

1020
01:06:50.831 --> 01:06:53.950
let alone clapping a random hugs and kisses.

1021
01:06:53.951 --> 01:06:58.570
Not so much unless they're from,
oh Jesus,
I'm the worst.

1022
01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:01.930
I can't read it unless they're hot and then all bets are off of course.

1023
01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:07.090
Uh,
all right.
So that's that guy's opinion.
Um,
oh.

1024
01:07:07.091 --> 01:07:10.540
Did have a guy shake my hand and thank me for this time.
I,
uh,

1025
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:14.050
time in the service guy looked like he could have been a Vietnam vet,

1026
01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:19.140
so it wasn't a patronizing 20 year old douchebag handshake or a 50 year old

1027
01:07:19.151 --> 01:07:22.060
cubicle farm,
farm secretary.

1028
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:28.140
A guy looked like he might've actually meant it and understood what the term

1029
01:07:28.571 --> 01:07:30.980
service meant.
I'm sorry,
I don't have the light on in my bedroom on.

1030
01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.840
I bring this over to the fucking window here.
Okay.
Um,

1031
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:40.300
all right.
This really was supposed to be interesting and the way I read it,

1032
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:43.060
that sounded like I was fucking reading and spelling test.

1033
01:07:45.210 --> 01:07:47.770
All right,
here's another guy.
Charming again.
Um,

1034
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.340
I served in the Marines as a radio operator.
One of the guys in the,

1035
01:07:51.341 --> 01:07:54.760
one of those guys in the war movies with the backpack radios that invariably

1036
01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:58.660
invariably die within 30 minutes of the opening credits.
Uh,

1037
01:07:58.661 --> 01:08:03.370
my unit participated in the evasion and returned to Camp Pendleton,

1038
01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.630
California via a stopover in Baltimore.
As we came into the main terminal,

1039
01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.080
we received the awkward standing ovation.
Uh,

1040
01:08:11.110 --> 01:08:13.030
if I had had one of those cyanide pills,

1041
01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:17.420
the spy pilots carry between the cheek and gum,
I might've gone for it.

1042
01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:23.750
There has to be a happy medium between spitting and being an ass.

1043
01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.950
I know you're clapping so you can tell you,

1044
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:31.250
tell your friends that you support the troops.
Just knock it off.

1045
01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:32.990
I know you really don't care.

1046
01:08:33.170 --> 01:08:37.220
We don't care that you don't care and we'll all be better off if you don't.

1047
01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:40.010
What does it say on

1048
01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:46.860
athletically clap or something like that?
Like it's the end of topcon.

1049
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:52.640
Uh,
what's more is that every guy in the world internalizes other guys,

1050
01:08:52.670 --> 01:08:56.600
military service and wants to tell you about how he almost joined.

1051
01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:00.080
But a promising job in the food industry called.

1052
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:04.670
So these clowns not only make your,
your walkthrough,
the term terminal,

1053
01:09:04.671 --> 01:09:05.750
super awkward,

1054
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.190
but then they follow you into the bar and ruin your first experience around

1055
01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:13.820
women in eight months.
See,
that's what I felt like it was.
I mean,

1056
01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:18.410
what are they supposed to do?
Smile and wave.
Thank you.

1057
01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:23.900
Thank you.
14 confirmed kills,
right air.
I made the altar all star team.

1058
01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:26.900
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
It's fucking weird.
So I don't know.

1059
01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:30.590
One guy says he doesn't mind it.
Uh,
I dunno.

1060
01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:34.430
This is how I do it.
If I'm in a bar and I see people in uniform,

1061
01:09:34.431 --> 01:09:37.460
I'll send out around a drinks.
I don't even walk up to him sent down.

1062
01:09:37.461 --> 01:09:41.040
They look all them,
you know,
I give them the,
uh,

1063
01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.520
more black people used to do when they're there.
When the,
the height of the,
the,

1064
01:09:44.521 --> 01:09:48.770
the,
the fucking a salad.
I remember that Shit.

1065
01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:51.890
Anybody else used to watch fat Albert back in the day.

1066
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:57.910
It's not like the full on 1968 Olympics or that stupid puff daddy advertisement

1067
01:09:58.190 --> 01:10:01.520
in Times Square.
It's not like that.
You know?
I love that one.

1068
01:10:01.521 --> 01:10:05.720
That puffy has in there like he's fighting the power in the fashion industry for

1069
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:09.530
is Sean John Close.
He's fighting the power.
Everybody,

1070
01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:13.190
those goddamn eight year olds who sewed together as track suits,

1071
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:16.850
they keep propelling.
They keep rebelling,
you know,

1072
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:22.010
but he stay in strong.
Oh,

1073
01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:26.780
it must be great to always get to play the victim.
God Damn.
And I'm jealous.

1074
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:29.790
I'm really fucking jealous of that.
All right,
so there you go.
I Dunno,

1075
01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:32.600
we got one for one against.
So it's a tie.

1076
01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:37.010
So I need more veterans to chime in here.
Yes.
On the clapping.
No,

1077
01:10:37.011 --> 01:10:39.890
on the clapping.
And this is the thing,
you can't just say yes in the clapping.

1078
01:10:39.891 --> 01:10:43.370
Why don't you come up with creative ways that people can thank you and I don't

1079
01:10:43.371 --> 01:10:47.000
care how filthy they are,
have fun with it for the love of God.

1080
01:10:47.001 --> 01:10:49.250
So I can actually maybe be funny on my own.

1081
01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.720
God Damn podcast and I actually have the nerve to get upset that fucking people

1082
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:58.700
were trashing me on my own fucking alleged fan page.

1083
01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:02.330
I think I need another sip,
a smoothie so I can become even less funnier.

1084
01:11:04.670 --> 01:11:09.500
This really is anti funny juice.
You know,
you have a breakfast sandwich.

1085
01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:14.280
You fucking hilarious.
You breaking balls,
you flies down.

1086
01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:19.140
You don't even know it.
People laugh and with Yann at Ya.
Um,

1087
01:11:20.010 --> 01:11:23.400
so anyways,
let's get onto some youtube videos of the week.
Um,

1088
01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:27.510
I'll wait.
Did I talk about jury duty?
I did.

1089
01:11:27.511 --> 01:11:31.410
Didn't I did I guys,

1090
01:11:31.411 --> 01:11:33.840
how the fuck do I get out of jury duty?
I don't want to do it.

1091
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.560
I've already done it.
I've done it.
Fucking,
I don't have any times I've done it.

1092
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.500
I can only remember once,
but I'm gonna say three fucking times.

1093
01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:43.380
This is one of these weird things where as an American I want to do it.

1094
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:46.210
It is my goddamn duty.
All right.

1095
01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:50.970
I would rather do community fucking service

1096
01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:54.660
then do jury duty.
Well,
I'll tell you what,
buddy.

1097
01:11:54.661 --> 01:11:57.870
You don't show up for that fucking shit.
He does.
Jack,
what you're going to get.

1098
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:04.880
Does anybody know anybody who fucking blew off jury duty and actually got

1099
01:12:04.951 --> 01:12:07.940
arrested for it?
You know,

1100
01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:13.080
I figured California's a broke state so you know,
they,
they gotta be,

1101
01:12:13.081 --> 01:12:17.850
they gotta be like stretched pretty thin right now.
You know,

1102
01:12:17.851 --> 01:12:21.870
my problem is I fucking responded to it when I was living in New York and I

1103
01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:26.790
actually sat on a juror jury as an alternate juror and this dude,

1104
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:29.100
they busted this dude trying to break in.

1105
01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:33.720
It was actually hilarious trying to pick a lock to break into a building and he

1106
01:12:33.721 --> 01:12:37.440
was trying to say that he was taking a piss and one of the best part,
you know,

1107
01:12:37.441 --> 01:12:40.680
and that's why he was turned into the doorway.
And uh,

1108
01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:44.460
one of the funniest things was when the cop was testifying saying,

1109
01:12:44.490 --> 01:12:47.040
do you think there's any way that he was actually urinating?

1110
01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.270
And the dude was working on the deadbolt locks,

1111
01:12:50.271 --> 01:12:54.030
so his hands were basically up where his chest was.
So he goes,
well,

1112
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:59.220
unless he was trying to pee in his own face with the longest dick ever.
No,

1113
01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:04.200
he wasn't trying to pee.
He said it much more,
uh,
a much more cleaner way.

1114
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:07.830
But,
uh,
I sat there as an alternate juror and I felt bad.

1115
01:13:07.831 --> 01:13:10.260
I felt bad for the fucking guy.
You know,

1116
01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:15.000
I don't have it in me to send someone to jail for doing some shit that I've
done.

1117
01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:19.560
You know,
it's just fucking ridiculous.
What?

1118
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:22.170
Cause I never got caught.
Now I can judge this guy.

1119
01:13:22.530 --> 01:13:25.830
I never tried to break into somebody's house,
but I did other things.

1120
01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:31.290
I had a couple failed attempts to steal cars.
This is this,

1121
01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:32.670
my attempts to steal cars,

1122
01:13:32.671 --> 01:13:36.750
I would check to see if the door was unlocked and if it was unlocked then I

1123
01:13:36.751 --> 01:13:39.570
would get in it.
And then I would look in the visor for keys.

1124
01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:43.920
And when that didn't happen,
I just got out because I had no skills.

1125
01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:49.350
You know,
you can go on youtube and learn how to hot wire a car and it's funny,

1126
01:13:49.351 --> 01:13:53.340
they show you how to hot wire a car all under the guise of in case you run out

1127
01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:56.160
of gas or case you lose your keys,
that's it.

1128
01:13:56.161 --> 01:14:01.161
Run out of gas at stupid in case you lose your keys and you're in the middle of

1129
01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:06.771
fucking nowhere and a you need to hot wire your car and uh,

1130
01:14:07.261 --> 01:14:10.320
you know,
you can actually fucking do it.
You know when you can drink a fucking,

1131
01:14:10.650 --> 01:14:13.690
juggle your own urine in the process,
they try to make it like that.

1132
01:14:13.691 --> 01:14:18.010
Like it's a survivalist thing and there's all these comments underneath it.
Hey,

1133
01:14:18.011 --> 01:14:22.330
thanks a lot man.
I just got that 68 Mustang I always wanted.
You know,

1134
01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:27.190
now who knows if they're joking or not,
but
I don't know.

1135
01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.210
So anyways,
how do I get out of it?
See,

1136
01:14:31.211 --> 01:14:35.050
this is why you want to have as many friends as possible.
This is,

1137
01:14:35.051 --> 01:14:39.010
this is a true belief that I have come to in my life.

1138
01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.000
You can not have enough friends who are cops.

1139
01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.580
You just can't.
All right.

1140
01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:50.230
And I don't give a fuck how much you hate authority.
You're going to loose.

1141
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:51.850
All right?
You've seen those guys.

1142
01:14:51.851 --> 01:14:56.250
Those guys can accidentally or on purposely kill you and be like,
ah,

1143
01:14:56.530 --> 01:15:00.850
you know,
I,
I had a muscle spasm.
Sorry about that.
And they walk.

1144
01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:04.990
So you want these guys on your side,

1145
01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:10.390
there's a cop lives on your block.
Bake them a cake that works.

1146
01:15:10.710 --> 01:15:15.370
Two fold.
One,
you get on his good side and two,
if you do some bad shit,

1147
01:15:15.371 --> 01:15:19.090
if he doesn't recognize you,
he's too fat to catch you.
You know?

1148
01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:20.980
And maybe when he reaches down for his gun,

1149
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:24.610
his degree is his fucking love handles,
you know,

1150
01:15:24.790 --> 01:15:28.180
are pushing the gun a little bit back around to the ass area and he can't pull

1151
01:15:28.181 --> 01:15:32.860
it out.
Is Old Service revolver?
Um,
no,
actually,
you know,

1152
01:15:33.490 --> 01:15:37.040
I know a couple of cops out here in La.
I know a couple back in uh,

1153
01:15:37.210 --> 01:15:41.590
New York and yeah,
when I have new DVDs that come out,
I fucking send them out.

1154
01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:44.680
Hey,
you go fellas.
Remember this face?

1155
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:51.820
Remember this face for what?
I'm speeding around in my fucking hybrid.

1156
01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:56.140
I really am a Douche.
Um,
anyways,
it's fucking plow ahead.

1157
01:15:57.810 --> 01:16:00.070
I'd also make friends with the veterans on your street.
You know,

1158
01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:04.180
maybe they actually smuggled back a grenade or some shit and you'll be privy to

1159
01:16:04.181 --> 01:16:08.260
see what it looks like when he fucking throws it at somebody on a 4th of July.

1160
01:16:08.261 --> 01:16:11.830
Just for the fuck of it.
Um,
anyways.
Yeah.
Okay.

1161
01:16:11.831 --> 01:16:15.010
So those are my two questions this week.
Veterans,
I want you to chime in,
okay?

1162
01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:18.510
Cause it's a tie right now.
All right?
Um,

1163
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:22.660
about how people are supposed to show appreciation.
Okay?

1164
01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.820
So one guy says he doesn't mind the clapping,

1165
01:16:24.821 --> 01:16:26.200
but both of you said it was awkward.

1166
01:16:26.201 --> 01:16:30.010
The other person said he wanted to take a fucking cyanide pill.
All right?

1167
01:16:30.011 --> 01:16:31.270
So we're all over the map here.

1168
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.720
And if you can come up with a creative way that a legal or not legal way that

1169
01:16:37.451 --> 01:16:41.120
people can thank veterans as they get off the plane,
please let me know.
And uh,

1170
01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.670
actually,
uh,
what do you think of mine?

1171
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:46.450
You send down around a drinks and then you don't go down there and have the

1172
01:16:46.451 --> 01:16:49.690
fucking awkward conversation with them.
You know,

1173
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:55.810
like,
what am I going to say to you?
I never went to war,
you know,

1174
01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.180
just start fucking doing quotes from platoon.

1175
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:03.790
All right,
let's fucking plow ahead here.
Um,

1176
01:17:03.791 --> 01:17:08.560
youtube videos of the work of the week,
of the work of the week.
Uh,

1177
01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:13.430
youtube videos.
All right,
guy searched.
This guy walks into traffic,

1178
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:16.910
gets hit.
This guy is such a fucking moron.

1179
01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:21.080
I actually thought that this was fake because I don't know how he doesn't see

1180
01:17:21.081 --> 01:17:25.310
this.
He walks into traffic doing a silly dance and I swear to God,

1181
01:17:25.311 --> 01:17:27.740
I believe he gets hit by an ice cream truck.

1182
01:17:29.330 --> 01:17:32.060
And I'll tell you right now,
if that doesn't put a smile on your face,

1183
01:17:32.061 --> 01:17:35.690
you're not American.
You're not American.
You're a fucking commie.

1184
01:17:35.691 --> 01:17:40.340
Pinko son of a bitch.
Do you know in Russia the ice cream trucks are gray?

1185
01:17:41.690 --> 01:17:42.410
Slate Gray.

1186
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:45.560
They don't even have a picture of the ice cream on the side of it and they don't

1187
01:17:45.561 --> 01:17:48.870
play a fucking happy little pedophile.
Jingle has a,

1188
01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:53.920
as they drive down the street,
they don't.
They just played the,
I am Russia.

1189
01:17:53.921 --> 01:17:54.920
I am Russia.

1190
01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.930
I'd take a comb and then I brush Ya.
That's what they do.

1191
01:17:59.931 --> 01:18:03.820
Just something fucking like that,
you know,
except they sing it.
Um,

1192
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.650
slayer goes to church.

1193
01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:11.460
I think I might have recommended this one before someone else did.
Um,
but it's,

1194
01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:14.060
it's just awesome.
Um,
next one.

1195
01:18:14.300 --> 01:18:19.300
Our best judge Judy ending ever best judge Judy ending ever.

1196
01:18:19.971 --> 01:18:22.280
And this actually made me watch some of those,
uh,

1197
01:18:23.290 --> 01:18:26.450
like I fucking hate judge Judy.
I Hate Judge Carol.

1198
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.730
I hate all those mother fuckers.
Okay.

1199
01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:32.600
This one is some lady screaming at this guy going,
you know,

1200
01:18:32.601 --> 01:18:35.900
you don't come in here and disrespect this quite like that.

1201
01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:41.660
Disrespect what court?
It's a fucking TV show.

1202
01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.350
You're dumb cunt.
You're not a fucking judge.

1203
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:50.750
I'm so sick of these fucking people who get TV shows about a job and they think

1204
01:18:50.751 --> 01:18:51.081
that,
that,

1205
01:18:51.081 --> 01:18:54.630
that there's their fucking job now is still the job that they're showing.
No,

1206
01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:58.370
you're a TV star.
It's not a fucking court of law.

1207
01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:00.560
Even though it has the authority of a court of law.

1208
01:19:00.561 --> 01:19:04.070
How many courts do you know out there?
Okay.

1209
01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:07.100
That ceased to exist if they get bad ratings.

1210
01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.313
You know what I mean?

1211
01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:13.280
Actually left that comment on one of those fucking youtube video things,
man,

1212
01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:15.560
just fucking girl show boat.

1213
01:19:15.740 --> 01:19:19.130
There was show boat and slam it down the hammer screaming and yelling and then,

1214
01:19:19.131 --> 01:19:19.341
you know,

1215
01:19:19.341 --> 01:19:22.310
they go to the commercial and the producer comes up and whispers in their ear

1216
01:19:22.311 --> 01:19:25.310
like,
yeah,
that was great television.
That was great.
Tell them,
hey,

1217
01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:29.960
do more yelling,
yell more.
ESPN is making a killing with the yelling

1218
01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.420
I fuck out.
Maybe it's my hatred of women.
I don't know what it is,

1219
01:19:35.421 --> 01:19:40.280
but those fucking women judges,
that's my nightmare of what being married is.

1220
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:44.000
You know,
cause you're legally bound to them and they can take half your shit.

1221
01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.340
So now they can fucking yell at you like that.

1222
01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:49.670
Banging a hammer hammer on some fucking coffee table.

1223
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.690
Oh,
I'll tell you right now.
You can take half my shit.

1224
01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:57.770
I'll fucking walk just to get away from you and your fucking goddamn

1225
01:19:59.390 --> 01:20:03.740
menopause.
Chicken neck.
Fucking screaming at me.
Go fuck yourself,
Judge Judy.

1226
01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:07.100
There's no fucking way I would stand there.
Okay.

1227
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:12.060
And get yelled at like that because a third of my swing set is on my neighbor's

1228
01:20:12.061 --> 01:20:16.700
property.
You're gonna fucking yell at me like that.
Cause cause why?

1229
01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:20.100
Why are you yelling at me like that?
You don't even feel it,
Judge Judy.
All your,

1230
01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:23.040
Oh,
you want to do is get good ratings.
You're fucking grand standing.

1231
01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:27.720
Go Fuck Yourself.
Please tell me you're not naked under that robe.

1232
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.340
You amazed created old whore.
Sorry,

1233
01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:33.990
I don't like those fucking shows.

1234
01:20:33.991 --> 01:20:35.640
That's the same thing with like that Donald Trump.

1235
01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.840
If you actually think Donald Trump is rich and you're a fucking idiot,

1236
01:20:39.930 --> 01:20:41.310
you're a goddamn idiot.

1237
01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:46.710
He needs that job to keep his,
his face out there.

1238
01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:50.850
What do they call it?
Your Q rating?
Is that what they say in the business?

1239
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:53.850
How recognizable you fucking faces.

1240
01:20:53.851 --> 01:20:57.180
Go Down to Atlantic city and talked to a couple of people about Donald Trump and

1241
01:20:57.181 --> 01:21:01.890
his fucking,
he,
you know,
he is,
he is rich,
but he's like,
you know,

1242
01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:06.120
he's the rich version of that guy who lives on your street who has like four old

1243
01:21:06.121 --> 01:21:08.640
cars and different,
uh,

1244
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:13.290
levels of restoration and a fucking old refrigerator just rusting out on his

1245
01:21:13.291 --> 01:21:16.740
front property.
That guy,
the guy who makes your fucking property value go down.

1246
01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:19.140
He does that at like the skyscraper level.

1247
01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:21.560
I'm not saying he doesn't have more money than Uri,

1248
01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:23.530
but you know what I mean enough already.

1249
01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.610
If she really had all these successful businesses going on,

1250
01:21:26.850 --> 01:21:30.990
you don't have time to see if Ozzy's wife is better than Cindy.

1251
01:21:30.991 --> 01:21:34.230
Lopper do you?
I don't think you do.
All right,

1252
01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:38.070
last week on the podcast,
um,

1253
01:21:38.490 --> 01:21:41.170
I read some hate mail from single mothers,
uh,

1254
01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:45.210
who got mad at me when I was talking about stay at home moms with husbands who

1255
01:21:45.211 --> 01:21:49.200
give them money.
And uh,
I actually got some shit from,
uh,

1256
01:21:49.230 --> 01:21:52.500
from actual stay at home moms.
So,
uh,

1257
01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:57.501
one person chimed in on that actually brought up a decent point that was

1258
01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:01.410
delivered in a very extreme way,
which is how we do it on this podcast.

1259
01:22:01.411 --> 01:22:04.520
But I think there's,
there's,
there's a little bit of point here,
said,

1260
01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:07.050
I just listened to the August 2nd podcast.
He says,

1261
01:22:07.051 --> 01:22:11.160
isn't it funny how martyred the women who choose to bank some loser,

1262
01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:15.840
he's talking about single mothers here who they probably bitch at incessantly.

1263
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:19.050
This guy sounds like he's going through a divorce.
Um,

1264
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:23.370
and they end up single parent.
Wait a minute.

1265
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:27.930
I really can't read this week.
People.
It's the lack of alcohol in my system.

1266
01:22:27.931 --> 01:22:29.400
All right,
let's start over again.
Bill,

1267
01:22:29.401 --> 01:22:33.280
isn't it funny how martyred the women who choose to bank some loser and end up a

1268
01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:37.170
single parent like to make themselves and in his quads?

1269
01:22:37.171 --> 01:22:42.060
I am a single mom.
I do it all by myself.
Blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1270
01:22:42.930 --> 01:22:44.310
And the guy goes on to say,

1271
01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:47.820
who told you to get knocked up before you got an education?

1272
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:49.770
It's a great fucking point.

1273
01:22:50.220 --> 01:22:54.600
Who told you to let some loser who won't even stick around.

1274
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:57.120
Oops.
Stick it in you.

1275
01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:03.870
When you know what is going to come of it.
You got loaded.

1276
01:23:04.050 --> 01:23:08.140
Found some hardy loser who works a part time construction job.

1277
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:12.160
Hang on,
let me keep scrolling down and let them knock you up.

1278
01:23:12.370 --> 01:23:16.480
You chose the loser.
You didn't do birth control.
You didn't wait too.

1279
01:23:16.481 --> 01:23:20.680
You had your education or your career going and we need to celebrate you for

1280
01:23:20.681 --> 01:23:22.840
being the poor,
pitiful victim.
You are.

1281
01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:28.320
Cry me a river conc I have no more sympathy for you than the people who complain

1282
01:23:28.991 --> 01:23:31.880
about having no money but never run out of beer,

1283
01:23:31.881 --> 01:23:36.881
cigarettes or lottery tickets and our sporting a pony keg for a gut from all the

1284
01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:38.540
over eating they do.

1285
01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:48.070
There you go.
People,
that is the extreme opinion of the week.
We might've had a,

1286
01:23:48.090 --> 01:23:50.470
a new segment there.
Now,
obviously,
um,

1287
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:55.810
what makes that thing funny is it is,
it is so extreme,
but he's also,
you know,

1288
01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.080
he's ignoring the fact that there's a,

1289
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:03.520
there's different levels of information that is passed on to people at different

1290
01:24:03.521 --> 01:24:07.300
levels of,
uh,
ah,
you know,

1291
01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:12.340
look at super rich people have access to all the fucking information need and

1292
01:24:12.341 --> 01:24:14.050
even their kids can get fucking knocked up.

1293
01:24:14.051 --> 01:24:17.860
But you know what I mean as if you really look at the educational system in the

1294
01:24:17.861 --> 01:24:20.770
inner city schools in that type of shit.
I mean,
Jesus Christ,

1295
01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:24.520
it's fucking horrific what goes on in there.

1296
01:24:24.610 --> 01:24:29.170
And it's absolutely pathetic.
The,
I don't know that,
that,

1297
01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:34.380
that people in general don't give a shit that the more poor you are,

1298
01:24:34.691 --> 01:24:39.280
the worst,
the fucking free education that you're supposed to get.
His,

1299
01:24:39.281 --> 01:24:44.220
so I mean,
I,
I do great it a little bit on a,
on a,

1300
01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:47.170
uh,
what do they call that?

1301
01:24:47.260 --> 01:24:52.090
What was that shit when you a scale grading scan of fucking remember I'm a
moron.

1302
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:54.130
I don't know.
I grew up in the suburbs.
So I had a,

1303
01:24:54.131 --> 01:24:58.540
I had a decent education and I remember when I started working in a warehouse

1304
01:24:58.541 --> 01:25:03.541
and I started working with these other kids from a Brockton and,

1305
01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:04.390
uh,

1306
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:09.390
the education that they got was a way more street education than they got like a

1307
01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:12.790
,
you know,
the x's and o's from school,
you know,

1308
01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:17.050
and a lot of them had fucking kids real young,
just like their parents did.

1309
01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:21.250
And for all you fucking people out there who were picture and blacks and Puerto

1310
01:25:21.250 --> 01:25:23.800
Ricans,
these kids were white.
They were white,

1311
01:25:23.801 --> 01:25:28.200
but they were listening to that hip hop.
No,

1312
01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:32.770
I'm fucking around.
No,
seriously.
So,
but that,
there is,
there is like a,
uh,

1313
01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:34.810
there,

1314
01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:39.810
there is a great point in there where it's like you weren't born a single mom.

1315
01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.480
You know what I mean?
Like if somebody is handicapped,

1316
01:25:43.481 --> 01:25:47.380
I'd never make some fun of somebody fucking handicapped.
Okay.
I wouldn't,

1317
01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:52.330
all right.
It's just,
you know,
it was an accident or you were born that way,

1318
01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:57.130
but you weren't born pregnant.
I don't know.
Yeah.

1319
01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:58.060
And it's,

1320
01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:03.060
it's really hard for me from where I came from to imagine why someone would want

1321
01:26:03.981 --> 01:26:07.640
to be.
There's actually people out there who want to have a kid at 16.

1322
01:26:09.620 --> 01:26:12.590
MMM.
I guess a lot of it comes down if their parents did it.

1323
01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:17.570
I have no fucking idea.
MMM.
Yeah.
I Dunno.

1324
01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:21.180
But yeah.
Okay.
Any single moms out there?
I mean,
do you,

1325
01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:23.630
is there any sort of responsibility on yourself?

1326
01:26:23.631 --> 01:26:27.260
Do you ever sit down and just be like,
wow,
I,
you know,
no pun intended,

1327
01:26:27.261 --> 01:26:31.210
really fucked myself over here,
you know,

1328
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:38.190
I dunno,
I'm of that opinion that that's how you grow in life.
Okay.

1329
01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:41.500
You know,
you can't blame other peoples for your failure.

1330
01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:44.770
Like Peyton manning does every goddamn Sunday he loses.

1331
01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:50.000
We had protection issues.
Okay.
Oh,
that actually works.

1332
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:52.670
Ah,
that's what these single moms should do.

1333
01:26:52.671 --> 01:26:55.790
They should come out just like at the end of one of those Peyton manning fucking

1334
01:26:55.791 --> 01:27:00.750
bad games.
He has come out with a towel around your neck and just,
and I,

1335
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:04.850
we are protection issues.
Um,
I don't know if there was a hole in the condom.

1336
01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.480
Oh wait,
he didn't even wear one.
Um,

1337
01:27:08.481 --> 01:27:10.010
it was because look,

1338
01:27:10.011 --> 01:27:15.010
he had a condom on initially and then he went and he put it in my ass and he

1339
01:27:15.011 --> 01:27:19.380
wanted to go back to my vagina.
I made him take it off because,
you know,
I,

1340
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:23.480
I didn't want to get an infection so I didn't get infected for anybody wandering

1341
01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:23.481
.

1342
01:27:23.481 --> 01:27:28.481
But now I have a child and you have no idea how difficult it is to try to raise

1343
01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:33.890
this child.
I know it has to be unbelievably fucking difficult,

1344
01:27:33.891 --> 01:27:35.330
but at the end of the day,

1345
01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.690
you're the one who laid on your back and took a hot one.
Okay.

1346
01:27:39.910 --> 01:27:43.600
So for all you ladies,
all the booties out there,

1347
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.920
um,
yeah,
don't do that.
This is what you want.
You want to get married first,

1348
01:27:50.810 --> 01:27:53.300
so you're legally bound to that son of a bitch.

1349
01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:58.790
So when he knocks you up and then leaves like the piece of fucking garbage that

1350
01:27:58.791 --> 01:28:02.930
he is,
he's going to owe you money.
You know?

1351
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:07.310
And I know what you're saying,
but what some of these guys,
they just blow it off.

1352
01:28:07.311 --> 01:28:10.010
They become dead beat dads.
They'd rather go to fucking jail and he was,

1353
01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.830
then you married a fucking loser.

1354
01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.690
Okay.
Do you understand that you're married a fucking loser?

1355
01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:21.380
And I think this day and age,

1356
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:26.180
women have no business complaining about a what?

1357
01:28:26.181 --> 01:28:28.990
They make an hour.
Okay?

1358
01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:34.060
Cause if you listen to the beyond say catalog of music that she's put up,

1359
01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:39.150
if you could sit through that hours and hours of shit that she has put out,

1360
01:28:39.681 --> 01:28:42.260
evidently,
um,
you guys,

1361
01:28:42.261 --> 01:28:47.230
your booty licious you're independent women and a,
if you like it,

1362
01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:50.620
you got to put a ring on it.
I mean,
right there is the trilogy.

1363
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:53.140
That's all the information you need

1364
01:28:55.570 --> 01:28:58.720
to get ahead in life.
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.
Look,
you know,

1365
01:28:58.721 --> 01:29:02.130
I'm trying to be,
uh,
not devil's,
I'm to be mediated here.

1366
01:29:02.131 --> 01:29:05.910
I understand that a shit happens.
I mean,

1367
01:29:05.911 --> 01:29:10.500
who out there in their fucking career never had a girl who was late,

1368
01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:15.990
never took a chance.
You know,
we all have,

1369
01:29:15.991 --> 01:29:19.710
so this guy is wrong for judging them that harshly,

1370
01:29:19.711 --> 01:29:22.950
but these single moms to 100%

1371
01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:28.770
paint themselves as these fucking victims.
You're not all right.
You know,

1372
01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:32.060
God damn well,
it's not easy to raise a kid.
I did.

1373
01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:36.090
He not fucking know that I knew that it's 16.
That was the horror,

1374
01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:40.470
the fucking horror when I was 16 to get somebody fucking knocked up,

1375
01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:44.760
you know?
And I was so fucking nervous about knocking somebody up.

1376
01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.530
I didn't get laid till I was 19.

1377
01:29:48.030 --> 01:29:50.430
That's the only reason I could get laid at 14.

1378
01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:54.360
Me coming down the fucking hall with my orange hair and my freckles,

1379
01:29:54.690 --> 01:29:58.320
I was beaten.
The ladies off me,
he was like,
listen ladies,

1380
01:29:58.890 --> 01:30:03.690
I'd love to have a threesome in the seventh grade.
Okay,
I get it.
You know,

1381
01:30:03.691 --> 01:30:08.010
I'm like that White Rhino,
um,
rare.
I'm desirable.

1382
01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:09.300
Like the hope diamond.

1383
01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.200
That was pathetic.
I mean,

1384
01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:18.870
then 19 I started my fucking bang and career and um,

1385
01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:23.850
I'm so full of Shit.
All I would do is just make sure the girl was on the pill.

1386
01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:27.960
This is back when we thought I aids you could only get if you are gay or if you

1387
01:30:28.070 --> 01:30:31.350
were a trucker
and um,

1388
01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:36.660
you know,
I'm completely full of Shit.
I think if I was a fucking woman,

1389
01:30:36.661 --> 01:30:38.100
I probably have six kids by now.

1390
01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:43.980
All right,
there you go.

1391
01:30:44.010 --> 01:30:46.830
We need veterans and we need single moms to fucking chime in here.

1392
01:30:46.831 --> 01:30:50.280
Do you think that guy's being too harsh?
Obviously.
Obviously he's a little harsh.

1393
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:54.120
All right.
Um,
oh,
here's this thing I wanted to read about the royals.

1394
01:30:54.150 --> 01:30:57.420
I actually saved this here.
If I can go back for a second.
I,
Bill,

1395
01:30:57.421 --> 01:31:00.990
I've heard you many times talk about how the Red Sox and Yankees are ruining

1396
01:31:00.991 --> 01:31:04.590
baseball with how many stars they're able to buy.
Unlike other teams.

1397
01:31:04.591 --> 01:31:06.090
I agree with you to a certain extent.

1398
01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:09.870
I think there should be a salary cap to make it more fair for everyone in the

1399
01:31:09.871 --> 01:31:13.050
league.
However,
here is a fun fact.

1400
01:31:13.051 --> 01:31:16.860
The owner of the royals is a recent CEO of Walmart.

1401
01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:20.310
The royals are one of the few teams.
Hang on here.

1402
01:31:20.311 --> 01:31:25.311
One of the few teams used as an example of how teams without enough money can't

1403
01:31:25.411 --> 01:31:29.120
compete yet,
their owner is a multibillionaire dude.
That guy's not a mall.

1404
01:31:29.130 --> 01:31:33.570
You're not as CEO of Walmart in your own multi billionaire,
I bet is a CEO.

1405
01:31:33.571 --> 01:31:36.810
He probably makes some disgusting amount,
like 10 million a year.

1406
01:31:39.060 --> 01:31:41.760
Um,
one,
I don't know if I agree with this,

1407
01:31:41.761 --> 01:31:44.850
you're acting as if Walmart owns the royals.

1408
01:31:45.450 --> 01:31:47.400
It's a c o of Walmart.

1409
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:50.760
Can we find out how much those guys make?

1410
01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:54.360
Hasn't one of them written a book like the secret to success?

1411
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:59.500
He sits there in his fucking seersucker suit with his hand on his fuck head in

1412
01:31:59.501 --> 01:32:01.300
his hand.
And that,
that,
you know,

1413
01:32:01.301 --> 01:32:05.080
that smile that Jay Leno smile where you don't show your teeth,
you know,

1414
01:32:06.700 --> 01:32:10.970
that's supposed to be like the relaxed.
It's easy.
I mean,
he's going,

1415
01:32:11.070 --> 01:32:14.590
he interviewed them many in,
in and he talked to the guy who plays the trumpet.

1416
01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:18.210
Um,
how teams can compete with the nonverbal,
but yeah,

1417
01:32:18.250 --> 01:32:20.470
it's not about how much money the team has,

1418
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:24.730
it's about how much the owners are willing to invest on the team.
No,

1419
01:32:24.731 --> 01:32:28.360
it is about how much it is about how much money you have.

1420
01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:32.230
You don't have enough money to invest into the fucking team.

1421
01:32:33.130 --> 01:32:36.010
Listen to this sentence.
It's not about how much money the team has,

1422
01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.020
it's about how much the owners are willing to invest.

1423
01:32:38.021 --> 01:32:43.021
So I guess he's making the leap now that because this guy is a CEO for Walmart,

1424
01:32:44.711 --> 01:32:48.970
that he's now a multibillionaire.
God Damn it.
I love when I list,

1425
01:32:48.971 --> 01:32:51.460
when I find out my listeners that just as dumb as I am,

1426
01:32:53.230 --> 01:32:54.790
he's not a multibillionaire.

1427
01:32:54.791 --> 01:32:58.750
Walmart itself takes in billions of dollars every year.

1428
01:32:58.751 --> 01:33:02.650
And I know that because I've never looked it up.
Okay.

1429
01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:07.330
But they don't pay a CEO multimillions of dollars.

1430
01:33:07.331 --> 01:33:12.220
I bet the Walmart family,
the upper echelon,
the JP Morgans,

1431
01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:16.300
the incestuous family that continues to fuck each other.

1432
01:33:16.301 --> 01:33:19.640
So the money stays in their family.
Allah,

1433
01:33:19.770 --> 01:33:21.880
the fucking Rothchild family.
Right.

1434
01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:25.300
That's how you end up with a kid in the attic.
You know what I'm saying

1435
01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:29.110
though,
yet?
Cause I don't know what I'm saying.
All right.
So anyways,

1436
01:33:29.111 --> 01:33:32.020
he says the Walmart guy doesn't give a fuck about baseball.

1437
01:33:32.290 --> 01:33:35.530
So he doesn't risk the money on his puttsy.
This is why I love being in bars.

1438
01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.970
This is what this guy's doing right now.

1439
01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:41.830
He just assumed that because the CEO of Walmart is one of the owners of Kansas,

1440
01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:46.240
the Kansas city royals,
that that guy is a multi fucking billionaire.

1441
01:33:46.810 --> 01:33:49.600
And then with that knowledge that he just pulled out of his ass,

1442
01:33:49.780 --> 01:33:53.530
he's now going to complete the fucking dismount with this statement.

1443
01:33:53.531 --> 01:33:56.050
The Walmart guy doesn't give a fuck about baseball,

1444
01:33:56.051 --> 01:33:58.180
so he doesn't risk his money on his team.
Yeah,

1445
01:33:58.181 --> 01:34:02.260
he doesn't give a fuck about baseball.
He just bought a Goddamn team.
Um,

1446
01:34:02.261 --> 01:34:04.060
if he had the passion of Steinbrenner,

1447
01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.850
we would be talking about how the royals and Yankees are ruining baseball is

1448
01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:12.160
heat now.
That right there,
if you don't know what my podcast is about,

1449
01:34:12.161 --> 01:34:13.480
it's that email right there.

1450
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:18.190
What you do is you start off with a piece of information that actually is a fact

1451
01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:22.690
and then you just run with it.
You know,
if we were smart on this podcast,

1452
01:34:22.691 --> 01:34:26.140
what we would do is you'd be like,
Oh wow,
that guy's a CEO at Walmart.

1453
01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:29.800
Well let's find out how much he makes a year.

1454
01:34:30.460 --> 01:34:34.060
Does he own it by himself?
You know,

1455
01:34:34.330 --> 01:34:38.620
let's find out what it takes to run a fucking baseball team.
I mean,

1456
01:34:38.621 --> 01:34:42.880
you completely ignored the fact that Kansas City is not a major media market.

1457
01:34:42.940 --> 01:34:44.140
That's another way that a,

1458
01:34:44.141 --> 01:34:48.280
the red sox and Yankees make a ton of cash with the yes network and Nelson.

1459
01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:52.480
I mean,
how many people even live in Kansas City?
Huh?

1460
01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:57.910
With your fucking rib shacks out there.
Um,
I,

1461
01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:01.010
I do know what you're saying because I know people in Pittsburgh,

1462
01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:04.370
they went through the roof when they found out that the pirates were one of the

1463
01:35:04.371 --> 01:35:07.980
most profitable teams in the league because a,

1464
01:35:07.981 --> 01:35:11.420
they don't spend shit on the team and then they get all that welfare money from

1465
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:15.860
the Red Sox,
Yankees and whoever else goes over the fucking salary cap.

1466
01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:21.100
Um,
so there is an element of truth in that shit.
But,
uh,
I'll tell,
you know,

1467
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:24.020
my favorite baseball team is right now.
I mean,
I always root for the Red Sox,

1468
01:35:24.021 --> 01:35:25.550
but I fucking love the devil rays.

1469
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:31.510
The devil rays remind me of like the Orioles in the 70s you know what I mean?

1470
01:35:31.941 --> 01:35:36.860
Where they just were a fucking,
just an unbelievable franchisee.

1471
01:35:37.170 --> 01:35:40.700
Oreos in the 70s I swear to God they,
the,

1472
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:44.120
the level of pitchers that they just one after another,

1473
01:35:44.121 --> 01:35:48.620
I don't know how they ended up getting him a Frank Tenana,
Jim Palmer,

1474
01:35:48.621 --> 01:35:53.420
they just always had these,
these potentials.
Cy Young winning,
I'm

1475
01:35:55.940 --> 01:35:58.970
winning pitchers and then like they're fucking third baseman in short,

1476
01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:03.740
short for like almost 30 years.
They were bringing up a fucking hall of Famer.

1477
01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.970
They like Frank Robinson,
Brooks Robinson,

1478
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:12.950
cal Ripkin jr from the sixties seventies into the 80s I guess frank and Brooke

1479
01:36:12.951 --> 01:36:14.720
retired.
There was a little bit of a gap there.

1480
01:36:15.410 --> 01:36:17.570
Who the fuck paid poo play third base

1481
01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:23.790
for the Orioles in the 79 world series?
Uh,

1482
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:26.520
going back too far of I first thought thought I had was Doug to

1483
01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:32.060
Sensei Bobby gritch.
Those are like angels,
I believe.
California angels,

1484
01:36:32.660 --> 01:36:37.260
Rod Carew.
Why am I thinking of those guys?
You know,
it's funny,

1485
01:36:37.340 --> 01:36:42.020
as I can remember,
all of the fucking pirates from the,
I guess cause they won.

1486
01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:46.370
Okay.
Eddie Murray played first base.

1487
01:36:47.210 --> 01:36:50.510
Willie Stargell played first base for the pirates.
Lily,

1488
01:36:50.511 --> 01:36:55.460
I can go right around the unfilled.
Tim Foley was second base.
I can,

1489
01:36:55.461 --> 01:36:59.540
I can only do half the fucking ed art.
Omar Marino,

1490
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:06.590
Dave Parker,
John Candaleria,
Kent to Colby.
How come I can't remember you?

1491
01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:11.060
The fucking Orioles.
Remember that guy?
You remember that guy in the Orioles?

1492
01:37:11.061 --> 01:37:13.280
Maybe you can find this picture on the m podcast.

1493
01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:17.330
There was a guy in the Orioles who broke his jaw and through the whole world

1494
01:37:17.331 --> 01:37:19.820
series he had half a football helmet.

1495
01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:23.390
Literally like the gray face mask.

1496
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:29.360
I can't remember his fucking name either.
It gives a shit.

1497
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:33.950
All I'm saying is the fucking that the devil rays in my Goddamn team,

1498
01:37:33.951 --> 01:37:37.160
I think that they're,
they're the shit.
They don't have a lot of money.

1499
01:37:37.161 --> 01:37:41.390
They got a low payroll and they just have the best prospects in the league and

1500
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:44.060
they're doing it the old school way.
I got nothing but respect for him.

1501
01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:48.140
And I'm slowly getting back into baseball.
Most of you know,
when,
uh,

1502
01:37:48.170 --> 01:37:51.500
David Ortiz tested positive for some shit.
I just,
I had a tap out,

1503
01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:56.550
you know what I mean?
That was like finding out lone ranger,
a transvestite.

1504
01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:58.800
It's just,
yeah,
there's too much information.
I don't want to know that.
Okay.

1505
01:37:58.801 --> 01:38:03.270
It's one of my heroes and it just,
you know,
part of me died that day,
so,

1506
01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:07.020
but I'm gradually coming back and I'm coming back because of teams like the

1507
01:38:07.021 --> 01:38:10.230
devil rays.
I just want those teams to fucking knock off the bigger teams.

1508
01:38:10.231 --> 01:38:14.400
I don't give a fuck.
What are you gonna Chat?
2007 at me.
I don't give a fuck.

1509
01:38:15.130 --> 01:38:18.870
All right.
Hey,
Ron hits his 600th,
whole broad.

1510
01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:20.290
Hey,

1511
01:38:20.290 --> 01:38:24.450
you mean the guy took steroids and had a good 400 of those fucking home runs on

1512
01:38:24.451 --> 01:38:27.700
roids.
That guy,
the guy who came back who,
who's allegedly clean,

1513
01:38:27.701 --> 01:38:32.520
but he's just as big as he was when he was on roids.
Is any doctors out there?

1514
01:38:32.521 --> 01:38:36.750
Can anybody for the love of God explained to me how the fuck you do roids get

1515
01:38:36.751 --> 01:38:39.780
off a roids and you come back and you just as fucking big.

1516
01:38:41.850 --> 01:38:44.310
I think that means you're Rhonda,
then you're onto the next shit.

1517
01:38:44.400 --> 01:38:47.760
Although somebody I know who's really into baseball,
uh,

1518
01:38:47.790 --> 01:38:51.930
stats was telling me that when,
when he was on the shit,

1519
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:56.280
he was hitting a home run like every fucking 14 at bats.

1520
01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:58.500
And then,
uh,

1521
01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:02.520
he got off the shit and then it went to like 18 at bats and now it's down to

1522
01:39:02.521 --> 01:39:06.240
like two every 23 at bats.
So maybe he's not on the shit.
I don't fucking know

1523
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:10.410
why.
Why am I just openly trashing people with no information?

1524
01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:12.930
Cause that's what this fucking podcast is about.
All right?

1525
01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:17.140
A few weeks ago I talked about how I,
uh,
or maybe it was last week,

1526
01:39:17.250 --> 01:39:21.450
how I was really into breaking bad and that made everybody want to come out here

1527
01:39:21.451 --> 01:39:23.820
and start telling me what their favorite TV shows are.

1528
01:39:23.821 --> 01:39:25.350
So here are some of you guys can check out.

1529
01:39:25.470 --> 01:39:30.130
This is one I didn't even know exist existed.
Uh,
moral Orel

1530
01:39:33.090 --> 01:39:36.300
and that was like a claymation show.
Is that what it was?

1531
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:41.250
And it was on adult swim and he got canceled but it really attached religion I

1532
01:39:41.251 --> 01:39:45.780
guess.
Then I watched a little bit of it.
It was so fucking depressing.

1533
01:39:45.781 --> 01:39:48.000
I don't know if I can watch it.
I have to watch it now.

1534
01:39:48.001 --> 01:39:50.070
I guess it's just available on DVD.

1535
01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:53.190
Go on Youtube and check out a couple of clips.

1536
01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:59.360
There's one where the fucking father is walking around and it's a first person

1537
01:40:01.951 --> 01:40:06.630
shoot.
Um,
for those of you play video games or watch porno,
um,

1538
01:40:06.631 --> 01:40:10.140
it's in the first person and he just keeps looking down at this whiskey glass

1539
01:40:10.141 --> 01:40:15.141
and it keeps drinking at any hears his wife talking to their child behind closed

1540
01:40:15.481 --> 01:40:18.450
doors and the kids going,
why does daddy drink?

1541
01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:21.000
I don't like it when he drinks and she's just going,
oh,

1542
01:40:21.130 --> 01:40:25.050
you got to understand he's just a different person.
When he drinks it's okay.

1543
01:40:25.051 --> 01:40:27.750
And she's giggling and laughing like he has no drinking problem.

1544
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:31.080
Then she walks out into the hall,
does not see the father,

1545
01:40:31.530 --> 01:40:36.150
and she breaks down crying for like 20 seconds.
It's fucking brutal.

1546
01:40:36.151 --> 01:40:40.170
And then she looks up and sees him who the whole time,
by the way,

1547
01:40:40.171 --> 01:40:43.020
keeps taking sips of his whiskey.
When she finally sees him,

1548
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.790
she immediately stopped crying,

1549
01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:48.240
shuts down all of her emotion and walks the other way down the hallway.

1550
01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.800
It's fucking,
and I have to watch it.
All right.
Here's some other ones.

1551
01:40:56.801 --> 01:40:59.170
People recommended true blood.
I don't know what that is.

1552
01:40:59.171 --> 01:41:02.320
Psych and somebody recommended on her entourage.

1553
01:41:02.380 --> 01:41:05.980
Evidently they still haven't picked up the fact that it always ends the same
way.

1554
01:41:06.810 --> 01:41:10.060
There's a problem and then they all get on a jet and go to Vegas and it all

1555
01:41:10.061 --> 01:41:14.950
works out.
Um,
underrated.
Overrated for this week.
Um,

1556
01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:19.810
overrated.
The dollar menu at fast food joints,
underrated,

1557
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:22.630
illegal immigrants,
uh,

1558
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:25.600
person did not give an explanation on either one of those.

1559
01:41:25.601 --> 01:41:29.290
And I'm going to actually chime in.
Um,

1560
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:34.900
overrated is because I was in a touristy place down in San Diego,

1561
01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:40.000
La Jolla.
Um,
overrated would be,
uh,

1562
01:41:40.030 --> 01:41:43.540
any breakfast place that you have to fucking stand in line for.

1563
01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.700
You know,
that's the one that the chick using.

1564
01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:53.920
All right.
I got another fucking a underrated for you.

1565
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:56.050
Underrated a fucking device.

1566
01:41:56.051 --> 01:41:58.540
That light that lets you know the batteries are going to wear out.

1567
01:41:58.541 --> 01:41:59.374
Sorry about that.

1568
01:41:59.890 --> 01:42:02.880
I was right in the middle of the underrated overrated in my fucking Olympus ls

1569
01:42:03.150 --> 01:42:07.270
10.
Just fucking conked out on me.
Sorry about that.
I was saying,

1570
01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:10.750
let me continue here.
Let me just give you guys a breather.

1571
01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.580
She can figure out what the fuck just happened.

1572
01:42:12.581 --> 01:42:15.000
Because the way I'm going to edit this thing,
I know it's,

1573
01:42:15.001 --> 01:42:18.280
it's just going to be really choppy.
Basically.
Uh,

1574
01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:21.010
my battery's ran out so I was in the middle of the underrated,

1575
01:42:21.011 --> 01:42:25.450
any of those fucking breakfast places that have the long lines at him cause they

1576
01:42:25.451 --> 01:42:30.310
have the best,
it's fucking eggs.
It's never worth the long line.

1577
01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:34.370
Okay.
I'm not saying to go to some shit place that has rubber eggs,
but there,

1578
01:42:34.371 --> 01:42:37.900
there's a,
there's another place close by,
you know,

1579
01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.420
and every time you go to those places with the long lines,

1580
01:42:40.421 --> 01:42:42.040
it's usually for the chicks because they,

1581
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:45.430
they're just addicted to sugar and they want to go in and get the fucking

1582
01:42:45.431 --> 01:42:48.760
stuffed French toast with the cheese cream cheese and the fucking ice cream on

1583
01:42:48.761 --> 01:42:51.850
top.
Fuck all of that.
All right,
you're a goddamn man.

1584
01:42:51.851 --> 01:42:56.110
Go get bacon and eggs at a fucking diner and get on with your morning.
Um,

1585
01:42:57.230 --> 01:43:01.330
and uh,
underrated,
I would say is a surfing.

1586
01:43:02.230 --> 01:43:06.790
I was down there.
I am absolutely in San Diego,
absolutely fucking terrified of,

1587
01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:11.080
uh,
the ocean.
And I watched these guys surf.

1588
01:43:11.110 --> 01:43:13.840
I had my little flip camera there cause I was hoping someone was going to get

1589
01:43:13.841 --> 01:43:16.120
eaten by a shark or at the very least attacked.

1590
01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:20.800
And I could have this fucking awesome video of this guy getting eaten by a
shark.

1591
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:22.750
And then he'd stick my head in and be like,

1592
01:43:22.751 --> 01:43:26.590
I'm going to be at the Hampton Beach Casino this fucking Thursday.
You know,

1593
01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:32.200
the ultimate fucking promo video,
I guess Friday I'm going to be there,
you know?

1594
01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:35.680
But um,
yeah,
I actually,
I came real close.

1595
01:43:35.681 --> 01:43:37.840
I was going to actually do a,

1596
01:43:37.841 --> 01:43:41.260
I was going to take a surfing class when I was down there and become the world's

1597
01:43:41.261 --> 01:43:44.830
first redheaded surfer,
you know,

1598
01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.820
and if I actually dominated in that sport,

1599
01:43:48.821 --> 01:43:53.821
do you realize that redheads would fucking be dominating the surfing world from

1600
01:43:56.041 --> 01:43:59.800
fucking snowboarding all the way to fucking surfing?

1601
01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:02.700
And that would be it.
And when that ever happened,

1602
01:44:03.690 --> 01:44:06.300
you'd know that Jesus was coming.
Um,
all right,

1603
01:44:06.301 --> 01:44:10.620
that's the fucking podcast for this week.
Uh,
just to let you guys know this week,

1604

August 12th,

1606
01:44:17.970 --> 01:44:20.610
And on Friday the 13th,

1607
01:44:20.611 --> 01:44:25.200

1617
01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:55.580
Nor did I know that bill's coming out there where I'm letting you know I'm going

podcast seriously.
All right.
There's always people doing that shit.

1629
01:45:38.970 --> 01:45:43.970
I got an email from somebody who came out to my show down in La Jolla and was

1630
01:45:43.971 --> 01:45:48.220
saying how he had to drag his wife to,

1631
01:45:48.221 --> 01:45:50.010
to my show because uh,

1632
01:45:50.020 --> 01:45:54.090
all her girlfriends was saying that I was misogynistic and anti fucking woman

1633
01:45:54.130 --> 01:45:55.600
women because a,

1634
01:45:55.601 --> 01:46:00.010
their husbands listened to my podcast and a,
you know,

1635
01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.440
I'm not anti women,
I just,
I,
I just trash them.

1636
01:46:05.250 --> 01:46:10.180
So why don't you lighten up fucking whores and come out to my shoe.

1637
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:14.470

He caught a nasty virus and there was the ever present football player rapist.

1641
01:46:28.891 --> 01:46:33.300
They were all in love with Diane.
They were doing all,
they caught a bullet,

1642
01:46:33.301 --> 01:46:37.020
but it only hit his leg while it should have been a better shot and got him,

1643
01:46:37.150 --> 01:46:40.950
and they were all in love with guy and they were drinking from a fountain that

1644
01:46:40.951 --> 01:46:43.980
was born like an avalanche coming down the mountain.

1645
