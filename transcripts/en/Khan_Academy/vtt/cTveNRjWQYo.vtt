00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:03.950
Beatrice is ordering
pizzas for a party.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.830
Each pizza is cut
into 12 pieces.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.770
Beatrice wants to
have enough pizza

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.533
so that each person
can have 4 pieces.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.140
And 16 people will
be at the party.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.530
A lot of information
in this problem.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.180
If Beatrice buys 7 pizzas, how
many extra pieces will there

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.440
be after each person
eats 4 pieces?

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.380
So to do this, let's think
about how many total pieces

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.632
she will have.

00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:37.840
And then let's think about
how many total pieces will

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.130
be eaten by the 16 people.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.250
And then we'll figure how
much that she had extra.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.065
So first, let's think about
how many total pieces.

00:00:46.065 --> 00:00:48.690
And I encourage you to pause the
video and try to figure it out

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.910
yourself.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.430
She ordered 7 pizzas.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.100
How many total pieces
are there going to be?

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.050
Well, you have 7 pizzas.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.155
7-- that's the number of pizzas.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.820
And if you have 12
pieces per pizza,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.800
you multiply by 12 to get
the total number of pieces.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.090
So this is number
of pieces per pizza.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.040
And 7 times 12 is equal
to 84 total pieces.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.780
So that's how many
pieces she's got.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.350
Now let's think about how many
get eaten by the 16 people.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.720
So you have 16 people.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.840
16-- that's the
number of people.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.720
And this little symbol,
that's shorthand for number.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.170
16 people, and they
each eat 4 pieces.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.220
So 16 people times
4 pieces per person.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.215
So number of pieces per person.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.110
16 times 4 is 64.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.840
So that's 64--
not 84-- 64 pieces

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.750
are eaten by the 16 people.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.760
So how much does
she have left over?

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.740
Well, if you start with 84
pieces and 64 get eaten,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.945
84 minus 64 is 20.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.660
We deserve a drum roll now.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:36.674
You have 20 extra pieces after
everyone eats their share.
