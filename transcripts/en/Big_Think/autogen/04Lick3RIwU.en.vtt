00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.260
One of the things that we have found in our
research is that in general we don't make

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.130
full use of the capacity of the human brain.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.720
We identified that actually initially from
hearing from a couple of the POWs when they

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.230
were in solitary confinement.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.630
They told us that when they were in solitary
confinement for years and all they had was

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.940
the ability to think that they developed unusual
cognitive capacities that they never had before

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.149
when they were in solitary confinement, like
they were essentially exercising their brain.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:46.989
One individual told us he was able to multiply
eventually many numbers by many numbers, 12

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.949
numbers by 12 numbers accurately.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.559
Never was able to do that before.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.850
Another told us that he was able to remember
to very early times in his childhood, like

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.850
remembering the names of the students in his
kindergarten class.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.080
Admiral Shoemaker, one of the individuals
that we came to admire a lot, built a house

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.260
in his mind nail by nail, cabinet by cabinet,
room by room and then when he got out he built

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.230
that house, and when we met him he was having
a fight with his wife because she wanted to

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.390
renovate the house and he said no way was
that going to happen.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.980
That brought home that when you exercise your
brain and you don't have any outside distractions

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.310
because you're in solitary, you have enormous
capacities.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.130
Our research group subsequently hearing about
this and others around the country have now

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.490
taken a tact that through specific exercises
we might be able to enhance brain plasticity,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.530
or using more of the capacity of the human
brain.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.200
For example, we now have a research study
in which where through exercises, through

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.909
psychological exercises are trying to retrain
the circuits that are involved in depression.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.569
It's not a typical psychotherapy.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.849
It's very specifically oriented toward improving
the circuits that are involved in causing

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.340
human depression.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.939
So far there are some positive results around
that.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.480
For certain forms of learning and memory problems,
new therapies have been developed that exercise

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.659
the human brain around learning and memory
mechanisms.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:38.959
With human anxiety, practicing certain techniques
that tap into the circuits and the chemistry

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.120
of anxiety is now an area of focus.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.920
Mindfulness therapy is an example of that.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.750
So that's a really emerging area to develop
new therapies, non pharmacological therapies,

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.849
that exercise the human brain to improve learning
and memory problems and anxiety and problems

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:58.649
with depression.
