and I think anyone that's had a pet can

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
and I think anyone that's had a pet can
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549
and I think anyone that's had a pet can
really relate to losing that pet and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
really relate to losing that pet and
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.330
really relate to losing that pet and
feeling responsible for losing him um so

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340
feeling responsible for losing him um so
 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.320
feeling responsible for losing him um so
you go for him being unbelievably angry

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330
you go for him being unbelievably angry
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.929
you go for him being unbelievably angry
and vengeful through this by think sort

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939
and vengeful through this by think sort
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.289
and vengeful through this by think sort
of unlike some of the other times where

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299
of unlike some of the other times where
 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.690
of unlike some of the other times where
they did it again it feels like this is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
they did it again it feels like this is
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120
they did it again it feels like this is
really warranted because this is someone

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
really warranted because this is someone
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.980
really warranted because this is someone
that he's been very close to even if it

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
that he's been very close to even if it
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.719
that he's been very close to even if it
is an animal in fact in a strange way it

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
is an animal in fact in a strange way it
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.700
is an animal in fact in a strange way it
makes more sense if it's an animal

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
makes more sense if it's an animal
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.320
makes more sense if it's an animal
because I don't think he's ever dealt

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330
because I don't think he's ever dealt
 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.499
because I don't think he's ever dealt
with he's dealt with loss of people and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509
with he's dealt with loss of people and
 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.090
with he's dealt with loss of people and
it's really hurt him this is the first

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
it's really hurt him this is the first
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.999
it's really hurt him this is the first
time he's lost a creature that was

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
time he's lost a creature that was
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.340
time he's lost a creature that was
really close to it you know uh

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350
really close to it you know uh
 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.080
really close to it you know uh
essentially a pet in a sense you know

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
essentially a pet in a sense you know
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.969
essentially a pet in a sense you know
it's like a cowboy losing his horse or

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
it's like a cowboy losing his horse or
 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.249
it's like a cowboy losing his horse or
something it's a big deal and I like

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
something it's a big deal and I like
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.130
something it's a big deal and I like
that he isn't just angry and that's it

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
that he isn't just angry and that's it
 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.100
that he isn't just angry and that's it
it's a it really carries through the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
it's a it really carries through the
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.960
it's a it really carries through the
whole entire episode to a point where it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
whole entire episode to a point where it
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.410
whole entire episode to a point where it
really sort of it pushes his patience

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
really sort of it pushes his patience
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.780
really sort of it pushes his patience
big time and he has another avatar state

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
big time and he has another avatar state
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.389
big time and he has another avatar state
freakout near the end but it's it's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
freakout near the end but it's it's
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.389
freakout near the end but it's it's
brief and I like I like being with

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
brief and I like I like being with
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.100
brief and I like I like being with
Katara sort of bringing him out but she

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
Katara sort of bringing him out but she
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.660
Katara sort of bringing him out but she
doesn't even have to say anything

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670
doesn't even have to say anything
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.139
doesn't even have to say anything
and I like her not freaking out when she

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
and I like her not freaking out when she
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.449
and I like her not freaking out when she
sees him starting to really go nuts I

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459
sees him starting to really go nuts I
 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.930
sees him starting to really go nuts I
like that and I won't say she knows that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
like that and I won't say she knows that
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.930
like that and I won't say she knows that
she has the answer but

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940
she has the answer but
 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.550
she has the answer but
she understands what he's going through

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560
she understands what he's going through
 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.270
she understands what he's going through
and I think because of that she most

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280
and I think because of that she most
 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.220
and I think because of that she most
likely has the right idea of how to snap

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
likely has the right idea of how to snap
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.990
likely has the right idea of how to snap
him out of it and I think that's why she

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
him out of it and I think that's why she
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.660
him out of it and I think that's why she
looks so calm there and also so very sad

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670
looks so calm there and also so very sad
 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.370
looks so calm there and also so very sad
because she does know what he's going

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380
because she does know what he's going
 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.220
because she does know what he's going
through because this is a very different

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
through because this is a very different
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.270
through because this is a very different
kind of loss for him but again they seem

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280
kind of loss for him but again they seem
 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.560
kind of loss for him but again they seem
to have sort of this connection this

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570
to have sort of this connection this
 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.530
to have sort of this connection this
kinship uh so that's one story going on

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540
kinship uh so that's one story going on
 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.270
kinship uh so that's one story going on
they have which they do very well I

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280
they have which they do very well I
 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.180
they have which they do very well I
think the capture the frustration of the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190
think the capture the frustration of the
 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.090
think the capture the frustration of the
surge the frustration of being lost the

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100
surge the frustration of being lost the
 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.830
surge the frustration of being lost the
frustration of having something that you

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840

really capture that while also

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090
really capture that while also
 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.150
really capture that while also
connecting it to a living being which

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
connecting it to a living being which
 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.590
connecting it to a living being which
makes it even worse so they can't find

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600
makes it even worse so they can't find
