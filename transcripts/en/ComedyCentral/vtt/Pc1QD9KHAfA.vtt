00:00:02.573 --> 00:00:04.670
- And then I wore a condom,
which you should always do,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.238
but a condom is just a
choke hold for your boner.

00:00:07.238 --> 00:00:10.738
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:25.599
- Welcome to This Is
Not Happening Presents

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:26.432
One Crazy Night.

00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:28.681
So this is what we do,
we're a bunch of comedians,

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:30.675
tell stories about a similar subject.

00:00:30.675 --> 00:00:31.508
So, this is just one crazy night.

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:34.546
Give it up for Mr. Kyle Kinane, everybody.

00:00:34.546 --> 00:00:37.546
(audience applause)

00:00:41.662 --> 00:00:43.542
- How's it going?

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:46.174
Sorry there's no naked ladies here.

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:49.622
But a bunch of dudes that look like me.

00:00:49.622 --> 00:00:51.955
What a suitable replacement.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.871
I'll just let you into my life,

00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:59.378
so you know my point of view on things.

00:00:59.378 --> 00:01:01.711
Yesterday, I picked my nose,

00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:05.996
and then I didn't want
to wipe it on my couch,

00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:09.617
but I was too lazy to
get up and get a kleenex,

00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:10.898
so I put it back in my nose.

00:01:10.898 --> 00:01:13.898
(audience laughter)

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.862
So now that you know that about me,

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:25.738
let's get into some current events.

00:01:25.738 --> 00:01:29.905
Two weeks ago during sex, a
woman sighed into my face.

00:01:32.274 --> 00:01:36.106
In my face, just went "uck," to my face,

00:01:36.106 --> 00:01:38.025
during sex, not before like,

00:01:38.025 --> 00:01:39.914
"uck I guess we're gonna do this,"

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:42.129
not after like, "uck that happened,"

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:43.497
in the middle.

00:01:43.497 --> 00:01:45.090
Two thumbs down to the movie

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.458
before she finished watching it.

00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:50.988
"Uck." You can't do
that to somebody's face,

00:01:50.988 --> 00:01:52.488
during sex. "Uck."

00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:58.310
Listen, you don't have to fake an orgasm,

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.166
but don't act like I
wrote you a parking ticket

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:03.603
in the middle of it, alright?

00:02:03.603 --> 00:02:07.630
If you want me to retain my enthusiasm.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.546
It's like three in the morning you know,

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.966
there was booze and then there
was some hash on top of that.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.255
And then I wore a condom,
which you should always do,

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:18.327
but a condom is just a
choke hold for your boner.

00:02:18.327 --> 00:02:19.577
That's all it is.

00:02:19.577 --> 00:02:21.496
A condom at three in the
morning is just like,

00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:24.414
you go to sleep, you
go to sleep right now.

00:02:24.414 --> 00:02:25.747
You go to sleep.

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.678
There's going to be some
al dente moments, you know.

00:02:30.678 --> 00:02:33.678
(audience laughter)

00:02:35.174 --> 00:02:37.774
So, it's like yeah, okay.

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:39.822
But you don't have to act like it's that,

00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:41.709
yeah I'm gonna thumb this
idiot for the next 20 minutes.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.085
By the way, your meter ran out so that's.

00:02:44.085 --> 00:02:47.013
(audience laughter)

00:02:47.013 --> 00:02:49.096
That was a Tuesday night.

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:55.108
Wednesday, I went and got
some Japanese noodles,

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.342
which is already a dumb look,

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.741
noodles going into this stupid face.

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:01.876
This look, can we be
done with this already?

00:03:01.876 --> 00:03:03.765
This stupid look for guys.

00:03:03.765 --> 00:03:04.861
This isn't a fetish.

00:03:04.861 --> 00:03:07.357
How can we keep every
comedian on this show so far,

00:03:07.357 --> 00:03:08.860
like women like this, yeah,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.261
women wanna be reminded
of their dad's friend

00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:14.285
that used to show up in the early 80s,

00:03:14.285 --> 00:03:16.596
that he only knew briefly during 'nam.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:17.885
He's come over to the house

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.740
and he'd stare at me a little too long.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.492
But it wasn't sexual, you could tell,

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:24.173
because I reminded him of
the girl he couldn't save

00:03:24.173 --> 00:03:25.896
from the village he was
ordered to burn down.

00:03:25.896 --> 00:03:29.640
(audience laughter)

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.472
It's a dumb look, it's stupid.

00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:34.272
(audience laughter)

00:03:34.272 --> 00:03:37.704
All this is. This is like when
girls use the big waistband

00:03:37.704 --> 00:03:38.735
to hide their bellies.

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:42.902
This is just guys hiding fat
chins, that's all this is.

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:46.241
So, there's noodles hanging out of this,

00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:48.192
just in pajama bottoms,

00:03:48.192 --> 00:03:51.055
looking out the window
just wondering about

00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:53.215
like how can I improve?

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:55.352
(audience laughter)

00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:58.352
Maybe not take the dead man's
elbow three minutes into it.

00:03:58.352 --> 00:03:59.352
Just oh god.

00:04:02.136 --> 00:04:05.136
That's the giveaway, the death roll.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.389
We're crumbling, the tent's falling,

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:09.972
the tent's falling.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:12.969
What if I just lay on you and wiggle?

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.559
(audience laughter)

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:20.571
So, I'm having noodles, and
I'm looking out the window.

00:04:20.571 --> 00:04:21.685
There's just like whatever,

00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:23.916
some shitty Depeche Mode soundtrack

00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:26.249
on the 80s XM thing playing.

00:04:27.715 --> 00:04:31.058
And then a car ran into the building,

00:04:31.058 --> 00:04:32.778
next to where I was sitting,

00:04:32.778 --> 00:04:35.342
just right next, 10 feet away,

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:38.102
went over the sidewalk into the building,

00:04:38.102 --> 00:04:41.574
that was it, just crash-o right there.

00:04:41.574 --> 00:04:44.134
10 feet over me, in the window,

00:04:44.134 --> 00:04:46.717
noodles, Depeche Mode, pajamas.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.326
And that was almost the end,

00:04:50.326 --> 00:04:52.510
that could of been the end.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.574
You wanna think that your last
moment is going to be epic.

00:04:55.574 --> 00:04:57.678
It's going to be your
life flashing before you,

00:04:57.678 --> 00:04:58.511
and you're going to be like,

00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:00.113
there's every beautiful
moment and loved one.

00:05:00.113 --> 00:05:01.455
Or shit, what if it's regrets?

00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:02.984
That's everything I did wrong.

00:05:02.984 --> 00:05:05.183
But the end of your
life might just be that,

00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:07.190
noodles, Depeche Mode, car,

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.326
and you just going, fucking seriously?

00:05:09.326 --> 00:05:10.361
And you're dead.

00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:12.511
Like that could be the end of it all.

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:15.456
And that's the most unpoetic
thing that could have happened,

00:05:15.456 --> 00:05:16.655
on top of "uck."

00:05:16.655 --> 00:05:19.343
And that kills me to know that.

00:05:19.343 --> 00:05:21.527
Because you realize that especially now,

00:05:21.527 --> 00:05:22.391
in this day and age,

00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:24.422
you're going to have a
soundtrack to your death.

00:05:24.422 --> 00:05:26.409
Everybody's going to walk around,

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:27.297
you got your headphones in.

00:05:27.297 --> 00:05:28.488
Everybody's listening to something,

00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:29.523
or this and that.

00:05:29.523 --> 00:05:30.980
You're going to have a
soundtrack to your death.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.817
It's not going to be a good soundtrack,

00:05:32.817 --> 00:05:34.649
because you don't listen to the good shit

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:36.563
that you hope people would judge you on,

00:05:36.563 --> 00:05:38.304
when it's just jammed in your ears.

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:41.969
No, just Prince's 1999 on
repeat while you're at the bank,

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:45.257
boop boop boop boop,
because you don't care.

00:05:45.257 --> 00:05:46.408
And that's how you're going to die.

00:05:46.408 --> 00:05:49.728
I drove through a gang
shoot-out in East LA,

00:05:49.728 --> 00:05:52.507
listening to the Go-Go's
greatest hits in my car.

00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:55.617
That's how I almost
perished once on this earth.

00:05:55.617 --> 00:05:58.001
I pulled up, it was eight years ago,

00:05:58.001 --> 00:05:58.968
it wasn't so great.

00:05:58.968 --> 00:06:00.856
Pull off Avenue 52 there.

00:06:00.856 --> 00:06:02.722
And I pull off, just singing Vacation,

00:06:02.722 --> 00:06:05.642
that one's my favorite, I
like Vacation personally.

00:06:05.642 --> 00:06:07.808
So I pull off, Vacation's playing,

00:06:07.808 --> 00:06:09.321
and in the bushes right by the exit,

00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:10.161
there's somebody,

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.848
some roustabout tussling there.

00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:14.121
Some rapscallion.

00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:17.708
I like to refer to gang members
as old timey villain terms,

00:06:17.708 --> 00:06:20.497
it kind of makes the whole
thing a little bit easier

00:06:20.497 --> 00:06:21.752
to pallette, you know.

00:06:21.752 --> 00:06:24.696
So this rapscallion's
just tussling about here.

00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:25.922
I'm like what's he doing over here?

00:06:25.922 --> 00:06:28.505
Little ne'er-do-well, this guy.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:31.503
I just continue singing Vacation.

00:06:31.503 --> 00:06:32.722
I get about a block and a half down,

00:06:32.722 --> 00:06:35.250
through the chorus, you know.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.110
And then there's another
young Latino youth.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.110
(audience laughter)

00:06:43.262 --> 00:06:45.492
And he's crambling behind a van.

00:06:45.492 --> 00:06:46.977
Now crambling's not a word.

00:06:46.977 --> 00:06:49.617
(audience laughter)

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:50.857
But I think if I say it enough,

00:06:50.857 --> 00:06:52.241
people will start, you know, crambling,

00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:54.972
it's like something Willie
Nelson would've made up.

00:06:54.972 --> 00:06:56.641
How's that tour back in '72?

00:06:56.641 --> 00:06:58.606
Oh we were just crambling
through West Texas,

00:06:58.606 --> 00:07:00.790
you know me and Waylon

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.235
just crambling on the
back of the bus there man.

00:07:03.235 --> 00:07:04.818
So, he's crambling,

00:07:05.723 --> 00:07:09.204
and he's holding what I
believe to be a microscope.

00:07:09.204 --> 00:07:13.049
Because that's how much
I know about firearms.

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:15.767
I just saw something metallic and tubular,

00:07:15.767 --> 00:07:18.143
and I was like what's this
midnight scientist up to,

00:07:18.143 --> 00:07:18.976
over here?

00:07:20.127 --> 00:07:21.816
This guy's getting that school work done,

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:22.994
burning the midnight oil.

00:07:22.994 --> 00:07:24.480
You get that scholarship.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.488
You get out of these surroundings,

00:07:25.488 --> 00:07:28.056
you get that scholarship.

00:07:28.056 --> 00:07:31.176
Oh no, it's a pistol, and they
were shooting at each other.

00:07:31.176 --> 00:07:32.584
And that's what I just drove through

00:07:32.584 --> 00:07:34.408
singing Belinda Carlisle hits.

00:07:34.408 --> 00:07:37.408
(audience laughter)

00:07:39.729 --> 00:07:40.944
And that could just be it.

00:07:40.944 --> 00:07:42.969
That could be the end of your life.

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:45.219
Vacation all I ever wanted.

00:07:46.081 --> 00:07:48.914
Vacation there's a guy with a gun.

00:07:51.817 --> 00:07:53.835
And that was the end.

00:07:53.835 --> 00:07:54.895
That was my messed up week.

00:07:54.895 --> 00:07:56.207
So that's it. Thanks for listening.

00:07:56.207 --> 00:07:57.047
(audience applause)

00:07:57.047 --> 00:08:00.547
(upbeat electronic music)

00:08:03.694 --> 00:08:05.358
- Hey, wasn't that an amazing story?

00:08:05.358 --> 00:08:07.830
If you liked it, why don't
you click like over there?

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.174
So other people know about it,

00:08:09.174 --> 00:08:10.494
and then also leave a comment,

00:08:10.494 --> 00:08:12.286
so you can get in a whole
flame war with people

00:08:12.286 --> 00:08:14.414
and start a fight with
people you don't even know,

00:08:14.414 --> 00:08:15.287
and then subscribe,

00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:16.886
so you get next week's This
Is Not Happening story,

00:08:16.886 --> 00:08:18.258
as soon as it comes out.

00:08:18.258 --> 00:08:20.678
This Is Not Happening.
This Is Not Happening.

00:08:20.678 --> 00:08:22.845
(grumble)
