is where we start running into some
issues here right some of you that heard

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500
issues here right some of you that heard
 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.199
issues here right some of you that heard
my talk before have seen this slide

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209
my talk before have seen this slide
 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.110
my talk before have seen this slide
before right so to be honest I think we

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120
before right so to be honest I think we
 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.310
before right so to be honest I think we
have the sort of a chicken and egg

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320
have the sort of a chicken and egg
 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.410
have the sort of a chicken and egg
problem right right now users can't do

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420
problem right right now users can't do
 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.349
problem right right now users can't do
that much with

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359
that much with
 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.349
that much with
web archives and so on and on the flip

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
web archives and so on and on the flip
 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.270
web archives and so on and on the flip
side sort of the egg side it's hard to

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280
side sort of the egg side it's hard to
 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.689
side sort of the egg side it's hard to
develop tools for non-existent users all

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:26.699
develop tools for non-existent users all
 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:27.770
develop tools for non-existent users all
right because there are no users you can

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780
right because there are no users you can
 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.570
right because there are no users you can
develop tools and you know you can't you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
develop tools and you know you can't you
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.490
develop tools and you know you can't you
can't get around this right so I've been

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500
can't get around this right so I've been
 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.110
can't get around this right so I've been
advocating and this is slide some of you

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120
advocating and this is slide some of you
 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.760
advocating and this is slide some of you
probably seen before it that what we

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770
probably seen before it that what we
 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.040
probably seen before it that what we
really need is these deep collaborations

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050
really need is these deep collaborations
 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.149
really need is these deep collaborations
between users archivists historians

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159
between users archivists historians
 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.300
between users archivists historians
usual humanists etc librarians and tool

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310
usual humanists etc librarians and tool
 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.830
usual humanists etc librarians and tool
builders like myself computer geeks

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840
builders like myself computer geeks
 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.230

essentially right so we need to develop

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240
essentially right so we need to develop
 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.089
essentially right so we need to develop
tools that support exploration and

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099
tools that support exploration and
 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.749
tools that support exploration and
discovery in web archives and so what

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759
discovery in web archives and so what
 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.450
discovery in web archives and so what
what's happened is and going beyond

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460
what's happened is and going beyond
 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.519
what's happened is and going beyond
browsing going beyond searching right so

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:58.529
browsing going beyond searching right so
 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.830
browsing going beyond searching right so
what's happened is I basically taken my

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840
what's happened is I basically taken my
 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.080
what's happened is I basically taken my
own advice right so I met yen this is

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090
own advice right so I met yen this is
 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.719
own advice right so I met yen this is
his slow smiling face about a year ago

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:05.729
his slow smiling face about a year ago
 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.490
his slow smiling face about a year ago
and we've been engaged in an

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500
and we've been engaged in an
 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.260
and we've been engaged in an
increasingly intensive collaboration

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270
increasingly intensive collaboration
 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.480
increasingly intensive collaboration
essentially him on the user side and me

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490
essentially him on the user side and me
 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.580
essentially him on the user side and me
on the tool builders side right so I'm

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590
on the tool builders side right so I'm
 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.050
on the tool builders side right so I'm
going to start here by telling you a

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060
going to start here by telling you a
 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.429
going to start here by telling you a
little bit about the tool side and I'll

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:16.439
little bit about the tool side and I'll
 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:18.950
little bit about the tool side and I'll
switch over and he'll talk a little bit

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960
switch over and he'll talk a little bit
 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.809
switch over and he'll talk a little bit
about the user side right so from the

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819
about the user side right so from the
 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.459
about the user side right so from the
technical perspective the questions that

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:22.469
technical perspective the questions that
 

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:24.740
technical perspective the questions that
we've been asking ourselves is you know

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750
we've been asking ourselves is you know
 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.390
we've been asking ourselves is you know
what would a modern web are you plot

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400
what would a modern web are you plot
 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.909
what would a modern web are you plot
what our web archiving platform built on

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919
what our web archiving platform built on
 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.399
what our web archiving platform built on
big data infrastructure look like right

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409
big data infrastructure look like right
 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:32.809
big data infrastructure look like right
so before we get to that you have to

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:32.819
so before we get to that you have to
 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:34.219
so before we get to that you have to
think about you know what are sort of

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229
think about you know what are sort of
 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.079
think about you know what are sort of
the criteria what are the desiderata

00:05:36.079 --> 00:05:36.089
the criteria what are the desiderata
 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:38.629
the criteria what are the desiderata
that you need right so you got to store

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639
that you need right so you got to store
 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.490
that you need right so you got to store
the data all right you got to have

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500
the data all right you got to have
 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.959
the data all right you got to have
efficient random access because you want

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:41.969
efficient random access because you want
 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.570
efficient random access because you want
to pull down records you want to have

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580
to pull down records you want to have
 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.100
to pull down records you want to have
scalable analytics and scalable

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110
scalable analytics and scalable
 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.869
scalable analytics and scalable
processing and then finally you're going

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:47.879
processing and then finally you're going
 

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.159
processing and then finally you're going
to have derive data then you want to

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:49.169
to have derive data then you want to
 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.559
to have derive data then you want to
store and access somehow right so how we

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:51.569
store and access somehow right so how we
 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.480
store and access somehow right so how we
currently do that you doing this right

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490
currently do that you doing this right
 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.510
currently do that you doing this right
so Internet Archive has a pita box

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520
so Internet Archive has a pita box
 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.050
so Internet Archive has a pita box
architecture and most organizations

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060
architecture and most organizations
 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.029
architecture and most organizations
today are still using sans network

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039
today are still using sans network
 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.339
today are still using sans network
attached storage so relatively expensive

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:04.349
attached storage so relatively expensive
 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.309
attached storage so relatively expensive
sword solutions right in terms of

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319
sword solutions right in terms of
 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.170
sword solutions right in terms of
efficient random access you have the

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180
efficient random access you have the
 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.540
efficient random access you have the
open wayback machine but it's sort of

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550
open wayback machine but it's sort of
 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.829
open wayback machine but it's sort of
showing its age you know it's a

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:12.839
showing its age you know it's a
 

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.129
showing its age you know it's a
monolithic monolithically integrated

monolithic monolithically integrated
tomcat application and you know we'd

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789
tomcat application and you know we'd
 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:19.309
tomcat application and you know we'd
like to move something that's more

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:19.319
like to move something that's more
 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:21.019
like to move something that's more
loosely decouple and service-oriented

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029
loosely decouple and service-oriented
 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:23.329
loosely decouple and service-oriented
and in keeping the architecture of the

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:23.339
and in keeping the architecture of the
 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:25.990
and in keeping the architecture of the
times right in terms of scalable

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000
times right in terms of scalable
 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.680
times right in terms of scalable
processing analytics we're actually

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:27.690
processing analytics we're actually
 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:28.390
processing analytics we're actually
doing quite well

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400
doing quite well
 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.370
doing quite well
and our work built on a lot of this

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380
and our work built on a lot of this
 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.110
and our work built on a lot of this
there's been lots of work by the

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120
there's been lots of work by the
 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.300
there's been lots of work by the
internet archive and the common crawl

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:34.310
internet archive and the common crawl
 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.050
internet archive and the common crawl
about using Hadoop for a scalable

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060
about using Hadoop for a scalable
 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.550
about using Hadoop for a scalable
analytics and that that's really a good

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560
analytics and that that's really a good
 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.230
analytics and that that's really a good
thing and then the final the fourth

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240
thing and then the final the fourth
 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.320
thing and then the final the fourth
point is this derived data it's so far

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:44.330
point is this derived data it's so far
 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.740
point is this derived data it's so far
we've been using ad hoc storage and wet

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750
we've been using ad hoc storage and wet
 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.870
we've been using ad hoc storage and wet
files which i think is a ad hoc and

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880
files which i think is a ad hoc and
 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.240
files which i think is a ad hoc and
temporary solution and it still has its

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250
temporary solution and it still has its
 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.150
temporary solution and it still has its
sort of rewards right so the way I look

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160
sort of rewards right so the way I look
 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.680
sort of rewards right so the way I look
at it you know the existing tools aren't

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:56.690
at it you know the existing tools aren't
 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.200
at it you know the existing tools aren't
aren't adequate and so what do we need

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210
aren't adequate and so what do we need
 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.600
aren't adequate and so what do we need
well to me I think the solution is a

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610
well to me I think the solution is a
 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.689
well to me I think the solution is a
combination of Hadoop and HBase and so

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699
combination of Hadoop and HBase and so
 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.070
combination of Hadoop and HBase and so
I'll run through these technologies very

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080
I'll run through these technologies very
 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.779
I'll run through these technologies very
quickly but basically what we want to do

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:07.789
quickly but basically what we want to do
 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:10.090
quickly but basically what we want to do
is we want to use a HDFS the Hadoop

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.100
is we want to use a HDFS the Hadoop
 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.219
is we want to use a HDFS the Hadoop
distributed file system for storage we

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229
distributed file system for storage we
 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:14.680
distributed file system for storage we
want to use a Hadoop for the analytics

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690
want to use a Hadoop for the analytics
 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.230
want to use a Hadoop for the analytics
and processing we want to use each base

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240
and processing we want to use each base
 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.719
and processing we want to use each base
for efficient random access and also

00:07:19.719 --> 00:07:19.729
for efficient random access and also
 

00:07:19.729 --> 00:07:22.060
for efficient random access and also
keeping track of the derived data and

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:22.070
keeping track of the derived data and
 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.150
keeping track of the derived data and
providing access to it right so let me

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.160
providing access to it right so let me
 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.200
providing access to it right so let me
run through the technologies very

00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:03.079
historical scholarship if we essentially
 

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.420
historical scholarship if we essentially
broaden the ability for people to get

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:05.430
broaden the ability for people to get
 

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.460
broaden the ability for people to get
access to historians and other humanists

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.470
access to historians and other humanists
 

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.230
access to historians and other humanists
and social scientists to get access to

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240
and social scientists to get access to
 

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.119
and social scientists to get access to
these technologies right so we're

00:11:11.119 --> 00:11:11.129
these technologies right so we're
 

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:12.650
these technologies right so we're
measuring a processes like this where i

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660
measuring a processes like this where i
 

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.509
measuring a processes like this where i
can start off with visual graph analysis

00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519
can start off with visual graph analysis
 

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.670
can start off with visual graph analysis
on the longitudinal data you select

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680
on the longitudinal data you select
 

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.040
on the longitudinal data you select
subsets for the examination and then you

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:19.050
subsets for the examination and then you
 

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.040
subsets for the examination and then you
drill down examine individual pages and

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:22.050
drill down examine individual pages and
 

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.689
drill down examine individual pages and
then you go from distant reading to

00:11:23.689 --> 00:11:23.699
then you go from distant reading to
 

00:11:23.699 --> 00:11:25.460
then you go from distant reading to
close reading right and you can do it

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:25.470
close reading right and you can do it
 

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:29.150
close reading right and you can do it
all from your desktop or laptop right

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:29.160
all from your desktop or laptop right
 

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.139
all from your desktop or laptop right
okay and then as a final bonus we've

00:11:33.139 --> 00:11:33.149
okay and then as a final bonus we've
 

00:11:33.149 --> 00:11:35.420
okay and then as a final bonus we've
gone to work based to run on this does

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:35.430
gone to work based to run on this does
 

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.970

anybody recognize what this is this is a
 

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.340
anybody recognize what this is this is a
this is a Raspberry Pi right so this is

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:40.350
this is a Raspberry Pi right so this is
 

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.309
this is a Raspberry Pi right so this is
a we've gotten it to run here and this

00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:43.319
a we've gotten it to run here and this
 

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:46.400

is a computer the size of a credit card

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:46.410

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:50.030
is a computer the size of a credit card
and it's about the price of three

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040
and it's about the price of three
 

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.480

cocktails here in Manhattan all right

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:53.490
cocktails here in Manhattan all right
 

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:55.699
cocktails here in Manhattan all right
and so why is this the big what why is

00:11:55.699 --> 00:11:55.709
and so why is this the big what why is
 

00:11:55.709 --> 00:11:58.999
and so why is this the big what why is
this a big deal so what this allows you

00:11:58.999 --> 00:11:59.009
this a big deal so what this allows you
 

00:11:59.009 --> 00:12:01.519
this a big deal so what this allows you
to do is score every page that you ever

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:01.529
to do is score every page that you ever
 

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:04.400
to do is score every page that you ever
visited in your pocket right so think of

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:04.410

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:57.500
that's a user's around and to drive it
 

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:59.430
that's a user's around and to drive it
from you know what are their substantive

00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440
from you know what are their substantive
 

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.960
from you know what are their substantive
scholarly interesting questions that can

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:01.970
scholarly interesting questions that can
 

00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:04.060
scholarly interesting questions that can
be answered from this and so I think

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:04.070
be answered from this and so I think
 

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.830
be answered from this and so I think
that's sort of a key component that I

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840
that's sort of a key component that I
 

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.280
that's sort of a key component that I
see that's missing from from some some

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:09.290
see that's missing from from some some
 

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:11.600
see that's missing from from some some
of the efforts

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:11.610
 

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:14.870
I have a question um this is the

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:14.880
I have a question um this is the
 

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:16.370
I have a question um this is the
question I started already know the

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:16.380
question I started already know the
 

00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:17.960
question I started already know the
answer to and it's maybe more directed

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:17.970
answer to and it's maybe more directed
 

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.630
answer to and it's maybe more directed
towards Ian but I think it would be some

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640
towards Ian but I think it would be some
 

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.070
towards Ian but I think it would be some
good added context is sort of what

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080
good added context is sort of what
 

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.600
good added context is sort of what
institutional challenges you may have

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:26.610
institutional challenges you may have
 

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:30.140
institutional challenges you may have
encountered in this project and I think

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:30.150
encountered in this project and I think
 

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.230
encountered in this project and I think
it's something that you know we have

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240
it's something that you know we have
 

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.390
it's something that you know we have
dealt with it i am in mark of it and

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400
dealt with it i am in mark of it and
 

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:36.770
dealt with it i am in mark of it and
that you've probably dealt with from the

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:36.780
that you've probably dealt with from the
 

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.669
that you've probably dealt with from the
user side but speaking to sort of i

00:27:40.669 --> 00:27:40.679
user side but speaking to sort of i
 

00:27:40.679 --> 00:27:41.960
user side but speaking to sort of i
don't know that a lot of institutions

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:41.970
don't know that a lot of institutions

long time it took you know took like

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:24.750
long time it took you know took like
 

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.270
long time it took you know took like
four months really to get everybody

adverse it was going up probably higher

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:29.970
adverse it was going up probably higher
 

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:31.820
adverse it was going up probably higher
than it necessarily needed to and it

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:31.830
than it necessarily needed to and it
 

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.140

some work with a wide web scrape so the

some work with a wide web scrape so the
biases are there they're clued the data

they finally traced it down retired

really need work base but then it was
just a few minutes later and you had it

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:45.530
just a few minutes later and you had it
 

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.980
just a few minutes later and you had it
running on a Raspberry Pi and then I

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:47.990
running on a Raspberry Pi and then I
 

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.970

gigabyte size collections and so I
 

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.480

wonder what why do that right why bring

those tools to bear on even the small

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:06.500
those tools to bear on even the small
 

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.310
those tools to bear on even the small
problems okay so some running out of

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320
problems okay so some running out of
 

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.750

how we're going to do this and then take
a look out at what we have archive is so

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:54.310
a look out at what we have archive is so
 

00:36:54.310 --> 00:37:03.240
a look out at what we have archive is so
far in in in the terms of size I believe

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:03.250
far in in in the terms of size I believe
 

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:05.910
far in in in the terms of size I believe
we have archival lots of things but many

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920
we have archival lots of things but many
 

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:08.550
we have archival lots of things but many
studies have shown that up to you now

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560

the web we have archive is far from

you can see most of the websites
probably have their front page archive

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:21.940
probably have their front page archive

deeper than that well you're out of luck
so is there a way that we can archive

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:31.330
so is there a way that we can archive
 

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:41.850
so is there a way that we can archive
the the web more deeply and then the

00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:41.860
the the web more deeply and then the
 

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:43.770
the the web more deeply and then the
current status of the web archiving is

00:37:43.770 --> 00:37:43.780
current status of the web archiving is
 

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:46.950
current status of the web archiving is
closely related on how we archive it the

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960
closely related on how we archive it the
 

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.380
closely related on how we archive it the
survey also shows that the predominant

web is the crawler based archiving which

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:54.490
web is the crawler based archiving which
 

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:58.340
web is the crawler based archiving which
we set off the web crawler to go out and

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:58.350
we set off the web crawler to go out and
 

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.640
we set off the web crawler to go out and
from the seeds traverse the links and

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:01.650
from the seeds traverse the links and
 

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:05.100
from the seeds traverse the links and
archive with the crawler sees we already

things might be different from what we

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:15.040
see
people and so we don't necessarily got a

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:15.050
people and so we don't necessarily got a
 

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:18.730
people and so we don't necessarily got a
full picture of through the archive so

00:38:18.730 --> 00:38:18.740
full picture of through the archive so
 

00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:21.400
full picture of through the archive so
there are many other approaches to

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:21.410
there are many other approaches to
 

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.710
there are many other approaches to
archive the water at the web why are

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720
archive the water at the web why are
 

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.710
archive the water at the web why are
those approaches well more widely used

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720
those approaches well more widely used
 

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.170
those approaches well more widely used
so that's the other questions I'm trying

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:32.180
so that's the other questions I'm trying
 

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:34.690
so that's the other questions I'm trying
to solve through this little project and

00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:34.700
to solve through this little project and
 

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.020
to solve through this little project and
the fourth aspect I want people to think

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:38.030
the fourth aspect I want people to think
 

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.990
the fourth aspect I want people to think
about is the value proposition why we're

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:41.000
about is the value proposition why we're
 

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.580
about is the value proposition why we're
archiving the web so the survey also

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:45.590
archiving the web so the survey also
 

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:47.980
archiving the web so the survey also
shows the predominant value proposition

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:47.990
shows the predominant value proposition
 

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:50.290
shows the predominant value proposition
is the so-called comprehensive public

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:50.300
is the so-called comprehensive public
 

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.740
is the so-called comprehensive public
good we archive the web to preserve the

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:53.750
good we archive the web to preserve the
 

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:57.130
good we archive the web to preserve the
history and we collect those data for

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:57.140
history and we collect those data for
 

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:02.040
history and we collect those data for
later research notes can be useful but

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:02.050
 

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:07.210
as any comprehensive public goods

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:07.220
as any comprehensive public goods
 

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:11.109
as any comprehensive public goods
project indicates there are many

00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119
project indicates there are many
 

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:13.000
project indicates there are many
problems of this type of value

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.010
problems of this type of value
 

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:15.010
problems of this type of value
proposition we've got loads of free

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:15.020

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:43.820
little project tries to break into so we
 

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.420
little project tries to break into so we
want to expand the value proposition we

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:46.430
want to expand the value proposition we

similar problem with Stanford but it

00:59:14.799 --> 00:59:14.809
similar problem with Stanford but it
 

00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:16.809
similar problem with Stanford but it
doesn't really help archiving because it

00:59:16.809 --> 00:59:16.819
doesn't really help archiving because it
 

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:18.959
doesn't really help archiving because it
doesn't get the content out of the

about what to do with the archive so I I

01:00:05.499 --> 01:00:05.509
about what to do with the archive so I I
 

01:00:05.509 --> 01:00:09.929
about what to do with the archive so I I

caused the down in the first place so

01:00:17.679 --> 01:00:17.689
caused the down in the first place so
 

01:00:17.689 --> 01:00:21.189

so you could hand it over and load it up

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:39.220
so you could hand it over and load it up
 

01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:41.609
so you could hand it over and load it up
in another archive so it's really

01:01:41.609 --> 01:01:41.619
in another archive so it's really
 

01:01:41.619 --> 01:01:44.910
in another archive so it's really
capture tool you capture at the source

01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:44.920

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:57.250
capture tool you capture at the source
you can archive elsewhere and another

01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:00.220
no no I think it's a misinterpretation

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:00.230
no no I think it's a misinterpretation
 

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:04.060
no no I think it's a misinterpretation
this is about completely capturing the

01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:04.070
this is about completely capturing the
 

01:02:04.070 --> 01:02:07.000
this is about completely capturing the
history of certain server which you can

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:07.010
history of certain server which you can
 

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:09.970
history of certain server which you can
ever do using web crawling approaches so

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:09.980
ever do using web crawling approaches so
 

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:11.710
ever do using web crawling approaches so
it's just another paradigm to capture

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:11.720
it's just another paradigm to capture
