00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.979
If i swallow a watermelon seed a new watermelon
will grow in my stomach, right?

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:05.330
Everyone knows that!

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.350
Good thing we have seedless watermelons!

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:19.260
Wait … if there’s no seeds, how do we
make more of them?

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.530
These days, you see WAY more seedless fruits
than seeded.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.780
Seedless grapes, watermelons, oranges, come
to mind, but natural bananas have seeds, so

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.039
do cucumbers!

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.850
Fruit is, by nature, a matured ovary around
a seed, the flesh of a watermelon or apple

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.410
is part of that ovary!

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.640
So if it's not "natural," then what is seedless
fruit?

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.680
Seedless plants have been around for millennia.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.300
Some strains of grapes were documented in
ancient Roman times that didn't produce seeds.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.660
And in 1872, seedless navel oranges were brought
to the US from Brazil.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.230
They were sourced from a "clump of freak orange
trees" according to a New York Times article

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.590
from 1902 and thanks to American farmers grow
everywhere today.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.770
FYI: seedless fruits are not genetically modified
-- no one is tweaking their DNA to add or

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.869
remove genes; instead, they're selecting traits
and breeding them naturally.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.990
In botany, breeding seedless fruit is called
parthenocarpy.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.300
Parthenocarpic fruit can occur naturally due
to mutations or problems with sperm and egg

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.810
fertilization or through specific hybrid breeding
-- mixing plants with more or fewer chromosomes

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.069
to get a sterile offspring.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.259
For example, bananas have an extra set of
chromosomes, called triploid -- it's sort

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.049
of like the fruit version of a mule -- it's
sterile.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.229
Seedless plants are cultivated by farmers
because consumers buy for convenience!

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.590
Nothing is more inconvenient than a seeded
grape, amirite?

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.239
The National Watermelon Promotion Board says
only 16 percent of watermelons sold have seeds!

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:52.299
But if the seed of a plant is how that plant
reproduces, how do we perpetuate a seedless

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.299
plant?

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:54.709
There's no SEED TO PLANT!

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.840
But farmers know the answer to this one … through
grafting.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.109
Farmers and agribusinesses spend lots of capital
to produce what they believe is the best fruit

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:04.789
for modern life.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.979
Watermelon with thick rinds survive shipping
and no seeds sell better; so why let nature

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.900
mess those perks up by allowing them to naturally
breed?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.459
Instead, they'll reproduce that seedless plant
variety.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.000
This is has been done since antiquity.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.090
If a branch is sliced from a seedless tree
it could (eventually) grow a whole new seedless

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.090
plant.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.659
To increase the chances, farmers today use
"rooting hormone;" a broad term for an antibacterial

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.849
agent which can be made at home from willow
bark, honey, or a chemical called auxin -- which

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.769
is naturally produced by plant roots!

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.879
In fact, most of the fruit we eat in the U.S.
today comes from cuttings; because it's an

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:50.099
easy way to propagate a single high-yield
fruit tree into an orchard of high-yield trees

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.540
-- especially when they don't have seeds to
grow their own offspring.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.019
Farmers can also graft cuttings onto existing
trees -- making it possible to have say an

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.959
orange and lemon growing on the same plant;
again propagating without seeds.

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.959
There is an issue with this though, maybe
you've spotted it, if farmers plant whole

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.749
orchards of seedless, high-yield trees based
on the cuttings of an original tree they destroy

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.450
biodiversity.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.980
All the trees are clones of that original
seedless mutant!

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.620
If a disease strikes the plant, like in the
case of the banana in the 1970s, or the cacao

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.389
problems in South America.

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.170
Seedless plants are so genetically similar,
they're often struck by the same diseases

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.770
-- making it spread quickly.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.290
Biodiversity is what keeps lineages of plants
alive when drought, blight, or disease strikes;

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:46.709
some varieties die, but the species survives.

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.909
Seeds help propagate biodiversity and as an
added bonus they're often super nutritious!

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:57.359
Heirloom plants may not look like fruits in
the ads; they have a variety of colors, sizes

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:03.219
and shapes; but some stand up better to disease
and some don't; some have BETTER flavors,

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.719
and some don't.

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:09.400
As a consumer, we have to use our best judgment,
and buy not for the sake of seed, but for

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:34.699
what we really want 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.819
in our foods.
