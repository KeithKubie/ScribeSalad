ANANT SHUKLA: Hello, everyone.

00:00:02.132 --> 00:00:03.590
Thank you all for
being here today.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.790
We have a bit of Bollywood
here in New York City.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.910
Today's-- yes, yes,
big round of applause.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.160
Today's guest requires
no introduction.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.610
He's an acclaimed actor,
director, singer-songwriter,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.990
producer, humanitarian,
global icon.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.160
After co-founding
Exile Entertainment,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.640
he made his directing
debut in 2001

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.830
with Dil Chahta Hai, which I'm
sure everyone here has watched.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.480
He has starred in classics,
such as "Rock On!!,"

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.850
"Zindagi Na Milegi
Dobara," "Dil Dhadakne Do,"

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.950
and most recently, "Wazir."

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.150
He was recognized with the
Filmfare Award for his best

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.700
actor performance
"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag."

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.292
But his accomplishments outside
of cinema are equally of note.

00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:52.750
He started the MARD campaign,
which he'll talk about today,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.340
to bring attention to the
important issue of gender

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.120
equality and violence against
women and girls in India.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.040
In 2014 he was selected as the
first male UN Women Goodwill

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.470
Ambassador for South
Asia, has been active

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.810
part of the HeForShe campaign.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.904
A true global icon, a
true global change maker,

00:01:09.904 --> 00:01:11.820
please give a warm
welcome, Mr. Farhan Akhtar.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.200
So Farhan, welcome to Google.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.658
FARHAN AKHTAR:
Thank you very much.

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:22.170
Hi, hello.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.634
ANANT SHUKLA: How does it feel?

00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:25.350
FARHAN AKHTAR: It feels good.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.391
ANANT SHUKLA: Feels good?

00:01:26.391 --> 00:01:27.430
Feels good.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.846
So we're going to talk a little
bit about your background,

00:01:29.846 --> 00:01:31.650
career, and how that
kind of shaped then

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.310
your creative
process, and then get

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.851
into a little bit
about MARD and some

00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:37.420
of the other social initiatives
that you're involved with.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.720
So you grew up in a
family that's always

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.950
been involved with Bollywood.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.740
So tell me about your
journey as an actor.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.250
Did you always know that
acting was in the cards?

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.295
Or what kind of drew you
then to the cinema industry?

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:50.670
FARHAN AKHTAR: I think from
pretty much from a young age,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.560
we have a basic idea of
where we'd like to end up,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.770
which world we'd
like to belong to.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.109
And I always fancied
entertaining people.

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.150
So whenever there were
guests over I would always

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.720
do things to make them
laugh, and so I'd just

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.220
get a certain degree of
attention, I guess, as a kid.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.040
So my parents pretty
much knew that he's

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.780
going to go into film
from that time onwards.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.740
And when you're watching
movies or you listen to music,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.280
you very rarely know what's
going on behind the scenes.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.180
Like now I've come to
this amazing office

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.670
that you all have, and you
see the amount of people

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.740
who put stuff together.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.721
When you're just
using something,

00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:31.970
it's just really what you see.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.560
You don't know what all
goes into the making of it.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.830
So you just know the actor.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.080
You know the singer.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.330
You don't know all the other
people behind the scenes,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.530
so you're automatically
drawn to wanting

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.820
to be that person, because that
represents the film for you.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.890
So on that level, yeah, I think
I always wanted to be in film.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.170
I always wanted to,
at that point I guess,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.511
be an actor, because I didn't
know what else you could do.

00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:56.260
But then, of course,
as you start working,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.727
you start realizing there's
many more things that

00:02:58.727 --> 00:03:00.560
put a film together,
and sometimes even more

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.060
important than just being the
face of the film, so to speak.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.372
And that's when the whole
acting-direction thing.

00:03:06.372 --> 00:03:08.080
ANANT SHUKLA: Yeah,
I've heard this story

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.580
about when you were in
college that you kind of went

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.210
on a binge Netflix, back
in the day with VHS,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.390
just watching movies.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.940
FARHAN AKHTAR: There
was no Netflix.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.900
There was no net.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.390
So you had to just
flick videocassettes

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.180
from other people.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.160
But yeah, whatever I
could get my hands on.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.860
My mom was a very avid collector
of movies, so that helped.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.590
So when she was awake
I'd watch the ones that

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.360
were rated good for me as a
kid, and after she'd fall asleep

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.210
I'd go into the
other drawer which

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.314
had all the adult films that I
couldn't access at that time.

00:03:43.314 --> 00:03:44.730
But yeah, I've
watched everything,

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.650
and I've watched them
over and over again.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.490
And I was just very
fascinated by it,

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.710
and I would just imitate
certain things of performances

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.865
that I liked.

00:03:54.865 --> 00:03:59.870
And I was very into the
whole gangster thing, films

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.560
like "Untouchables" or
then the "Godfather" films.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.682
De Niro doing the classic,
the American-Italian mobster.

00:04:06.682 --> 00:04:08.640
So I used to do that a
lot with all my friends,

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.020
like, "you talking to me?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.390
You talking to me?"

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.514
All that kind of stuff, and,
"you got nothing, nothing."

00:04:14.514 --> 00:04:15.680
I still love all that stuff.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.649
So yeah, just constantly
watching films.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.190
ANANT SHUKLA: So
then that transition

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.680
from director to actor.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.830
Obviously a change in mindset,
a change in technique.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.230
What was most difficult there?

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.210
Or did it naturally come from
so many years of just absorbing,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.427
watching your idols, mentoring?

00:04:30.427 --> 00:04:31.010
What kind of--

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.470
FARHAN AKHTAR: Yeah, I think so.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.310
Apart from, of course,
watching performances of actors

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.130
that you do appreciate
and respect,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.030
also working with them.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.440
I directed three films before
I started acting myself.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.250
So working closely
and, fortunately,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.670
with actors who really
know what they're doing.

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.566
So be it [INAUDIBLE], be it Mr.
[? Bachan ?] in [? "Luch," ?]

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:57.620
be it Shah Rukh in "Dawn."

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.835
So I worked with a huge--
with Priyanka, [? Pradeep ?].

00:05:00.835 --> 00:05:02.710
So when you're working
with all these people,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.335
you see how they
approach, and everyone

00:05:04.335 --> 00:05:06.160
comes with questions,
comes with research,

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.940
what it is that
they'd like to do,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.540
mannerisms that
they'd like to adopt.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.490
So it teaches you
as well about if you

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.450
were to do that job, what it
is you-- how you approach it,

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.800
and what you could be doing.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.855
So I felt pretty comfortable
with doing "Rock On!!"

00:05:19.855 --> 00:05:22.210
at the time, in 2008.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.370
Also, it was a world that
was very familiar to me.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.680
It was set in Mumbai.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.250
It was about music
that I enjoyed,

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.900
so I kind of slipped into
that film very easily.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.790
ANANT SHUKLA: Then
Excel kind of has

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.631
the motto of contemporary
Indian cinema,

00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:38.380
not your traditional
Bollywood love story.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.420
Your movies are all
a little different.

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.120
So what, for you, is
contemporary Indian cinema,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.487
and what are you aspiring
to then in your films?

00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:47.070
FARHAN AKHTAR: I
don't know if there's

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.180
a standard definition of
what that is, because it's

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.050
constantly evolving.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.636
It's constantly changing.

00:05:52.636 --> 00:05:54.260
And I think the
important thing, if you

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.310
want to meet
contemporary film, I

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.680
think is just to keep
your ear on the ground

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.384
and kind of get a sense
of what's going on.

00:06:01.384 --> 00:06:03.050
Every year there are
films that come out

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.250
that kind of
redefine storytelling

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.880
in the Indian film milieu.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.300
So it's just to keep
looking out for what's

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.960
changing, what people
are reacting to,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.590
and then try and find
stories or ideas that

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.440
could keep pushing
it in this direction

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.627
that story changing
is headed in.

00:06:21.627 --> 00:06:23.210
ANANT SHUKLA: That
kind of segues then

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.590
into your creative process.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.669
So for you then, how
do you sit down--

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.210
I know you've sometimes talked
about pegging onto a character

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.579
and then identifying and
building a story around that.

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:33.120
Is there a different
creative process

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.200
as an actor versus your role
as a producer versus a role

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.470
as a director, and
what for you allows

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.460
you to just sit down,
concentrate and then

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.000
envision the final product?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.940
FARHAN AKHTAR: If you
really think about it--

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:49.589
as a director, when anybody
asks you, what do you do?

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:51.380
You're actually not
really doing that much,

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:52.296
if you think about it.

00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:57.340
You hire, hopefully,
people who know their jobs,

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:00.407
and you're just telling
them yes and no to things

00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:01.615
that they're bringing to you.

00:07:01.615 --> 00:07:05.200
So it really is just
keeping an overview

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.850
of what you want the film to
feel like, and on some level,

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:15.000
being probably the first
audience to the movie.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.480
So it's like just
watching a scene play out

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.102
as you would on screen,
but just keeping in mind

00:07:20.102 --> 00:07:22.560
that you have in your head how
it's going to come together.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.140
So it's really a job of just
giving people confidence,

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.200
motivating them, inspiring
them to do their best,

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.970
and just taking whatever it
is that once you brought them

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.880
into that place, where they feel
like family, where they feel

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.840
like everyone is given the
freedom and the confidence

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.620
to contribute, because
everyone does want to do that.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.040
I've worked on certain sets
when I was an assistant director

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.790
where you didn't have the
liberty at all to go and share

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.550
what it is that maybe you
want to contribute to a scene,

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.910
because you're too low down
in the ranks to say anything.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.360
And that troubled me.

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.690
That will always stay with me.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.320
And I'm sure every
single person who

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.540
works in a film, so be
it the camera department,

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.750
be it the costume head,
makeup, whoever it is,

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.320
and then you expect the ideas
to come from your cameraman

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.560
and from the actors.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.300
But everyone has hearts.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:17.150
And a good example
of that is when

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.590
we were doing "Dil Chahta Hai."

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:22.820
So we were all thinking of how
do we shoot [? Save ?] song.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.980
We had a really nice
song, and I didn't

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.832
want to get into
that classic lip sync

00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:28.790
where these two characters
just suddenly get up

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:29.840
and start dancing.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.320
So Arjun Bhasin, who was the
costume director on the film,

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.150
he said, why don't
they just go for a film

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:36.940
and then watch this
thing on a movie

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.400
and just imagine
themselves in the film.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.789
And that's how it came together.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.510
Now if this had happened on
the set that I was on earlier,

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.190
there's no way the costume
director could have come up

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.660
and said that idea
to a director.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.305
So it's really important
to keep your ears,

00:08:51.305 --> 00:08:54.510
mind open, because these ideas
can really come from anywhere.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.510
ANANT SHUKLA: So you don't
envision then start to finish

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.340
and then organically
add in parts.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.904
It's kind of for you--

00:09:00.904 --> 00:09:03.070
FARHAN AKHTAR: Actually
when I'm writing the script,

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.270
it's very clear to me of what
it is I'd like it to be like,

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.420
and what I'd like
it to look like.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.730
But eventually,
it's other people

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.480
who are going to do that
for you, and all you can do

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.840
is just answering questions.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.760
And that's really what
you as a director.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.979
As an actor, it's
very different.

00:09:20.979 --> 00:09:22.520
You have just one
sole purpose, which

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.144
is to try and give
the best performance

00:09:24.144 --> 00:09:28.430
that you can do and be as
clear in your head as to what

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.320
it is the director has-- and the
writer, who's the unsung hero,

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:32.880
I think.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.210
Of every single piece
of content ever created,

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:38.783
I think the unsung
hero is the writer.

00:09:38.783 --> 00:09:42.320
So what it is that they
are trying to create,

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.370
what was it about this character
that was so exciting for them

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.860
that even if it's a small
part and not the lead role,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.260
has stayed in the script.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:50.760
And why is this
character important.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.675
To try and understand all of
that and then make that dream,

00:09:54.675 --> 00:09:57.334
make that vision your own
and to be able to do it.

00:09:57.334 --> 00:09:59.000
ANANT SHUKLA: Is there
a Hollywood actor

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.352
or other global actor-- you
know Leo does method acting,

00:10:01.352 --> 00:10:02.810
where he really
gets into character

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:05.944
for months at a time--
that somebody that you

00:10:05.944 --> 00:10:07.860
tried to emulate or see
as a role model there?

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.990
FARHAN AKHTAR: I don't think
emulation is the right word.

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:14.060
I think you do get inspired by
watching great work, for sure.

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:16.770
To be a [? force, ?] be
it Leonardo Di Caprio,

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:23.050
be it Christian Bale-- and for
me, I grew up watching De Niro,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:27.450
and he was very inspirational
to me to want to be in film

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.500
and of course even act, I guess.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.426
So I had the great
fortune of meeting him

00:10:33.426 --> 00:10:36.370
on two occasions now,
and that's the only time

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:38.742
I found myself
completely speechless.

00:10:38.742 --> 00:10:39.950
And I don't know what to say.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.960
And I'm not from a
traditional family

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:46.950
at all, so we were never in this
culture of [INAUDIBLE] and all

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.130
that stuff.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.820
We never did all that.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.880
But he was the only
guy that I told myself

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.577
if I ever meet I'm going
to touch his [? feet. ?]

00:10:54.577 --> 00:10:56.410
So he was pretty shocked,
because I saw him,

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.676
and I was like, [BOWS DOWN].

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.512
It was nice to meet him.

00:11:02.512 --> 00:11:04.220
ANANT SHUKLA: Like
you said, your family,

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.980
you have a very special
relationship with your sister.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:10.777
Do you ever find that there's
a friendly sibling rivalry

00:11:10.777 --> 00:11:12.360
or competition between
the two of you?

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.590
Or how do you guys
continue to push each other

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:15.440
for such great work?

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.356
FARHAN AKHTAR: I just
lock her in the cupboard

00:11:17.356 --> 00:11:19.570
when it really gets
[? ugly. ?] She's pretty small,

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.153
so it's easy to lift her up and
just keep her there for a bit.

00:11:22.153 --> 00:11:25.920
Then she comes out and
tells me I'm the best again.

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:28.020
They put meals under the
door, and she stays there

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.590
for a couple of days.

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.090
I don't know if
you've ever met her.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:32.180
If she hears me
saying this, I'm dead.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:33.096
ANANT SHUKLA: It's OK.

00:11:33.096 --> 00:11:34.304
This is going on YouTube now.

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.229
FARHAN AKHTAR: Nobody look.

00:11:39.229 --> 00:11:40.020
There's no rivalry.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.110
There isn't.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:43.830
We have a relationship
and a bond

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.870
that's kind of way beyond that.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.930
She was the first AD
on "Dil Chahta Hai,"

00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:52.640
and I worked with her and
then the executive producer

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.550
of [? "Luch." ?] And then we've
been collaborating on her films

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.190
from "Luck by Chance."

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.850
So we work as a team.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.280
It doesn't really feel like we
try to outdo each other at all,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:03.780
ever.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:04.812
It never happens.

00:12:04.812 --> 00:12:06.270
ANANT SHUKLA: So
what, for you, has

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.330
been the most satisfying
and challenging film?

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.570
Commercial success
aside, for you, what

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:13.780
are you most proud of?

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.930
FARHAN AKHTAR: I think as a
director "Luch" was probably

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:22.110
the one that I
feel most proud of.

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.390
Apart from the fact that it
wasn't an easy film to make,

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.960
it took me to a world which
I wasn't familiar with.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.387
And somehow it's easy to bring
yourself there as an actor,

00:12:33.387 --> 00:12:35.470
because the director is
already giving you so much

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.720
that you can work with, and
the script gives you a lot

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.070
that you can work with.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.980
Like for example, in
the [? "Milkha" ?] film,

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:44.510
there was so much to take from
it and then push yourself.

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:49.416
But to create that world and to
translate it and get everyone

00:12:49.416 --> 00:12:50.790
to understand it
the way you want

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.410
to present it to
the audience, "Luch"

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:55.250
was a difficult one to do.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.000
But I feel the way that
film came together,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.330
the way the Army
reacted and responded

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.150
to the film when they
saw it, that made

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.933
me feel really good about that.

00:13:05.933 --> 00:13:09.530
ANANT SHUKLA: So
MARD, Men Against Rape

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:10.380
and Discrimination.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:12.660
So tell us a little
bit of your own words,

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.470
what was your vision
for the organization?

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.136
How did it come about?

00:13:16.136 --> 00:13:17.010
What it means to you?

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.930
And how outside of cinema
there, four-part question,

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.400
is MARD so important.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.470
FARHAN AKHTAR: It's
something as an emotion,

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.250
or as an emotional
response, to wanting

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:33.710
to do something about I
guess just the mounting

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.840
violence against women.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.760
It was impossible
to read a newspaper

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.670
or watch the news where you
weren't subjected to something

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:46.240
really horrific going on in
some part of the country,

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:50.260
in the world, I guess,
where the sheer brutality

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.230
of certain crimes,
it just shocks you.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:56.060
And you feel angry.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.800
You feel helpless.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.680
There's a lot of venting that
happens with your friends

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.270
in the room.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.603
We must do something, and
then you wake up the next day,

00:14:03.603 --> 00:14:05.280
and you get back to work.

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.480
So it just came to a point.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.938
There were couple
of incidents that

00:14:07.938 --> 00:14:11.635
happened back to back over
a period of about three

00:14:11.635 --> 00:14:13.306
or four days.

00:14:13.306 --> 00:14:17.050
There was this woman
who was molested

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:21.942
in [? Kohati, ?] and somebody
recorded it and put it out

00:14:21.942 --> 00:14:24.254
on the internet,
which was horrific.

00:14:24.254 --> 00:14:25.920
Then there was followed
by what happened

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.610
in [? Delhi. ?]
Then was followed

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:30.370
by what happened to a
five-year-old who was kidnapped

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.720
and abused by her neighbor.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.720
So there were just so
many things that happened,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.310
and it was just a feeling
of something has to be done.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.950
And you can't just
go onto Twitter

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:42.030
and say, deeply anguished.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.320
There has to be something more.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.930
And also, I feel that where
we are and what we do,

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:57.610
we are so dependent on the love
and support of these people.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.250
If it's not for them coming
and watching your work

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.780
or buying your music,
you don't have a job.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:09.870
So its somehow important to, in
an organic way and not having

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.550
to force it, because it
has to come from inside,

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.320
but when you do
have that feeling

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:18.430
to do something where you
can make them understand

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.060
that it's everyone's problem.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.120
And you're not isolated from it.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.710
You don't live an insular life
where these kind of problems

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:28.310
don't affect you or
your family or what

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.720
you feel about their safety.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.820
So it was all these
things that came together.

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:36.560
And there were a lot of people
already doing a lot of stuff

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:45.780
in rehabilitation of survivors
of rape, of domestic abuse,

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.250
of female trafficking.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.630
Just there were already
many people doing that.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.770
But there was very
little going on,

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:55.870
at least from what
I could gather,

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:59.060
in terms of reaching
out to men and getting

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.090
them to start understanding
that it's important for us

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:05.650
to start thinking
about what we can do,

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.570
because more often than not, the
perpetrators of these crimes,

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.082
of course, are men
more often than not.

00:16:12.082 --> 00:16:17.070
So to somehow catch
men, young men,

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:21.350
boys at an age where
they're about to create

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:24.210
this concept in
their head of what

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.530
it is like to be a man and
the responsibility that needs

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.700
to come with that
definition of it,

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.210
because we take
from pop culture,

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.920
from just social culture, we
take impulses and reference

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.720
points from--

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.640
ANANT SHUKLA: We see
our idols doing it.

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:40.480
FARHAN AKHTAR:
--what to base it on.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.360
Because nobody goes
and asks their parents,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.740
mommy, am I a man now?

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.420
That doesn't happen.

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:50.040
[FOREIGN]

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.740
If you're asking
that question, OK.

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.750
So you just base
it on what you see.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:16:59.840
So if we can somehow create
better reference points,

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.710
certain kind of values that
you can maybe feel like,

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.359
let me create these as a
blueprint or a benchmark

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.040
that I can use.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.109
If I behave like this,
then maybe that's

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:11.910
a good thing to base my
concept of masculinity on.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.760
So that's really
where it came from.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.960
And we just started going
into colleges and schools.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.599
And [? Anurak ?], who's
right here, I spoke with him.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:24.740
And I didn't want to go and
give lectures in colleges,

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.300
because students
just switch off.

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.347
They're not interested
after like five minutes as,

00:17:30.347 --> 00:17:31.680
fortunately, you all seem to be.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.040
So he was like, let's
go and do some music.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.570
Maybe we'll go do music,
because it changes

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.497
the mood that a person is in.

00:17:42.497 --> 00:17:44.330
And then through that,
maybe just talk about

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.060
the initiative, share the poem.

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:47.890
We've got a song
that we've done.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:49.440
Let's share all
of that with them.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.450
So it will be an enjoyable
evening for them,

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.220
and when you've
had fun, you always

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.370
remember things that
happened that night.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.194
So that's really how it started.

00:17:59.194 --> 00:18:00.610
So now it's been
over three years.

00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:03.720
We've been to colleges and
schools all across India.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.407
We will keep going.

00:18:06.407 --> 00:18:07.990
So that's really how
it came together,

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:11.940
to just give young boys and
young men a kind of a blueprint

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.055
that they could access.

00:18:15.055 --> 00:18:17.430
ANANT SHUKLA: We've seen in
America grassroots movements,

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:20.060
whether it's electing the
president 2008 or Bernie

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.049
Sanders this year or
even Donald Trump.

00:18:22.049 --> 00:18:23.590
If you start at the
grassroots level,

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.940
you can actually cause
social change in society.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.300
So how are you engaging then
with students after the fact,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.404
after a concert is done
or through the website.

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:33.820
FARHAN AKHTAR:
There is a website,

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.560
but the thing is that
it really is something

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:40.502
that people need to get
inspired to do themselves.

00:18:40.502 --> 00:18:41.710
And that's what we try to do.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.126
It's very difficult to follow
up with every single student

00:18:44.126 --> 00:18:45.770
that you met.

00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:48.000
But there is a website.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.950
The thing is, what everyone
needs to understand,

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.450
and what we try and
explain to them,

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:55.150
that if you go out
saying that oh, I

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:56.730
want to change
every single person,

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.647
it's not going to happen.

00:18:58.647 --> 00:19:00.230
But try and just
find those one or two

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.484
people who will listen to you,
because everyone does have

00:19:03.484 --> 00:19:04.900
that, whether it's
in your family,

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:09.510
if you just change maybe the
way your one uncle thinks,

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.534
or maybe the domestic help
who's working in your house.

00:19:13.534 --> 00:19:15.950
If there's a maid who works
there, the way your husband is

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.979
treating her, you can
try and understand

00:19:17.979 --> 00:19:19.020
what she's going through.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:22.360
Maybe educate her some more, get
her to start using the internet

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:23.684
so she can empower herself.

00:19:23.684 --> 00:19:25.350
ANANT SHUKLA: [INAUDIBLE]
and Google it.

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:27.930
FARHAN AKHTAR: So various things
like that that can happen,

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:28.570
so that we do.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.195
But eventually, we
just try and inspire

00:19:30.195 --> 00:19:33.090
these people to find
it within themselves

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:34.860
to be able to do
stuff, because it

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:40.270
is-- if this was the only thing
that I did then probably I

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.540
would have had time to follow up
with people about what they do.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:49.190
But it's many other things, like
with my job, with the music,

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:51.417
with film, and
also now two films.

00:19:51.417 --> 00:19:53.000
So even "Dil Dhadakne
Do," where we've

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.470
tried to get a certain
idea of MARD into it

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:00.730
in one of the scenes, where
[INAUDIBLE] Priyanka and myself

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:01.810
are talking.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:04.569
There's a similar thing that we
are putting a MARD related song

00:20:04.569 --> 00:20:05.360
now into "Rock On!!

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.830
2" as well.

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.390
So film is a good
vehicle for it,

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:11.280
because it really
goes everywhere.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.820
We just keep putting out content
and hoping that people just

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:16.370
get inspired by it.

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.620
ANANT SHUKLA: So for
you, what do you see then

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.099
as the biggest obstacle?

00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:22.390
Obviously, some of these are
very deep rooted sentiment

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.700
and issues in India,
across the world

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:28.344
more broadly, around
rape, discrimination.

00:20:28.344 --> 00:20:30.260
Like you said, you can
pull it apart, come out

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.520
and look at it from the
cinema lens, from concerts.

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.609
Technology can enable it.

00:20:34.609 --> 00:20:36.900
Like I was mentioning before,
helping women get online.

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.530
You partnered with Google.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:41.297
What do you see then as the
biggest obstacle then from you?

00:20:41.297 --> 00:20:43.505
FARHAN AKHTAR: I think the
biggest challenge really--

00:20:43.505 --> 00:20:47.230
I think because also
where-- the world's going

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.730
through an interesting
time, I feel.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:52.860
There's an entire generation,
or a couple of generations

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.500
now, that really aren't
interested in the way

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.020
things used to be.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:01.030
And I think that's where
the tension lies, is people

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.010
saying that I don't want to
follow those old rules that

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.260
would have been
around for centuries

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.790
dictated either by local
tradition, local customs

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.400
and culture, or by religion.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.600
People don't want that.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.474
And the minute people
are trying to step away

00:21:15.474 --> 00:21:17.580
from that, especially when
it comes to women, who

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.460
have very clear cut,
designated rules when it comes

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.550
to the traditional
structure and patriarchy,

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.560
almost every single
religious book

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.795
has certain guidelines for what
women should and should not do.

00:21:29.795 --> 00:21:31.670
So when you're trying
to move away from that,

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:32.700
there is tension.

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.999
And there are
people who want to,

00:21:34.999 --> 00:21:36.540
of course, because
the majority still

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:42.766
exists within that
aspect of life right now.

00:21:42.766 --> 00:21:45.270
So it's a power struggle.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.360
And more often than not,
in any power struggle

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.690
the people who suffer the most
are considered the weakest

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:53.910
victims who can't fight
back, who don't have a voice,

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.710
whose rights are less,
whose voice can be subdued,

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.560
who physically
aren't that strong.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.510
So you'll always see
it manifesting there,

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:04.460
so be it women, be it
the LGBT community,

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.127
be it even like in caste,
in certain places, or race.

00:22:08.127 --> 00:22:09.960
It's the same thing
that goes on everywhere.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.210
So it's like a power struggle.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:14.250
The balance eventually
finds itself.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:17.160
So it's just up to us to try
and accelerate that movement

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.090
as much as we possibly can,
so we arrive there faster.

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:21.200
So it's a process.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:24.030
ANANT SHUKLA: You've partnered
with Priyanka, Ranveer,

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.100
Anushka, [? Suchin ?],
celebrities all across India.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.870
People look at
their role models.

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:32.530
They look at pop culture
as their reference point.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.060
So for you, how do you
see that celebrity status

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.730
as impacting or being a
role model for change?

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.150
FARHAN AKHTAR:
Eventually, everyone

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.670
has someone that they
look up to or someone

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.920
that they inspire outside,
of course, their family

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:53.410
and their parents like in this
pop culture or sporting culture

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.690
space.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.980
Everyone has one.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:59.290
And those people, even
if you don't realize it,

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.820
I think because you
are a public figure,

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:07.430
I think there is a certain
degree of responsibility,

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:10.310
I feel, that should
come with it,

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:14.190
because there's so many people
who get affected by what you do

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:17.330
or get inspired or get let
down by things that happen

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:20.220
and when you see that
happening all the time.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:22.840
So if somehow you
can be aware of it,

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:25.630
you can't force
someone to be that way.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.470
Eventually, it's
completely their choice

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.280
what they want to be
remembered as and for.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.230
But if you can somehow
find that within you

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:35.690
and somehow find a
way to inspire people

00:23:35.690 --> 00:23:42.040
to be more positive about
any aspect of their life,

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.430
I think it's a good
thing to try and do.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.550
ANANT SHUKLA: I mentioned
before, obviously UN Goodwill

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.070
Ambassador taking
MARD then out to

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.950
the next international
and global level,

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.420
working with HeForShe.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.860
What other kind of international
movements or organizations

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.078
are you hoping to partner
with through MARD,

00:24:00.078 --> 00:24:01.615
or how will your
work with the UN

00:24:01.615 --> 00:24:03.740
hopefully take this message
to a more global level,

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:05.656
and hopefully bring
change even here in the US

00:24:05.656 --> 00:24:08.115
where some of the same
sentiments are held?

00:24:08.115 --> 00:24:09.240
FARHAN AKHTAR: We will see.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.910
There's constantly
something going on,

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:16.712
and our emphasis really has
been on content creation.

00:24:16.712 --> 00:24:18.420
That's really what we
said we want to do.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.020
We want to create music.

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:23.780
I want to get into
creating short films.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:26.650
And like I said, bringing
things into feature films

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:28.790
as and when it's possible
to bring stuff in.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.057
Hopefully get into doing
some kind of art as well.

00:24:32.057 --> 00:24:34.140
But that's really the area
that I want to focus on

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.020
and then everything
that comes with it,

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.940
any kind of associations
and collaborations

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.820
that can happen on that front.

00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.230
We're always open to.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.700
ANANT SHUKLA:
Always open, great.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.699
We're going to open it
up to audience questions,

00:24:44.699 --> 00:24:46.946
as well, if people want
to start queuing up.

00:24:46.946 --> 00:24:48.070
You mentioned in "Rock On!!

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.887
2" that there's another song
coming that also has MARD.

00:24:50.887 --> 00:24:53.470
Can you talk a little bit more
about what we can expect there?

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.990
I know you can't disclose
too much information now,

00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:00.290
but what can we
expect there, in terms

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.619
of MARD and this campaign?

00:25:01.619 --> 00:25:03.160
FARHAN AKHTAR: Well,
it's a song that

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.640
really talks about-- it's really
like a call to action for women

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.000
to rise up, and that this
is their time and maybe all

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:12.880
together.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.260
We all want to fight
for your rights.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.736
So it's that kind of a song.

00:25:17.736 --> 00:25:20.390
It's called "Jagu", is
what the song is called.

00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.470
And it's as much a call, of
course, to the establishment,

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.100
or to the patriarchy,
that it's time

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.460
to wake up and realize
that things are not

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.800
going to be the same anymore.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.610
ANANT SHUKLA: And
I know you just

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:31.818
finished the US tour as well.

00:25:31.818 --> 00:25:34.310
Did you find the message
resonated as well here

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.160
in the US, or what most
surprised you about audiences

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.410
here when you're carrying
the MARD message?

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.220
FARHAN AKHTAR: I just
like the fact when you go,

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:45.380
there's all these seats out
front, and everyone comes.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.194
And I don't know what they are
expecting this concert to be.

00:25:48.194 --> 00:25:50.046
So we had to just
keep telling them

00:25:50.046 --> 00:25:52.670
like, I'm sure many people have
come here and performed before,

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:55.500
but this is not that
kind of concert.

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.580
So please get ready to
stand up, dance, jump.

00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.420
And it was great
because they all got up,

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:02.660
and they all had
a fantastic time.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.407
And I'm really
glad that they all

00:26:04.407 --> 00:26:06.240
want us to come back
and do some more music.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.650
So we'll come back soon.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:13.290
And maybe we should do a
performance here the next time.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:15.960
ANANT SHUKLA: Yes, I'm sure
the audience would love that.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.751
FARHAN AKHTAR: We do
a little unplugged set

00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:19.131
right in the stool.

00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:20.556
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Farhan.

00:26:20.556 --> 00:26:22.100
I'm [? Shuwetha. ?]
Than you for joining us.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.808
Big fan of your work,
and Zoya's as well,

00:26:23.808 --> 00:26:25.910
and of course, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.110
So when you were speaking
about MARD, I love the idea.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.700
It's great.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.820
But you spoke about how we
are inspired by Bollywood,

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.900
and let's face it, some
of the item numbers

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:36.220
are just atrocious.

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.320
And I have a soon
to be four-year-old,

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:40.486
and she's listening to
songs like, [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.680
And this is Kareena
Kapoor dancing to this.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.160
How do we start changing
Bollywood and the way

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.699
we think about women in
music and what we see on TV?

00:26:54.699 --> 00:26:56.740
FARHAN AKHTAR: I think
firstly, you should really

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.740
change the channel.

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.340
AUDIENCE: The
problem is it's also

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:04.627
the songs that you
listen to, because she's

00:27:04.627 --> 00:27:05.917
dancing somewhere--

00:27:05.917 --> 00:27:08.250
FARHAN AKHTAR: And I don't
mean this with any disrespect

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.600
whatsoever, but there is
a parental responsibility

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.260
as well.

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.520
Also, the fact is what
your child watches,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:20.490
and what your child listens
to, you have to be aware of it.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.270
It would be impossible
for me to tell anyone,

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:26.055
don't make the song, or don't
put this song in your film.

00:27:26.055 --> 00:27:27.480
It won't be possible.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.880
But when we realize
that people--

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.530
when people stop
listening to it,

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.017
when people stop
downloading it, when

00:27:33.017 --> 00:27:35.100
they realize that there's
not enough people buying

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.112
the song anymore,
they'll stop making it.

00:27:37.112 --> 00:27:39.570
AUDIENCE: So how do we influence
that, because sitting over

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:40.986
here, it's hard
for us to do that.

00:27:40.986 --> 00:27:42.620
And trust me, I
change the channel.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:44.280
She doesn't get to
listen to the stuff.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.070
But when you're out,
and you know every movie

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.530
has an item number,
most of them.

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:53.520
Are you speaking to
people in Bollywood

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.460
and trying to influence
change there as well?

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.543
FARHAN AKHTAR: We've had
conversations about this,

00:27:57.543 --> 00:28:01.030
but it really is very
difficult, because you're

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:03.370
in an artistic environment.

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:04.870
You're in a creative field.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.920
And the minute you're going to
get into [INAUDIBLE] someone

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.940
and telling them,
you cannot do this,

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:12.540
it opens up too many doors of
then other people telling you

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.550
what you can and cannot do.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.900
So it becomes a problem.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.410
But what we do try
is in our own films

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.400
we try our best not to do it.

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.890
So that if whoever
gets [INAUDIBLE] film

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.820
can work without having a song
like this, that's really--

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.170
and then I love directors.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:30.390
There are many other people,
so be it Rakeysh Mehra, be it

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.575
[? Ashutush ?] Kuvalikul,
a lot of people--

00:28:32.575 --> 00:28:34.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that came out recently.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:35.960
FARHAN AKHTAR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.680
So they don't really
enjoy putting songs

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.850
like that in their film.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:43.170
And there are some
people who do.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.790
But I really feel that is
something for the audience

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:47.644
to reject.

00:28:47.644 --> 00:28:48.560
You have to reject it.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.740
If they don't reject
it, there will always

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.410
be people making that stuff.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.295
If somebody's buying,
somebody will sell.

00:28:54.295 --> 00:28:55.910
AUDIENCE: Well, hopefully the
boys who are speaking to girl

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.590
have been rejected, and
then we won't have to.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.677
[?

00:28:57.677 --> 00:28:58.462
FARHAN AKHTAR: Essentially ?].

00:28:58.462 --> 00:28:59.295
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:59.295 --> 00:29:02.050
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Sanjay.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.300
It's a pleasure to
meet you, big honor.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.520
You mentioned something
that was interesting,

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.850
and I've been thinking
about it a lot as well.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.000
So my mom and dad
watched "Aradhna"

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.120
and [? "Shoy" ?] like 15, 16
times at the movie theater.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.290
That type of behavior
doesn't occur as much

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.030
anymore with the new generation,
at least in the United States.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.720
Maybe it does in India.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.010
I'm not privy to it.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.900
But I'm curious the
platform of cinema,

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:31.420
does it shout in the same
way that it did back then?

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:34.320
And if it doesn't,
then what other mediums

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.650
are now on the rise?

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.280
FARHAN AKHTAR: I do feel that
it resonates the same way,

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:42.610
but I feel the way
people are experiencing

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:44.306
a movie now has changed.

00:29:44.306 --> 00:29:45.680
When you talk
about your parents,

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.870
or I talk about even
when I was a teenager,

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.190
I really had not
much of a choice

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:53.880
apart from going to a theater
to watch a film, which

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.190
is why films ran for
50 weeks, 100 weeks,

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:58.730
because if you
wanted to watch it,

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:00.410
you had to go to the theater.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:03.090
I know people who watched
"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara"

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:07.320
75 times, once in the theater.

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.541
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:08.541 --> 00:30:09.690
FARHAN AKHTAR: Thank you.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.680
I would much rather [INAUDIBLE]
75 times to a theater in

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.170
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.260
So then they're like, but
I bought a ticket once,

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.790
and now I watch
it on my computer.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:23.970
And I'm like, OK, what fun.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:27.110
So people do watch
it, and there are

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:31.000
certain films that resonate with
people, that stay with people.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.980
The message of that
movie stays with people.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.900
The entertainment of certain
films stays with people.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.730
So that experience, in terms
of what a person is feeling,

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.165
is exactly the same, but it's
just how they're doing it

00:30:42.165 --> 00:30:43.540
I think has changed
tremendously.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.430
AUDIENCE: And from a
financials perspective,

00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:47.350
the margin on a ticket
sale in a movie theater

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.109
is much higher than
that of digital.

00:30:49.109 --> 00:30:50.650
FARHAN AKHTAR:
Unfortunately, they've

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:56.470
still not cracked this whole
penalty for piracy in India

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:57.040
just yet.

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:05.110
The day a film releases
you can find pirated DVDs

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.480
and VCDs of it being
sold on the streets,

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:11.110
and that's where it
really, really hurts.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:16.820
They did a little bit of a
study maybe about 10 years ago,

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:20.350
where they really tried to
see if they could control it

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:22.240
for the opening
weekend of the film.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:26.920
And the difference of
business was almost anywhere

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:33.420
between 40% to 60% of a
weekend is lost on piracy.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.420
So I don't know why
people aren't doing more

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.490
to try and control it
actually, to be honest.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.575
FARHAN AKHTAR: Sorry?

00:31:40.575 --> 00:31:41.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:43.585 --> 00:31:45.210
FARHAN AKHTAR: Yeah,
I'm sure it would.

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:45.850
I'm sure it would.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.250
That's also an ongoing battle
because the producers don't

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:51.830
decide the price of a ticket.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:54.340
That is the theater
owner's, their chain.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.880
And eventually, if you
have to release your film,

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.669
those are the people you go to.

00:31:58.669 --> 00:32:00.210
So there are many
problems like this.

00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.251
There are problems in
terms of percentage sharing

00:32:02.251 --> 00:32:04.070
between the producer and the--

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:06.610
Here, it's a standard
50/50 percent

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:09.840
that goes between the studio
and the theater chain.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.630
In India, it keeps changing.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.340
You get 50% only in
the first weekend.

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.860
Then it goes down to some 42%.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:18.150
Then it goes down to 35%.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:19.780
Then it's at 20 some percent.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.080
So actually for film,
if it's doing well,

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.220
and if it has long
legs, you actually

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:27.240
end up making a lot less
than you would have.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.122
So if a film opens to,
say, a 50% collection,

00:32:30.122 --> 00:32:31.830
and everybody's like,
you must go see it.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:32.622
You must go see it.

00:32:32.622 --> 00:32:34.413
By the time it comes
to the second weekend,

00:32:34.413 --> 00:32:36.860
we are making a lot less, and
the theater's making a lot

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:37.900
more.

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:40.580
So there are many issues like
that, but I do agree with you.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:44.640
I do feel that the ticket
prices are a bit much,

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.360
and they probably
force a lot of people

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:48.800
to stay out of the theater.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.090
I do agree with you.

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:51.730
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:52.647
AUDIENCE: Hey, Farhan.

00:32:52.647 --> 00:32:53.521
This is Oshaf.

00:32:53.521 --> 00:32:55.357
I'm really honored to meet you.

00:32:55.357 --> 00:32:56.940
I'm one of your
biggest fans actually.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:58.700
FARHAN AKHTAR: Thank you.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:05.130
AUDIENCE: And you've been
directing movies, acting,

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:05.630
singing.

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:08.060
I just have a two-part question.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.131
So the first part, you
played Milkha Singh in one

00:33:11.131 --> 00:33:12.630
of the movies,
"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag."

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.370
And I just wanted to ask you the
experience you had making it,

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:16.990
because it must be
really difficult.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:20.290
And looking at your
performance, it was amazing.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:22.290
So what did you do to
prepare for that role?

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:23.960
Did you talk to
Milkha Singh, and how

00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:26.270
did you come about with it?

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:28.800
FARHAN AKHTAR: I spent
probably three days with him

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.915
before I got into
prep on that film.

00:33:32.915 --> 00:33:35.960
And then when I realized what
his life was like, what all he

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.320
had to do, and
understood what it

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:40.912
is that I'd have to kind
of put myself through

00:33:40.912 --> 00:33:42.370
to be able to look
like an athlete,

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:46.930
I contacted the first VFX
house that I could find.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:48.550
And said, I just
wear a green suit.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:49.175
Give me a body.

00:33:53.542 --> 00:33:55.570
I was very inspired
by his story,

00:33:55.570 --> 00:34:01.590
and there was something
that unlocked in my head.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:03.800
And I just felt
like whatever needs

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.530
to be done to get this
right, I should do.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:09.790
So at no point in that film did
I ever feel like it's too much.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.274
At no point did I ever
feel like giving up.

00:34:12.274 --> 00:34:13.940
At no point did I
ever feel like, man, I

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.290
can't do this anymore.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.600
That feeling just never,
ever came no matter

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.639
what we were doing.

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:22.210
Like I was running around like
a lunatic in [INAUDIBLE] running

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:24.570
up hills and coming down.

00:34:24.570 --> 00:34:28.360
We shot all the races in
Delhi in the summertime,

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.620
because that's the only time
you can get the stadiums,

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:31.703
because nobody goes there.

00:34:31.703 --> 00:34:33.630
You have to be
mental to go there.

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.698
It's like 45, 46 degrees.

00:34:36.698 --> 00:34:38.239
But we could only
shoot at that time,

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:39.820
because that's when the
stadiums were empty.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:42.350
So to run around there for
like-- we were there 24 days

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.940
straight shooting races.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.440
But none of it mattered,
because I was just

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.550
possessed by his story.

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.050
I think that's
really what happened.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:56.590
And how it came
together, I don't know.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:59.280
I don't know how to explain
it to you, apart from the fact

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:01.400
that I was just a bit
possessed at that time

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:03.042
with wanting to get it right.

00:35:03.042 --> 00:35:04.250
AUDIENCE: My second question.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.266
So you first directed
your first movie,

00:35:07.266 --> 00:35:08.640
which was "Dil
Chahta Hai," which

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.100
set a benchmark in good movies
for the whole generation--

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:13.980
for example, my
generation from the 90s--

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.190
and the last time we
saw a movie from you

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.040
was "Dawn 2," which was 2011.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.793
When are we going to
get to see you come

00:35:19.793 --> 00:35:22.042
back in a director's seat next?

00:35:22.042 --> 00:35:23.250
FARHAN AKHTAR: Soon, I guess.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.520
It's something that
I do enjoy doing.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.990
What's happening right now in
my life, apart from the music,

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:32.840
is also there's like
a wonderful flow

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.400
to the work that's happening
of working with directors

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:41.270
whose movies I've enjoyed, with
on-scripts that I won't get

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.820
to work on as a director,
because somebody else is making

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:44.320
it.

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.460
So it's nice also to be a part
of another person's vision.

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.620
And I feel when I
don't get inspired

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.920
by what's happening within
the acting world that's

00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:56.654
being offered to me, I'll
just go back and start

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:57.320
directing again.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:58.820
AUDIENCE: Are you
hinting you you're

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:00.260
going to make "Dawn 3" soon?

00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:06.040
FARHAN AKHTAR: Oh, is that
the-- --the secret question.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.290
Can you [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:09.380
It was a last restraint.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.660
When I run out of acting
work, I'll let you know.

00:36:15.660 --> 00:36:17.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming here.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:19.147
FARHAN AKHTAR: And thank you.

00:36:19.147 --> 00:36:20.022
AUDIENCE: Hi, Farhan.

00:36:20.022 --> 00:36:23.341
This is [? Nihadika ?].

00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:25.340
Thank you so much, actually,
for taking the time

00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:26.170
to be here today.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.346
FARHAN AKHTAR: It
was my pleasure.

00:36:27.346 --> 00:36:29.846
AUDIENCE: My question was you
mentioned that you're actually

00:36:29.846 --> 00:36:32.990
going to colleges
and talking to kids

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.330
and enlightening them
about the entire HeForShe

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:38.780
kind of situation.

00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:42.230
But in my experience,
what's really happening is

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:45.110
there's a certain perception
formed between 10 to 15 years

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.410
or so, when the
kids are that young.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:49.810
And like somebody
already mentioned,

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.547
thanks to the songs
that come out,

00:36:51.547 --> 00:36:53.630
thanks to so many Bollywood
movies in the theater,

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:57.540
and generally because probably
less parental guidance,

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.390
there is already a
certain perception

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:01.140
by the time they
come to college.

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.960
So do you think that maybe
we need to focus more

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.680
on schools and that age kids?

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.420
Would that have a bigger impact?

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.000
And I don't know.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.230
I was just wondering if
you're already doing that?

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:15.950
FARHAN AKHTAR: You
know it probably would.

00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:19.979
But it would have to come then
in the form of the education

00:37:19.979 --> 00:37:21.270
that they're receiving already.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:24.970
Maybe even like stories that
kids are taught at a young age,

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:27.145
if they can focus on not the--

00:37:27.145 --> 00:37:29.270
AUDIENCE: But in a lot of
these government schools,

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.020
they don't have the
privilege to that.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:36.740
So a lot of Indian schools,
which are not private,

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.872
essentially, may not
have the same privilege.

00:37:38.872 --> 00:37:40.330
Or if you go to
public schools, you

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:41.910
don't have that
kind of education.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.576
So maybe you're going
there and actually

00:37:43.576 --> 00:37:46.870
having these kind of songs
at that age would actually

00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:48.450
have a bigger
impact and actually

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:52.605
have a more cultural change
in that generation, so to say.

00:37:52.605 --> 00:37:54.730
So they actually started
looking at it differently.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:58.310
[INAUDIBLE] was actually
probably doing it at an elder

00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:59.880
age, I'm just thinking of--

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.580
FARHAN AKHTAR: Yeah,
by the time we're

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.430
talking to kids who are
actually 15, 16, because that's

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.170
when they get into college.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.340
So that's when we,
more often than not,

00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.590
end up engaging with them.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:14.040
But there's also a lot of
stuff going on in schools, even

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.470
government run programs that
are going on in schools.

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:19.850
There's the whole
[INAUDIBLE], that's

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:23.001
happening that's
created its own-- that

00:38:23.001 --> 00:38:24.750
affects the syllabus,
to a certain extent,

00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.090
in terms of what
all is being taught.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.520
So these things are going on.

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.700
At the end of the
day, we are people who

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.580
wherever we're invited, we go.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:34.910
It's that kind of a thing.

00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:39.450
But I would imagine in
school and from a young age,

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:42.870
I think what you
teach kids would

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:44.590
be important in the
form of storytelling.

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:47.551
I think that would work very,
very effectively if they

00:38:47.551 --> 00:38:48.300
were still little.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.580
There was a book that had
come out a little while

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:58.440
ago, which was like fairy tale
but not politically correct.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.425
It was quite interesting,
where Goldilocks

00:39:00.425 --> 00:39:04.590
saves the world from the
hunter, things like that.

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:06.090
So it teaches you
a different kind--

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.840
it's not always a
damsel in distress,

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.300
and some prince needs
to come and save her.

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.480
So those kind of stories
where you create girl heroes

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.910
and women heroes
for children so it's

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:19.880
not always the one who
needs to be rescued,

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.120
or the one who's weaker.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.900
I think that would
really, really

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.455
help if that could come
into school at a young age.

00:39:25.455 --> 00:39:27.890
AUDIENCE: Your short stories
that you were mentioning,

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:28.855
your shadow videos.

00:39:28.855 --> 00:39:29.730
FARHAN AKHTAR: Sorry?

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.200
AUDIENCE: The shadow
videos that you

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.033
were mentioning that
you're doing right now,

00:39:33.033 --> 00:39:33.754
the short films.

00:39:33.754 --> 00:39:36.170
FARHAN AKHTAR: What we're doing
with the short films right

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:41.360
now is that we're
focusing on female icons,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:47.060
and we are kind of wanting to
reverse that philosophy that

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:49.010
exists of behind
every successful man,

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.230
there is a woman.

00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:53.050
We want to change that to
beside every successful woman,

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:54.682
there's also a man.

00:39:54.682 --> 00:39:55.890
So that's what we want to do.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.960
And talk about the men in
the lives of successful women

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.240
and the part that
they play, so men also

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.250
feel good about that
kind of contribution.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:05.420
I don't always have
to be the one who's

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.440
the hero and the
star in the family.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:10.590
So even if my wife is, or my
sister is, or my daughter is,

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.900
there's a lot of pride and a
lot of joy and a lot of success,

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.800
even for me withing
that happening.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.490
So let me maybe help
them achieve their dreams

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.180
and not be the one
that has to do it,

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.730
because I'm the
man in the family.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.070
So that's what we're
focusing on right now.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.215
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:27.215 --> 00:40:28.090
AUDIENCE: Hi, Farhan.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:31.315
I wanted to thank you as well,
with everyone here, for coming.

00:40:31.315 --> 00:40:33.480
So my question is more
so what you personally

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.481
want to see from an
institution like Google

00:40:36.481 --> 00:40:38.230
to help prevent the
violence against women

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:41.040
and specifically-- I know
you're the UN Ambassador

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.485
for a women in South Asia.

00:40:42.485 --> 00:40:44.522
Do you work at all for Pakistan?

00:40:44.522 --> 00:40:46.480
So personally, I'm half
Pakistani, half Indian.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.810
And I'm going to be working
on YouTube in Pakistan

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:51.730
in the coming months.

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:53.354
So I'm just curious
what you personally

00:40:53.354 --> 00:40:55.610
want to see from the South
Asian region, including

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:56.914
Pakistan and India from Google?

00:40:56.914 --> 00:40:58.580
FARHAN AKHTAR: What
would I like to see?

00:40:58.580 --> 00:40:59.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah, what
do you personally

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.130
think that we, as
an institution,

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:04.420
should do to prevent the
violence against women.

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.100
Anything that we can do.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:13.130
FARHAN AKHTAR: Well, it's a very
difficult question to answer,

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.760
because culturally, there are so
many problems wherever you go.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.510
Each place has its own issues.

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.660
Although on some
level, culturally,

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:27.950
India and Pakistan
are very similar.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.420
But then again, I
guess on the basis

00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:36.030
of there are certain issues that
come with certain religions,

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.690
I guess, of having
to be a certain way.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:43.140
And I feel challenging
those ideologies, I think,

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:47.150
is probably the biggest
challenge that any country that

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:52.630
is founded on any principles
of religion faces.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:56.450
So I think that's possibly
Pakistan's biggest challenge is

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:59.700
how to counter that,
because there's a lot

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.590
of do's and don'ts that comes
in being part of a certain

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:03.090
culture.

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:05.100
And I think that's
the big challenge.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.550
So what you can do?

00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:09.480
I'm sure you have a hundred
ideas that you could enlighten

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.230
me with, and if
there's any way that I

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:15.280
can help you get those ideas out
further and reach more people,

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.467
I'd be glad to.

00:42:17.467 --> 00:42:19.050
AUDIENCE: Specifically
then for India,

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:22.910
what do you think that we can
do, besides just awareness,

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.355
to help prevent the
violence against women?

00:42:25.355 --> 00:42:26.730
FARHAN AKHTAR: I
think education.

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:29.400
I think really the
important thing,

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:35.210
the answer lies in education
and in educating kids and just

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:39.330
getting them to understand basic
values, just basic human values

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:40.250
at a young age.

00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:44.282
And if we can do that, and
that has to come into-- like we

00:42:44.282 --> 00:42:45.740
were just discussing--
whether it's

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:50.810
from a young age in the stories,
or how a family treats the girl

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:54.170
child vis a vis the boy
child at home, the freedoms

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:56.160
that you give them.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.040
And all these things,
eventually, there

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.230
will be a generational
change, and the people

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:04.540
who are too far gone, no,
to try and change them.

00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.340
So let's forget about them.

00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.550
But the ones who are
coming, and the ones

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.640
who will be now
leaders in their fields

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:13.210
and the opinion
makers of tomorrow,

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.030
those people have to grow
up with a different mindset

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:17.510
from the ones before them.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.590
And that can really, really
only happen through education.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.480
So whether you put
out-- whatever it is.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:28.570
Everyone now is on their
phone, is on a tablet,

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:29.595
is on their computer--

00:43:29.595 --> 00:43:30.720
ANANT SHUKLA: Social media.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.803
FARHAN AKHTAR: --so whatever
you can put out there

00:43:32.803 --> 00:43:35.360
to help educate them to
be able to understand this

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.210
in an engaging way, in
an entertaining way, that

00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:41.920
creates dialogue,
that creates curiosity

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:43.674
about wanting to
know more, I think

00:43:43.674 --> 00:43:45.840
that's really where the
challenge lies for all of us

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.240
to keep doing that, because
that's the only way I

00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.102
know that it can happen.

00:43:50.102 --> 00:43:52.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.720
AUDIENCE: My name is Anita.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.160
I am just--

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.590
FARHAN AKHTAR: Ma'am, there is
something really troubling me

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:57.280
on both sides.

00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.655
Can I just come
and fix that mic?

00:44:00.507 --> 00:44:01.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.714
FARHAN AKHTAR:
Thank you so much.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.250
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:09.250 --> 00:44:15.165
[FOREIGN]

00:44:15.165 --> 00:44:16.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:42.602 --> 00:44:44.060
FARHAN AKHTAR: It's
easier to adopt

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:46.530
something that's bad for you.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:48.115
AUDIENCE: And you make it--

00:44:48.115 --> 00:44:50.470
FARHAN AKHTAR: No, but
that's-- if you just take any

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.560
[INAUDIBLE], if you
take smoking, drinking.

[FOREIGN]

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:22.726
ANANT SHUKLA: Last
audience question.

00:46:22.726 --> 00:46:26.626
AUDIENCE: So hi, this is Anthra.

00:46:26.626 --> 00:46:28.410
So my name is Anthra.

00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:30.350
I'm great fan of yours.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:33.090
So you have played
multiple roles in movie,

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:36.650
but which one is the one that
is closest to your heart?

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:40.061
Being actor, singer,
director, producer-- do I?

00:46:40.061 --> 00:46:40.560
No?

00:46:43.927 --> 00:46:46.260
FARHAN AKHTAR: I can't-- I
don't know how to answer that

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:46.890
question.

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.350
I really don't.

00:46:48.350 --> 00:46:52.150
I've been asked this question
since the last eight years.

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:55.280
I still don't have
an answer for it.

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:58.020
It keeps changing
also, in all honesty.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:01.510
But eventually, at
the end of it all,

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:03.540
it's all about
engaging with people.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.560
It's all about
entertaining people,

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:10.180
and hopefully getting
them to do good things.

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:13.810
So it's very difficult
to say which one.

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:15.481
I, too, I enjoy all of it.

00:47:15.481 --> 00:47:17.230
And the minute I stop
enjoying [? doing ?]

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:18.294
film, I'll stop doing it.

00:47:18.294 --> 00:47:19.210
So that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:21.300
AUDIENCE: I feel like your
ideas are really important,

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:22.530
and I've learned a lot today.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:25.420
Do you have any intention
in making a film geared

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.890
towards the American audiences?

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:35.000
FARHAN AKHTAR: I don't really
think of film like that,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.970
to be honest with you.

00:47:37.970 --> 00:47:40.880
What happens is,
as an artist, you

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:45.160
get excited by either what's
offered to you as a script,

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.610
or then an idea that you have.

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:50.400
And on some level,
we are, I guess,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.910
bound by the constraints,
for whatever it's worth,

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:54.410
at least in the
mainstream in India,

00:47:54.410 --> 00:47:57.680
by the language that we
have to make our film in.

00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:59.620
So there's a certain
challenge that

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.410
comes with taking that
across to an audience that

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:05.500
maybe would watch it if it
was an hour, hour an a half.

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:07.900
But our films tend to be longer.

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.140
They do.

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:10.265
That's a fact.

00:48:10.265 --> 00:48:12.710
Also, culturally different
because of the song and dance.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:16.280
So it becomes somehow maybe
not taken as seriously

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.130
because of that aspect of it.

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:22.960
But the hope really is that
it could reach out to anyone.

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.300
We watch foreign language
films all the time.

00:48:25.300 --> 00:48:27.185
We watch them with
subtitles, and at no point

00:48:27.185 --> 00:48:28.560
do we feel like,
oh, I don't want

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.700
to watch that film because it's
in Korean, or it's in Spanish,

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:33.882
or it's in English.

00:48:33.882 --> 00:48:35.840
You don't feel like you
don't want to watch it.

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.980
So hopefully we can excite
people to watch our films

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:40.900
for what they are.

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.030
And it's of course
an understanding

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:48.031
that you'd want it to have some
substance that could resonate

00:48:48.031 --> 00:48:48.780
with those people.

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.560
That I do understand
and appreciate.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:56.040
But I feel that a film
like "Zindagi Na Milegi

00:48:56.040 --> 00:49:00.410
Dobara," for example, I feel
that if marketed correctly

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:06.150
to a viewer that does not speak
Hindi, it would affect them.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.430
It would influence them.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:10.000
They'd enjoy that film.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.850
So the challenge of marketing
it then lies with somebody else.

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.670
And hopefully that is
something that we can track,

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:20.950
because that is an area I feel
that Hindi films have still

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:25.750
not found they feed on, on how
to make it exciting for people

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:30.255
who are not Indian, or
not from the sub-Continent

00:49:30.255 --> 00:49:32.120
to be able to come in
and enjoy their work.

00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:38.600
ANANT SHUKLA: Great,
so last question.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:43.940
Favorite dialogue from a
movie or a poem, a few words

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:44.650
to leave us with.

00:49:44.650 --> 00:49:48.160
FARHAN AKHTAR: Good
[? shot. ?] So I

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:52.230
guess I'll leave you all with
maybe the MARD poem, since we

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:53.420
will hear about that.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.955
So this is what we
really go around,

00:49:54.955 --> 00:50:01.420
and when we talk about a
blueprint for the new man is--

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:52.870
[FOREIGN]

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:55.920
ANANT SHUKLA: Ladies and
gentlemen, Mr. Farhan Akhtar.
