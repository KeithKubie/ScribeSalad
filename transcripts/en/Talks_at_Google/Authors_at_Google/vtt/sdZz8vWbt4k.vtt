00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.570
INTERVIEWER: Good.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.650
Hello.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.840
Maybe you'd like to introduce
yourself and tell us

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.900
what led you to working at the
university a couple of years

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.400
ago.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.360
SUKI KIM: Well, I was born
and raised in South Korea,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.190
and I moved to
America in my teens.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.260
And I do actually come from--
there's a personal history.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.360
The Korean War did
separate my family,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.780
and some members ended up
being taken to North Korea.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.990
This is not that unusual.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.350
It actually happened
to a lot of people.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.880
They estimate like a
million plus families were

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.470
affected by that back in 1953.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.100
And having grown up with
that separation and sorrow,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.580
then I became an immigrant
to going to America

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.540
in my teens, where I didn't
speak a word of English.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.880
So I think that that
really was a big issue.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.739
And then I went to North
Korea by chance in 2002

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:05.970
for the first time.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.370
And then I realized there was
this world that was basically

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.880
a wound, heartbreak
for Korean people

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.170
that is not being explained
in a way we can understand.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.650
I kept going back in.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.110
And there's no way you can go
find out about North Korea,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.550
except seeing the
government's propaganda.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.010
You will just never see it.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.105
So what that meant was--
and I went five times

00:01:27.105 --> 00:01:28.410
through a decade.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.610
And what that
meant was you would

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.940
have to go undercover and be
really embedded there in a way.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.160
So I found out about
the school, which was

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.930
run by Evangelical Christians.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.300
So I ended up
posing as a teacher,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.404
posing as an
Evangelical Christian.

00:01:46.404 --> 00:01:47.820
INTERVIEWER: So
the university was

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.700
run by Evangelical
Christians who

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.480
were sort of undercover
in the country,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.230
and you were an
undercover teacher, just

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.490
layers of undercover.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.800
SUKI KIM: Well, it's a
very complicated situation

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.210
to try to explain, obviously.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.450
Because this group of
fundamental Evangelical

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.440
Christians that fund
the school-- $35 million

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.300
to build and a lot
more to operate--

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.730
they have made a deal, some
sort of an official deal,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.180
to not proselytize.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.740
They'll go there and build the
school-- because proselytizing

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.610
is an execution of a crime.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.850
And we have seen that, where
people get detained there.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.050
But those are different.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.633
The ones who get
detained are the ones

00:02:25.633 --> 00:02:27.740
who went in there
under tourist visa.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.240
These are the people who go to
North Korea on a tourist visa

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.390
and take videos and
put it on YouTube.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.840
There's a lot of actually these.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.839
You just pay money, and
you can go as a tourist.

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:38.140
It's not a big deal to go
to North Korea that way.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.330
But then they're
passing bibles out.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.010
So those people will be
detained, no question about it.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.040
But the group I was with
was working with the regime,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.680
cooperating with the regime.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.310
The whole deal was they're
going to basically fund

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.390
the education of the future
leaders of North Korea,

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.640
hoping one day they
will be converted.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.860
A perfect population,
really, because it's actually

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.350
a very, very devoutly faithful
people to their cause--

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.730
I mean the great leader.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.920
So when that great leader
falls, they will actually

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.670
convert to the next religion.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.120
So they made that deal So
they are not-- the regime

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.830
knows exactly who they are.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.790
They just do not proselytize.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.390
So it's just not
out in the open.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.010
So when I went in there
with them, I was, I guess,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.610
posing as one of
them, but also they

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.950
were kind of posing as
not being Christians

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.370
when they were out in the open.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.211
So it was a very
double situation.

00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:38.710
INTERVIEWER: And this line, I
think what I got from the book

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.230
was that the students are
very apt at lying as well.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.340
They're very good at lying, and
they lied to you constantly,

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.840
almost.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.360
And so it just felt, with the
students lying and the teachers

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.940
lying and you lying, it just
felt like a lot of lies.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.940
SUKI KIM: Truth and lies
was really a big theme.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.440
It's interesting, because I just
gave a TED Talk in Vancouver.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.140
And the theme of
this year was where

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.350
the Google founder
was, supposedly,

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.240
somewhere in the crowd.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.950
But their big theme
was truth and lie,

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.900
and that's the talk I gave.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.815
And it's because the whole
world is built on lies.

00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:19.660
The entire system of the great
leader, this entire country

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.430
runs according to the
myth of the great leader.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.540
And if that is a lie, then where
do you begin to know the truth?

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.590
And in order to
discover the truth,

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.140
I also had to pretend to be
something I'm not in order

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.550
to get to the truth.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.490
So the question
of truth and lies

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.550
does become a really
important theme

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.210
when you do more and
more, I guess, research,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.360
into the topic of North Korea.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.110
INTERVIEWER: Cool.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.515
And so who were the peoples
that you were teaching for--

00:04:46.515 --> 00:04:49.135
SUKI KIM: It ended up being--
I didn't know this going in.

00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:54.340
In 2011, which was
Juche year 100.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.570
What that means is they
count the calendars.

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.870
Juche is North Korea's
foundational philosophy,

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.665
meaning self-reliance,
which is why

00:05:02.665 --> 00:05:04.040
they're so isolated,
because they

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.380
don't rely on anybody else.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.170
They also count
the calendar system

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.320
according to their original
great leader's birth,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.840
so their calendar was different.

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.020
So 2011 was actually Juche year
100, although he died in 1994.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.770
To celebrate his birthday,
despite the fact he died,

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.670
they shut down every
university across North Korea

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.290
and sent all the
university students

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.400
into construction fields to
build North Korea's biggest

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.872
idea, which is a powerful
and prosperous nation, which

00:05:41.872 --> 00:05:43.080
is what they call themselves.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.060
To build that, they sent all
the kids to construction fields,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.380
except 270 young men, who
are the sons of the elite.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.240
And those were the boys--
I mean, they're 19 and 20.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.610
But those were the young
men I ended up living

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.590
with in this private location
where nobody was allowed out

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.215
of the premise.

00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:06.760
INTERVIEWER: So what did
you discuss with them?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.060
You were teaching them English.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.559
It was a science
university, but you

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:10.850
weren't teaching them science.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.230
And what was sort of the
day-to-day interactions

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.785
with them?

00:06:13.785 --> 00:06:14.140
What would you--

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.210
SUKI KIM: No.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.126
I mean, this just goes
back to the whole truth

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:16.890
and lies question.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.150
It's a university of
science and technology,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.410
but there were no
science teachers.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.530
A lot of their
majors were computer,

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.430
but they didn't know the
existence of the internet.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.980
So I did see people,
actually-- towards the end,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.540
they showed me a student
with a Google page, actually,

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.400
and he was Googling something.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.480
But when you talked to him
afterward, they didn't know.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.150
They would ask questions
like, how many movies can you

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.760
watch on the internet?

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.630
And how long is a movie that
you see on the internet?

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.660
Like that kind of questions.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.370
Clearly they're not
on the internet.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:01.880
So this was sort of the daily
existence of that school.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.620
Everything was watched 24/7.

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:10.300
Minders lived in the same
building as the teachers.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.080
Counterparts were
people who oversaw

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.800
all the lesson plans because you
had to get everything approved.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.550
Every class was recorded
and reported on.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.970
I had meals three times
a day with the students,

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:28.410
and it's me and three
students at each table.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:31.850
And that conversation
was reported on,

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:34.900
because they were
watching each other.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:38.600
So they have these critique
meetings at least once a week,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.530
where they then report
on what they've heard,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:43.260
what they have witnessed.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.120
So there wasn't a
single place you could

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.620
be where you had any privacy.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.030
And I taught English.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.420
That's the only subject that
got taught in that school.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.280
But, basically, their
schedules were mapped out.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.430
So they did tons and tons
of great leader duties

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.080
and great leader studies.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.260
And then they learned English.

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.410
And it was just
repetition of that.

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:11.190
It was a soldier-like
existence for them.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.940
INTERVIEWER: How much
of the outside world

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.550
could you discuss with them?

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.840
Did you try and sort of--

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.310
SUKI KIM: There were rules
and rules, as you can imagine.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.460
The rules and rules
just went on and on.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.270
And they just went from, you
know, you couldn't wear jeans,

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:26.240
because Kim Jong-il
really hated jeans,

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.300
because they were a symbol
of America, so not allowed

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.809
in that country.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:37.120
But things like, do
not compare ever.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.590
Like you wouldn't
say, oh, it's amazing.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.900
It's like this, because
back home, in my country,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.530
like, that's not allowed.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:46.170
Don't ever suggest
there's anything

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.150
wrong with their
country was another one.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.380
Never, ever discuss
the outside world.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.320
Do not ever talk to
somebody outside when

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.840
you're taken on a trip outside,
which teachers were taken

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:04.250
on trips on weekend, just to
get groceries, or great leaders

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.110
buildings, because
every building is

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:07.700
about a great leader
in North Korea.

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.840
So there were all
these rules to follow,

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.200
so there was nothing you could
talk about the outside world.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.580
But when you live with
someone for months and months

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:23.430
and months, and as a teacher,
where I could assign things,

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.020
with an approval that
I assigned letters.

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.620
I assigned essay writing
and compositions.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.830
Through those things and also
daily conversation over meals,

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:38.620
things start slipping out
and escaping, and thoughts.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.340
It was really more thoughts.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:43.414
And the people asked me, did
you see North Koreans starving?

00:09:43.414 --> 00:09:44.830
And I don't know
why people are so

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.560
curious about that,
because we know

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.280
there's an 80% food shortage.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.700
I don't think that's
what was fascinating.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:58.320
You know, yes, I was taken out
of Pyongyang on a school bus.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.040
And you can guess those
things from looking

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.806
at the really, really
malnourished people out

00:10:04.806 --> 00:10:05.940
in the distance.

00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:07.750
They're not going to
let you talk to them,

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.370
but you can see that.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.200
But I think it's more
what this kind of society

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.320
does to an individual
psychologically, I think,

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.980
is more what I was
there to find out,

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.940
which did become-- as we were
bonding, me and my students,

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.787
more and more, I think I did get
glimpses of their world more.

00:10:27.787 --> 00:10:29.370
INTERVIEWER: I think
what surprised me

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.620
about reading the book
was how even the elite,

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.600
they fear the society, and
they play by the rules.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.570
I think I'd assumed that those
nearly perhaps knew the game,

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.470
knew what was
going on, and would

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:41.840
be able to speak more freely.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.531
But they weren't able to.

00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:44.030
They--

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:47.150
SUKI KIM: I think it's amazing
how, in the rest of the world,

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:48.970
we get these reports
of North Koreans

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.960
are all sneaking DVDs
and watching soap operas,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.440
and they're all
like on cell phones.

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.320
And that I didn't see.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.440
Even if they did
not show that to me,

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.200
I didn't see how that
was going on so rampantly

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.900
in that country,
because what I saw

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.350
was such a tight control and
such a lack of knowledge.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.460
Even if they saw some
forbidden video somewhere,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.260
it's very clear to
me they just had

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.140
no concept of how--
for example, we all

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:20.879
had to-- in the Korean
culture, you make kimchi.

00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:23.170
I don't know if you guys know
that that's a Korean dish

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:24.730
that every family eats.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:27.200
And we make this massive
kimchi in November, and which

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.800
North Koreans do, too.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:32.840
And we all peeled
garlics together.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.770
But this was actually where
it was really complex,

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:38.860
because I felt like, that
age, 19-year-old college

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.700
students, boys,
to get all of them

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.730
to peel garlic so diligently
would be very hard in America.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.080
I don't know about England.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.420
But that would be
nearly impossible.

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:54.560
But they were so really
earnestly peeling garlic.

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.440
Because there, they said, if
we all make kimchi together,

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.040
it would be quicker.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.516
So those were, I think, positive
moments of what I observed.

00:12:02.516 --> 00:12:04.390
Even if that's obedience,
there was something

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.350
that was really heartwarming.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.820
But at the same time,
they would ask me things

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.970
like-- we had this really
lovely moment where they then

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:12.882
began discussing.

00:12:12.882 --> 00:12:14.590
Because it's a family
tradition in Korea.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.410
Everybody makes kimchi
together in November.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.330
And they said, you
know, their family

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.966
gets like 8 kilos of cabbages
delivered from the government.

00:12:23.966 --> 00:12:25.840
And then depending on
the size of the family,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.930
another family gets 12 kilos
of cabbages, government sends.

00:12:29.930 --> 00:12:32.880
And he said to me-- actually
the group of them asked me.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.270
They said, so what
about you, Professor?

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.175
How many kilos does
your government

00:12:37.175 --> 00:12:39.600
send-- cabbages
do they send you?

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.730
And I was like, you know,
in Manhattan, [CHUCKLES]

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.680
where I live, no, the New
York City government is not

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.990
sending me cabbages to
make kimchi every November.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:52.480
And I think it was moments like
that where I thought, you know,

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.430
this is not faking.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.050
This is not a
government propaganda.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:56.770
They really have no idea.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.950
And there were a lot
of moments like that,

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.970
which does make you realize
the-- and these were

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.720
the best and brightest.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.740
And so there were a lot of
moments like that where it just

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:09.680
was a different way.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.290
And they were not
getting information

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:13.160
about the outside world.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.990
INTERVIEWER: So the
campus that you were on

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.580
was-- I think one of things I
picked out that it was guarded

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.685
by female guards, which I
would have thoughts putting 19

00:13:20.685 --> 00:13:24.610
and 20-year-old young man
with their female equivalents

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.675
would've been a
recipe for disaster.

00:13:26.675 --> 00:13:27.880
But it didn't?

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.450
SUKI KIM: It didn't, actually.

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.120
I mean, as far as I know.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.030
I didn't see them ever mixing.

00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:35.890
And those women never
talked back to me.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:37.906
I basically don't
really know what

00:13:37.906 --> 00:13:39.280
the girls are like
in North Korea

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.580
because my only point of
reference were these boys.

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:46.960
And from what I understand,
what I understood,

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.940
because I was very curious
about that, that supposedly

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.350
the school-- why the schools
are allowed to be built

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.940
is really many, many reasons,
obviously, one of which

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.550
is government propaganda.

00:13:57.550 --> 00:14:00.370
So that the foreign
media that can come in

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.130
for a couple of days and film
the school, and the school

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:04.920
looks fantastic,
and the kids look

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.010
really healthy and beautiful.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:11.050
Then they can turn around
and say North Korea looks

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.060
like this, which it does not.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:15.540
So when they did get
male soldiers there

00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:20.340
to guard the place, I don't know
what they need guarding from

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.767
or to, because obviously
we're just not allowed out.

00:14:22.767 --> 00:14:24.350
So I felt like it
was the guard's work

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.930
to make sure we did not escape.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.530
Actually, they were
not protecting us.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.240
I mean, it the other way around.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:33.500
But they basically
didn't want men soldiers,

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:36.200
because they said it looked
too threatening, whereas women

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.710
soldiers are not threatening
to foreign eyes, supposedly.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.010
So that was a reason.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.440
And another reason nothing
happened between the boys

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.290
and the girls is because
there is such a class

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.550
difference in North Korea.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.970
It's called songbun, and the
family difference, basically

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:54.100
the girls came from much
lower class than the boys,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.850
and they just would not be
interested in each other.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.820
They're not the kind of
people who mix in that world.

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.709
So that's what I
understood it to be.

00:15:01.709 --> 00:15:03.500
INTERVIEWER: And what
was your relationship

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.960
like with the minders,
those who were sort

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.440
of watching over what you did?

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.180
And as an extension,
how much did you

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.850
feel watched, your emails,
your phone calls and so forth?

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.470
SUKI KIM: Well, you just--
you know, being in North Korea

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.380
is just a constant surveillance.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.140
So I don't know if
there was a camera.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.270
I definitely it was
tapped because they

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.890
would know the conversations.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:27.410
Or the minders, we were told
there are-- the teachers

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.680
had email and internet.

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:31.880
The students didn't
even know what it was.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.330
So even though our dorms were
right next to each other,

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:36.380
we were in a different
world, really.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.590
And our emails, the
teachers' emails,

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:44.140
we were told by the
administrators of the school

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:47.140
who were running the school,
told us to basically set up

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.620
a different email when
you go into North Korea,

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.300
because they can really
easily go into your accounts

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:52.820
and stuff.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.650
And you don't really want them
to have all of your friends

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:58.360
emails, too. [CHUCKLES] I
feel like my friends would

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.830
have all disowned me if
their privacy was jeopardized

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:03.560
like that.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.700
So in these emails
that you sent home,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.010
we were told to just
keep it minimum so

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:11.625
that people know you're safe.

00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:15.420
But the minders knew it
was a monitored connection.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.840
So I would say, for example,
I woke up today at 4:00 AM,

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.420
whatever.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.381
And then the minder
would repeat that to me.

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:24.880
He would say, oh, so did you
get up at 4:00 AM this morning?

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.500
You must be tired.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:31.630
So that does just wipe
out any sense of that--

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.884
and another thing
I realized there.

00:16:33.884 --> 00:16:35.800
You know, they do have
letters in North Korea,

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.260
for example, letter
system, postal system.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:39.900
But when I talked
to my students,

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.766
they didn't really
know what letters were.

00:16:41.766 --> 00:16:43.140
They didn't know
how to write it.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:44.880
They didn't really send them.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.330
And I realized these
communication methods,

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:49.730
we need privacy.

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.000
Letters do lose meaning.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.580
Emails do lose meaning when
everybody else can see it.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.460
Or it's like the
authority that can

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.320
punish you is
looking it over, then

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.920
that means of communication
loses that meaning.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.859
And that was a very--
you know, having--

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.680
even for teachers
having email access

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:10.161
wasn't really the same as
having email access here.

00:17:10.161 --> 00:17:11.619
INTERVIEWER: I
quite like the story

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:16.390
where you were very keen to
get in to watch "Harry Potter."

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.760
And there was an argument
with the teachers

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.400
who wanted to show them "The
Chronicles of Narnia" again.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.240
And I liked that the--
perhaps you could

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.750
talk about the differences
with the other teachers there

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.430
and also why the peoples were so
keen to watch the Harry Potter

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:31.320
film that connected
them to the world.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.810
SUKI KIM: I mean,
it's not-- sorry.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:34.226
I don't want you
to misunderstand.

00:17:34.226 --> 00:17:38.460
It's not like I'm a-- I mean,
I'm not a "Harry Potter" fan.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.250
But my students just did
not have access to anything.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.825
None.

00:17:43.825 --> 00:17:45.120
They were not allowed out.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.960
They were not allowed to keep
in touch with their family.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:47.790
They had nothing.

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.814
Basically I'm the
only thing they had,

00:17:49.814 --> 00:17:51.230
I realized more
and more and more.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.090
I really felt
motherly towards them.

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.910
And they, one by
one, towards the end,

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:59.030
kept asking me about Harry
and Ron and Hermione.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:03.470
And I was like, did these
kids-- where did you learn this?

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.480
And it only is because
in that school,

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.000
the textbook was chosen very
carefully that was approved.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.914
But it was an old dated textbook
that was once used in China.

00:18:14.914 --> 00:18:17.080
So anything that was used
in China, the North Korean

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.230
government let it go.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:20.630
It was very, very dated.

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:24.220
But you know those ESL
textbooks have little passages.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:25.931
And in those passages
were so dated,

00:18:25.931 --> 00:18:27.930
they would talk about
like, paying for something

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.340
with a $2 personal check in
the US, and things like that.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.020
And I would have to
just say, actually,

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.670
we don't do that anymore.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.850
But they actually talked
about "Harry Potter" in one

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.180
of those textbooks, supposedly.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.490
And because they had so little,
I realized a little information

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.030
about the outside
world, they really

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.130
soaked it up, like a sponge.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.980
So all of them
knew that there was

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:53.760
this phenomenon outside that
they had no idea about called

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.960
"Harry Potter."

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.762
The things they knew was
"Harry Potter," JK Rowling,

00:18:57.762 --> 00:18:58.470
and what is that?

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.469
The sports that they do.

00:18:59.469 --> 00:19:00.510
Kiddich or something?

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.850
INTERVIEWER: Quidditch, yeah.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.600
SUKI KIM: Quidditch.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.100
Yeah.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:04.610
Quidditch, and then Harry,
and Ron, and Hermione.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:06.026
But they would ask
me things like,

00:19:06.026 --> 00:19:07.570
so is Quidditch really fun?

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.460
And I would be like,
no, I don't play that.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.430
[CHUCKLES] So they were
really keen on this.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:16.230
And then by chance I found
out one of my colleagues

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:18.870
had-- younger
colleagues, actually,

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:23.320
from England had one of
the Harry Potter movies

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.680
on her, like a DVD.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.250
So then I applied to teach
that to the counterparts

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:32.260
because I said it's
mentioned in the textbooks.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:34.560
In order to finish my
lesson, it's important.

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:37.260
It's detrimental to
my lesson that they

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:39.270
understand what it is.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:41.669
And then it was actually
miraculously approved,

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:42.710
which I couldn't believe.

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:44.760
So the words just went
around the campus.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.440
They all were so excited.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.040
All day, I would get
like-- every day,

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.670
it's like, so when
are we watching

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.430
Harry and Hermione and Ron?

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:57.350
And then my colleagues,
the Evangelical fundamental

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.500
Christian group-- because there
were degrees in that group.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:03.630
Some were so much more
Orthodox than others.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.430
So more senior ones
actually came to me

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:08.040
and said this is unacceptable.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.320
It's not going to happen.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.320
Because they said they were
now aiming for "Narnia."

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.350
And "Narnia"--
I've never seen it,

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.300
but "Narnia" has a very
religious tone to it,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.530
overtone to it.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.720
So they absolutely
forbade me, and they

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.810
applied to teach
"Narnia," which then

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:29.150
got rejected by the North
Korean counterparts.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:31.470
So it was suddenly a
battle between "Narnia"

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:33.430
and "Harry Potter."

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:40.805
And "Narnia," once it got
rejected, I was given a choice.

00:20:40.805 --> 00:20:45.200
And the Orthodox group, they
really felt that it was filth.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:49.160
So I had these crying and crying
moment just arguing with them.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.270
Because I was like, I don't
think Harry Potter is evil.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.590
And they were like, it's filth.

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.340
And literally my
heart broke, I think,

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.030
because it was so censored.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:03.620
My kids, they couldn't
have one or the other,

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.520
because it was
complete censorship.

00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:07.470
They were just not
allowed this information.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:12.755
And I was given a choice to
show either one or the other.

00:21:12.755 --> 00:21:14.790
I taught two groups.

00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:18.812
Out of 270 young men, 50
were in my direct charge.

00:21:18.812 --> 00:21:21.270
So these are the kids that were
like my babies, 50 of them.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:23.080
And there were two
groups of them.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:28.640
And my colleagues, the
fundamentals Evangelicals said,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.870
choose one group.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.490
Then you can show it.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:37.650
So I was just really-- it was
a horrible choice to make,

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:41.020
because I have to choose
one group of boys.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.290
And I did battle
with that decision,

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:47.120
because I thought, how can I
break their hearts like that?

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.280
Because they were
so disappointed.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.850
And I thought, you know, better
show it to one group than none.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:57.960
That was a choice that had to be
made, like a "Sophie's Choice."

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.400
But they did see it.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.180
They marveled at watching it.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:05.604
And I thought they would
talk about things like the--

00:22:05.604 --> 00:22:08.145
because it was the third one,
which is really like, dramatic,

00:22:08.145 --> 00:22:09.540
the third installment.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.620
So I thought they would be
more fascinated by that.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.230
But in fact what was amazing
is because I had just been

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.290
teaching essay writing to them.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:19.070
And essay writing,
by the way, was

00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:21.910
impossible to teach because
they didn't understand

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:24.820
the whole concept of
coming on with an argument

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.380
and proving it with evidence.

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.820
That's what essays are about.

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.780
And that was impossible there
because critical thinking

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.450
is just not allowed.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.550
So we'd been battling with
essay writing so much.

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.120
So when we watched
"Harry Potter,"

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.700
there's a scene
where Hermione says,

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.260
I have to write essays for
Professor Snape's class.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.540
And that's the moment
the boys talked about.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:51.270
They're like, Hermione has to
write an essay, too, like us.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:53.330
And I really thought, uh.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:55.840
This is what the
government is denying them.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.480
Basically it was the connection.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.260
It was the first time I
think they saw a Western film

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.100
that they were-- they would only
get allowed things like "March

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:11.510
of Penguins" and "Lion King,"
because those are like a nature

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:13.280
film or the cartoon.

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:16.680
This was a normal--
like people film.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.470
And that's what they latched
onto, was the connection,

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.090
I thought.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:24.000
They really connected
with these kids like them.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.380
And I thought, that's what their
government is denying them--

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.170
complete blocking
them from relating

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.650
to the rest of the world.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.055
It was a heartbreaking moment.

00:23:34.055 --> 00:23:35.280
INTERVIEWER: Do you
want to show some photos

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.210
that we've got lined up?

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:36.600
SUKI KIM: Yeah.

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.710
I think a lot of them already
got shown somehow from that.

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:39.110
But we can just sort of--

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.800
INTERVIEWER: There you go.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.880
And then after that,
we'll take some questions.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.520
SUKI KIM: Yeah.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.540
INTERVIEWER: There's a mic
in the middle to go around.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.081
SUKI KIM: OK.

00:23:44.081 --> 00:23:47.810
So that's like in 2002 when
I first arrived in Pyongyang.

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.280
And that was actually the
60th birthday celebration

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.110
of Kim Jong-il.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:55.230
So she's holding the sign--
Sun of the 21st Century.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.090
And that's referring
to their great leader,

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:01.270
because great leader's
birthday is the Day of the Sun.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.390
So that's the original
great leader, Kim Jong-il,

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:04.960
who died in 1994.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.980
And his entire
philosophy, Juche,

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.570
is what North Korea is based on.

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.753
And that's Kim Jong-il
flowers because all

00:24:12.753 --> 00:24:16.020
of the great leaders have
flowers invented for them.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.650
So this was Ministry
of Railways display

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:23.440
of Kim Jong-il flowers to
celebrate Kim Jong-il's

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.570
60th birthday.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.030
There were hundreds
of these displays.

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.080
And I got taken to Kim Jong-il
flower exhibition, where

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.020
I was given an explanation
about every single

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:36.650
of those displays, which I think
might sound really fascinating.

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.690
But I tell you, after
about like seven or eight,

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.350
it's all the same because it's
all about the same flowers

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.310
and the same theme.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:45.720
You see another one like that.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:48.240
I mean, there were
so many of these.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.970
These are the Workers'
Party leaders.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:53.120
Back in 2002, when
I went in, I had

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.820
to do karaoke with those guys.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.170
And that was a whole
other experience

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.860
which I had to write about for
"New York Review of Books."

00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.675
INTERVIEWER: What did they sing?

00:24:59.675 --> 00:25:00.258
What did you--

00:25:00.258 --> 00:25:02.650
SUKI KIM: They were singing
obviously the only theme.

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:04.430
What do you think
their songs were about?

00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.520
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.300
SUKI KIM: Obviously,
the great leader.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.240
I, actually-- the
only song allowed.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.530
I couldn't sing any
American songs, obviously,

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.450
no English songs.

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.040
I don't know any
North Korean songs.

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.520
I could, but that
would have just

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.180
seemed weird, for
me to suddenly start

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.785
singing North Korean songs.

00:25:19.785 --> 00:25:21.900
But the only South
Korean song allowed

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.500
was actually a protest song
against the dictator regime

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.216
back in 1970s.

00:25:27.216 --> 00:25:29.090
And I thought that was
also very fascinating,

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.460
songs that was actually
about a different time.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.620
In South Korea, which also had
a dictatorship back in 1970s

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:37.640
against the government,
youth protest song,

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.410
now that was used for
propaganda in North Korea

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.750
later on, which I
thought was fascinating.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:45.484
Every mountain you get taken to.

00:25:45.484 --> 00:25:47.150
Well, I only got taken
to two mountains,

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.780
but they're the most
famous mountains.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:51.390
And I think this is the case
with the rest of the mountains

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:52.390
there.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:57.300
Every surface has those Kim
Jong-il stuff carved directly

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.210
on the surface of the mountain.

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.810
I think in Kumgangsan, which
is South Korea's-- I mean,

00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:07.240
the entire Korean peninsula's
most famous mountain has 4,000

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.880
such carvings all
across the surface.

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.470
So even the nature belongs
to the great leader.

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:16.075
And generally it's saying things
like the great hero, our Kim

00:26:16.075 --> 00:26:17.300
Jong-il, and stuff like that.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.500
I mean, it's not really that
complicated what it says.

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:22.740
So that's my kids.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.110
I think they're taking an exam.

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:26.090
That's like a typical classroom.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:29.700
Yeah, so there
was like a lesson.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.390
That's where the great leaders--
now there are two of them--

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.990
that are embalmed.

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:38.700
So you go in there, and
you have to bow to him,

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.700
and he's basically
lying there embalmed.

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.020
And it's very, very
cold inside, obviously,

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:48.030
because there's a
dead body in there.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.120
That's them watching
"Harry Potter" in my class.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.390
And you can only show, project
a movie very small there,

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.060
I realized.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.470
Because there's no
blank space anywhere.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.910
And so those are Kim
Jong-il Kim Il-sung

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:03.050
sayings, whatever they
said, which often like,

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:04.460
our country's the greatest.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.710
It's all stuff like that.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.730
It's not also that complicated.

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:11.690
So in every room, there's
those kind of fame and sayings

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:14.750
by great leaders or
they're portraits.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.840
And you cannot move them.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.691
So if you can't move them,
there is no full blank space

00:27:19.691 --> 00:27:20.190
anywhere.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:22.590
So you have to just
show it half the size

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.839
that you either can
watch at a big movie.

00:27:25.839 --> 00:27:27.130
So, I mean, we saw that before.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.840
But that walkway, I realized,
as I spent time there,

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.890
made sure that there was
no privacy because you

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:36.210
are seen everywhere.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:38.460
There are windows on
either side of that.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:42.370
So wherever you
are, you are seen.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:47.060
So that's my kids, a set of my
kids doing great leader duty.

00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.330
So there was a
building on campus

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:53.195
that was basically a great
leader, Kim Jong-il-ism study

00:27:53.195 --> 00:27:54.290
hall.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.000
So that's where you go and study
the study of the great leader,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.670
and they went there every day
to learn great leader studies.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:04.980
And six students took
turns to guard it 24/7.

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.510
So even if it's like
minus 40 degrees,

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:10.182
you stand outside and
guard the building.

00:28:10.182 --> 00:28:11.140
It's an empty building.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:16.000
And they put on the--
basically the party uniform

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.940
in order to guard the building,
because it's a holy duty.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.050
So actually, my last day
there, Kim Jong-il died.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.730
And that was a coincidence.

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.890
So I witnessed
the whole reaction

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.240
to Kim Jong-il's death.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.050
And that's their only
newspaper announcing

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.420
the death of Kim Jong-il,
which I ended up actually

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.675
getting a copy of.

00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:40.050
INTERVIEWER: As
you were leaving.

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:42.340
SUKI KIM: As I
was leaving, yeah.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.960
INTERVIEWER: Any questions?

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.960
As you move to the mic,
I will ask one question.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.590
Do you think that it's a
good thing or a bad thing

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:51.707
that tourism to North
Korea is increasing?

00:28:51.707 --> 00:28:53.290
Obviously that's
giving money to the--

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:53.800
SUKI KIM: Tourists.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.925
INTERVIEWER: Tourism, Yeah.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:01.450
SUKI KIM: I'm against
it, personally.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.190
That's my personal opinion.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:07.890
I think different engagement
methods are probably necessary.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.520
But tours?

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.300
I don't know what
there is to tour about.

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:15.930
I don't know about-- they called
them torture porn or something.

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:21.230
I think there's a term for that,
voyeurism with poverty tours.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.150
And it's a gulag
pretending to be a nation.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:28.960
And that money the tourists
spend, it might seem curious.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.430
But it's not that curious,
because you get taken

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.920
to the exact four, five sites.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.030
And it's just not that funny.

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.520
North Korea is literally a
gulag pretending to be a nation.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.980
And every penny you spend there
will go directly to the regime

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.650
to suppress and torture
and execute their people.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:53.930
So I do think actually that
tourist money is not money.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:56.506
It's bolstering the regime.

00:29:56.506 --> 00:29:58.710
INTERVIEWER: OK.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.330
AUDIENCE: I'm really
curious about storytelling.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.570
You mentioned that you showed
"Harry Potter" to them.

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:05.445
And I'm curious about
like-- because you only

00:30:05.445 --> 00:30:06.430
showed it to one class.

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.530
And I'm wondering, was it
retold to the other class?

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:13.120
And how did that story
kind of propagate, and how

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.760
does storytelling generally
work within that kind

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.445
of environment?

00:30:18.445 --> 00:30:19.570
SUKI KIM: What do you mean?

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.970
The storytelling of
whatever happens?

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:23.650
I mean, it's an
important method there.

00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:27.295
One of the things actually
they did to amuse themselves,

00:30:27.295 --> 00:30:30.370
which seems, really,
you know, they're kind

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:32.130
of too old for it-- 19, 20.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.370
But they did tell stories
to amuse themselves.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:35.590
They did nothing else.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.280
So they told me in
evenings, they-- there

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.910
was a little free
time they gather

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:43.440
to watch their television, which
is all about the great leader.

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:46.600
So I think a lot of
times with the TV on,

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.410
they did little games and stuff.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:51.470
But they said they
would do stories.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.536
They would make like
one is playing a boy.

00:30:53.536 --> 00:30:54.660
Like almost like a theater.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.430
But they would tell stories,
like little made-up theater

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.180
to entertain themselves.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.526
I mean, it seems so not
2015 kind of an amusement,

00:31:04.526 --> 00:31:05.400
but they did do that.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.340
So it is, actually,
I think a way they

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.950
do entertain themselves there.

00:31:13.109 --> 00:31:13.650
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:14.470
Fascinating stuff.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.970
Thanks so much.

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.310
I wondered just a bit
more about sort of whether

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:21.100
or not your sense of whether
or not people actually

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.240
question anything.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.930
Because you talked
about the fact

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.360
that they are totally isolated.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.390
That isn't like some
fake they just don't

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:29.830
know what's going on outside.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:32.288
But do you get any sense of
that they're actually beginning

00:31:32.288 --> 00:31:34.550
to question what's going on?

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:36.260
Like what are they looking for?

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:38.770
For example, when
they couldn't watch

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:42.130
"Harry Potter," that class,
the authorities had said no.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.090
Is that something that
actually upset them

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.610
and made them think about it?

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:50.174
Or did they just have total
obedience to their leadership?

00:31:50.174 --> 00:31:51.090
SUKI KIM: It is there.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:55.290
Of course it's there, the
doubt against the regime.

00:31:55.290 --> 00:32:00.180
But it is so squashed
that-- you know,

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:03.071
there are different
levels of that.

00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:05.320
Number one is actually
something that we didn't finish

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.680
talking about, which is lies.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.030
My students lied all the time.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.230
There were different
levels of lies.

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.230
One, they lied because
they were always

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.795
fearful of-- like the
guard duty, for example.

00:32:17.795 --> 00:32:19.170
They would do
those guard duties,

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.940
and they would say
they didn't do it,

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:22.230
although I saw them do it.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.310
So it was such a lie
that made no sense.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:29.710
Or they would say like, I
cloned a rabbit in fifth grade.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:31.890
And, you know,
just nonsense lies.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:35.750
But I think they were
regurgitating those lies.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.450
Or sometimes they
lied out of habit.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.720
So this whole lying culture
does make it very difficult

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.550
to see what's really going on.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.700
And that's a part of the
whole propaganda thing.

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:48.250
And you constantly have to
pretend to do something else.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.040
It creates a shield,
and you can't really

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.300
see what's going on.

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.520
So that lying culture made
that really difficult.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:57.580
But I think the more and
more I was there, I did

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.597
think there were
slight questions why.

00:33:00.597 --> 00:33:01.680
Because they would ask me.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.460
Of course they could see
that I'm traveling freely.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.460
And they're not.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:06.835
They're not even
allowed to leave

00:33:06.835 --> 00:33:08.710
their-- none of
those kids had ever

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:10.750
been to any of those mountains.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:11.660
And these are elite.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:13.940
They've never been to
their country's most famous

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.770
mountains, because
they're not allowed.

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:17.530
So I think they
did question that.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:20.410
But the questions
that-- I mean, I

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.675
think this is probably our
best way to think about it.

00:33:22.675 --> 00:33:24.174
I think two ways
is probably easiest

00:33:24.174 --> 00:33:26.760
to think about that question,
which gets asked most often.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:28.230
How much do they really know?

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.220
I think humanity is not
that different anywhere.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.920
But this is all they've
known and born into.

00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:39.059
So even though they might
question for a second,

00:33:39.059 --> 00:33:41.100
within that context, I
think if you think of them

00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.350
as the most abused household.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:48.760
So if you've basically been
born and bred in endless abuse--

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.980
physically, and
emotionally, psychologically

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.830
beaten every single
day-- that I think

00:33:52.830 --> 00:33:56.240
it is really hard to
fathom what else is there.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.520
So there's that level.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.754
But I think also the
control that they have,

00:34:00.754 --> 00:34:03.170
making sure you don't move,
physically, because you're not

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:04.480
allowed to move anywhere.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.497
Make sure you don't share any
information, because you're not

00:34:07.497 --> 00:34:08.420
allowed.

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.909
And I think that just binds you.

00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:12.860
You become helpless.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.690
There's not much you can do.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:17.245
And I think also the punishment
is so great when there's

00:34:17.245 --> 00:34:19.460
a gulag, and there's
public execution,

00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:21.500
and also you report
on each other.

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:23.320
So I think that all
those doubts-- I

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:25.650
did see little inklings of it.

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.000
But it gets squashed so quickly.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.610
I mean, it's just like there's
not a-- it's like so rapid.

00:34:31.610 --> 00:34:34.070
It's a moment of a
flicker, and it's gone.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:36.360
And I think it's
because punishment is--

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.580
and so in answer to that,
I think it's like us.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.340
It's not that different
on some level,

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.679
but it's so
tremendously different.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:47.659
And the punishment is
beyond what we can fathom.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:50.409
And if you are
living in a gulag,

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:53.199
and one thing you say
wrong would get you

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:57.340
and your family and
everyone you know killed,

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.333
then you would probably not
express more than a second.

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:03.970
AUDIENCE: Just another
super quick question,

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.050
which may just be a yes or no.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:08.890
Do you think this regime
will fall in our lifetime?

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.000
SUKI KIM: I mean, the world
has been questioning that.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.430
So I don't-- I mean, I cannot--
I don't think that I say that

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.480
authoritatively, but having
studied this topic as long as I

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.100
could stand it and
having been there,

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.710
I've also talked to
all the defectors,

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.501
traveled to all of the
surrounding regions.

00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:30.022
I mean, I've just been
following it for over a decade.

00:35:30.022 --> 00:35:34.760
And I just feel like
that's up to us.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.010
I think I did come to a
conclusion by living in there.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.820
I don't know if it
could come from inside.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:43.680
You might see little
flickers, but that flicker

00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.820
gets squashed so quickly.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.080
I think whoever talks about
North Korea's spring compared

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.090
to Arab spring or
compared to Cuba

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:53.470
or compared to East Germany,
West Germany, all of that,

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:56.170
I personally think that's
nonsense because we've never

00:35:56.170 --> 00:35:57.300
seen anything like this.

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:00.780
A gulag concentration camp
in existence for 70 years?

00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.040
That's a different
animal altogether.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.970
This goes back to why
backpacking, touring into North

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.690
Korea, I'm against it.

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:11.860
So I don't know if it
could fall on its own.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.620
But I do think-- I
find it a little-- I

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.050
mean, one of the reasons
for writing this book,

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:20.140
and it is a bit nutty thing
to do to go in there, I think,

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:20.780
undercover.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.230
But I think I just find
it morally unacceptable

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:29.870
that world is there, and
the rest of us are here.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.700
There's something really
deeply disturbing about

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:37.060
that, I think just
humanity in general,

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:39.610
because I think it's horrific.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:40.421
So I don't know.

00:36:40.421 --> 00:36:42.170
I don't think they can
do it on their own,

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:45.401
but I think the world can
maybe make that happen.

00:36:45.401 --> 00:36:47.150
I think the first step
is caring about it,

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:49.691
caring about the issue, and then
maybe something will change.

00:36:49.691 --> 00:36:50.260
I don't know.

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:52.340
But I think it's up to us.

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:55.569
INTERVIEWER: Thanks a lot.

00:36:55.569 --> 00:36:56.110
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:56.110 --> 00:36:57.832
Thanks for being here today.

00:36:57.832 --> 00:36:59.790
My question has to do
with academic curriculum.

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.780
I wonder if you can expound
a bit about, if you know,

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.240
what the average
14-year-old learns.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.240
And the reason I
ask is because it's

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.010
been said that knowledge
is power, and all this.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:12.940
I think if it's a
subject like math, where

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:15.730
it can be taught rotely,
and you learn the facts,

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:19.945
and it never sort of expands
your mind into the world-- one

00:37:19.945 --> 00:37:20.570
interpretation.

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:22.729
But something like
literature or economics,

00:37:22.729 --> 00:37:24.770
how can you learn those
subjects without thinking

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:26.400
about the world?

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:29.409
And is it done that way?

00:37:29.409 --> 00:37:31.450
SUKI KIM: I think that's
another-- because people

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:34.030
do ask me about reunification.

00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:35.330
What do I think?

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:38.220
And I think that goes back
to that education thing.

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.020
Like where do we begin?

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:42.690
Because what I
saw there was it's

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:47.570
not possible to teach economics
and literature without bringing

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:48.990
the world in there.

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:52.690
So if they have the
basic information--

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:53.550
they were so bright.

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:55.610
I mean, they learned
English so quickly.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:57.290
They worked so hard.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:59.330
But their general
knowledge had a gap

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:02.950
that I just could
not understand.

00:38:02.950 --> 00:38:08.330
They thought scientists changed
blood type A to B-- North

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.280
Korean scientists, of course.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.170
So if you teach that to
students in a science class,

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:19.930
or they learned basketball
makes them grow taller.

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:24.260
So, I mean, it's basically
teaching nonsense.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:28.717
Because in order to teach
economics or science or any

00:38:28.717 --> 00:38:30.550
of these things-- how
can you teach computer

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:33.220
without telling them about
Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.250
or the internet or any of it?

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:39.660
So I did not-- and literature,
out of the question.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.650
The only book they are
allowed to learn that is not

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:46.450
North Korean was
"Disappeared with the Wind"--

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:49.970
"Gone with the Wind," which
is about North and South

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:54.530
civil war, where North wins.

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:57.740
There's all reasons why only
that information is allowed.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:01.010
So, I mean, what
literature do they know?

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.910
Only the great
leader's literature.

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:06.110
So I don't think that education
as we know it exists there.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.872
Because their system is
designed in order to uphold

00:39:09.872 --> 00:39:11.080
the myth of the great leader.

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.100
In order to uphold
that, they need

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:14.960
to make their students dumb.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.530
And that was really
difficult to stomach,

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:21.760
because they were so bright,
they were so sweet, so lovely.

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.303
They just did not
know much of anything.

00:39:24.303 --> 00:39:25.136
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:29.620
AUDIENCE: Hi Suki.

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.770
My name is Arvin.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:35.180
I had a quick question about
the "Harry Potter" movie again.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.960
I was wondering, was parts
of the movie censored?

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.210
Because I know it's
a fictional movie,

00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:43.990
so I guess that's why it
was allowed, because it kind

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.340
of shows a fictional world.

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.460
But the beginning
of the movie shows

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.790
parts of London, people
taking the train,

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:53.270
and they're living in houses
and interacting with each other.

00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:54.660
I was wondering,
were those parts

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.229
of the movie
completely censored?

00:39:56.229 --> 00:39:56.770
SUKI KIM: No.

00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:00.080
Amazingly, the North Korean
staff just let it happen.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.400
Because I think it was
mentioned in the textbook.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.180
So they were just kind of
bureaucrats with that one--

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.750
luckily passed it.

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:08.400
And they could have
easily said no.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.470
But I think some of it, I
was thinking at the time--

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.050
because it's also
a little mythical.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.760
It's not kind of
real London, is it?

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.500
Obviously not.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:19.050
It's Harry Potter's London.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:23.540
So I think that's why it was
kind of magic thing made it

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:29.510
better than like a normal
today's London visuals, which

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:31.766
they wouldn't have wanted.

00:40:31.766 --> 00:40:33.030
AUDIENCE: One other question.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.276
Was the movie screened
in English or--

00:40:35.276 --> 00:40:37.400
SUKI KIM: Yeah, because
they were learning English.

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:39.420
So that was a part
of an English lesson.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.503
AUDIENCE: And I saw on the
picture there was text.

00:40:41.503 --> 00:40:43.870
Was that North Korean text
so they could understand,

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:45.677
or were they speaking
fluent English?

00:40:45.677 --> 00:40:47.010
SUKI KIM: What do you mean text?

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:47.590
There was--

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.285
AUDIENCE: I think on the
picture there was subtitles.

00:40:50.285 --> 00:40:52.160
SUKI KIM: The pictures
didn't have subtitles.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:55.470
I think it was my
writing to explain maybe

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:56.430
in Korean or something.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:57.870
No, there was no subtitle.

00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:59.570
No, they understood the movie.

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:01.900
Their English was very good.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.110
AUDIENCE: And last question.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:04.651
It might be a more
personal question.

00:41:04.651 --> 00:41:09.760
I was wondering, like coming
back to the Western world

00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:12.705
and writing this book and
speaking about your experience,

00:41:12.705 --> 00:41:17.840
do you ever feel that you're
threatened or exposed?

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.340
Like--

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:18.740
SUKI KIM: Me?

00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:19.365
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:19.365 --> 00:41:22.160
SUKI KIM: Well, that was always
a part of the whole thing.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.530
I think obviously being
there was the worst of it.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:31.640
Consequences were frightening.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:37.130
So when one side started
following this topic

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:41.660
and deciding to write a
book, that scary part of it,

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.970
which I was scared, every
single day, of being there.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:46.450
And sometime after when
the book was coming out,

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:47.685
I was getting threats.

00:41:47.685 --> 00:41:48.761
So it was scary.

00:41:48.761 --> 00:41:51.260
AUDIENCE: Where you getting
like emails from the government?

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:54.530
SUKI KIM: I was getting emails
from the head of that school,

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:59.220
who are working with the regime
to absolutely stop publication,

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.840
send the manuscript to them.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.967
And it was threatening.

00:42:03.967 --> 00:42:04.800
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:05.811
SUKI KIM: Thanks.

00:42:05.811 --> 00:42:08.220
INTERVIEWER: Do you regret
that you can't go back?

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:09.160
SUKI KIM: Oh, I'm
not going back, no.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:10.090
INTERVIEWER: No,
but did you regret

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:11.430
that you can't go back again?

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.890
SUKI KIM: No, because I
feel like I poured myself

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:17.280
into-- this whole
project took, I think,

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.650
12 years from the beginning.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.358
INTERVIEWER: Wow.

00:42:19.358 --> 00:42:23.410
SUKI KIM: And I threw
everything I know

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:26.140
into this book on the topic.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:30.430
So there isn't really much
more I can say at the moment,

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:31.570
I think.

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:35.590
I got to understand it, I think,
as I possibly humanly could.

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:38.360
So I think if I do go back,
maybe something would have

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.180
changed in that
world, or something

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.500
in different circumstances,
so I can find different truth.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:47.260
INTERVIEWER: We'll take--
oh-- these questions,

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:48.510
but make them shorter.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.265
OK.

00:42:49.265 --> 00:42:50.640
AUDIENCE: My
question is actually

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:51.340
related to fear as well.

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:52.950
Because presumably,
those kids must

00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:58.180
live under such constant fear
all the time and distress.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.320
Did you see it
manifested in any way?

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.490
SUKI KIM: Did I see what?

00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:02.510
AUDIENCE: Did you
see it manifested?

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:03.424
How did it manifest?

00:43:03.424 --> 00:43:05.090
SUKI KIM: The fear,
how did it manifest.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.719
The fears manifested-- the
fears were every second.

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:10.510
The fears-- you know,
I think it's amazing.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:12.680
Human beings, one of
the most primal feelings

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:15.550
that we can sense is fear.

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:18.030
And I felt that
so strongly there.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:20.240
So I mean, a very, very moment.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:21.220
It's in the book.

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:23.590
When they say, what do
you sing when you all

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:25.165
get together to
celebrate birthday,

00:43:25.165 --> 00:43:27.590
because that's what they
do, or do storytelling.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:31.240
And they said, you know,
songs about the great leader.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.820
And one time, one student
said rock and roll.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.990
And the whole table froze.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.510
And that moment
was absolute fear.

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:41.840
Like my heart sank
when he said that.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.320
Because he just looked around
to see who else heard it,

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:46.550
and I looked around.

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.510
And I remember just my whole
body-- my feet felt cold.

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:53.180
Because I realized that he could
be punished because of this.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.680
We all changed the
topic instantly.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.550
But it was moments like
that, something so tiny.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.959
But the fear there was palpable.

00:43:59.959 --> 00:44:00.750
You could touch it.

00:44:03.584 --> 00:44:04.375
AUDIENCE: Hi, Suki.

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:06.820
Thank you for your
really fascinating talk.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.570
I just wanted to
ask you, have you

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.200
been involved in any
political activism

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.070
off the back of
all the attention

00:44:12.070 --> 00:44:13.720
that the book is getting?

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.930
Because I can
imagine-- I mean, we

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:18.550
talk about the Holocaust
and the Second World War

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:19.989
constantly, even to this day.

00:44:19.989 --> 00:44:22.280
And like you mentioned, this
is even greater than that.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.260
It's been going on for 70 years.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.300
And we still talk
about the guilt

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:32.820
about how come we didn't go into
help Poland, Netherlands, all

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:34.610
the Second World War still.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.550
And this is on a
much bigger scale.

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.510
So does the book affect
anything politically?

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:44.200
Is there any move into
maybe the UN or the US

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.800
or anyone going in there after--

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:52.640
SUKI KIM: I think as my job,
I mean, the best I could do

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:58.140
was vividly deliver that
world in the deepest

00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:02.470
way I know how to the world
so the world can feel.

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:06.950
I always said the purpose
was to humanize North Korea.

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.410
So through this book,
if people can actually

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.200
feel humanly feelings
towards the people there,

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.220
25 million people, who
have now become, sadly,

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:18.760
butt of Kim Jong-il jokes,
which are really tiresome.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.970
And so I think that, as
a writer, that's the most

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:22.550
I can do.

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:24.930
And also bring
back-- another one

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:27.910
that I-- you know, the
reason we have North Korea

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.360
is because there
was a Korean War.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:33.410
And the truth about the Korean
War, which the world calls

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:35.930
"forgotten war," and
this forgotten war,

00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:38.360
millions of people got
separated and died.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:40.450
And where it really
began has a lot

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:43.970
to do with actually the
Second World War remapping

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.780
of colonial powers,
starting with the UK,

00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:51.410
actually, and China
and ultimately

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:54.840
the US and Soviet Union.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.930
And that remapping created
the division of two Koreas.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.620
It's never a civil war.

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:02.950
And how it affected
that decision that

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:05.840
began from the Cairo
Conference, where

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.240
it began in 1943,
with remapping,

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.840
and how it resulted in
the division of a country.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:14.970
And that ended up separating
millions of families

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:17.820
and created today's North Korea.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:19.570
And I thought, you
know, all I can

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:23.110
do is to relate that
in a readable way

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:26.030
so that people begin
thinking about it

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:30.320
and thinking a little
more deeply about why

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.930
we have this tragedy today.

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.640
And I don't think--
I mean, I don't know.

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:37.390
Like, political
activism, I think

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:39.320
that's for activists to do.

00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:42.010
As a writer, all I can
do is write the best book

00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:44.596
I know how on the topic.

00:46:44.596 --> 00:46:45.512
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much again.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.550
Given that your students can be
quite directly linked to you,

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:57.360
even if you try to cover
things up in the book,

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.112
it seems that there's
a risk for them.

00:46:59.112 --> 00:47:01.070
Do you know if there have
been any consequences

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:01.820
for your students?

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.800
SUKI KIM: The consequences
from this book

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.180
was something that was
brought up from the beginning,

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:07.950
right away.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:10.990
It was obviously the
foremost on my mind.

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:12.700
People questioned a
lot the consequences

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:14.950
for it, actually, the
Evangelical Christians

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:17.320
who brought me in.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:20.700
I mean, clearly that group
works with the government.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.050
So it's not like the
fact they were missionary

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:24.120
was ever a secret.

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:25.071
I didn't out them.

00:47:25.071 --> 00:47:27.570
I'm sure it's unpleasant for
them to have the book come out,

00:47:27.570 --> 00:47:30.620
because it's made,
probably, things difficult.

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.680
But, you know, the
book was worth it.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.430
But it was not going
to sabotage them

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:37.340
in any way that has to do
with real consequences.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:41.140
I would think probably moneywise
it might have been hard

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.240
for them on some level to
have to raise more money

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:45.336
for the regime on some level.

00:47:45.336 --> 00:47:48.990
But kids, the students,
was my foremost concern.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:51.710
They were really like my kids.

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:54.880
And I felt--
everything about them

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:58.360
is blurred and edited
out so that you

00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.360
can't tell who's who at all.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.860
Apart from that, when
you read the book,

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.070
the kids come across
loyal to the regime.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:08.970
So they're basically
is nothing to fault

00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:12.880
them, as an entire group,
which is how they come across.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.930
It was hard to do,
because individually, they

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:16.200
were so adorable.

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:19.660
And as a writer, doing
characterization,

00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:21.740
there were just little
habits and little sayings,

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:24.390
little dialogues that happened
there that was just so lovely,

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:28.225
and I wanted to portray
that unique loveability.

00:48:28.225 --> 00:48:31.090
But, you know, that had to be
sacrificed so that they become

00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:33.970
very blurry, one
group of people,

00:48:33.970 --> 00:48:35.410
who are loyal to the regime.

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:37.430
So I think I protected them.

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:39.390
I felt confident with that.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:40.482
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:40.482 --> 00:48:42.046
INTERVIEWER: Last question.

00:48:42.046 --> 00:48:42.860
AUDIENCE: Hi, Suki.

00:48:42.860 --> 00:48:45.110
Thank you very
much for your talk.

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:47.326
My question was
regarding something

00:48:47.326 --> 00:48:48.950
you wrote at the
beginning of the book,

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:52.490
where you said when you came
to New York from South Korea,

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:54.490
you felt this was not home.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:57.300
And then you went back
to South Korea for a bit,

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:59.570
and you didn't feel
that was home either.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:01.070
Did you get some
sense of closure

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:03.065
from having done this
project to yourself?

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.140
SUKI KIM: Yes and no, I think.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:10.840
I think that when
you do lose a home--

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.240
and I think that loss is
something that obviously was

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:18.740
a motivation for writing
the book, but also

00:49:18.740 --> 00:49:22.430
is a bigger question, even in
the whole history of the two

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:23.740
Koreas.

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:27.740
I think when you do
lose home as a child,

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.340
I don't know if you
can get that back.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:34.070
But I guess through
writing, you look for it.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:37.530
And that search
is a temporary way

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:41.840
to appease that lost feeling.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:43.880
But I'm not sure if I
did get the closure.

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.820
As far as looking for truth
for injustice of that world,

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:50.940
I think I did get a closure.

00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:54.465
Because it was never
satisfying to go--

00:49:54.465 --> 00:49:56.590
I did cover the New York
Philharmonic in Pyongyang,

00:49:56.590 --> 00:49:58.700
for example.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.075
There was nothing
to write about that

00:50:01.075 --> 00:50:03.200
unless I wanted to be a
publicist for North Korea's

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.761
regime, which I really
think that's what they want.

00:50:05.761 --> 00:50:07.260
All these articles
about North Korea

00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:09.430
that comes out after
like a three-day trip

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.680
is what I could manage to do.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.950
But I think by living there and
understanding the place deeper,

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:18.860
that closure did happen
through this book.

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:19.990
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.360
INTERVIEWER: Cool.

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:22.318
Please join me in thanking
Suki Kim for coming.

00:50:22.318 --> 00:50:23.470
[APPLAUSE]
