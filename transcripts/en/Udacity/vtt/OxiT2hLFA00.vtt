00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.864
In interactive rendering systems, a color is defined by three values: red, green

00:00:05.864 --> 00:00:10.537
and blue, abbreviated RGB. Each color value is often called a channel. These

00:00:10.537 --> 00:00:16.145
values are usually in this order in most systems, RGB. That said, once in awhile

00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:20.718
you'll run into data in the order BGR, blue, green, red. Which is RGB's evil

00:00:20.718 --> 00:00:24.708
twin. Without properly swapping the channels, you'll see some odd-looking

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:28.760
images, such as this one on the right. The green stem looks fine, since the

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.532
green channel is in the same place, but what was once red is now blue. Okay, now

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:38.292
you've been warned. We usually define colors in one of two ways, as floating

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:42.500
point numbers or as integers. We'll start with floating points, since that's

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.053
generally the easier one to understand.
