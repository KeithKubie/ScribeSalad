00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.960
So just because a trait has a frequency of zero, meaning it's not seen at

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.250
all. Doesn't mean that, that allele isn't

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.220
still in the gene pool just floating around.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.970
&gt;&gt; Exactly and this brings us back to the concept of genetic diversity.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.640
Remember from our pedigrees we learned that it's not a good idea to

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.850
keep genes within a family tree.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.460
Because those recessive genes that cause recessive

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.130
traits, right, they need other recessive genes

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.220
to make those recessive traits show up.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.380
And that's going to happen when the gene pool stays small.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.240
&gt;&gt; That's why you need to reproduce with somebody outside

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.700
of your immediate family tree to have more options of genes.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.840
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and random mating and human travel around the world

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.380
does a pretty good job at mixing and matching these various alleles.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.600
&gt;&gt; Every once in a while a selection happens and survival

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.540
of the fit enough cuts out some of the weaker alleles.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.410
&gt;&gt; This definitely happens, but there's a lot of allele frequency

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.660
changes from random selection events, too. take

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.340
these flies buzzing around as a good example.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.325
&gt;&gt; [Splats]

00:01:00.325 --> 00:01:06.130
&gt;&gt; case in point. before Lauren swatted the flies, the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.070
was roughly 50% of one color versus another color. But

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.000
her hand indiscriminately killed a lot of the bugs and

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.388
now what's left over is 25% of one color and

00:01:17.388 --> 00:01:17.960
75% of another.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.360
&gt;&gt; Oops. It's okay. But this is a great example of how

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.480
it was a completely random event. The color of the bug had

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.360
no bearing on whether or not the bug died. She just indiscriminately

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.590
smacked. So the change in frequency is a result of random selection.
