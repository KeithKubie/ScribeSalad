00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.340
So let us look at the result of the kind of learning technique we

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.280
are discussing here. Here might be the old concept of a cup.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.015
In this particular case, this particular concept definition has been put

00:00:10.015 --> 00:00:14.430
in the form of a production rule. Here is the new, concept definition for

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.790
a cup. This is almost identical to the previous definition,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.540
except that now the object not only has a handle, but also the handle is fixed.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.070
This is similar in many ways to incremental concept learning.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.380
You may recall that in incremental concept learning that any particular stage of

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.830
processing there was a concept definition. As new examples came,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.560
then the concept definition changed depending on the new example and

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.040
the current concept definition. Note that in this matter of concept revision,

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.060
the number of features in this if clause may become very, very large,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.620
very quickly. Here we have object has a handle and handle is fixed.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.840
We could keep on adding additional features, with the interior is blue,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.090
that cover all the positive experiences. The difficulty is,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.220
at the present time there is no understanding for why the fact that handle is

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.300
fixed is an important part of the cup definition. This requires an explanation.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.140
Why is it that the handle being fixed is an important part of the definition of

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.890
a cup? This is one of the key differences between knowledge-based AI and

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.010
other schools of AI. Classification is ubiquitous in many schools of

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.645
AI as we have discussed earlier. Explanation however is a key characteristic of

00:01:24.645 --> 00:01:29.520
knowledge-based AI. Explanation leads to deeper learning. It not only says here

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.710
are the features that result in a concept definition, it also says and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.509
here is why these features are important for a concept definition.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.140
This brings us to the second question on learning from failures. Now we want

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.240
the agent to explain why a particular fault in its knowledge led to its failure.
