00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:02.628
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:02.628 --> 00:00:05.523
is get some practice
subtracting multi-digit numbers

00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:10.151
I'm going to use 1000
minus 528 as our example.

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:12.385
But really to understand
different methods and how they

00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:15.317
all fit together, why
it actually makes sense.

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:18.257
So if you wanted to visualize
what this difference

00:00:18.257 --> 00:00:22.506
means, imagine something
that has a length of 1000

00:00:22.506 --> 00:00:26.673
some type of units, so it's
length right over here is 1000

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.085
and we were to take away 528 from that.

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:36.795
So 528 from that is what
we take away and so this

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:40.467
difference would be well
what do we have left over.

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:42.603
So this is equal to question mark.

00:00:42.603 --> 00:00:44.740
And I'm going to do it two different ways.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.047
I'm going to do it using
a table with place value

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:49.314
and I'm also going to do
it using what's sometimes

00:00:49.314 --> 00:00:51.845
called the standard method
it's the way that people often

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:54.990
learn to subtract numbers
like this especially if we're

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.020
going to have to do some removing.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.066
So I'm actually going to
do them simultaneously

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.156
for your benefit, alright.

00:01:01.156 --> 00:01:04.117
So let me just write out our
table with our place values.

00:01:04.117 --> 00:01:08.967
So first of all you have your
thousands place, thousands.

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:11.849
And let me square off
the numbers here that are

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:15.447
in the thousands place so
that 1000 right over there,

00:01:15.447 --> 00:01:17.561
that's one in the thousands place.

00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:22.088
Then you have your hundreds
place, hundreds place,

00:01:22.088 --> 00:01:25.700
and this number I have zero
hundreds right now here I have

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.867
five hundreds.

00:01:27.847 --> 00:01:32.014
And then you have your
tens place, tens, zero tens

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:37.710
right there in the tens place,
two tens right over there.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.822
And then of course you
have your ones place.

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:46.470
Here I have zero ones,
here I have eight ones.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.455
Now let me also rewrite these
numbers and I'm going to do it

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:50.324
using the standard method.

00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:53.991
So I have 1000 and then
I have zero hundreds

00:01:56.024 --> 00:01:59.852
I have zero tens and I have zero ones.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:04.019
And from that I am going to
subtract five hundreds, five

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.316
hundreds, two tens, two tens,
and eight ones, eight ones.

00:02:16.897 --> 00:02:19.474
So let's do both of
these at the same time,

00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:23.343
make a little bit of a
table right over here.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.010
So that is my table.

00:02:26.976 --> 00:02:29.249
So let's start with what
we originally have, we have

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.389
1000 that's what we're subtracting from.

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.488
Well on this table I would
just represent as that

00:02:33.488 --> 00:02:37.456
as 1000, now we want to take
five hundreds and two tens

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:41.489
and eight ones from it, how do we do that?

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.113
'Cause right now we have no
hundreds, we have no tens,

00:02:44.113 --> 00:02:46.389
and we have no ones.

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.465
And with the standard method
we have the same problem

00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:51.553
'cause we start in the ones
place we say hey we want

00:02:51.553 --> 00:02:53.599
to take eight ones from zero
ones, similar problem here.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.584
How do we take eight ones here?

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:57.918
Similarly we want to take
two tens from zero tens,

00:02:57.918 --> 00:03:01.702
how do we do that here and
the answer is regrouping.

00:03:01.702 --> 00:03:04.484
What we want to do is break
up this thousand and so we can

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.764
start to fill in these
other categories it's like

00:03:06.764 --> 00:03:09.953
exchanging monies that's
sometimes an example used.

00:03:09.953 --> 00:03:13.089
So 1000 is how many hundreds?

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.587
Well if we get rid of this
thousands I can break it up

00:03:15.587 --> 00:03:20.116
into ten hundreds, so one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:22.116
seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:03:22.993 --> 00:03:25.445
And so that's equivalent
of I could get rid of this

00:03:25.445 --> 00:03:29.123
1000 or this one in the
thousands place and give myself

00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:30.206
ten hundreds.

00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:33.603
Well that starts to solve my
problem 'cause I could now

00:03:33.603 --> 00:03:36.672
take five hundreds from this,
I could take five from ten.

00:03:36.672 --> 00:03:40.190
Five hundreds from ten
hundreds, but I still have

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.905
the problem in the tens
and the ones place.

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:46.784
And so what I could do is I
could break up one of these

00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:50.545
hundreds and into ten
tens so let me do that.

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:53.793
So I'm going to take, (mumbles)
so I'm going to take that

00:03:53.793 --> 00:03:58.065
one away and then that 100
is ten tens, one, two, three,

00:03:58.065 --> 00:04:01.482
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:04.605
And if I did that here,
well if I take away one of

00:04:04.605 --> 00:04:08.772
the hundreds I'm now going
to have nine hundreds left.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.916
Nine hundreds left, but now I
have ten, now I have ten tens.

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:20.170
So I'm in good shape now
I can take some tens here

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.711
but I still don't have any
ones, remember I want to take

00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:24.694
eight ones from here, so you
can imagine what's going on.

00:04:24.694 --> 00:04:28.086
I could take one of my tens
and that's going to give me

00:04:28.086 --> 00:04:31.746
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,

00:04:31.746 --> 00:04:36.334
ten ones and so over here I
could take away one of my tens

00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:40.501
so I'm now going to have nine
tens and I'm going to break

00:04:43.122 --> 00:04:45.539
that into ten ones, ten ones.

00:04:47.096 --> 00:04:49.894
And so now things are
pretty straightforward.

00:04:49.894 --> 00:04:51.183
What do I do?

00:04:51.183 --> 00:04:54.362
Well I can now take my eight
ones from the ten ones.

00:04:54.362 --> 00:04:57.763
So ten minus eight,
that is going to be two.

00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:59.873
How would I represent that over here?

00:04:59.873 --> 00:05:02.881
I'm going to do the subtraction
in this yellow color.

00:05:02.881 --> 00:05:06.497
I want to take away eight of
these ones, so I take away

00:05:06.497 --> 00:05:10.664
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, and I am

00:05:11.971 --> 00:05:16.562
left with that two right over
there, that two is that two.

00:05:16.562 --> 00:05:19.325
Now I can move on to the tens place.

00:05:19.325 --> 00:05:21.694
If I have nine tens and I
take away two tens, I'm going

00:05:21.694 --> 00:05:25.861
to be left with seven, I'm going
to be left with seven tens.

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:30.978
How would we see it over here?

00:05:30.978 --> 00:05:35.521
Well I have nine tens left
over, I'm going to take away

00:05:35.521 --> 00:05:37.843
two of them, so take a one
two and I am left with seven.

00:05:37.843 --> 00:05:39.280
Is that seven?

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.291
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, yep that is seven

00:05:41.291 --> 00:05:42.865
tens right over there.

00:05:42.865 --> 00:05:46.272
We have two ones, seven tens
and so this seven is exactly

00:05:46.272 --> 00:05:49.425
this seven right over there same colors.

00:05:49.425 --> 00:05:54.129
I think you see where this
is going and the whole idea

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:55.728
is not just to get the answer
but to understand how we got

00:05:55.728 --> 00:05:57.151
this answer.

00:05:57.151 --> 00:05:59.635
So in the hundreds place if I
have nine hundreds and I take

00:05:59.635 --> 00:06:02.155
away five hundreds then I'm
going to be left with four

00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:05.382
hundreds, same idea over here.

00:06:05.382 --> 00:06:09.569
I have nine hundreds, I take
away one, two, three, four

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:13.486
five, I am going to be
left with four hundreds,

00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:17.894
this four and this four is the same.

00:06:17.894 --> 00:06:20.289
And so there you get the
general idea, with the standard

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.864
method it sometimes seems
like magic of how we're

00:06:22.864 --> 00:06:25.268
regrouping things but all
we're doing is we're taking

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:27.728
that thousand and saying
hey that's ten hundreds

00:06:27.728 --> 00:06:30.785
and then we take one of
those hundreds and we say

00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:34.192
hey that's ten tens and we take
one of those tens and we say

00:06:34.192 --> 00:06:37.545
that's ten ones and then
we are able to subtract.
