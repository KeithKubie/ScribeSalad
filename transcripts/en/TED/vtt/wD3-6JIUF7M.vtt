[Ojibwe: Hello.

00:00:14.043 --> 00:00:17.782
My English name is Tara;
my Native name is Zhaabowekwe.

00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:20.401
I am of Couchiching First Nation;
my clan is bear.

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:22.965
I was born under the Maple Sapping Moon.]

00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:24.656
My name is Tara Houska,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.085
I'm bear clan from
Couchiching First Nation,

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.156
I was born under the Maple Sapping Moon
in International Falls, Minnesota,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.165
and I'm happy to be here with all of you.

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:37.592
(Applause)

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:43.379
Trauma of indigenous peoples
has trickled through the generations.

00:00:43.403 --> 00:00:48.104
Centuries of oppression,
of isolation, of invisibility,

00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:51.065
have led to a muddled understanding
of who we are today.

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.685
In 2017, we face this mixture
of Indians in headdresses

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:57.534
going across the plains

00:00:57.558 --> 00:01:00.741
but also the drunk sitting on a porch
somewhere you never heard of,

00:01:00.765 --> 00:01:03.804
living off government handouts
and casino money.

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:07.602
(Sighs)

00:01:07.626 --> 00:01:09.334
It's really, really hard.

00:01:09.358 --> 00:01:11.994
It's very, very difficult
to be in these shoes,

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:17.708
to stand here as a product
of genocide survival, of genocide.

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:23.610
We face this constant barrage
of unteaching the accepted narrative.

00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:28.236
87 percent of references in textbooks,
children's textbooks, to Native Americans

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.983
are pre-1900s.

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:34.214
Only half of the US states
mention more than a single tribe,

00:01:34.238 --> 00:01:37.187
and just four states
mention the boarding-school era,

00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:41.267
the era that was responsible
for my grandmother

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:42.631
and her brothers and sisters

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:45.293
having their language
and culture beaten out of them.

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:48.367
When you aren't viewed as real people,

00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:51.391
it's a lot easier to run over your rights.

00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:55.026
Four years ago, I moved to Washington, DC.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.909
I had finished school
and I was there to be a tribal attorney

00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:01.725
and represent tribes across the nation,
representing on the Hill,

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.582
and I saw immediately
why racist imagery matters.

00:02:04.606 --> 00:02:07.153
I moved there during
football season, of all times.

00:02:08.162 --> 00:02:11.370
And so it was the daily slew
of Indian heads

00:02:11.394 --> 00:02:14.536
and this "redskin" slur everywhere,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.413
while my job was going up on the Hill

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:21.215
and trying to lobby for hospitals,
for funding for schools,

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.049
for basic government services,

00:02:23.073 --> 00:02:25.142
and being told again and again

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:28.460
that Indian people were incapable
of managing our own affairs.

00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:31.468
When you aren't viewed as real people,

00:02:31.492 --> 00:02:34.487
it's a lot easier to run over your rights.

00:02:36.645 --> 00:02:40.343
And last August, I went out
to Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.

00:02:40.995 --> 00:02:42.843
I saw resistance happening.

00:02:42.867 --> 00:02:44.113
We were standing up.

00:02:44.811 --> 00:02:49.191
There were youth that had run
2,000 miles from Cannonball, North Dakota

00:02:49.215 --> 00:02:53.404
all the way out to Washington, DC,
with a message for President Obama:

00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:54.968
"Please intervene.

00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:56.449
Please do something.

00:02:56.473 --> 00:02:57.704
Help us."

00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:01.643
And I went out, and I heard the call,

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:04.659
and so did thousands
of people around the world.

00:03:04.683 --> 00:03:07.280
Why did this resonate with so many people?

00:03:07.304 --> 00:03:12.111
Indigenous peoples are impacted
first and worst by climate change.

00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:16.667
We are impacted first and worst
by the fossil-fuel industry.

00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:20.410
Here in Louisiana, the first US
climate change refugees exist.

00:03:20.434 --> 00:03:21.794
They are Native people

00:03:21.818 --> 00:03:24.726
being pushed off their homelands
from rising sea levels.

00:03:25.194 --> 00:03:27.101
That's our reality, that's what we live.

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:30.823
And with these projects
comes a slew of human costs

00:03:30.847 --> 00:03:32.694
that people don't think about:

00:03:32.718 --> 00:03:36.773
thousands of workers influxing
to build these pipelines,

00:03:36.797 --> 00:03:40.484
to build and extract from the earth,

00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:43.793
bringing crime and sex trafficking
and violence with them.

00:03:44.973 --> 00:03:47.204
Missing and murdered
indigenous women in Canada

00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:50.204
has become so significant
it's spawned a movement

00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:52.123
and a national inquiry.

00:03:52.147 --> 00:03:55.006
Thousands of Native women
who have disappeared,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.551
who have been murdered.

00:03:56.878 --> 00:03:58.979
And here in the US,
we don't even track that.

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:03.107
We are instead left with an understanding

00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:06.018
that our Supreme Court,
the United States Supreme Court,

00:04:06.042 --> 00:04:10.600
stripped us, in 1978, of the right
to prosecute at the same rate

00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:12.750
as anywhere else in the United States.

00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:17.359
So as a non-Native person you can walk
onto a reservation and rape someone

00:04:17.383 --> 00:04:19.406
and that tribe is without the same level

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.484
of prosecutorial ability
as everywhere else,

00:04:22.508 --> 00:04:26.223
and the Federal Government declines
these cases 40 percent of the time.

00:04:26.247 --> 00:04:29.346
It used to be 76 percent of the time.

00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:32.878
One in three Native women
are raped in her lifetime.

00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:34.553
One in three.

00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:41.591
But in Standing Rock,
you could feel the energy in the air.

00:04:41.968 --> 00:04:44.536
You could feel the resistance happening.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.126
People were standing and saying, "No more.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.830
Enough is enough.

00:04:49.854 --> 00:04:52.045
We will put our bodies
in front of the machines

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.865
to stop this project from happening.

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.504
Our lives matter.

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:57.528
Our children's lives matter."

00:04:58.483 --> 00:05:02.102
And thousands of allies came
to stand with us from around the world.

00:05:02.126 --> 00:05:07.621
It was incredible, it was incredible
to stand together, united as one.

00:05:08.464 --> 00:05:15.405
(Applause)

00:05:16.805 --> 00:05:19.098
In my time there,

00:05:19.122 --> 00:05:24.020
I saw Natives being chased on horseback
by police officers shooting at them,

00:05:24.044 --> 00:05:26.607
history playing out in front of my eyes.

00:05:27.813 --> 00:05:30.545
I myself was put into a dog kennel
when I was arrested.

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.584
But funny story, actually,
of being put into a dog kennel.

00:05:34.307 --> 00:05:37.570
So we're in this big wire kennel
with all these people,

00:05:37.594 --> 00:05:41.214
and the police officers
are there and we're there,

00:05:41.238 --> 00:05:43.039
and we start howling like dogs.

00:05:43.063 --> 00:05:46.781
You're going to treat us like dogs?
We're going to act like dogs.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:48.626
But that's the resilience we have.

00:05:49.334 --> 00:05:52.279
All these horrific images
playing out in front of us,

00:05:52.303 --> 00:05:57.176
being an indigenous person
pushed off of Native lands again in 2017.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.344
But there was such beauty.

00:05:59.368 --> 00:06:02.694
On one of the days that we faced
a line of hundreds of police officers

00:06:02.718 --> 00:06:06.415
pushing us back, pushing us
off indigenous lands,

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.130
there were those teenagers
out on horseback across the plains.

00:06:10.744 --> 00:06:14.038
They were herding hundreds
of buffalo towards us,

00:06:14.062 --> 00:06:18.238
and we were crying out, calling,
"Please turn, please turn."

00:06:18.262 --> 00:06:20.263
And we watched the buffalo
come towards us,

00:06:20.287 --> 00:06:22.154
and for a moment, everything stopped.

00:06:22.178 --> 00:06:24.712
The police stopped, we stopped,

00:06:24.736 --> 00:06:28.768
and we just saw this beautiful,
amazing moment of remembrance.

00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:34.091
And we were empowered.
We were so empowered.

00:06:34.115 --> 00:06:37.626
I interviewed a woman
who had, on one day --

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.152
September 2nd,

00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:41.892
the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation
had told the courts --

00:06:41.916 --> 00:06:43.788
there's an ongoing lawsuit right now --

00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:45.032
they told the courts,

00:06:46.247 --> 00:06:49.985
"Here is a sacred site that's in
the direct path of the pipeline."

00:06:50.826 --> 00:06:52.756
On September 3rd, the following day,

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.082
Dakota Access, LLC skipped 25 miles ahead
in its construction,

00:06:56.106 --> 00:06:57.484
to destroy that site.

00:06:58.363 --> 00:07:02.640
And when that happened,
the people in camp rushed up to stop this,

00:07:02.664 --> 00:07:05.451
and they were met with attack dogs,

00:07:05.475 --> 00:07:10.300
people, private security officers,
wielding attack dogs in [2016].

00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:12.917
But I interviewed one of the women,

00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:15.893
who had been bitten on the breast
by one of these dogs,

00:07:15.917 --> 00:07:19.132
and the ferocity and strength of her

00:07:19.156 --> 00:07:20.307
was incredible,

00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:22.713
and she's out right now
in another resistance camp,

00:07:22.737 --> 00:07:24.578
the same resistance camp I'm part of,

00:07:24.602 --> 00:07:28.544
fighting Line 3, another pipeline project
in my people's homelands,

00:07:28.568 --> 00:07:32.974
wanting 900,000 barrels
of tar sands per day

00:07:32.998 --> 00:07:36.378
through the headwaters of the Mississippi
to the shore of Lake Superior

00:07:36.402 --> 00:07:38.951
and through all the Treaty
territories along the way.

00:07:38.975 --> 00:07:42.292
But this woman's out there
and we're all out there standing together,

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:44.436
because we are resilient, we are fierce,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:48.326
and we are teaching people
how to reconnect to the earth,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.674
remembering where we come from.

00:07:50.698 --> 00:07:52.865
So much of society has forgotten this.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:57.016
(Applause)

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.739
That food you eat comes from somewhere.

00:07:59.763 --> 00:08:02.809
The tap water you drink
comes from somewhere.

00:08:03.255 --> 00:08:05.357
We're trying to remember, teach,

00:08:05.381 --> 00:08:07.421
because we know, we still remember.

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:10.542
It's in our plants,
in our medicines, in our lives,

00:08:10.566 --> 00:08:12.423
every single day.

00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:14.272
I brought this out to show.

00:08:14.296 --> 00:08:15.297
(Rattling)

00:08:15.321 --> 00:08:17.836
This is cultural survival.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.175
This is from a time that it was illegal

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:23.265
to practice indigenous cultures
in the United States.

00:08:23.289 --> 00:08:25.915
This was cultural survival
hidden in plain sight.

00:08:27.003 --> 00:08:28.639
This was a baby's rattle.

00:08:28.663 --> 00:08:31.457
That's what they told the Indian agents
when they came in.

00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:32.645
It was a baby's rattle.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:39.429
But it's incredible what you can do
when you stand together.

00:08:39.453 --> 00:08:42.468
It's incredible, the power
that we have when we stand together,

00:08:42.492 --> 00:08:45.583
human resistance,
people having this power,

00:08:45.607 --> 00:08:48.323
some of the most oppressed people
you can possibly imagine

00:08:48.347 --> 00:08:51.745
costing this company
hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:55.751
and now our divestment efforts, focusing
on the banks behind these projects,

00:08:55.775 --> 00:08:58.633
costing them billions of dollars.

00:08:58.657 --> 00:09:01.112
Five billion dollars
we've cost them so far,

00:09:01.136 --> 00:09:02.287
hanging out with banks.

00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:07.211
(Applause)

00:09:07.235 --> 00:09:08.760
So what can you do?

00:09:08.784 --> 00:09:10.162
How can you help?

00:09:10.186 --> 00:09:11.854
How can you change the conversation

00:09:11.878 --> 00:09:14.630
for extremely oppressed
and forgotten people?

00:09:15.358 --> 00:09:17.797
Education is foundational.

00:09:18.642 --> 00:09:21.405
Education shapes our children.
It shapes the way we teach.

00:09:21.429 --> 00:09:23.399
It shapes the way we learn.

00:09:23.423 --> 00:09:25.206
In Washington State,

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.818
they've made the teaching of treaties
and modern Native people

00:09:29.842 --> 00:09:31.936
mandatory in school curriculum.

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:33.587
That is systems change.

00:09:33.611 --> 00:09:36.040
(Applause)

00:09:36.064 --> 00:09:38.993
When your elected officials
are appropriating their budgets,

00:09:39.017 --> 00:09:42.500
ask them: Are you fulfilling
treaty obligations?

00:09:43.031 --> 00:09:45.975
Treaties have been broken
since the day they were signed.

00:09:45.999 --> 00:09:47.736
Are you meeting those requirements?

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.507
That would change our lives,
if treaties were actually upheld.

00:09:51.531 --> 00:09:53.008
Those documents were signed.

00:09:53.032 --> 00:09:56.096
Somehow, we live in this world
where, in 2017,

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.360
the US Constitution is held up
as the supreme law of the land, right?

00:09:59.384 --> 00:10:01.576
But when I talk about
treaty rights, I'm crazy.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.751
That's crazy.

00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:04.744
Treaties are the supreme law of the land,

00:10:04.768 --> 00:10:08.474
and that would change so much,

00:10:08.498 --> 00:10:11.989
if you actually asked
your representative officials

That's huge. It makes a huge difference.

00:10:19.688 --> 00:10:21.988
