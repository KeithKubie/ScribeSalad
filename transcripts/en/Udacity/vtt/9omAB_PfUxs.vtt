00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.330
So, that's very good. So, you, were able to realize that Pavlov is

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.670
in Nash equilibrium. But we can go further than that. Or farther, than that.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:07.290
&gt;&gt; Further.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.730
&gt;&gt; We can go further than that. And show that in fact Pavlov is sub-game

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.070
perfect. So, unlike tit for tat. It's

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.180
actually subgame perfect. So let's let's take a

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.810
look at how we could convince ourselves of that. So I think the important thing

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.840
to see is that by feeding these two

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.230
Pavlov machines different sequences we can get into

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.210
any of these four different combinations of states.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.320
They're both in the cooperation state. They're both

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.250
in the. Both in the defect state, ones

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.430
cooperate, ones defect, ones defect and ones cooperate.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.180
&gt;&gt; Mh-hm.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.420
&gt;&gt; so is it the case, that no matter which state

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.790
that those are in, that the average reward is going to be

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.520
mutual cooperation. So let's check, if they are both cooperating, and we

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.810
continue with these Pavlov machines then they will mutually cooperate, so yes.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.710
&gt;&gt; Mh-hm.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.360
Alright if they're in defect defect then what's going to happen?

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.320
&gt;&gt; Well then they both agree, so then they cooperate.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.970
&gt;&gt; So they're going to move to cooperate

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.060
and then they'll stay there forever, so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.510
then that'll be mutual cooperation. Awesome. What

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.120
if ones in cooperation and ones in defect?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.180
&gt;&gt; Then they disagree.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.430
&gt;&gt; Right. And they move to the other state.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.470
&gt;&gt; More specifically what?

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.530
&gt;&gt; Oh, I don't know [LAUGH], I can't remember. I'm trying to keep

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.710
track of who, who's who. So if I cooperate. and you defect, then let's

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.270
see the guy who cooperates moves to defect. And the guy who defects

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.590
moves to defect. Because you, and now

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.320
you agree, and so you're going to cooperate.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.910
&gt;&gt; Boom. So, when we're in the

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.370
cooperate defect state, then on the first move.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.090
Let's see, you just, yeah, the right-hand

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.390
Pavlov just defected, so that causes this transition.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.310
And this guy just cooperated, which causes this

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.240
transition, so that we've gone to defect defect.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.850
&gt;&gt; Right. Which means that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.240
we're going to average cooperation, because [CROSSTALK]

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.558
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:52.030
&gt;&gt; That's where we're going to get stuck in the long run.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.470
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.640
&gt;&gt; And the same thing works through here. Boom.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.119
&gt;&gt; That's actually very cool, and kind of counter-intuitive.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And truly neat. So sort of no matter what

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.910
weird sequence we've been fed we manage to

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.100
resynchronize and then return to a mutually cooperative state.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.030
&gt;&gt; So I have a question for you.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.120
&gt;&gt; Go for it. So presumably this is really cool

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.210
like mathmatically because now we shold all do, we should

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.700
all be Pavlovians. Like we're all Kinseans. ANd then we

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.970
just kind of move forward from there. D people do this?

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.720
&gt;&gt; I don't know the answer to that question.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.520
&gt;&gt; I mean other than men on a basketball course.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.510
&gt;&gt; Sure, you can always return to that. Though I'm not sure I'm aware of any

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.570
analyses of men on a basketball court and

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:36.260
whether or not You know, people have analyzed that.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.610
&gt;&gt; Hmm.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.970
&gt;&gt; But how about this. If I find

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.900
out, I will post something on the instructor's comments.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.640
&gt;&gt; Okay, that sounds reasonable. So Pavlov

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.710
is subgame perfect. That's awesome. So remind

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.870
me again why I care that something is subgame perfect? Because it means that,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.510
so let's say that you actually, so I'm being this left Pavlov

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.420
and you defect and me and you're like yeah I'm going to

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.560
defect on you because I just want to take advantage of you,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.300
and you're, you're going to forgive me and I will have gotten this

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.910
extra bonus for that. And what it turns out is that No,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.600
if we do Pavlov versus Pavlov, we're going to fall into mutual cooperation

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.970
no matter what. So, so, so this defection that I do, this,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.940
this threat, this punishment that I deal out to you, you can earn

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.580
it back, and we can go back into a cooperative state.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.160
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.250
&gt;&gt; So, it's worth it to me to punish

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.120
you, because I know that it's not going to cost

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.740
me anything in the long run, and it stabilizes your

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.140
behavior in the short run. Sure. It makes perfect sense.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.760
&gt;&gt; So it becomes a plausible threat.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.600
&gt;&gt; I like it.
