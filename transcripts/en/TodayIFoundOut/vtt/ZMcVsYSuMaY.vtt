00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:11.430
The 
result of years of work and representing the

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.449
absolute pinnacle of Beethoven’s skill as
both a composer and musician, Symphony No.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:23.289
9 is widely considered one of the single finest
pieces of music ever created- a fact made

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.229
all the more impressive when you consider
Beethoven himself was completely deaf when

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:31.750
he finished composing it in 1824, with its
debut performance occurring at the Theater

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.090
am Kärntnertor in Vienna on May 7, 1824.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.250
Wanting to go out with a bang, Beethoven saw
to it that the orchestra performing his masterwork

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.070
was one of the largest ever seen by the city.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.030
As an idea of just how large the group Beethoven
assembled was, it’s noted that not only

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.710
did Beethoven require the entire Kärntnertor
house orchestra, but also needed to recruit

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.320
amateur musicians from the Gesellschaft der
Musikfreunde (Society of Friends of Music

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.120
in Vienna) as well as various others to fill
out the parts.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.530
On top of that, the chorus alone is known
to have numbered nearly 100 singers.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.729
Although Beethoven was, as noted, completely
deaf by this point in his career, he made

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.549
it known to the powers that be that a condition
of him premiering the Ninth Symphony in Vienna

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.729
was that he be allowed to conduct the orchestra…

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.530
A decision that understandably unnerved some,
in particular the theatre’s Kapellmeister

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.670
Michael Umlauf who’d personally seen Beethoven
previously nearly ruin the dress rehearsal

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.999
of Beethoven’s 1814 opera, Fidelio, because
he couldn’t properly keep time owing to

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.999
his hearing.

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:38.789
In the end, Umlauf was selected to assist
Beethoven in conducting Fidelio to ensure

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:39.789
it went well.

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.659
As for his 9th symphony, eventually a similar
compromise was reached for Umlauf to “assist”

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.179
Beethoven once again in his duties- Beethoven
was to set the tempo and Umlauf would do the

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:52.179
rest.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.520
Beethoven seemed satisfied with this and Umlauf
subsequently shadowed the composer while he

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.429
went over the music with his hastily assembled
super-orchestra.

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.979
To ensure Beethoven couldn’t mess up the
performance, Umlauf reportedly secretly told

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.820
the orchestra to simply humor Beethoven’s
instructions during rehearsals and outright

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.080
ignore him while he was conducting.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.330
On the night of the premier itself, while
the performers followed Umlauf’s lead, Beethoven

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.440
reportedly flailed around like one of those
giant inflatable tube-men while vigorously

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.130
illustrating the tempo with his conducting
baton.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.450
Or, to quote violinist Joseph Böhm about
his recollection of the event,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.270
Beethoven himself conducted, that is, he stood
in front of a conductor’s stand and threw

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.550
himself back and forth like a madman.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.640
At one moment he stretched to his full height,
at the next he crouched down to the floor,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.280
he flailed about with his hands and feet as
though he wanted to play all the instruments

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.020
and sing all the chorus parts….

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.910
According to an oft repeated story, Beethoven’s
deafness prevented him from hearing the end

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.560
of the performance and, as he was slightly
off in his timing in his conducting, he continued

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.680
to flail about after the music had stop and
initially missed the thunderous standing ovation

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.260
the performance received.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.460
While this anecdote is often exaggerated,
first hand accounts do corroborate the general

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.460
story.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.430
For example, Böhm alludes to this, stating

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.000
Beethoven was so excited he saw nothing that
was going on about him; he paid no heed whatsoever

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.430
to the bursts of applause, which his deafness
prevented him from hearing in any case.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.900
He had to be told when it was time to acknowledge
the applause.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.620
Soprano chorister Felix Weingartner also would
later recall in the book Akkorde,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.570
One had the tragic impression that he was
incapable of following the music.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.780
Although he appeared to be reading along,
he would continue to turn pages when the movement

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.330
in question had already come to an end.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.790
At the performance a man went up to him at
the end of each movement, tapped him on the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.120
shoulder and pointed to the audience.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.590
The motions of the clapping hands and the
waving handkerchiefs caused him to bow, which

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.540
always gave rise to great jubilation.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.340
Unsurprisingly, the response to the premier
was generally extremely glowing.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.710
For example, a correspondent for Theater-Zeitung
noted, “After a single hearing of these

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.700
immense compositions one can scarcely say
more than that one has heard them.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.480
To engage in an illuminating discussion is
impossible for anyone who only attended the

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.480
performance.”

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.160
He would later go on, “All the joys and
sufferings of the human soul resound here

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.240
in the most varied forms… [they] intertwine
in the marvelous, magic knots that unravel

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.290
and again weave themselves into new and wonderful
signs.”

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.590
German composer Carl Czerny further wrote
in a letter on June 24, 1824, “There is

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.520
surely no more significant musical news that
I can write you about from our dear old Vienna

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.320
than that Beethoven finally gave repeated
performances of his long-awaited concert,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.910
and in the most striking manner astonished
everyone who feared that after ten years of

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.970
deafness he could now produce only dry, abstract
works, bereft of imagination.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.940
To the greatest extent, his new Symphony breathes
such a fresh, lively, indeed youthful spirit;

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.630
so much power, innovation and beauty as ever
came from the head of this ingenious man,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.710
although several times he certainly gave the
old wigs something to shake their heads about.”

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.320
On that note, some critics disliked the work.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.650
For example, Richard Mackenzie Bacon wrote
in an 1825 edition of The Quarterly Musical

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.080
Magazine and Review,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.720
I am as zealous an admirer of the composer,
as any one of those who would… exalt this

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.840
symphony above every thing else he has written…[But]
I have come to a decision in my own mind,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.070
that until any one can persuade me that bad
is good, or that black is white, I must ever

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:42.870
consider this new symphony as the least excellent
of any Beethoven has produced, as an unequal

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.540
work, abounding more in noise, eccentricity,
and confusion of design, than in those grand

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.430
and lofty touches he so well knows how to
make us feel…

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.020
One great excuse remains for all this want
of perfection.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.520
It is to be remembered, that the great composer
is afflicted with an incurable disorder (deafness),

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.720
which to powers like his must be a deprivation
more acute and distressing than any one can

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.650
possibly imagine…

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.570
While not mentioned in Bacon’s criticism
of the work, a major complaint after Symphony

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:20.060
No. 9’s debut was centered around Beethoven’s
inclusion of a choral element in a symphony.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.050
You’ll often read that this was the first
time any major composer had chosen to augment

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.520
a symphony this way, but this isn’t actually
correct.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.530
In fact, beyond many other examples, Beethoven
himself had previously done this very thing

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.690
in his Choral Fantasy composed in 1808.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:41.500
However, this was a rather unorthodox choice
(as was the extreme length of his 9th Symphony),

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.510
but one in which Beethoven had planned all
along, with the seed of the idea behind his

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.620
9th coming all the way back in the late 18th
century when he began contemplating including

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.350
Friedrich Schiller’s 1785 Ode to Joy in
one of his works.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.570
Interestingly, according to friend and patron
of Beethoven, Leopold Sonnleithner, Beethoven

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:06.420
may have regretted his decision to include
the choral element.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.050
Sonnleithner writes of this,

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.979
I cannot refrain from mentioning something
my deceased friend Carl Czerny (a favorite

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:19.090
pupil of Beethoven’s) repeatedly related
to me and which he confirmed as being reliably

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.090
true.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.850
Some time after the first performance of the
Ninth Symphony, Beethoven is supposed to have

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:30.370
announced to a small group of his closest
friends, among them Czerny, that he realized

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.770
he had committed a blunder with the last movement
of the symphony; he wanted, therefore, to

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:41.520
eliminate it and write an instrumental movement
without voices in its place; he already had

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.580
an idea in mind for it.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.479
Although the less favourable reception of
the final movement with chorus was probably

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:52.860
not entirely without influence on this statement
of Beethoven’s he was certainly not the

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:59.030
man to waver in his views as a result of criticism
of the day or less than customary applause.

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:03.770
Therefore, it seems in fact that he did not
feel quite comfortable on the new path he

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.770
had taken.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.360
In any event, it is greatly to be regretted
that his announced intention was never carried

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.360
out.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.850
Whether this is true or not, based on his
surviving notebooks, it took Beethoven around

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.280
200 different variations of the main Ode to
Joy theme to work out the details, but he

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:19.280
got there in the end.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.889
And while some “old wigs” didn’t care
for adding a choral element to the symphony,

00:08:23.889 --> 00:08:28.770
Beethoven’s masterpiece has withstood the
test of time, not only influencing many composers

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:35.080
after, but also generally considered one of
the greatest musical compositions of all time.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:39.289
Very unfortunately for Beethoven who at this
point had completely lost the ability to support

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.640
himself through his former very lucrative
performance career, this debut performance

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.980
of No. 9 was a total flop financially, with
the sold out premier earning him a paltry

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.850
420 florins (very roughly about $5,000 today).

00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.110
So instead of a windfall of cash to support
himself with, he was stuck in the unenviable

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:02.420
position of being short on money and on account
of his deafness with diminished means of making

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:03.950
more at his craft.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:08.640
Joseph Huttenbrenner, corroborated by fellow
witness of the event, Anton Schindler, relays

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.290
what happened when Beethoven learned of his
minuscule profits on the endeavor, writing,

00:09:13.290 --> 00:09:15.020
I handed him the ticket-office figures.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.460
He collapsed at the sight of them.

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.740
We picked him up and laid him on the sofa.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.570
We stayed at his side until late at night;
he did not ask for food or anything else,

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.990
and did not speak.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:29.660
Finally, on perceiving that Morpheus had gently
closed his eyes, we went away.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.330
His servants found him the next morning as
we had left him, asleep and still in the clothes

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.790
in which he had conducted.

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:38.770
Schindler would go on concerning the rather
ugly aftermath:

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.960
Beethoven believed that he owed Umlauf, Schuppanzigh
and me some thanks for our efforts.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.620
A few days after the second academy, therefore,
he ordered a meal at the Wilder Mann in the

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.620
Prater.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:53.300
He arrived in the company of his nephew, his
brow hung round with dark clouds, acted coldly,

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:55.950
using a biting, carping tone in everything
he said.

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.600
An explosion was to be expected.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.910
We had only just sat down at the table when
he brought the conversation round to the subject

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:06.950
of the pecuniary result of the first performance
in the Theater, blurting out point-blank that

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:11.330
he had been defrauded by the administrator
Duport and me together.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.820
Umluaf and Schuppanzigh made every effort
to prove the impossibility of a fraud of any

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.870
sort, pointing out that every piece of money
had passed through the hands of the two theatre

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.640
cashiers, that the figures tallied precisely,
and that furthermore his nephew, on the instruction

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.700
of his apothecary brother, had superintended
the cashiers in defiance of all custom.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:35.820
Beethoven, however, persisted in his accusation,
adding that he had been informed of the fraud

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.450
from a reliable quarter.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:40.760
Now it was time to give satisfaction for this
affront.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:45.520
I went off quickly with Umlauf, and Schuppanzigh,
after having to endure several volleys at

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.000
his voluminous person, soon followed.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.880
We gathered at the Goldenes Lamm in the Leopoldstadt
to continue our interrupted meal undisturbed.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:59.180
The furious composer, however, was left to
vent his anger at the waiters and the trees,

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.680
and as punishment had the opulent meal alone
with his nephew.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.090
Beethoven wasn’t finished, however, writing
this scathing letter to Schindler shortly

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:10.090
thereafter, which reads in part:

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:15.160
I do not accuse you of having done anything
wicked in connection with the concert.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:19.899
But stupidity and arbitrary behavior have
ruined many an undertaking.

00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:24.790
Moreover I have on the whole a certain fear
of you, a fear lest some day through your

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.620
action a great misfortune may befall me.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:33.370
Stopped-up sluices often overflow quite suddenly;
and that day in the Prater I was convinced

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:38.980
that in many ways you had hurt me very deeply-
in any case I would much rather try to repay

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:44.370
frequently with a small gift the services
you render me, than have you at my table.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:48.260
For I confess that your presence irritates
me in so many ways…

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.260
I will certainly invite you occasionally.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:55.600
But it is impossible to have you beside me
permanently, because such an arrangement would

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.670
upset my whole existence…

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:04.630
Beethoven’s hearing seems to have started
to decline around 1796, with Beethoven mentioning

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.459
hearing “buzzing noises” around this time
in letters.

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:12.080
Things got worse around the turn of the century,
with Beethoven writing to his physician in

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.779
1801, “For the last three years my hearing
has grown steadily weaker . . . I can give

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:22.350
you some idea of this peculiar deafness when
I must tell you that in the theatre I have

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:27.410
to get very close to the orchestra to understand
the performers, and that from a distance I

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:31.580
do not hear the high notes of the instruments
and the singers’ voices.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.560
. . Sometimes too I hardly hear people who
speak softly.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.480
The sound I can hear it is true, but not the
words.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.270
And yet if anyone shouts I can’t bear it.”

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:43.709
The exact cause of Beethoven’s deafness
is unknown, though it is noted that during

00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:49.130
his autopsy they found that his auditory nerves
had atrophied and Eustachian tube narrowed,

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.089
though why is anybody’s guess.

00:12:51.089 --> 00:12:55.360
Whatever the case, the composer continued
seeking treatment for his eventual complete

00:12:55.360 --> 00:13:03.640
deafness going all the up until 1822, after
which he finally gave up on finding a cure.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.779
While the loss of his hearing was a crushing
blow to the man, this was actually a boon

00:13:07.779 --> 00:13:08.779
to history.

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:12.830
As his hearing diminished, he took to writing
to communicate with people, resulting in numerous

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:16.910
letters and “conversation books,” many
of which have survived providing incredible

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.480
insight into Beethoven’s life and music.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:24.290
For instance, in a letter to a friend he vocalized
his social struggles and his concern over

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.970
his future on account of losing his hearing:
“For two years I have avoided almost all

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:33.410
social gatherings because it is impossible
for me to say to people ‘I am deaf.’

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:39.180
If I belonged to any other profession it would
be easier, but in my profession it is a frightful

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.180
state…”

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.140
He went on to say that, “Of course I am
resolved to rise above every obstacle, but

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.870
how will it be possible?”

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:51.580
Beethoven’s final public performance as
a musician took place in April of 1814, playing

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.899
his so-called “Archduke Trio”, known formally
as Beethoven’s Piano Trio in B-flat major,

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:54.899
Op. 97.

00:13:54.899 --> 00:13:57.750
Composer Louis Spohr had this to say after
watching a rehearsal for Beethoven’s last

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.769
performance: “On account of his deafness
there was scarcely anything left of the virtuosity

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:06.160
of the artist which had formerly been so greatly
admired.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.420
In forte passages the poor deaf man pounded
on the keys until the strings jangled, and

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:16.120
in piano he played so softly that whole groups
of notes were omitted, so that the music was

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.390
unintelligible unless one could look into
the pianoforte part.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:42.570
I was deeply saddened at so hard 

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:47.760
a fate.”
