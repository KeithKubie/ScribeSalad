00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.980
Georg Friedrich Hegel was born in Stuttgart in 1770.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.400
Intellectually he was adventurous, but in externals, respectable, conventional, and proud of it.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.840
He ascended the academic tree and reached the top most branch,

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.100
head of the University of Berlin, when he was sixty years old; he died the following year.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.720
Hegel wrote some very long and very famous books, among them,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.280
"The Phenomenology of Spirit", "The Science of Logic", and "Elements of the Philosophy of Right";

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.580
but, we'll be frank: he wrote horribly;

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.800
his work is confusing and complicated when it should be clear and direct.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.420
He tapped into a weakness of human nature: to be trustful of grave-sounding, incomprehensible prose.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.040
This has made philosophy much weaker in the world than it should be,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.260
and it's made it much harder for us to hear the valuable things that Hegel has to say to us,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.360
amongst which a small number of lessons stand out.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.940
Firstly, important part of ourselves can be found in history.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.500
In Hegel's day, a standard European Way of looking at the past was to consider it as primitive,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.640
and to feel proud of how much progress has been made to get us to the modern age.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.540
But in his book, "The Phenomenology of Spirit", published in 1807, Hegel argued that

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.760
every era can be looked at as a repository of a particular kind of wisdom.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.780
This means we need to go back in time to rescue things which have gone missing.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.740
So, for example, we might need to mine history of ancient Greece to fully grasp the idea of what community can be,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.380
something which has been lost in the modern age.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.920
Or, the Middle Ages can teach us, as no other era can, about the role of honor,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.680
even if this period featured appalling attitudes to children or the rights of women.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.860
"Progress is never linear", Hegel tells us; "there is wisdom at every stage",

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.560
"which", says Hegel "points us to the task of the historian."

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.940
"To be a historian is to be someone who should rescue, from the past, those ideas that're most needed"

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.640
"to compensate for the blind spots of the present."

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.960
Secondly, learn from ideas you dislike.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:20.240
Hegel was a great believer in learning from one's intellectual enemies, from points of view we disagree with, or that feel alien.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.520
That's because he held, "the bits of the truth are always getting scattered even in unappealing, or peculiar places,"

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.840
"and we should dig them out by asking always,

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.440
'what sliver of sense and reason might be contained in otherwise frightening or foreign phenomena?'".

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.080
Nationalism, for instance, has had many terrible manifestations even in Hegel's day,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.740
but Hegel's move was to ask what underlying good idea or important need might be hiding within the bloody history of nationalism.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.900
He proposed that it's the need for people to feel proud of where they come from,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.660
to identify with something beyond merely their own achievements,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.840
and to anchor their identities beyond the ego.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.360
Hegel is a hero of the thought that really important ideas may be in the hands of people you regard, at first glance, as beneath contempt.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.440
Thirdly, Progress is Messy

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.440
Hegel believed the world makes progress,

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.620
but only by lurching from one extreme to another. As it seeks to overcompensate for a previous mistake.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.500
He proposed that it generally take three moves.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.720
Before the right balance on any issue can be found.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.220
A process that he named the DIALEKTIK.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.080
He was often thinking of the complex twist and turns that brought about the modern state.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.640
We can also think the slow path towards sensible attitudes to sex in our own time.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.380
The Victorians impose too much repression, yet the 1960s may have turn out to be too liberal.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.820
It might only be by 2020s that we`ll find the right balance between extremes.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:02.160
All this can seem the most appalling waste of time, but Hegel insists that the painful stepping from era to era is inevitable.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.820
Something we must expect and reconcile ourselves to when planning our lives

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.820
or contemplating history books.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.960
And sometimes in this process of moving from era to era we`ll find a new solution,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.420
that manages to synthesize the good qualities of the previous solutions,

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:22.240
to make something really new, and different and better.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.900
Four, Art has a purpose.

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.220
Hegel vigorously rejected the idea of art for art sake.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.760
Painting, Music, Architecture, Literature and Design: all have a major job to do.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.720
We need them so that important insights can become powerful and helpful in our lives.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.860
Art is in Hegel`s formulation: "the sensuous presentation of ideas".

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.840
Just knowing ideas often leaves us cold.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.240
for example in theory we believe the conflict in Syria is an important one.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.120
In practice however we just switch off.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.940
In principle we know we should be more forgiving to our partners,

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.580
but this abstract conviction gets forgotten at the least provocation.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.280
The point of art Hegel realized, is not so much to come up with startling new strange ideas

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.400
but to take the good, helpful, important thoughts we already think we know,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.020
and make them stick more imaginatively in our minds.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.400
Five. We need new institutions.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.800
Hegel took a very positive view of institutions and of the power then can wield.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.940
This is a point Hegel made again and again in different ways.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.780
For ideas to be active and effective in the world, a lot more is needed then the ideas are simply correct;

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.740
to make major truths powerful in society they need employees and building and budgets and legal advices;

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.480
institutions allow for the scale of time and power the big projects need to become effective in the world.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:57.400
So, as new needs of a society get recognized, they should ideally lead not just to new books but to the formation of new institutions.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.320
Nowadays we might say we need major new institutions to focus on relationships,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.300
consumer education, career choice, mood management and how to bring up less damaged children.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.440
Hegel help us to see valuable insights what we might initially resist them,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.880
in art in institutions in the ideas of our enemies and in the strange mistakes of the past.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.800
His insight is the growth requires that clash of divergent ideas and therefore that will be painful and slow.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.740
But at least once we know this we don`t have to compound our troubles by thinking them abnormal.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.000
Hegel gives us a more accurate and hence more manageable view of ourselves,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.520
our difficulties and where we are in history.
