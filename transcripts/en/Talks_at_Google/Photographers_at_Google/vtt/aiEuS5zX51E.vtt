00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.580
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello
and welcome.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.180
We're very pleased to have been
Vincent Versace with us

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.000
today here at Google.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.820
He's been a longtime friend of
ours, and he'll be talking

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.650
about photography.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.040
That's that we're here for.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.810
The title of his presentation is
the Lens is the Brush, the

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.600
Camera is the Canvas, and the
File is the Sheet Music, and

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.040
the Print is the Symphony.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.540
So all these things come
together to create a beautiful

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.440
final image.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.750
Vincent has up a long line and
list of accolades, and I can't

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.080
possibly go through
all of them.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.060
I'll just pinpoint a few.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.580
And Vincent, if I
miss anything,

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.740
you can jump in there.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.530
VINCENT VERSACE: That's OK.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.100
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.910
He's been recognized as a
pioneer in the art and science

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.380
of digital photography.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.540
He has been a recipient of the
Computerworld Smithsonian

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.680
Award in Media Arts and
Entertainment as well as a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.300
permanent collection in the
Smithsonian Institute's Museum

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.760
of American History Vincent has
been highlighted in all

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.550
the major magazines
for photography--

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.930
many, many photography
magazines--

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.420
and he's also really well-known
for some of his

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.450
bestselling books.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.740
He has one called "From Oz To
Kansas, Almost Every Black And

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.970
White Technique Known To
Mankind" and "Welcome to Oz

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.940
2.0, The Cinematic Approach
to Digital Photography in

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.580
Photoshop," and he has
several others.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.270
Vincent has a brilliant mind.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.200
If you ever have a chance to
talk and listen to him, you're

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.052
in for a real treat,
as you are today.

00:01:24.052 --> 00:01:25.650
So Vincent, thanks very
much, and welcome.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.120
VINCENT VERSACE: Thank
to you for having me.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.540
VINCENT VERSACE: I love coming
to a place where no matter

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.220
where I am, I feel
like the absolute

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.810
dumbest kid in the room.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.300
This place is--

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.640
the way in which every little
detail is thought of, it's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.950
gotten to the point where,
of course you did.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.460
It's great.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.510
You live in heaven here and
make the best orange

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.680
shortbread cookies
I have ever had.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.410
So where's the HR person?

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.260
Because you could just
pay me in cookies.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.600
I'm OK.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.220
I'm easy that way.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.340
So what is it that you would
like to get from me?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.660
What is your expectation of this
interaction, besides a

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.680
fancy-ass title?

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.040
Life story.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.620
How I get from here to here
to there to this.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.310
How I get this to look like this
while translating this

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.950
from this to this, and why that
affects this to this to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.640
that, that comes over here.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.260
How'd I do?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.230
AUDIENCE: We're done.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.490
VINCENT VERSACE: Thank
you very much.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.630
Right place, right time.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.500
How I became a beta tester was
back in the day, there was a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.508
booth about this big in the
photography area of Nikon.

00:02:51.508 --> 00:02:56.360
And there was nobody that was a
professional that wanted to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.260
do digital photography, because
there was no way

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.890
digital photography was ever
going to take over film.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.890
And this poor guy that was there
in this booth was one

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.490
step out the door, because
nobody's going to buy an

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.570
electronic camera!

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.120
And the big photographers that
were willing to do it wanted

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.480
hundreds of thousands of
dollars, because any pictures

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.380
that they took would be useless
to them forever.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.210
And me, right out of
college, went, I'll

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.970
do it for the camera.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.330
And that's really right
place, right time.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.750
And be willing to be paid in
orange shortbread cookies.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.910
That's really what
it comes down to.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.580
So what I want to talk about how
it all interplays, because

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.580
it all interplays.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.450
Everything dovetails into
everything else.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.940
I'm going to start with passion
in the photograph.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.720
The quickest way to take better
photographs is to stop

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.960
taking photographs.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.060
Let the photograph take you.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.610
Be taken by your pictures.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:13.590
It is not about smile
now, damn it!

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.880
It is about that moment
where you go [GASPS].

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.370
And as you're being grabbed, the
journey is not this way.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.360
The journey is this way.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.510
And as you're being ripped
through that lens, watching

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.670
cool things happen, the finger
should be shooting.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.610
I shoot so much that according
to my doctor, I have a stress

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.660
fracture on this finger
and these fingers.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.200
I couldn't figure out why my
hand was killing me, and it's

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.630
like, well, how much did
you shoot when you

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:47.630
were in Burma last?

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.330
And I'm looking at it.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.340
I have 136,000 frames.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.570
His response was, perhaps
shoot less.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.520
My response was, rebuild me.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.640
So the response, it has to
be absolutely automatic.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.200
Things travel at the
speed of life.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.110
And rather than noodling the
photograph and concerning

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.260
yourself about did I get
it right, forget that.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.200
What you need to get
is you need to let

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.590
the moment take you.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.480
You need to let the moment that
moved you to the point

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.260
where you are witnessing the
most amazing thing be the

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.700
impulse to fire.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.040
Things happen at the speed of
life, and a camera captures

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.330
things in fractions
of a second.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.850
We see things in time
and motion.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.660
A camera photographs things
in fractions of a second.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.270
When adding up how much time I
have spent in Burma or India

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.720
or wherever--

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.380
I just did this with Burma--
when I was done, I was there

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.050
for two weeks, and if you total
up all the fractions of

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:00.240
seconds that I shot, I shot
two and a half minutes.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.020
But I was there for two weeks.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.580
I have stress fracture
on my shooting hand.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.150
Why?

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:07.100
It's a numbers game.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.490
Things happen at the
speed of life.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.440
You set your camera up so that
it can do all of the things

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.020
that you don't want to worry
about, exposure,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.730
focus, those things.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.250
If you think about a D4--

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.720
I shoot Nikon, so I'm going to
speak in a Nikon metaphor--

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:25.300
if you think about a D4, D800,
those cameras, those are the

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.770
ultimate idiot-proof, or as we
like to refer to the computer

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.390
business, an ID10T camera,
total point and shoot.

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.790
Why?

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.820
Because I am busy concerning
myself about what is happening

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.450
in front of my camera.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.370
I do not want to worry about
what my camera is doing.

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.850
To your question, how do you
make technology better?

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.420
You make it so that I can set it
up, and it does the things

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:54.100
I need it to do based on my
style, that there is some form

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.300
of understanding of what it
is that I'm shooting.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.750
One of the advantages of my
system is the way in which its

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.060
meter works, which is
why I choose it.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.640
It's a three-dimensional light
meter that's an RGB meter with

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.190
6.5 million pixel RGB meter
that meters in three

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.750
dimensions, and computes skin
tones, and backgrounds, and

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.240
things differently, so it
exposes differently.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.280
Why?

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.470
I don't want to be paying
attention to all of that.

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.750
I need to be paying
attention to what?

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.210
The moment as it unfolds
in front of me.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.620
The architect Mies van der Rohe
said, "An interesting

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:34.720
plainness is the most difficult
thing to achieve."

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.940
You want to have "blow
you away" pictures?

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.340
Photograph interesting
plainnesses, things that

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.890
others walk by so that you
create an image that stops the

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.850
viewer the same way
you were stopped.

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.020
The conversation in a
photograph is this.

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.830
Ansel Adams was asked, how
many people are in your

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:57.420
photographs?

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.370
And he said, well, me.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.930
No.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.060
The only thing I disagree with
him on all of his quotes is

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.150
the one person that doesn't
belong in your

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.160
photograph is you.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.070
And here's the reason why,
in my philosophy of it.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.610
Things happen in the
space between.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.400
Photograph doesn't happen
over here, and it

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.430
doesn't happen over here.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:24.160
It happens in this space,
the space between.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.460
In karate, the reason why you
throw a punch and pull out

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:32.380
fast, versus planting it, is
that if you plant it, 90% of

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.030
the force of the impact
is left in the

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.150
hand if it's there.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:40.320
If it comes in and pulls out,
90% of the impact is here.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.890
Where do you want the impact
of your photograph to be?

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.330
In the photograph.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.410
You want to create an image so
that it's as if the person who

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:52.300
is looking at it was standing
in the same place that you

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.610
were when the photograph
took you.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.650
So if you can get to that
point, that's a

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.230
great place to be.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:06.150
Well, how do you get to
that point, would be

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.940
a question to ask.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.880
Do we agree on that?

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.570
Mr. Stuff, I'm about
to tell you.

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.230
How you get to that point is you
understand the middle part

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.410
of photography forwards,
backwards, upside down,

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.020
sideways, in any other
dimension, since we can talk

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.020
string theory here, and
you'll understand

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.190
what I'm talking about.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:32.300
And then at point of capture,
promptly forget it.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.540
There's a concept in Japanese
thought, in Zen Japanese

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.990
thought, called shibumi, which
is the ability to have

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:41.660
thoughtful, thoughtless thought,
to do the right thing

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.480
at the right time, in the
moment, without consciously

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.020
thinking about doing it.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.060
You simply be it.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.900
You simply do it.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:53.290
How you get there is
through practice.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:57.490
There's a misnomer that practice
makes perfect.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:58.890
Practice does not
make perfect.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.200
Perfect practice
makes perfect.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.050
You have to practice
at practicing.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.360
One of the great sorrows I have
as a teacher is I will go

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.560
to exotic places with people,
and I will do what I always

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.550
do, which is what would
you like this

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.350
conversation to be about?

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.420
And somebody will say to me,
well, I came here to learn how

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.440
to use my camera better.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.810
How much money, time, and
effort did you spend for

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:25.260
buttonology lessons?

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.220
When you walk into the hairball
of photography, you

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.000
need to know that camera as
well as you know yourself.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.490
Sun Tzu, "The Art Of War."
It's a great book on war.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:34.520
It's a great book on life.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.620
It's a great book on art.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.000
You know your camera as well as
you know yourself, you will

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.880
know the outcome of
every photograph.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.720
Know your camera half as well as
you know yourself, you get

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.980
half the shots, you lose
half the shots.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.900
Don't know your camera means
you don't know yourself.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.630
You were truly lost.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.880
So where do you practice?

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.700
You practice here, where
it doesn't matter.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.860
You carry a camera with
you everywhere you go.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.420
You drive your cat crazy, your
significant other crazy, your

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.350
kids crazy, your
friends crazy.

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:02.770
Why?

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:03.900
Because you're crazy.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:06.400
You decided to do photography,
right?

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.020
I mean, there are many more
things that one could do that

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:15.666
would be less nuts-making
than photography.

00:11:15.666 --> 00:11:17.480
I'll give you another
question to ask you.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.340
When you look at somebody's
work, do you know if

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:23.270
it's good or bad?

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.080
When you look at a picture,
you can say,

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.470
that's good, it's bad.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.740
I like it, I don't like it.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:29.910
You can do that.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.180
You can go through these
pictures up here, and you will

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.990
make judgments as to whether or
not they're good or bad to

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.400
your aesthetic, correct?

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.220
Why can't you do that
with your own work?

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.040
Why can't you look at your own
pictures and say, this is

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.230
good, this is bad?

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.160
Why is it all crap?

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:52.340
Furthermore, why did you
choose a hobby in which

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:56.290
everything you do, you say
to yourself is what?

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.390
It's crap.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.130
Really?

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:00.450
There are enough people to
beat you up in the world.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:02.860
You do not need to assist.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.840
Your biggest critic sits in
the same chair you do.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.580
I contend that, no,
it isn't crap.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:13.120
What the problems are is
understanding stuff.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.450
Technology.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:18.820
It is this interesting thing
that we do with technology.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.350
We blame ourselves for the
problems of the technology,

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.100
and we blame the technology for

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.980
problems that are ourselves.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:30.730
For example, a camera
meters at 18% gray.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.500
That means if I shoot a white
wall and a black wall, and I

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.580
let the meter do it, I'm
going to get what?

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.170
Two 18% gray walls.

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.300
So we go out in this highly
dynamic, highly lit

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.680
environment, we take
a picture, and

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.730
it comes out flat.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.210
And we say to ourselves,
I suck.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:46.490
No!

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.140
The camera meters at 18% gray.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.440
What sucks is the camera
meters at 18% gray.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.570
So you change the way you expose
because you understand

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.090
the middle.

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.620
Here's the way I look at it.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:59.270
You're traveling a circle, but
you're going to do it in a

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.330
straight line.

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.050
Every decision you need to make
about your photograph has

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:06.070
to happen where?

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.010
Moment of capture.

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.110
The more you understand about
the middle, the more informed

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.440
your decision can be at the
beginning, because you're in

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.500
service of what?

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.580
The end.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:17.120
The print.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:20.220
What's the print
in service of?

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:21.270
Your voice.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.290
Where does that happen?

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:23.950
At the beginning.

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.670
So it's this circle, but it's
like taking a circle and

00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.380
making it a straight line.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.350
Now one of the things that is
important to understand is the

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.610
first concept, the
lens as brush.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:46.030
There is a reason when I pick up
a 64 pound camera bag that

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:50.070
I have in this--

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:53.480
I always feel like I'm a
Ringling Brothers clown, and

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.000
they're about to all
hop out with this.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.140
There's a reason why I have a
200 millimeter, 70 to 200

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:11.860
F4.5, a 70 to 200
2.8, a 70 to 210

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:24.940
push-pull, a 24 to 120 nano.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:31.420
My new rocket motor,
the 80 to 400.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.690
That's a beautiful
piece of glass.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:42.740
The 70 to 300.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:43.990
I'm not done.

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.580
70 to 300, and the 28 to 300.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:55.810
You get a feeling that
I nail 80 to 124?

00:14:55.810 --> 00:15:01.130
I absolutely nail that
focal length.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.380
Why?

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.640
Bokeh.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.320
It's pronounced "bouquet." OK?

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.940
Not Boca.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.290
Boca is a city in Florida,
also known as

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:20.490
God's waiting room.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.750
I told that joke in Florida.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.000
It did not go over.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:30.500
Bokeh is a very unique
quality.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.030
It's the quality of blur.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:36.460
It's a harmonic that is caused
by all the things in the lens

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.280
that you don't want
a lens to do.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:42.955
It's sort of like the Caesar
salad dressing of optics.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.450
You laugh, Mr. Stuff.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.900
But Mr. Camera Person
does not.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.200
Life story wants to know,
how does this apply?

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.710
I'm a better cook than I am a
photographer, but I will never

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.520
be as great a cook as the
great cooks that I know.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.890
So I spend a lot of time working
with how food works.

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:09.900
Caesar salad dressing.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.170
It's made up of anchovies,
strong.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.080
Raw garlic, strong.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.250
Red wine vinegar, strong.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.550
Coleman's hot mustard, strong.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.070
Parmesan cheese, strong.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.310
Olive oil, not so strong.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.530
You put them all together,
what do you get?

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.180
A mild dressing.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:31.680
Why?

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.540
Because each one of those things
cancels each other out

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.390
in a way in which creates a
harmonic that, if it's done

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.990
correctly, everything dovetails
into everything

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:44.350
else, and you have
a smooth flavor.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:49.580
So all the things in a lens that
you don't want have to be

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.400
balanced in such
a way to create

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.160
something that you do want.

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.523
For example, how many Nikon
shooters do I have?

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:01.590
That just makes my day.

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:02.840
To you Canon shooters--

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:09.119
it's been years coming,
hasn't it?

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:11.754
This is the 72 to 210
D-series lens.

00:17:11.754 --> 00:17:17.369
This is probably the lens
I built my career on.

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.900
This is the best portrait lens
you will ever, ever find.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.369
If somebody is silly enough to
want to sell it to you, do

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:26.160
them a favor and relieve
them of it.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.109
Why?

00:17:27.109 --> 00:17:32.630
It has the best bokeh for
portraiture I have ever seen.

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:36.110
Linear objects, hair, stuff
like that, tack sharp.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:37.740
Skin, perfectly smooth.

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:40.590
Background, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful blend.

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:46.140
It has come down to why this
matters with something called

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.090
depth of field.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.410
My favorite definition of depth
of field is Michael

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:55.900
Reitman's, which is a circle
of confusion is a bunch of

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:59.400
photographers sitting around a
table defining depth of field.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:08.850
So let's talk about depth of
field and the illusion of

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.060
depth of field.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:11.740
Let's agree on terms.

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:13.640
What are the parameters
of depth of field?

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.740
Aperture, do we agree?

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:18.620
Focal length.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.820
Distance from a subject.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.540
And if you want more crap in
focus, you stop the lens down.

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:27.450
No.

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:29.830
Focal length has nothing
to do with it.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:33.320
Distance of the subject does,
aperture does, and something

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.350
called angle of view.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:40.520
All lenses have the same
depth of field.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.480
Why a wide-angle lens appears
to have a greater depth of

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:47.850
field than a telephoto lens
has to do with this.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.770
The smaller an object is,
the more in focus

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:52.080
it appears to be.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.670
The bigger an object is,
the less in focus

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:55.940
it appears to be.

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:59.110
How many people shot film?

00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.530
OK.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:02.260
For those of you who don't shoot
film, I agree, film is

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.740
what occurs in your teeth now
when you don't brush.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.830
But back in the day, 35
millimeter film, if you looked

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.985
at a contact sheet, all
the pictures would

00:19:09.985 --> 00:19:10.820
be in focus, right?

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:13.250
It wasn't until you put it in
the enlarger that all hell

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.640
broke loose.

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.330
Why?

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:18.840
Because as you blew the image
up, that's when you started to

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.270
see the blur.

00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:24.050
The tighter the edge,
the more in focus.

00:19:24.050 --> 00:19:26.030
The less coherent, the
bigger it is, the

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.420
less in focus it becomes.

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.730
That's the first thing.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.170
Here's another proof.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:34.820
An 80 millimeter lens on the
35 millimeter camera is a

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:37.500
telephoto lens, correct?

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.750
Slight telephoto,
but telephoto.

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.320
If we call 50 normal, 80 would
be in the realm of telephoto.

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.950
An 80 millimeter lens on 2.25
camera is the normal lens, and

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.680
an 80 millimeter lens on a
4 by 5 view camera is a

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.660
wide-angle lens.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.180
What changed?

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.830
Angle of view.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:58.100
So that's the first thing
to keep in mind.

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.570
I will get to why that
matters in a second.

00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:07.630
The next one is the misnomer of
if you stop the lens down,

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:11.080
you get more things in focus.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:17.250
That is not true according
to physics.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.905
Unless you can introduce, my
favorite word in photography,

00:20:20.905 --> 00:20:25.135
the Scheimpflug principle--

00:20:25.135 --> 00:20:26.890
cool word, isn't it?

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:28.790
Swings and tilts.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:31.490
Unless you can do this, if
you're dealing with a

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:35.520
fixed-lens system, which is
what this is, physics says

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.920
that the only thing that is in
focus is that which the lens

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.290
is physically focused upon and
anything that crosses the

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.200
plane of focus.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.940
That means that anything from
the plane of focus is the

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.880
increasing area of acceptable
out of focus,

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.630
though it isn't in focus.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:00.590
Now why we believe this to be
true has to do with film.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:04.250
A lens, any one of these lenses
here, is capable of

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:09.760
resolving a minimum
of 200 line pair.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.050
That's 200 black and white
lines per centimeter.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:19.600
Film was between 150 and 170
line pair, which means that

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.310
the lens has greater resolution
than the film.

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:24.820
With me so far?

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.470
Silver paper was between
50 and 75 line pair.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:31.550
So the lens has greater
resolution than the film, and

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.600
the film has significantly
greater resolution than the

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:35.500
photographic paper,
silver paper.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.830
So anything above 75 line pair
will register as what?

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.290
75 line pair.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.720
So you have the illusion of more
things in focus, but in

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.620
reality, what you have are more
things at 75 line pair.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:52.180
Digital, the lens sees 200,
the sensor sees 200, and

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.000
high-end printers can print
upwards of 300 line pair,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.450
which means that the output
device has greater resolution

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.720
than the file that you're
sending it.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:01.220
So what are you going to see?

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.830
Blur ramp.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.080
So this brings up a very
interesting question, which

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:13.260
goes back to yours, yours,
yours, and trust me when I

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:16.520
tell you, yours.

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.580
Trust me.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.820
Which is, what's your photograph
more about, in

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.202
focus or in blur?

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:30.782
What do you worry about more,
in focus or in blur?

00:22:30.782 --> 00:22:32.930
You worry about in
focus, right?

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.220
But only one thing in your
photograph's in focus.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.550
So you're spinning your wheels
worrying about less than 1% of

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.730
the image when most
of your image is

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.020
about the ramp of blur.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:44.580
Here's another one.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.790
You want four objects in
a photograph in focus?

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:49.910
What do you know you need?

00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.120
Four photographs.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.840
Because you can't have four
objects in focus in a digital

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.540
camera because of
the resolutions.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.930
The trick with the photograph
is that when you're all said

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:07.480
and done, it looks like you
didn't do anything, and the

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.670
person looking at your
photograph will believe that

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.240
they could go right
out and shoot it.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.560
And at the same time, what
you've done is that when they

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.800
look at a flower, if you took
a picture of a flower, for

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.050
that much time they
see your flower.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:23.350
Then they see the flower that
they're looking at.

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:27.130
How you accomplish this task
and where pretty is in a

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:27.690
photograph--

00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.620
and if you want to pick one of
the great epiphany moments of

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:35.570
my career visually, to answer
how do you do this, was when I

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.780
realized that my photograph was
more about the blur than

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:41.050
it was about the focus.

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:43.590
All lenses focus.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.860
That is what lenses do.

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.740
That's their job.

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:50.250
But it is how they handle from
in focus to blur, which is

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.060
where the pretty is.

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:56.060
Are you making the seed packet
photograph, or you're trying

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.950
to make a piece of art?

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.270
Are you putting something in the
Encyclopedia Britannica,

00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:03.310
or the Encyclopedia Americana,
or Wikipedia, or you're trying

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.980
to make something that
moves somebody?

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.060
That's the question.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.680
If what you're trying to do is
accurately document something,

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.420
then focus, stack the thing, put
it [? in Helicon ?] focus,

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:15.180
make one big in focus
photograph, and call it a day.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.920
If what you're trying to do is
to move the viewer's eye

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.970
around the photograph and tell
the story you want to told,

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.650
because you want to move the
viewer in a certain way, then

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.410
we're in a different realm.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:30.920
And the more you understand
the physics

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.570
of this, the math--

00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:36.170
and what is a great thing for
me is that I give this

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:39.560
discussion quite a bit, and
the fact that everybody in

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.330
this room could probably correct
me on my math really

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.150
makes my day.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:47.390
So you have to understand
how these work.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:51.490
For example, does light travel
in a straight line?

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.470
Not according to Einstein.

00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:56.830
According to Einstein,
light bends.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.110
Light's both a wave and a
particle at the same time.

00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:02.090
The reason why these lenses are
designed the way they are

00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.410
is so that red, green,
and blue hit the

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.090
sensor at the same time.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.810
Nothing about the journey of
light down this barrel is a

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:08.520
straight line.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:10.960
It does move in a forward
direction, but it doesn't move

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.500
in a straight line.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.980
So natural light has a whole
different set of things that

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:23.140
it does, attributes, that
strobe light doesn't.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.940
It's both ambient and
directional at the same time.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:27.070
You can light in a ball.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.390
Hot light works the same way,
which is why I tend to use

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:32.370
those lights, that
type of lighting,

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.320
because it's prettier.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.360
It's also the more difficult
and the simpler types of

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.680
lighting to do at
the same time.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.840
It requires a greater
understanding of how light

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.035
works to be able to shoot
it, but it's everywhere.

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:51.210
What I look at when I look at
these is the bokeh of the

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.170
lens, how it handles blur.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:58.220
Apertures that I shoot at, I
shoot wide open, I do portrait

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:04.640
at 5.6, and I do landscape at F8
or F11, depending on where

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:07.280
the critical aperture, which
is where the light's most

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:11.130
evenly distributed across
the lens system, is.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:15.350
F22 does not give me
the sharpest image.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:20.810
F22 gives me the greatest area
of acceptable out of focus.

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.590
So again, it's understanding
your glass.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:24.850
There's a--

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.841
is it borrowlenses.com?

00:26:26.841 --> 00:26:28.580
Rent some lenses.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.520
See how they work.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.410
Play with the blur.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.450
You will find prettier
in the blur than

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.260
you will in the focus.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.060
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you a slide show

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:40.100
in which when you see this,
there will be no music if you

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:44.770
watch this on YouTube, but
you'll hear the music here.

00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:48.520
We will agree this is
a weapon system.

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:51.080
Nothing says professional
photographer, high

00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:54.210
anti-spontaneity than
a camera like this.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.780
This is the ultimate point
and shoot camera.

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.950
I program the back for
the parameters that

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.540
I want it set for--

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:05.240
color space, way I want it to
white balance, how I want

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.060
picture control to handle
things, at what speed I'm

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.180
going to shoot.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.710
I put this on aperture priority,
and I have a

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:16.370
focusing system that
[SNAPS], OK?

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.610
So it's not the little green
button which decides

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:19.430
everything for me.

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:23.620
I decide before I walk in what
it is that I think the

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.060
environment is going
to require from me.

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:29.260
I also shoot in the raw,
but not in the buff.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.930
I'll be very clear about that.

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:34.190
That will get you arrested.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:38.040
The reason why I shoot in the
raw is a raw file allows me to

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.700
rebake a cake.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:44.810
The only thing that I can't
unto is ISO and bad

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.590
photography.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.680
Other than that, I can
change everything.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.070
So I come up with a set of
parameters that I think will

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:58.250
fit, and I want to offload as
much as I possibly can the

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:02.270
things that I don't want to
worry about, like exposure.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.090
I want this camera calling the
ball whenever possible on

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:06.680
exposure, because it will
do it better than I

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.150
can, most of the time.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:12.040
I want this camera
auto-focusing

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.910
because it will focus--

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:14.830
because of these, right?

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:18.150
Sharper than I can, and
quicker than I can.

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:19.930
Because what I want to be
doing is I want to be

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:22.550
practicing on reacting
to the moment.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:25.960
So that's why I picked this
camera system, because the

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.230
camera system allows me to set
it up, and it's kind of my

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:30.960
little green button.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.440
So did I connect that for you?

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.420
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:35.140
VINCENT VERSACE: OK.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.190
So that I practice.

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:38.210
And then the other thing that
is important is I can tell

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:42.750
what's going on with my camera
by the sound of the shutter.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:43.810
That's important.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:45.710
Like if I'm in a really dark
room, and I'm hearing click,

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.560
click, click, that's
ISO, way too high.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.580
Or if you're outside on a bright
day, and you're just

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.430
hearing that camera shoot off
at an 1/8,000 of the second,

00:28:55.430 --> 00:29:00.240
that tells you you haven't
done something correctly.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.840
So it's understanding the
majority of what the menus do

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:07.250
on the back and how to set
it up is important.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:10.330
Again, it's understanding the
system so completely that when

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:13.000
you set it up, you don't have
to worry about it, that you

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.400
can hear by sound what is going
on, that by the way in

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.570
which the camera is shooting
tells you that something is or

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:24.130
is not correct on it.

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.640
I always do something called
VSE, Visual Search of

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:27.320
Extremities.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.270
When the camera is in the camera
bag, and I pull it out,

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:31.020
the first thing I do is turn
it on just make sure

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.770
everything is set right.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.790
Because there are gremlins that
live in camera bags, and

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.600
they turn the camera on, they
push the buttons, and they

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.430
turn it off.

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.380
And all of a sudden,
you don't know.

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:42.390
Or somebody decides they want
to look at your camera.

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:44.430
They play with all
your buttons.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:48.240
I was out shooting in Burma,
and somebody played with my

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.510
camera, and put it into JPEG--

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:56.720
I don't know what's
below garbage.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.710
And I'm shooting this picture,
and it's like bing, bing,

00:29:58.710 --> 00:29:59.636
bing, bing, bam!

00:29:59.636 --> 00:30:02.420
And it's like, something's
not right.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.900
And I shot this entire
sequence of

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.630
JPEG basic in SRGB.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:10.990
And it was just, like, really?

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.214
A little closer, just
a little closer.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.690
This gets into the other
part of it, which

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.270
is camera as canvas.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.560
I have two D800s,
a D600 and a D4.

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:29.150
One D800 is converted for
infrared, and then I have the

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:33.030
D600, and the D4,
and the D800.

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:38.410
Why would I possibly want to
have that many different types

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:41.590
of resolution in a camera?

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:46.390
I don't want to shoot a portrait
at 36 megapixels.

00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:49.250
That's like retouching
an orange.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.430
That's hours of work.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:52.890
I want a, nice, smooth
skin tone.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.570
I want to be able to shoot
at very low light

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:55.330
when I shoot a portrait.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:55.530
Why?

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:58.310
Because lower light has
a prettier quality.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:00.310
I want to shoot a landscape, so
what am I going to shoot?

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:02.850
I'm whipping out that D800,
thank you very much.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:06.500
I have no idea what is going to
face me when I go to shoot.

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.820
What camera do I pick?

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.520
D600.

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.190
Why?

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:15.910
4,000 ISO, no noise, 24
megapixels, no problem.

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:18.320
Each camera is a different
canvas that

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.280
does a different thing.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.630
It's a different tool.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:23.620
And each one of these lenses
combined with that creates a

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.880
different look.

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.010
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you a bunch of

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:33.850
images in which what I would
like you to see here, first,

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.720
is my commitment to the moment,
which is the things

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:39.630
that move me, and you're going
to see some of the infrared

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:40.560
stuff as well.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.130
And we will get into that.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:45.690
And you're going to see a
journey of my life, part of

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.310
which is all the different
places I go.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.640
Because, you see, my photographs
really are the

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:53.590
snapshots of the vacation
that is my life.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:56.895
I'm amazed that I get
paid to do this.

00:31:56.895 --> 00:32:00.490
I'm happy I get paid to do this,
but there's a different

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:05.435
story than the photograph tells,
that the photograph--

00:32:05.435 --> 00:32:06.600
how do I put this?

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.400
The photograph tells one story,
but there's a different

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.620
story behind each photograph.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.690
I'm going to tell you one story
about one photograph

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:15.100
after I show you this.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.989
So let's see if this works.

00:32:16.989 --> 00:40:41.977
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:40:41.977 --> 00:40:45.630
VINCENT VERSACE: Proof that
children are indeed born in

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:48.720
cabbage patches.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:52.810
So what you should see is that
there's a lot of use of blur

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.570
in that photograph and a
lot of use of focus.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:41:00.580
And the objects that I want
you to see are in focus.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:06.100
There's some other things that
I do, which is I don't really

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:10.310
pay too much attention to
composition theory,

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:14.230
particularly 17th century
painting composition theory.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:17.570
Rule of thirds, Grecian mean,
the center of the frame is for

00:41:17.570 --> 00:41:20.370
God, not you, or the center of
the frame is the best place to

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:21.640
put the object.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.420
You decide.

00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:26.660
What I pay attention to is the
biomechanics of vision.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.610
What is looking at
the picture?

00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:35.990
17th century composition theory
or a set of eyeballs?

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.220
Eyeballs.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.880
So what should I pay
attention to?

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.990
Eyeballs.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:43.720
Here's how the eye works.

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.080
It goes to a pattern that it
recognizes first in the area

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.950
of light, then to dark.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:52.550
I want you to watch
a trend here.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.040
It then goes from high contrast
to low contrast.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.830
What is contrast?

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:01.370
Bueller?

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.540
The ratio between
light and dark.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:08.470
It goes from high sharpness
to low sharpness.

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.700
What is sharpness, or
specifically, unsharpness?

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.430
And if we want to get really
technical, the

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.850
Craik-O'Brien-Cornsweet
edge illusion.

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:17.960
What is that?

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.230
What is unsharpness
in a computer?

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:25.270
The introduction of contrast
to the edges of things.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.150
The human eye is a
contrast beast.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.650
It works on varying degrees
of contrast.

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:32.300
It then goes from in focus to
blur, which is different than

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:34.180
high to low sharpness.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:37.260
High saturation of color to low
saturation of color, which

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.590
is another form of contrast.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.830
Warm colors move forward
in the picture.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.210
Cool colors recede
in a picture.

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.950
So my job is to control your eye
and where it goes, because

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:50.950
the most important thing to keep
in mind is that the human

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:52.360
eye doesn't want to
look at anything.

00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:54.210
It's always in a seek mode.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:57.100
Women understand this concept
better than men.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.350
You're out on a date, a pretty
woman walks in, what

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:02.460
does the guy do?

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:03.870
Always in the seek mode.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:08.690
So my job is to create a
situation where you can't stop

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:11.040
looking at the photograph.

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.930
It's my picture, right?

00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:17.470
I decide where the viewers eye
goes based on being true to

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.300
the emotional moment
that took me.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:22.480
So how do I do that?

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:29.330
Well, I use the middle part,
software, to control how

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:30.540
things go about.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.010
Contrast, sharpness, light,
dark, detail enhancement,

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:37.050
detail degradation, blur.

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.690
All of these things are things
that I try to do.

00:43:39.690 --> 00:43:44.050
Now, what I have found is
in-camera blur is better than

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:47.380
digital blur, so what I try to
do is create images that will

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:50.520
give me the varying levels of
blur that I want and the

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:54.040
varying levels of sharpness that
I want, that there's a

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.740
point where I start
looking at the

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:57.100
picture as image structure.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:44:00.140
Now, there are two schools
of thought.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:03.250
There's a school of thought,
Ansel Adams school of thought,

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:06.380
which says that without
previsualization, the zone

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.060
system is just a five finger
exercise, so you need to

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:11.000
previsualize the photograph.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.440
And then there is Paul
Caponigro's school of thought,

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.320
which is if you believe in
previsualization, you deserve

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.760
what you get.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.310
Both are correct.

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:25.250
You don't want to walk into a
situation previsualizing what

00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:27.980
picture you're going to take,
because all you're ever going

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:29.460
to do is be disappointed.

00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.030
Because the picture that you're
dreaming to see will

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:33.900
never occur.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.470
What I previsualize when
I walk in to shoot, I

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:39.490
previsualize being amazed.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:44.730
The moment I fire the shutter,
at that moment, I start

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:48.110
previsualizing the
finished picture.

00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:52.320
When I was a kid growing up--
see, I turned that, right?

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.500
There was a poster that my
father had of a "Saturday

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.910
Evening Post" cover called
"The Connoisseur." It's a

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:01.290
picture of a Jackson Pollock
scribble, and there's this guy

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:04.900
standing like this, holding
a bowler hat and a pair of

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.790
gloves, looking at this Jackson
Pollack scribble.

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.080
Every time I take a picture, the
ones that really grab me,

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:17.420
in that moment in my head, I put
the picture in that frame

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:19.440
with that guy looking at it.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.360
And so when I'm working on the
image in post-processing

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:26.050
software, for me what it is is
removing everything that is

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:28.930
not that picture, what

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:30.830
Michelangelo said about sculpting.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.830
He viewed the rock as a living
stone, and he removed

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:36.540
everything that was not the
sculpture, and he freed the

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:39.130
sculpture from the rock.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.570
The file is the living file,
and what I do is I free my

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:46.060
vision of the image
from that file.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.650
And the thing you have to keep
in mind when you're working on

00:45:48.650 --> 00:45:56.820
an image is that magenta, kind
of puke yellow, low contrast

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.320
file you're looking at that's
a raw file, that's the

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.870
cleanest the data
will ever be.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:05.630
Everything that you do to that
file from that moment forward,

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:08.200
you're clipping data, and the
minute you clip data, you

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.390
introduce artifact.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:11.010
Correct?

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.220
We all know that.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:15.310
Now, artifacting is both
cumulative and may be

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:16.510
multiplicative.

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:18.120
And the goal is to--

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.750
and this always sounds like
a Disney song to me--

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:26.170
minimize the cumulative and
negate the multiplicative.

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:27.920
Can you see that being
a Disney song?

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:32.970
So the trick is in how you
post-process the image so that

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:37.660
you negate the multiplication
aspects of artifacting, and

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.396
you just deal with cumulative,
and you work at minimizing it.

00:46:42.396 --> 00:46:45.580
Which is why I use the tools I
use, and which is why I build

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:46.370
things in layers.

00:46:46.370 --> 00:46:48.950
Instead of putting it all on one
layer, I have many layers.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.290
It's not because I like to
give myself busywork.

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.670
It's because I like to make it
so that I can blow the picture

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:56.790
up 16 feet if I want
to, because I

00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:59.260
minimize the artifact.

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.590
The key elements of
a photograph--

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:04.100
light, gesture, color.

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.820
That's Maisel.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:07.790
And if you're not familiar with
Jay Maisel, you should

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:08.500
look him up.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.180
I think he's probably the
greatest breathing

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.520
photographer we have.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:14.890
Mine, because I can't leave
well enough alone--

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.510
light, gesture, color,
and time.

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:20.030
Specifically, timeless.

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:24.290
If you can create a photograph
where you have no idea when it

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:30.420
was shot, those are truly the
most successful photographs.

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:32.280
Here's a couple of things
that I've learned.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:36.110
Timeless in a city happens
four stories and above.

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:36.785
Go to San Francisco.

00:47:36.785 --> 00:47:39.200
Next time you're in San
Francisco, look at where the

00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:44.210
banners end for the Giants
or the next exhibition at

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:45.665
whatever gallery.

00:47:45.665 --> 00:47:48.290
Look at where all
the neon ends.

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:52.530
It ends at the bottom of the
third floor, at the beginning

00:47:52.530 --> 00:47:53.710
of the fourth floor.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:57.300
If you shoot from the fourth
floor up, what you see is the

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:02.715
age of the city when those
buildings were shot.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:06.880
There's another thing.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.480
There's a photographer
named [? Duino ?].

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.540
I used to look at his work,
and he was one of those

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.830
photographers for me which
whenever I looked at his

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:16.190
pictures, it was,
I'm not worthy.

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:18.550
I should go find a job where I
say "would you like fries with

00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:22.830
that?" I mean, just not worthy
to take a picture.

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:24.070
His work was so amazing.

00:48:24.070 --> 00:48:26.930
His backgrounds were
so incredible.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:30.790
So I did something that guys
don't normally do.

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:32.850
Basically, I read the book.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.050
Instead of looked at the book,
I read the instructions.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:39.500
And he had one quote that just
stuck with me. "I find the

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.680
stage, and the

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:44.270
players come." Brilliant!

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:47.260
What the man would do is he
would go find the background,

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:51.300
set the camera up, get it all
set, sit down, have a cup of

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:55.142
coffee, and wait for stuff
to walk into his picture.

00:48:55.142 --> 00:48:56.942
That's brilliant!

00:48:56.942 --> 00:49:01.390
That's absolutely the best
way to shoot, because the

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:04.160
background is as important
as the foreground.

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.130
And if your background is
interesting, and then you have

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:10.130
an in-focus subject, the
picture's even more compelling

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:11.020
and interesting.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:14.240
So I would invite you to
consider, in your quest for

00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:16.830
how do you make them better,
find the stage, and the

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:18.960
players will come.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.770
Pay attention to the background
as much as you pay

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:23.550
attention to the foreground.

00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:26.200
What's more important
in a photograph, the

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.450
light or the subject?

00:49:29.755 --> 00:49:32.640
What do you think?

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.870
Subject?

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:34.350
OK.

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:37.720
Do you know what the word
"photography" means?

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.760
Photo-graphy, "to write with
light." what would you rather

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:47.290
look at, the Taj Mahal poorly
lit or a line of clothing

00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:50.590
beautifully lit?

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:57.330
Treat light as if it
was a solid object.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:00.270
It's as important to the
photograph, if not more

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.880
important to the photograph,
sometimes

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.970
than the subject itself.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.650
If the light is beautiful,
all sorts of

00:50:07.650 --> 00:50:09.460
wonderful things happen.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.850
Now, here's one for you.

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:12.580
What's the fastest thing
in the universe?

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:21.230
Unless you're a Trekkie, then
it's tachyons, right?

00:50:24.283 --> 00:50:28.200
Doesn't it amaze you that dark
always seems to be there

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.260
before light?

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.620
Doesn't that trip you out?

00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:35.060
Now, yes, light is the fastest
thing that we know of in the

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.140
universe, but dark in a
photograph is as important to

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.800
the photograph as light.

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.760
And the way in which
I remember that--

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.150
Terry Pratchett came up
with that quote--

00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:47.120
is that dark is always
there before it.

00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.800
I need to have dark in my
photograph to have drama, to

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.810
have contrast, to control the
ideas of the picture.

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:56.170
I need to have in-focus,
I need to have blur.

00:50:56.170 --> 00:50:57.970
These are the elements
that I work with.

00:50:57.970 --> 00:51:02.390
That's why these lenses
are my brushes.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:07.250
These cameras, because of the
different resolutions, become

00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:11.490
my canvas that I paint on,
because I pick the camera that

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:15.030
I'm going to use based on what
is the needs of what it is

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:17.020
that I'm going to do.

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.790
Now, I'm going to show you some
pictures of flowers in

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:25.940
which almost all of them are
multiple photographs, and what

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:28.360
I want you to pay
attention to--

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.900
this concept is image
harvesting.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:34.460
You've heard of high dynamic
range, right?

00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:38.510
Or how to make your picture look
like a Harry Potter set?

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:43.870
This is EXDR, Extending the
Dynamic Range of everything.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.210
You can extend the dynamic
range of time.

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:48.520
You can extend the dynamic
range of focus.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:50.250
You can extend the dynamic
range of blur.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.980
You can extend the dynamic
range sharpness.

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:55.530
You can extend the dynamic range
of color, in addition to

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:57.485
extending the dynamic
range of exposure.

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:04.540
You have to look at what it is
you want to say, what it is

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:05.350
that you want to leave.

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:08.560
What is the best thing
of you if not the

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.700
images you leave behind?

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.310
What is going to outlast you?

00:52:12.310 --> 00:52:14.740
It is the imagery that you leave
behind if you choose

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:16.560
photography as the
way in which you

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.190
choose to express yourself.

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:21.600
Because there are many other
ways to express yourself.

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:24.170
You've picked this one.

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:27.260
So this is the best of
who you are here.

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:30.250
This is the culmination of
everything you are as a

00:52:30.250 --> 00:52:32.230
person, you put in
a photograph.

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:34.040
It's your sensibility.

00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:36.670
That's what matters.

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:39.310
So give it the care, and give
it the attention, and create

00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:41.190
the image that moves
the viewer the same

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:42.230
way you were moved.

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:45.830
So in this next grouping, we're
going to take a look at

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:46.560
our flowers.

00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:50.520
Now, I became known
for my flowers.

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:58.280
And the funny story about them
is I don't really like or

00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.510
dislike them.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:02.430
Why I started shooting flowers
was when I was beta testing

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:06.790
cameras, they don't talk back.

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:09.480
And I would get cameras where
the menus would be in

00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:13.840
Japanese, and I don't speak
or read Japanese.

00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.670
So all you have to do is give
a flower a little water, and

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:19.040
we're done.

00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:22.730
So it wound up that in the
course of doing these things,

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:27.280
I made some discoveries about
photography and focus.

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.470
So let's take a look at these.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:31.670
And what I want you to keep in
mind when you look at this is

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:34.590
another thing that I invite
you to consider, which is

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:37.980
shoot your portraits as
landscapes and your landscape

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:39.410
like portraits.

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:42.570
That it's the cross pollination
of the two

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:48.880
disciplines that inhabit your
photographs, that yes or no,

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:53.186
are these the portraits
of the flower?

00:53:53.186 --> 00:57:18.230
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:20.020
VINCENT VERSACE: One of the
secrets that I have to

00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:23.910
photographing flowers is
that they're all alive.

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:26.460
None of them are cut flowers.

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:30.160
I had a friend of mine who
does a lot of flower

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:31.280
photography.

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:35.440
I'd look at his work, and I just
couldn't put my finger on

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:37.510
what it was that bugged
me about it.

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:39.040
Just something bugged me.

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.910
It was beautiful, well-composed,
but

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:43.452
there was just a--

00:57:43.452 --> 00:57:44.850
you know?

00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:48.420
So I was photographing a pink
flower out in front of my

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:50.760
house, and it was moving.

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.610
And I figured, well, I have a
clamp, and I have this little

00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:56.080
alligator clip thing, and what
I'll do is I'll just pluck it,

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.490
and I'll put it in the
alligator clamp.

00:57:57.490 --> 00:58:00.320
And so I'm looking at it through
the lens, and I'm

00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:02.370
seeing the flower do this.

00:58:02.370 --> 00:58:08.710
And I pluck it, and then it went
like that in front of me.

00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:09.520
Still a flower.

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.330
It still maintained it's shape,
but something left it.

00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:15.280
I realized that the thing that
I didn't like about his

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.250
flowers was that he was
photographing corpses.

00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:22.120
So what I do when I photograph
a flower is that, first off,

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.390
they're all alive.

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:26.930
I can't put my finger
on it, but there's

00:58:26.930 --> 00:58:28.240
something about it.

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.970
The next thing is-- and
let's take a look at--

00:58:32.655 --> 00:58:34.810
let's see if I have this
set up right--

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:40.100
this image right here.

00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:51.225
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine shots.

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:55.660
Does it look like nine shots?

00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:01.640
Because what I'm looking at is
what is the journey of the eye

00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:05.090
that I want, how do I want you
to go through this picture,

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:08.690
and what's the pretty thing
about this photograph?

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:10.710
It's the blur.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:12.840
The blur is the pretty thing.

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.120
So I want to take
a look at that.

00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:20.610
Now, I'm going to show you
two pictures here.

00:59:20.610 --> 00:59:23.420
This is in the next
slide show.

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.670
That's impossible.

00:59:28.330 --> 00:59:29.580
Why is it impossible?

00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:37.340
Unless I told you, wouldn't know
that that was impossible,

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:41.780
because this is what actually
should occur.

00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:47.400
I'm either going to get this
kid, or I'm going to get that

00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:52.040
kid, but I'm not going
to get both kids.

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:58.790
And as wonderful as this
experience was for me, this

00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:00.930
isn't a wonderful
picture in that,

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:01.920
yeah, it's a nice snapshot.

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.170
Great.

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:03.780
You had a good vacation?

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.160
Those are fun kids.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:11.860
What I want is I want to be
able to tell this story.

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:20.560
I've removed that which would be
disturbing to you based on

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:23.490
the way in which the eye wants
to see the picture, because

01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:26.300
you would see both of
these kids in focus.

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.570
Now, how do you get there?

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:30.730
This is for you.

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:33.030
Practice.

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:34.280
I practice at--

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.130
I knew it was somewhere--

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:48.760
what I practice at is being
able to bam bam, bam bam.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.320
So it's click click click
click, click click click

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.860
click, click click click.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:56.520
He just has to be
99% in focus.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:59.240
He has to be at 100% in focus.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.990
Even if the emotional moment
is a nanosecond off on him,

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:06.340
that's OK, because it's
still within the arc.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.760
Where do you practice being
able to shoot like that?

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.470
While you're there, or driving
your cat, your spouse, your

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:16.280
kids, and all your
friends crazy?

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:21.710
Practice doesn't make perfect.

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:23.570
Perfect practice
makes perfect.

01:01:23.570 --> 01:01:25.990
Understand this as well as you
understand yourself, you will

01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:29.300
know the outcome of
every photograph.

01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:32.070
You need to be like the Borg.

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:34.147
Literally, it's like this.

01:01:34.147 --> 01:01:36.135
Resistance is futile.

01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:42.770
And the other thing you have to
do is you've got to work in

01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:44.320
such a way--

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.130
this is for you, and
this is for you--

01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:49.640
you have to work in such a way
that you can make it so that

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.620
the camera disappears.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.300
I've been taking photographs
since I was seven.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:57.760
That's when I started
taking pictures.

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.240
This is my favorite
story to tell.

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.360
I sold my first photograph
when I was nine.

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:03.560
This sounds like, whoa, right?

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.510
I sold it to a local
newspaper for $50.

01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:11.470
So you're nine years old, $50
is add a couple of zeros.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.550
I took my dad out to lunch.

01:02:16.550 --> 01:02:19.090
We went to Woolworth's, which
doesn't exist anymore.

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:20.960
Had two frankfurters each.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.390
He had a cup of coffee.

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:23.610
I had a chocolate shake.

01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:24.620
We shared fries.

01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:27.340
And like my dad, I left
a dollar tip.

01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:33.150
And for the entire 9 to 10
years, I kept saying, dad, you

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:34.490
know, I got that $50.

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:36.620
And there was one point where
he goes, kid, you spent that

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:39.920
$50 years ago.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.660
But I've been taking pictures
since I was nine.

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.520
So for me, all of this
is an extension.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.550
And there was a book
about mastery.

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:51.060
And mastery comes
at 10,000 hours.

01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:53.450
You beat yourself up sometimes
because you don't know it as

01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:55.900
well as the pictures that you
fell in love with, and the

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.000
reason why you don't know your
camera as well as the person

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.890
who shot the pictures that you
fell in love with is that they

01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:03.270
probably had the head
start on you.

01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:06.980
Which brings us back to always
carry a camera and drive

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:10.760
everybody around you nuts, and
learn how to shoot flowers,

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.088
because they don't talk back.

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:14.478
AUDIENCE: In your presentations,
you were using

01:03:14.478 --> 01:03:16.390
a cross dissolve between
all the images.

01:03:16.390 --> 01:03:19.736
I'm wondering if it was
intentional in the way you

01:03:19.736 --> 01:03:22.925
ordered them and if you feel
like the prior image impacts

01:03:22.925 --> 01:03:25.112
the way [INAUDIBLE]
next image?

01:03:25.112 --> 01:03:28.180
VINCENT VERSACE: Why can't every
one of my conversations

01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:31.030
be like this?

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:31.500
Yes.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.130
That's called landscaping.

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:37.420
What happens is I make conscious
choices about how

01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.640
they intertwine.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.150
They're not random.

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:43.560
The reason why I use cross
dissolve is because that's the

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.350
least visually offensive and
least gimmicky-looking

01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:47.020
transition.

01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.900
Like you get the spinning box,
or the breaking up into this,

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:51.860
or the rippling water effect.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.050
It's like, great.

01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:58.240
There are pieces of software
that shall remain nameless in

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.530
operating systems that shall
remain nameless that

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:06.810
introduced like when I use my
Cintiq or a pen, and I click

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:09.080
on the screen, I get a ripple.

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.003
Or if I move an image,
it goes--

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:20.260
you know, if I wanted to play
a video game, if I wanted

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:22.710
"Star Wars."

01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:26.200
It's like in UI design, if I can
put that out there, one of

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:29.330
the things that I love about the
Google splash page is the

01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:34.130
philosophy of the Google splash
page, which is don't

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:35.875
muck it up.

01:04:35.875 --> 01:04:37.405
It's a great idea.

01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:41.010
It like in UI design,
clean, simple.

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.630
It's about the image.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:44.290
It's not about finding my image

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:46.720
underneath the user interface.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:49.510
So the way in which things get
designed here always appeals

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:51.610
to me as a visual artist,
because it's the

01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:52.790
canvas I work on.

01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:54.470
You're in support of my work.

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:56.920
You're not the art form, you're
the form that supports

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.290
the art form.

01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:01.950
And that's a brilliant way of
looking at things, I think,

01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:03.540
and I applaud that.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.560
So don't stop doing that.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.880
Please?

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.660
But yes, for you, the answer
is I picked that dissolve

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.100
because it's the simplest, and
everything moves because it

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.370
all tells a story.

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:19.590
Where the first slide show was
set up, how it went from San

01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:24.150
Francisco to New York to Paris,
and then that last shot

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:27.760
leads into the flowers that lead
into the portrait, which

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:30.400
is the landscapes
as portraits.

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.570
So I'm trying to reinforce
the idea.

01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:35.160
Everything matters.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.650
Everything dovetails into
everything else.

01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:41.500
The answer to the question
is always, yes.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.230
If you say to yourself,
do you think the

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:45.310
order my pictures matter?

01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:46.890
What's the answer?

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:48.090
Yes.

01:05:48.090 --> 01:05:49.990
Should I shoot two more shots?

01:05:49.990 --> 01:05:50.270
Yes.

01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:52.190
Do you think-- yes.

01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:53.440
Uh-- yes.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:06:01.150
I had a very wise teacher
named Viola Spolin.

01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.710
She teaches improv.

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:03.770
She created improv
as we know it.

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:04.850
It's called Spolin technique.

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:06.380
A very wise woman.

01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:10.560
Said at the point at which you
say it doesn't matter is the

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.560
point at which you say your
career or your character

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.090
doesn't matter.

01:06:16.090 --> 01:06:17.030
Everything matters.

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:22.130
You just don't know what
significance is until the

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:25.260
large, operatic lady sings.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.850
So I apply that to this.

01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:30.120
At the point at which you say
it doesn't matter in your

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.490
image is the point at
which you say your

01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:32.710
image doesn't matter.

01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:33.680
Everything matters.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:36.070
You just don't know what's
significant until you make the

01:06:36.070 --> 01:06:38.380
less pixel sing.

01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:41.270
So the job is to consider
everything.

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:44.360
Some things are more important
than others, but consider

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:46.140
everything.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:49.750
Which leads to I used to
have hair down to here.

01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:53.720
Now I have no hair, because
I'm worrying about every

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.350
little thing.

01:06:54.350 --> 01:06:58.070
So that when I put the
photograph up, what is not

01:06:58.070 --> 01:07:02.000
there is any reason to take
you out of the experience,

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.280
that the landscaping of the
photograph matters.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.580
Now, I'm going to show
you something, why

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:10.900
infrared is way cool.

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.270
This is a picture
of a young girl.

01:07:14.270 --> 01:07:18.450
Now, this is shot infrared, and
all three of the pictures

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:21.150
that I'm going to show you
were shot with the same

01:07:21.150 --> 01:07:24.320
camera, one modified for
infrared, one not modified for

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:26.360
infrared, using the same lens.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.600
And the shot was done this.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.386
Click, click click.

01:07:31.386 --> 01:07:32.810
See this?

01:07:32.810 --> 01:07:34.060
Pretty, right?

01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:38.960
Pretty, right?

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.080
Exactly.

01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.810
Not that it's not pretty, but
there's a profound difference

01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:49.280
between this and this.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:52.252
What do you think that is?

01:07:52.252 --> 01:07:52.700
Eyes.

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.580
What else?

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:57.160
It's the glow.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:01.430
What you're looking at is near
visible spectrum light, light

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:05.470
you can't see but you can feel
and you're aware of.

01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:07.890
I can't explain this, and
forgive me if I sound like an

01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:11.360
airy, fairy artist because,
well, I'm about to become an

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.720
airy fairy artist.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.980
It's as if there's another
universe I'm photographing

01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.100
that I can't see, that when I
photograph it feels like I'm

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:22.660
looking at something that
happened 100 years ago.

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:24.060
It's the wildest thing.

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.840
It's why I fell in love
with infrared.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:30.760
You're photographing near
visible spectrum, and you're

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:34.130
photographing some small
degree of heat.

01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:35.950
But to truly photograph
infrared, you need to cool

01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:37.300
down the sensor.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:41.080
But that's what causes the glow,
I think, is the heat

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.490
aspect of the light.

01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:45.350
That's just me guessing, so
I'm not basing that on

01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:48.149
anything other than having shot
it for eight years and

01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:49.770
looking at it.

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:55.140
I'd like to show you one last
show, and I'd like to show you

01:08:55.140 --> 01:08:59.029
this so that you can see what
it's like to shoot things at

01:08:59.029 --> 01:08:59.779
street level.

01:08:59.779 --> 01:09:02.540
And pay attention to the
buildings, because I want you

01:09:02.540 --> 01:09:06.507
to tell me what year
they were shot in.

01:09:06.507 --> 01:14:01.915
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

01:14:01.915 --> 01:14:04.410
VINCENT VERSACE: Thank you
so much for your time.

01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:08.965
[APPLAUSE]
