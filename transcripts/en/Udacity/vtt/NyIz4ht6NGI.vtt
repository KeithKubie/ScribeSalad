00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go ahead and add the post() handler.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, so here we are in our editor,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we've got our get handler, and this is what draws the form.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Let's add the post version, and this will get called when we post to the URL,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which is what happens when we submit our form.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay,so I've added a post function that goes along with our get function,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the post function will get called when we post to /, which is what our form does.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And upon a post, we will return back to the browser--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the string--"Thanks! That's a totally valid day!"

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Alright, let's give that a shot in our browser.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Okay, so here we are in the browser. I've reloaded my page.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now I'm going to type in some submissions, and this isn't exactly a valid month, day, and year,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
but let's click submit.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Our form says, "Thanks! That's a totally valid day!" which is nice of it to say,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
but our day isn't exactly valid, is it?
