00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:08.159
Enough mutations can bypass these fail-safes,

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:10.376
driving these cells to divide recklessly.

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.452
That one rogue cell becomes two,

00:00:12.452 --> 00:00:13.725
then four,

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:14.893
then eight.

00:00:14.893 --> 00:00:18.058
"How do you animate real materials,

00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:20.532
like brains and nerves and stuff like that?

00:00:20.532 --> 00:00:22.340
How do you take something that doesn't move

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.717
and then make it move?"

00:00:23.717 --> 00:00:25.474
"So, that's actually, we used a method

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:27.178
called stop-motion animation,

00:00:27.178 --> 00:00:29.139
in which you are moving the objects

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:30.307
underneath the camera,

00:00:30.307 --> 00:00:31.398
each frame, one at a time,

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.247
and you take a picture

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:35.544
for each picture that you've created.

00:00:35.544 --> 00:00:38.564
So, for this, we were watching a lot of videos

00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:40.656
on how cell division works,

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:43.907
and from that, I created a line-drawn animation

00:00:43.907 --> 00:00:45.947
that was my reference animation.

00:00:45.947 --> 00:00:48.950
And, using the software that we use for stop-motion,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.737
I was actually able to look

00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:53.617
at that reference material while shooting

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:56.958
so I could kind of arrange underneath the camera

00:00:56.958 --> 00:00:58.752
in order to match my animation

00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:00.505
as I would follow along.

00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:03.438
And we actually shot all of this on a green screen,

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:06.550
and the purpose of using the green screen was,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.691
for example, in the scene where you see

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:11.010
many cells dividing at one time,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.683
for me to have actually have to animate each of those cells

00:01:13.683 --> 00:01:15.977
unanimously dividing at the same time

00:01:15.977 --> 00:01:17.777
would have been a lot of work

00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:19.647
that we wouldn't have had time for.

00:01:19.647 --> 00:01:21.562
So, the green screen allowed me to do

00:01:21.562 --> 00:01:22.772
a couple of cell divisions

00:01:22.772 --> 00:01:24.273
that I could then duplicate

00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:26.523
in order to show cell division:

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:27.938
two, then four, then eight."

00:01:27.938 --> 00:01:30.017
"So, you only have to basically actually record it once

00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:31.934
and then you can just duplicate it on the computer."

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:32.985
"Exactly."

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:34.409
"So, it sounds really painstaking.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.409
How long did it take to, like, record one cell division?"

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.209
"I think I did in a day, I did a couple of cell divisions.

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:44.749
So, sort of a full work day,

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:48.506
so, probably a couple of hours for one.

00:01:48.506 --> 00:01:51.732
I think, actually, the stuff that took longer was the text.

00:01:51.732 --> 00:01:53.463
We were animating the word, 'growth'.

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:57.382
We were animating it getting smaller and taller and wider.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:02:01.688
And for this, I was literally adding one single seed at a time

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.438
in order to create that animation."

00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:06.903
"So, how did you animate the word cancer?"

00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:10.685
"I actually started with the word cancer written

00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:12.155
and moved backwards

00:02:12.155 --> 00:02:15.511
and was surgically removing one seed at a time,

00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:18.902
and then we played that photage backwards

00:02:18.902 --> 00:02:21.439
to make it look like it was appearing.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.627
We use that trick a lot of times in stop-motion

00:02:23.627 --> 00:02:26.085
because if you want things to really conform,

00:02:26.085 --> 00:02:28.877
any time that you're having things come together

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:30.048
or fall apart,

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:31.547
it usually makes more sense

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:33.611
to start with that together frame

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:35.189
and work from there,

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.734
and do the scatter from there,

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:38.693
and then, just play that in reverse.

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.736
It's a little too painstaking.

00:02:40.736 --> 00:02:41.862
Stop-motion is painstaking,

00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:43.120
it's a labor of love,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.322
but you have to also be practical

00:02:45.322 --> 00:02:47.605
when you have a deadline."

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:49.448
"So, there's this technique that you guys use

00:02:49.448 --> 00:02:51.033
to make the cells look like they're alive

00:02:51.033 --> 00:02:52.701
so they're not just sitting there.

00:02:52.701 --> 00:02:53.900
That's called shimmering.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.909
How does that work exactly?"

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.874
"So, in animation, shimmering is usually when you are,

00:02:58.874 --> 00:03:00.487
if you're doing drawn animation,

00:03:00.487 --> 00:03:02.838
you're drawing that same drawing multiple times

00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:04.546
but with slight variations

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:06.884
so that way, you don't have a stagnant, still frame

00:03:06.884 --> 00:03:08.344
under the camera.

00:03:08.344 --> 00:03:10.676
With the cells, using the seeds and the Nerds,

00:03:10.676 --> 00:03:13.819
we had the opportunity to really have a look,

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.858
like they were kind of vibrating and pulsating in a way.

00:03:16.858 --> 00:03:19.320
And so, those are actually, depending on the cell,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.115
three to five pictures.

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:22.233
With the candy Nerds,

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:25.395
I would rearrange their position each time

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:28.280
so there's actually removing all the colorful Nerds,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.074
leaving the purple ones in the center

00:03:30.074 --> 00:03:32.866
and moving the colorful ones back in

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:34.159
into a different position.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.888
But with the seeds,

00:03:34.888 --> 00:03:36.933
when the seeds were shimmering,

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:38.187
for that, I would actually

00:03:38.187 --> 00:03:40.876
just very, very, very lightly, like,

00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:42.549
roll my hand over it very slightly

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.718
and then make sure none of them

00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:46.663
fell out of the constraints of the cell,

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:47.636
fix the edges,

00:03:47.636 --> 00:03:48.549
and take that picture,

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.306
and just slightly do that again.

00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:52.245
So, it just slightly changes their position

00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:54.208
or rustles them up a little bit

00:03:54.208 --> 00:03:57.021
so that would cycle over and over.

00:03:57.021 --> 00:04:01.273
And those would play on what animators call threes.

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:03.740
And threes means that each picture

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.654
is on screen for three frames

00:04:05.654 --> 00:04:07.456
at twenty-four frames per second.

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:09.129
So, for the shimmers, you were seeing

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.606
eight different pictures each second of footage."

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:15.849
"How much of your sweat and tears

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.178
are on these Nerds?"

00:04:17.178 --> 00:04:19.061
"I think, actually, to be honest,

00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:23.149
the part that was the most perspirational

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:25.963
of using the Nerds for animation

00:04:25.963 --> 00:04:30.072
was the place where we had to separate them into colors

00:04:30.072 --> 00:04:32.212
in order to use them to animate.

00:04:32.212 --> 00:04:34.160
Every time I would put them on the screen to animate,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.715
on the tabletop to animate,

00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:36.870
I would have to separate them out

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.248
at the end of the day again.

00:04:38.248 --> 00:04:40.290
And that was the most frustrating part.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.753
And, honestly, up until, like, three weeks ago,

00:04:42.753 --> 00:04:45.171
I dropped my purse on the ground

00:04:45.171 --> 00:04:48.550
and, like, lentils came out of my purse and onto the floor.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.250
Like, there's, this video will stay with me forever."

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.096
"In your bag."

00:04:53.096 --> 00:04:54.348
"In my bag.

00:04:54.348 --> 00:04:56.138
It goes wherever I go."
