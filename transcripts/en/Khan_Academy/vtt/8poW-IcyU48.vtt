00:00:00.108 --> 00:00:02.448
- [Voiceover] In previous
videos on triangle congruence,

00:00:02.448 --> 00:00:06.824
we talk about how side,
side, angle cannot be used

00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:08.904
to establish triangle congruence.

00:00:08.904 --> 00:00:11.024
What I'll do in this video
is I'll show you an exception

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:12.804
and the exception is when we are dealing

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.024
with right triangles, in particular,

00:00:15.024 --> 00:00:18.424
when this angle is a right angle.

00:00:18.424 --> 00:00:22.984
So, this is a 90 degree
angle in which case,

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:26.784
this first side is going
to be the hypotenuse

00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:31.524
and the second is going to be
a leg, is going to be a leg.

00:00:31.524 --> 00:00:33.364
And that's why you'll sometimes see this,

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:35.766
instead of calling it, you
know, instead of calling it SSA

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.166
for the special case of a right triangle,

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.114
you'll sometimes call this, see this

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:43.054
as hypotenuse leg congruence.

00:00:43.054 --> 00:00:46.272
Let me do this in the same
colors so I'm consistent.

00:00:46.272 --> 00:00:48.282
So, hypotenuse,

00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:52.652
hypotenuse leg congruence.

00:00:52.652 --> 00:00:53.972
And if you're dealing,

00:00:53.972 --> 00:00:56.326
if someone saying there's a
hypotenuse of that triangle,

00:00:56.326 --> 00:00:58.014
then that triangle by definition is going

00:00:58.014 --> 00:00:59.132
to be a right triangle.

00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:02.790
You can only have a hypotenuse
in a right triangle.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.950
And to get an intuition for
why two triangles are going

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.050
to be congruent if their hypotenuse,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.610
if each of their hypotenuses
have the same length.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.590
Is it hypoteni, hypotenuses?

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.130
If they have the same length,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.410
and then the leg has the same length,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.630
we can look at these two right over here.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.010
So, we're going to assume
that this hypotenuse,

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.280
that this hypotenuse has the same length

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.640
as that hypotenuse.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.118
We'll say they're both of length c.

00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:34.498
We can assume that this leg here

00:01:34.498 --> 00:01:37.298
has the same length.

00:01:37.298 --> 00:01:40.294
This leg here has the
same length as that leg.

00:01:40.294 --> 00:01:43.354
We could call that length a,

00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:46.594
and you can see that the only
way to draw the next side.

00:01:46.594 --> 00:01:48.424
Remember, there's two
constraints now here.

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:49.992
We have to connect to
this point right over here

00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:51.470
as we're dealing with the triangle.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.410
So, we're only going to have three sides,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.330
and it's a right
triangle, so it has to be,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.030
the next side I draw
has to be perpendicular.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.210
So, the only way to draw that,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.190
the only way to draw
that is just like that.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.530
And to feel good that, I
guess more analytically,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.978
that this side, this green
side is congruent to this side,

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:10.658
we can just use the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:10.658 --> 00:02:13.038
The Pythagorean theorem would tell us

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:16.098
that this green side,
right over here, is going

00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:18.486
to be the square root

00:02:18.486 --> 00:02:22.566
of the hypotenuse-squared, c-squared.

00:02:22.566 --> 00:02:26.294
c-squared minus a-squared,
minus the square

00:02:26.294 --> 00:02:28.914
of the other leg, and
this one is also going

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:31.274
to be the square root of c-squared.

00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:32.674
Actually, I'm just gonna draw an arrow.

00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:33.854
This is gonna be true for that

00:02:33.854 --> 00:02:37.300
and it's going to be true from that.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.710
That comes straight out of
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.010
So, from that, we know that the third leg

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.950
or the third side, that they,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.490
those two corresponding
sides have to be congruent.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.520
And so, that's where we get

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.560
the hypotenuse leg congruence from,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.830
which is really just
a special case of SSA,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.204
which we've said in the past,
you cannot apply generally

00:02:57.204 --> 00:02:59.544
to establish triangle congruence.
