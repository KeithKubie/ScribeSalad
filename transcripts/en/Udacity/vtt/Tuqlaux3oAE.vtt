00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're coming to the end of what I want to say about decorators.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I wanted to add one more debug tool.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
That's one I'm going to call disabled.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's very simple.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Disabled is another name for the identity function--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that is the function that returns its argument without doing any computation on it whatsoever.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Why do I want it and why do I call it "disabled?"

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Well, the idea is that if I'm using some of these debugging tools like trace or countcalls,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I might have scattered throughout my program trace define f and some other traced functions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Then I might decide I think I'm okay now. I think I've got it debugged.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I don't want to trace any more.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Then what I can do is I can just say "trace = disabled"

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and reload my program, and now the decorator trace will be applied to the function,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but what it will do is return the function itself.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Notice we don't have to say that disabled is a decorator,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
even though we're using it as if it were one,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
because it doesn't create a new function. It just returns the original function.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That way we won't have the trace output cluttering up our output,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and the function will be efficient.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
There won't even be a test to see if we are tracing or not.

00:01:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It'll just use the exact function that passed in.
