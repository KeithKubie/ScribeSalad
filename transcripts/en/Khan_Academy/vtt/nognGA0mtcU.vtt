00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.330
Welcome back.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.440
Let me erase what I did.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.880
And I should have done this
before starting this.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.350
But it doesn't take too long.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.600
We're on problem number 6.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.070
And once again, a figure that
has not been drawn to scale.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.680
They do that to you
on purpose.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.070
Sometimes it is drawn to scale
and they say that it's not.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.040
You shouldn't assume anything.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.300
And they're saying that this is
3x degrees, they say that

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.310
this is 2x degrees, and they say
that this is 4x degrees.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.380
In the figure above, three line
segments meet at a point

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.710
to form three angles.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.350
What is the value of x?

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.020
Well, what are all of these
angles going to

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.250
have to add up to?

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.410
If you add this angle plus this
angle plus this angle,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.820
what do you do?

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.230
You went all around
the circle.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.650
So they have to add
up to 360 degrees.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:03.120
So 2x plus 4x plus 3x is going
to equal 360 degrees.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.640
And what's 2 plus 4 plus 3?

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.282
That's 9x.

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:07.020
Let me see.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.870
This is always where
I mess up.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.980
2 plus 4 is 6, 6 plus 3 is 9.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.555
9x is equal to 360.

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:17.740
x is equal to 360
divided by 9.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.420
It equals 40.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.800
And that is choice C.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.780
Problem number 7.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.660
Positive integers x, y, and
z-- so they're integers--

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:46.960
satisfy the equations x to the
minus 1/2 is equal to 1/3, y

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.790
to the z is equal to 16.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.940
OK, those are the
two equations.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:01.090
If z is greater than y, what
is the value of x plus z?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.770
So the trick is-- because you're
saying, well, how do I

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.350
solve for this?

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.699
Well, the trick is that
you know that

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.080
these are all integers.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.140
So first of all,
let's do this.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.020
So x to the minus 1/2
is equal to 1/3.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.210
That means that 1 over the
square root of x-- I just

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.280
rewrote x to the minus 1/2.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.650
1/2 power is square
root, and the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.710
negative means the inverse.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.590
So 1 over the square root
of x is equal to 1/3.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.340
Or you could say the square
root of x is equal to 3.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.750
x is equal to 9.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.450
So that was easy.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.170
We just solve this.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.060
You just have to know that a
negative means to invert, and

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.500
that 1/2 power is the same
thing as square root.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.670
Now y to the z equals 16.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.240
We've got to come up with
integers y and z where is z is

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.070
greater than y that
end up at 16.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.640
Well, the number that
immediately pops out is 2 to

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.460
the fourth power.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.250
2 to the fourth power
is equal to 16.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.480
The other option was 4 to the
second power, soon. right?

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.060
But 4 to the second power
wouldn't have satisfied this,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.830
because 4 is greater than 2.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.530
So the exponent has to be
greater than the base.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.180
So 2 to the fourth.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.730
And we know that because
it has to be integers.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.230
So we know that z
is equal to 4.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.776
So what's 4 plus 9?

00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:20.570
It's 13.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.360
x plus z.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.700
13.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.540
And that is choice D.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.790
Next problem.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.670
I'm on problem number 8.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.570
And let me draw what
they have drawn.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.750
I don't even know if it's useful
for me to draw, but I

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.980
will do it because
they've done it.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.530
And then they have
a semicircle.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.690
So I could do a semicircle,
something like this.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:53.920
I could draw it-- use the
circle tool like that.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.340
Roughly.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.830
That's good enough.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.090
I could erase the bottom if I
wanted to, but let's just

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.140
assume that we only
see this top part.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.030
And they say-- whoops, I'm still
using the line tool.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.110
This point is 4 comma 0.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.029
This point is 8 comma 0.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.160
And they say, in the semicircle
above, the center

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.800
is at 4 comma 0.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.450
Which of the following are
x-coordinates of two points on

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.050
the semicircle whose
y-coordinates are equal?

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.270
Well, this is an interesting
question.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.850
Because it's not so much math,
but it really is getting the

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.410
intuition of kind of the
symmetry of the circle.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.520
So it wants to know two
points on the circle

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.400
where the y is equal.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.430
So, for example, this point
and this point.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.165
The y is going to be equal.

00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:58.030
And so it would be this
point and this point.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.940
And similarly, we could say,
well, this point and this

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.155
point, the y's are equal.

00:05:03.155 --> 00:05:07.620
If we take down, it would be
this point and this point.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.500
The key is any of these pairs of
points have to be the exact

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.780
same distance from the center.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.410
And that makes sense.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.440
If we go the same distance to
the left and go up to the

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.055
circle, and we go the same
distance to the right and go

00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:20.150
up to the circle, they're going
to intersect the y-axis

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.350
at the same point.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.950
So we have to look at their
choices and see which of their

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.980
pairs of choices are equal
distance from x equals 4.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.650
So the first choice
is 1 and 6.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.530
1 is 3 less than 4, and
6 is 2 more than 4, so

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.190
that doesn't work.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.190
A is 1 and 6, and that doesn't
work because 6 is much closer

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.560
to 4 than 1 is.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.000
B is choices 1 and 8.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.350
Well, 1 is 3 away from 4.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.570
Right?

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.860
1 is here.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.480
Well, 8 is all the way here.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.040
So 8 is 4 more than 4.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.560
3 you less, 4 more.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.740
Doesn't work.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.190
C.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.300
2 and 6.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.140
This looks promising.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.150
2 is 2 less than 4.

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:10.940
6 is 2 more than 4.

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.800
So that's 2 less, bam, it's
going to be there.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.760
2 more, bam.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.310
Going to be there.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.250
So that's our answer.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.660
We don't even have to look
at the other ones.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.980
But if you look at the other
ones, you'll see that they're

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.200
all different distances
away from x equals 4.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:31.440
Next problem, problem
number 9.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.590
If p is an integer, and 3 is
the remainder when-- OK, so

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.890
let me write this. p integer.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:56.370
3 is remainder when 2p plus
7 is divided by 5.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.670
3 is the remainder.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:04.590
Then p could be-- well, there's
a bunch of ways you

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.500
could do it, but really the
simplest way, the very

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.765
simplest way, is to just
try out the numbers.

00:07:10.765 --> 00:07:12.710
And let me ask you a question.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.250
When you divide something by 5,
if you get a remainder of

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.800
3, what is that number going
to have to end in?

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.010
Well, it's going to end
in a 0 or 5, right?

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.510
Oh, sorry.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.390
It's going to end
in a 3 or an 8.

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.860
Because if something is
divisible by 5, it ends

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.350
with a 0 or a 5.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.750
5, 10, 15, 20, 25.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.940
All of these are
divisible by 5.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:41.530
And if you add 3 to any of these
numbers-- 8, 13, 18, 23,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:45.500
28, and so on, 33-- all of these
numbers are going to

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.440
have a remainder of 3 when
you divide by 5.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.140
And then you could also say,
well, any of these numbers is

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.390
going to be the numerator.

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.040
And then you can actually,
if you want, you

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.720
could subtract 7.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.720
But actually, we
won't do that.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.160
What we could do is just try out
the different choices they

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.670
give, and see if any of these
choices create a number that

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.645
ends in an 8 or a 3.

00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:16.060
So let's see.

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:18.990
Choice A is 2.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.460
What is 2 times 2 plus 7?

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:23.500
It's 4 plus 7 which is 11.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.840
It's not that one because
it ends with a 1.

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.060
B.

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.910
3.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:30.260
3 times 2 is 6.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.260
6 plus 7 is 13.

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.370
We're done.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:36.970
And you can try it out.

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:40.169
If p is 3, 2 times 3 is 6.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.010
Plus 7, 13.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.400
Divided by 5.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.570
Well, the remainder is going to
be-- it's 2, remainder 3.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.550
So it works.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.595
And that was it.

00:08:47.595 --> 00:08:48.420
And it's good.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.540
We didn't have to waste time
figuring out C, D, and E.

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.000
OK.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.680
And then-- oh, I only
have a minute left.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:58.340
So I will wait to do the next
problem in the next video.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.590
