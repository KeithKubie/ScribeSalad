00:00:01.059 --> 00:00:03.402
- [Instructor] So I'm here
on the Khan Academy Exercise

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:04.635
for mapping shapes.

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:08.081
And I'm asked to map the
movable quadrilateral

00:00:08.081 --> 00:00:10.744
onto quadrilateral ABCD

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.962
using rigid transformations.

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:16.207
So here in blue, I have
the movable quadrilateral.

00:00:16.207 --> 00:00:18.290
And I want to map it onto

00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:20.996
this quadrilateral in gray.

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:24.009
And we have a series of tools here

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.878
rigid transformations of translation,

00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:27.597
rotation and reflection

00:00:27.597 --> 00:00:29.112
on the Khan Academy tool.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:30.561
And of course, we can undo it.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:33.161
So the technique I'm
going to use to do this is

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:34.973
I'm gonna first use translation

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:37.480
to make one of the corresponding points

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.734
overlap with the point
that it corresponds to.

00:00:40.734 --> 00:00:42.562
So, for example, it looks like

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:45.178
this corresponds to
Point C right over here.

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.575
And so I am going to translate.

00:00:47.575 --> 00:00:49.855
And so notice, once I click that I can

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:50.862
translate this around.

00:00:50.862 --> 00:00:53.138
So I'm gonna translate
right over here to Point C.

00:00:53.138 --> 00:00:54.564
And now, let's see.

00:00:54.564 --> 00:00:55.652
To make

00:00:55.652 --> 00:00:57.178
these two overlap

00:00:57.178 --> 00:00:59.255
I really can't do anymore translation,

00:00:59.255 --> 00:01:00.776
I made one point overlap.

00:01:00.776 --> 00:01:03.436
Do I rotate, or do I reflect?

00:01:03.436 --> 00:01:06.016
Well, if I eyeball it right over here

00:01:06.016 --> 00:01:08.680
it looks like I am doing a rotation.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.041
Let me try to make user rotation to make

00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.519
this segment eight over here
overlap with segment CD.

00:01:14.519 --> 00:01:16.631
So let me do a rotation now.

00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:18.205
And so

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:20.946
let's see, yep, this is looking good

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:21.943
There you go.

00:01:21.943 --> 00:01:23.246
We did the rotation

00:01:23.246 --> 00:01:24.978
and we are done.

00:01:24.978 --> 00:01:27.873
Now, let's do another example.

00:01:27.873 --> 00:01:31.302
So, here, what do we need to do?

00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:33.356
All right, so I'm gonna
do the same technique.

00:01:33.356 --> 00:01:35.546
This seems to correspond to Point C

00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:37.634
so I'm gonna translate first.

00:01:37.634 --> 00:01:38.717
So, translate

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.935
first.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.340
And then, there's something interesting

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.033
going on right over here.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:48.172
Because I've actually been able to overlap

00:01:48.172 --> 00:01:50.672
points C and A by shifting it.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.776
By translating it, I should say.

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:55.576
And so it's not clear
if I were to rotate it

00:01:55.576 --> 00:01:58.161
then I would lose the fact that A

00:01:58.161 --> 00:02:00.040
that the point that corresponds to A

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.126
is now sitting on top of A.

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:02.360
The point that corresponds to C

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.599
is now sitting on top of C.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.299
It feels like a reflection.

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.291
And it looks like a
line that would actually

00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:09.332
contain the points A and C.

00:02:09.332 --> 00:02:10.797
If we reflect over that line

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:11.792
we will be in good shape.

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:12.816
So let me see.

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:14.349
Reflection.

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.187
So let me see, move of the line.

00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:18.609
See how it looks.

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.511
There, that's not what I wanted to do.

00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:22.529
So let's see.

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.532
Let me move my line.

00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:27.304
So that is, I think, a
good line of reflection.

00:02:27.304 --> 00:02:29.060
And then let me actually

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.303
try to reflect, and there you go.

00:02:30.303 --> 00:02:32.020
I was able to reflect over that line.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.375
And my clue that I had
to reflect over the line

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:36.294
that contained A and C is that

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:37.794
the points A and C

00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:40.393
and their images

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:42.076
after the transformation

00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:43.387
were all sitting on top of each other.

00:02:43.387 --> 00:02:45.694
So, that was a good clue
that on a reflection

00:02:45.694 --> 00:02:48.493
if they're both sitting
on the line of reflection

00:02:48.493 --> 00:02:50.380
that they wouldn't move, so to speak.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.522
And there you have it.

00:02:51.522 --> 00:02:55.028
So this was a translation
and then a reflection.
