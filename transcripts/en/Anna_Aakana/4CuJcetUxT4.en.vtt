00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.040
You know what I love?

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.060
Myself?

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.160
*dubstep music*

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.980
Yes, but a year ago I finally admitted that I hate myself.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.240
I know that sounds super extreme,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.440
but the first time I had the revelation of like,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.380
"Wow, I think I DO hate myself!"

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.760
I really wanted to push it away and just deny it because it seemed so intense.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.120
But when you think about the way you talk to yourself, most often, we say things like:

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.000
"You're so stupid, why did you say that?"

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.000
"You're terrible at everything you do. 
Just stop. No one cares.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.700
"Uh, of course he left you, why would anyone wanna be with you?"

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.809
Which for some reason is totally acceptable coming from your head.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:44.440
But if you separated your mind and you,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.959
and you imagine that everything it was telling you is coming from a friend,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.844
"That's probably the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life."

00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:53.179
"Oh, your art is terrible. You're never gonna make it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.289
You should definitely get a day job"

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.300
"Yeah, I mean obviously you're single.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.700
You have so many issues, who would want to deal with that."

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.000
That friendship would not last.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.040
You know when I became aware of how awful my self-talk was,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.700
I also realized how those messages drove parts of myself I have been trying to change for years.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.680
That I sacrifice my mental health in the name of work,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.720
that I practiced poor boundaries 
because I'm afraid of speaking up,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.520
that I tolerate disrespect in romantic relationships

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.440
because honestly, it's what I think I deserve.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.500
So a year ago, I was like, okay. Well, how do I stop hating myself?

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.580
Because that's not a good thing

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.060
they say you can't love someone else if you don't love yourself

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.020
and I want to love someone else before I die!

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.280
And self-love, in particular,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.100
seems like this like very abstract, rainbows and butterflies, intangible concept beyond

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.260
achievement cause there's no like physical measurement of success,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.800
just this deep internal certainty 
and self-assuredness of one's worth

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.260
that I have never had and I 
cannot tell you what it looks like.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.880
Until now! *angelic music*

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.940
You know, everyone has their own way of working on themselves,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.640
but I've found the single instrumental tool in changing my self talk

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.840
has been journaling.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.180
Specifically journaling affirmations that just emotionally resonate with me.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.220
*meow meow meow*

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.900
Every single day for the last year,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.340
sometimes multiple times a day -- I was in a bad place you guys,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.920
I would journal and journal and journal

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.620
to combat all the negative self-talk that runs on the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.820
default apps of my brain.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.400
And the more I did this, the more aware I became

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.260
of what I was saying to myself moment to moment.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.460
So I would catch myself being self-deprecating as a joke

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.780
or beating myself up about a mistake I made 10 years ago

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.020
or judging other people for stuff that really was about my own insecurities.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.400
And I thought there would be like 30 steps or something

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.140
that I had to take in order to deal with this.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.320
But honestly there was only one.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.620
And that was changing my self-talk so it reflected the way I wanted to feel about myself.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.740
And this is manifested very slowly over the course of a year.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.440
I want to stress this 'cause I don't want to act like it's some

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.440
magical instant process, you know.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.080
It took time and I'm still working on it a lot.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.500
And I've been really surprised to find that self-love just means

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.340
taking a bunch of really small steps to communicate that I care about you/me.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.500
You know, like, walking away from unanswered emails so I can get a good night's sleep,

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.360
not being afraid to leave the party early,

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.560
having a skincare routine,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.580
being sober (that's a big one for me)

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.520
and being as patient, kind and encouraging to myself

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.740
as I would to any of my friends.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.920
I'm Anna Akana, I wish you luck on your journey because

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.900
the world, and especially the internet,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.160
would be a better place if we all loved ourselves.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.519
I want to say thank you to care/of for sponsoring today's video.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.940
I am very grateful that I get to work with brands that I love to fund art that I love.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.800
So because I'm both a vegetarian, and a little bit of a health nut,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.140
Every day I take a multivitamin, a probiotic, fish oil and magnesium.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.620
Vitamins have been explained to me by my doctor as just insurance

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.980
in case I get too stressed out that day and I haven't eaten what I needed to,

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.860
or if I'm not paying attention to my protein sources and being a junk food vegetarian

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.000
that just eats pasta and potato chips.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.040
And I definitely do notice that there's a difference in both my sleep quality

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.900
and my mood when I'm getting everything that my body needs.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.400
But I know that figuring out what your body needs can be very annoying and overwhelming,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.280
So care/of makes vitamins easy.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.700
