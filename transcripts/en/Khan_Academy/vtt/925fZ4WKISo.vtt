00:00:00.222 --> 00:00:03.620
- [Instructor] Sikhism comes
into being in northern India

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.071
in a time when the Mughals
are coming into power.

00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:09.106
What we see in this blue area

00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:11.802
is what the first Mughal emperor, Babur,

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:13.892
is able to put under his control,

00:00:13.892 --> 00:00:16.116
which includes the region of Punjab,

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:20.330
which is where Sikhism begins
and thrives to this day.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.942
We see later emperors like
Akbar continuing to expand

00:00:23.942 --> 00:00:27.050
the domain of the Mughal
emperor with Aurangzeb,

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.059
the least tolerant of the Mughals,

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:31.726
expanding well into South India.

00:00:32.644 --> 00:00:36.100
It all starts in the 15th
century with the birth

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.308
of who will eventually
be known as Guru Nanak.

00:00:39.308 --> 00:00:42.842
He's born into a merchant
class Hindu family,

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:46.937
and he is known to be precocious
from a very young age,

00:00:46.937 --> 00:00:50.143
especially when it comes
to matters of spirituality.

00:00:50.143 --> 00:00:51.967
He is constantly questioning.

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:54.984
He goes and learns
about various religions.

00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:57.964
Remember, North India is under
the control of the Muslims,

00:00:57.964 --> 00:01:00.242
but it's a Hindu-majority population,

00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:04.256
and you also have populations
of Christians and Jains.

00:01:04.256 --> 00:01:07.101
And this is also a time, as
we've studied in other videos,

00:01:07.101 --> 00:01:09.992
where the Bhakti movement is on the rise,

00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:14.162
this notion of devotional
love to God within Hinduism,

00:01:14.162 --> 00:01:17.131
and it's in this context that Guru Nanak

00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:21.405
becomes a significant, some
would say, Bhakti guru.

00:01:21.405 --> 00:01:24.846
To get a sense of some of his teachings:

00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:26.264
"There is but one God.

00:01:26.264 --> 00:01:28.221
"His name is Truth.

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:29.920
"He is without hate.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.010
"He is beyond the cycle
of births and deaths.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.621
"He is Self illuminated."

00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:39.188
So just in this excerpt
of some of his sayings,

00:01:39.188 --> 00:01:42.189
you see elements of the core of Hinduism

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.469
and elements of Islam.

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.114
There is but one God, a
central tenet of Islam.

00:01:48.114 --> 00:01:50.328
But then, these ideas that really come

00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:51.704
from a Vedic tradition.

00:01:51.704 --> 00:01:55.872
God is beyond the cycle of
births and deaths, samsara.

00:01:55.872 --> 00:01:57.978
He is self illuminated.

00:01:57.978 --> 00:02:00.818
There's a lot of mention
of your inner self,

00:02:00.818 --> 00:02:03.924
your true self, is one with this God.

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:05.564
"Even kings and emperors

00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:08.323
"with heaps of wealth and vast dominion

00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:13.078
"cannot compare with an ant
filled with the love of God."

00:02:13.078 --> 00:02:15.971
So here, you see this Bhakti influence,

00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:17.499
and you can see why he's considered

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.499
a major Bhakti guru or Bhakti saint.

00:02:21.567 --> 00:02:25.317
He's emphasizing this
devotional love of God.

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:30.334
"The world is a drama staged in a dream."

00:02:30.334 --> 00:02:34.635
So here, you have the Hindu,
the Vedic notions of Maya.

00:02:34.635 --> 00:02:36.585
The world is an illusion.

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:39.691
His followers will
eventually be known as Sikhs,

00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:43.272
and the word Sikh comes
from the Sanskrit word

00:02:43.272 --> 00:02:46.053
for to learn or learning,

00:02:46.053 --> 00:02:48.441
and it's related to the word for student.

00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:52.478
And even in modern Sanskrit-derived
languages like Hindi,

00:02:52.478 --> 00:02:57.162
you have words like sikhna,
which means to learn.

00:02:57.162 --> 00:03:00.243
Guru Nanak dies in the early 16th century.

00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:01.559
You can see by this point,

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:06.033
the Mughals have taken
control of northern India.

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:09.245
And before his death, he names Guru Angad,

00:03:09.245 --> 00:03:12.054
who is not his son, as his successor.

00:03:12.054 --> 00:03:15.135
After Guru Angad, you have Guru Amar Das,

00:03:15.135 --> 00:03:18.941
and then you have Guru Ram
Das, who establishes the city

00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:21.744
now sacred to Sikhs known as Amritsar,

00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:24.244
originally known as Ramdaspur.

00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:30.203
Guru Dam Das is succeeded
on his death by Guru Arjan.

00:03:30.203 --> 00:03:33.928
And Guru Arjan is
significant for many reasons.

00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:37.329
He creates the compilation
known as the Adi Granth,

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.496
which are the sayings and the
hymns of the previous gurus,

00:03:40.496 --> 00:03:42.016
including his own.

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:44.683
The Adi Granth, as we will
see, will eventually evolve

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:47.524
into the Guru Granth
Sahib, which is considered

00:03:47.524 --> 00:03:49.602
not only the Sikh holy book

00:03:49.602 --> 00:03:53.282
but also the last and final of the gurus.

00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:56.418
In Ramdaspur, later to
be known as Amritsar,

00:03:56.418 --> 00:03:59.585
Guru Arjan builds the Harmandir Sahib,

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:03.073
which is intended to be a place of worship

00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:05.767
for people of all religions.

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:07.575
They have a tradition of langar,

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:10.911
where they feed anyone
who comes from any faith,

00:04:10.911 --> 00:04:13.008
and today the Harmandir Sahib

00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:14.991
would later be known as the Golden Temple

00:04:14.991 --> 00:04:18.257
where later Raja would plate it with gold,

00:04:18.257 --> 00:04:21.685
is the largest free kitchen in the world.

00:04:21.685 --> 00:04:23.442
Guru Arjan is also known

00:04:23.442 --> 00:04:26.570
as the first martyr in the Sikh faith.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.403
As we've told about,

00:04:27.403 --> 00:04:30.641
the early Mughals were
relatively tolerant.

00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:32.728
Akbar in particular
was extremely tolerant.

00:04:32.728 --> 00:04:35.945
But upon his death, his
son Jahangir takes power,

00:04:35.945 --> 00:04:38.231
and early in Jahangir's reign,

00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:40.987
he is insecure about his hold on power.

00:04:40.987 --> 00:04:43.153
And remember, the Mughals are ruling

00:04:43.153 --> 00:04:45.266
from the same region where the Sikhs

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:48.030
are having an increasingly
growing following,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.653
not just from Hindus
but also from Muslims.

00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:53.787
Threatened by this growing following,

00:04:53.787 --> 00:04:57.954
Jahangir imprisons Guru
Arjan and tortures Guru Arjan

00:04:59.114 --> 00:05:01.241
trying to get him to renounce the faith

00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:02.927
to convert to Islam.

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:06.056
Guru Arjan refuses despite many days

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.969
of excruciating torture
being boiled alive.

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.493
Eventually, he dies and there's
slightly varying accounts

00:05:12.493 --> 00:05:14.669
of how it happens.

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.479
After his death, his
son, who will be known

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.229
as Guru Hargobind comes to power,

00:05:21.142 --> 00:05:24.660
and Guru Hargobind, as
legend has it on direction

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.194
from his father before he would die,

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:31.079
tells him that the Sikhs
need to protect themselves.

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:33.939
They need to adopt a military tradition

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:35.985
to protect themselves from the oppression

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:38.727
especially the oppression
from the Mughals.

00:05:38.727 --> 00:05:42.810
So, Guru Hargobind, he is
famous for establishing

00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:46.491
the military tradition of Sikhism.

00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:49.343
He is the first guru to
be what you could call

00:05:49.343 --> 00:05:51.023
a warrior saint.

00:05:51.023 --> 00:05:53.222
He's famous for wearing two swords.

00:05:53.222 --> 00:05:56.750
One to represent his authority
in the spiritual realm

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:57.741
and another to represent

00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:00.520
his authority in the temporal realm.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.770
He also has the longest tenure as guru.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.229
At Guru Hargobind's death,

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.698
his grandson, Guru Har Rai becomes guru.

00:06:09.698 --> 00:06:13.785
At his death, his very
young son, Guru Har Krishan

00:06:13.785 --> 00:06:16.553
becomes guru but dies of smallpox.

00:06:16.553 --> 00:06:20.720
Afterwhich, Guru Hargobind's
youngest son becomes guru.

00:06:21.701 --> 00:06:25.154
He is named eventually Guru Tegh Bahadur

00:06:25.154 --> 00:06:29.199
which means brave sword or
brave wielder of the sword

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:33.543
because as his father, Guru
Hargobind, fought the Mughals,

00:06:33.543 --> 00:06:35.959
he was known as being unusually brave

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:38.954
and an unusually competent warrior.

00:06:38.954 --> 00:06:42.182
He continued this tradition
of being a warrior saint

00:06:42.182 --> 00:06:45.035
and especially under the rule
of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb

00:06:45.035 --> 00:06:47.868
as the Mughals became
more and more intolerant

00:06:47.868 --> 00:06:49.730
and started force conversions,

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.273
he viewed himself as a
protector of the oppressed,

00:06:52.273 --> 00:06:53.328
not just of the Sikhs

00:06:53.328 --> 00:06:55.819
but the oppressed of any
faiths including Hindus

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.828
who are being forced to
convert by Aurangzeb.

00:06:59.828 --> 00:07:03.011
Eventually, Aurangzeb
tortures and kills him

00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:05.508
for refusing to convert to Islam

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:08.988
and he is considered the
second guru who is martyred.

00:07:08.988 --> 00:07:13.819
At his death, we have the
tenth and last human guru

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.071
of the Sikh tradition, Guru Gobind Singh,

00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:20.476
who continues, again, this
tradition of a warrior saint

00:07:20.476 --> 00:07:24.660
and actually formalizes it
in this notion of Khalsa.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.986
There's a famous story of him
gathering the Sikh community

00:07:27.986 --> 00:07:29.833
and asking for volunteers.

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:31.943
And the first volunteer
he takes into a tent

00:07:31.943 --> 00:07:33.550
and then he emerges from that tent

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:35.392
without the volunteer with a bloody sword

00:07:35.392 --> 00:07:36.869
giving people the impression

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:39.120
that he might have killed that individual.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.701
Then, he asked for more volunteers

00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:41.681
and more people coming.

00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:44.645
Every time, he comes out of
the tent without the volunteers

00:07:44.645 --> 00:07:46.194
but with a bloody sword.

00:07:46.194 --> 00:07:47.988
But after five volunteers have come,

00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:49.879
they all emerged from the tent.

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:51.682
He makes it clear that
this was an exercise

00:07:51.682 --> 00:07:53.973
as a test of faith to see who was willing

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.882
to risk their life to follow the cause.

00:07:56.882 --> 00:07:58.578
And he says, "These are the Khalsa,

00:07:58.578 --> 00:07:59.662
"these are these are the pure.

00:07:59.662 --> 00:08:04.521
"Together, we are going to be
a group to fight oppression

00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:06.674
"wherever it might be."

00:08:06.674 --> 00:08:09.522
And he formalizes what it means to be

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:11.686
one of these warrior saints.

00:08:11.686 --> 00:08:14.791
Famously, with the Five K's of Khalsa

00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:18.421
that anyone who goes into
the Khalsa indoctrination

00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:20.569
who becomes a Khalsa sikh,

00:08:20.569 --> 00:08:23.735
they should not cut their
hair, this is known as Kesh,

00:08:23.735 --> 00:08:26.294
they should wear a metal
bracelet known as Kara,

00:08:26.294 --> 00:08:29.590
they should have a wooden
comb known as Kanga,

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.168
and they should carry
a short dagger or sword

00:08:32.168 --> 00:08:34.382
known a Kirpan and there is Kaccherra

00:08:34.382 --> 00:08:36.172
which is often an undergarment worn

00:08:36.172 --> 00:08:38.064
and has a symbolic meaning.

00:08:38.064 --> 00:08:41.557
A man who goes through
the Khalsa ceremony,

00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:45.040
the Khalsa baptism,
adopts the title of Singh

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.756
which means lion,

00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:50.759
and a woman who does adopts
the title, Kaur or princess,

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:54.340
and it's essentially, they are
promising to fight oppression

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:56.887
wherever it might be.

00:08:56.887 --> 00:08:59.731
Guru Gobind Singh is also famous

00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:02.600
for the final compilation
of what would be known

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.683
as the Guru Granth Sahib.

00:09:05.714 --> 00:09:09.870
Taking the Adi Granth which
was compiled by Guru Arjan

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.232
and adding the 115 hymns

00:09:12.232 --> 00:09:15.711
of Guru Tegh Bahadur who was martyred,

00:09:15.711 --> 00:09:18.905
and making this collection of
hymns not just from the gurus

00:09:18.905 --> 00:09:22.739
but from saints and gurus in the Hindu

00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:24.387
and Muslim tradition as well

00:09:24.387 --> 00:09:29.031
and declaring that this
is the 11th and final guru

00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:32.303
and sikhs today view the Guru Granth Sahib

00:09:32.303 --> 00:09:33.798
as their guru.

00:09:33.798 --> 00:09:37.419
If you were to visit a
gurdwara which is their temple,

00:09:37.419 --> 00:09:39.776
it means door to the gurus, dwara,

00:09:39.776 --> 00:09:42.280
same root in Sanskrit as door,

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.896
you will see it houses a Guru Granth Sahib

00:09:45.896 --> 00:09:50.063
which the Sikhs will venerate
and view as their guru.
