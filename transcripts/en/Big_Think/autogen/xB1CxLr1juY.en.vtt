people will come and say that Jesus we

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880
people will come and say that Jesus we
 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.360
people will come and say that Jesus we
got a problem and I say no that's not a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370
got a problem and I say no that's not a
 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.120
got a problem and I say no that's not a
problem this is a problem that may be an

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130
problem this is a problem that may be an
 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.770
problem this is a problem that may be an
inconvenience maybe unfortunate but it's

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780
inconvenience maybe unfortunate but it's
 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.570
inconvenience maybe unfortunate but it's
very doable it's very workable it's not

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580
very doable it's very workable it's not
 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.820
very doable it's very workable it's not
a problem and so one thing I guess that

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830
a problem and so one thing I guess that
 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.460
a problem and so one thing I guess that

I think as a person you become a much

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160
I think as a person you become a much
 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.190
I think as a person you become a much
better person because you realize the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200
better person because you realize the
 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.949
better person because you realize the
sanctity of life and so that's the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959
sanctity of life and so that's the
 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.280
sanctity of life and so that's the
tremendous value of I think what Pfizer

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290
tremendous value of I think what Pfizer
 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.229
tremendous value of I think what Pfizer
does what the pharmaceutical industry

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239
does what the pharmaceutical industry
 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.920
does what the pharmaceutical industry
does is they deliver medicines that will

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930
does is they deliver medicines that will
 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.920
does is they deliver medicines that will
hopefully one day continue to leave e8

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930
hopefully one day continue to leave e8
 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.890
hopefully one day continue to leave e8
this human suffering

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900
 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.190
let's be honest it's kind of amazing

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200
let's be honest it's kind of amazing
 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.290
let's be honest it's kind of amazing
it's really kind of unbelievable when

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300
it's really kind of unbelievable when
 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.930
it's really kind of unbelievable when
you think of all the biochemistry that

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940
you think of all the biochemistry that
 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.500
you think of all the biochemistry that
happens in our body and all these

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510
happens in our body and all these
 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.300
happens in our body and all these
proteins and cofactors and things that

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310
proteins and cofactors and things that
 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.250
proteins and cofactors and things that
are circulating that we can't see and

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260
are circulating that we can't see and
 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.280
are circulating that we can't see and
that they all work in perfect harmony to

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290
that they all work in perfect harmony to
 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.830
that they all work in perfect harmony to
keep us healthy but when something gets

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840
keep us healthy but when something gets
 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.170
keep us healthy but when something gets
out of whack just like our external

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180
out of whack just like our external
 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.870
out of whack just like our external
environment through environmental

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880
environment through environmental
 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.080
environment through environmental
factors or for through pollution you

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090
factors or for through pollution you
 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.790
factors or for through pollution you
know the same things can happen to our

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800
know the same things can happen to our
 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.370
know the same things can happen to our
bodies and so there's this very fragile

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380
bodies and so there's this very fragile
 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.059
bodies and so there's this very fragile
balance so to be able to study science I

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069
balance so to be able to study science I
 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.610
balance so to be able to study science I
think and see how ph affects what we eat

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620
think and see how ph affects what we eat
 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.360
think and see how ph affects what we eat
and how we eat affects our metabolism

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370
and how we eat affects our metabolism
 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.629
and how we eat affects our metabolism
and how are what we eat maybe affects

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639
and how are what we eat maybe affects
 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.020
and how are what we eat maybe affects
our cholesterol let's say something

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030
our cholesterol let's say something

we're all worried about our waistline
how it can contribute to these different

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650
how it can contribute to these different
 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.130
how it can contribute to these different
diseases you suddenly become very aware

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140
diseases you suddenly become very aware
 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.930
diseases you suddenly become very aware
Jesus if I want to live longer maybe we

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940
Jesus if I want to live longer maybe we
 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.500
Jesus if I want to live longer maybe we
have to eat better and exercise more

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510
 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.570
