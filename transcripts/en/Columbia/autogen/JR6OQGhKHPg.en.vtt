00:33:06.369 --> 00:33:06.379
narrative about what the Union hospital
 

00:33:06.379 --> 00:33:09.460
narrative about what the Union hospital
car covered and what it didn't cover and

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:09.470

wondered what her husband had that was
covered and what the husband had wasn't

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480
covered and what the husband had wasn't
 

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:18.310
covered and what the husband had wasn't
covers and they flowed in to the

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:18.320
covers and they flowed in to the
 

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:23.830
covers and they flowed in to the
narrative of the great rebellion in her

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840
narrative of the great rebellion in her
 

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.529
narrative of the great rebellion in her
in Eastern Kentucky from 1962 to 1964

00:33:28.529 --> 00:33:28.539
in Eastern Kentucky from 1962 to 1964
 

00:33:28.539 --> 00:33:33.700
in Eastern Kentucky from 1962 to 1964
when the Union took back the miners

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:33.710

hospital card so the story public
hospital

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:39.290
hospital
 

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:44.920
hospital
the hospital narrative generated the

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:44.930
the hospital narrative generated the
 

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:49.860
the hospital narrative generated the
Union narrative there and of course

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:49.870
Union narrative there and of course
 

00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:57.810
Union narrative there and of course

00:33:57.810 --> 00:33:57.820
they're all stories about life and death
 

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:00.880
they're all stories about life and death

there's a basic difference of course in
 

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:07.690
there's a basic difference of course in
the case of war narratives you can die

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:07.700
the case of war narratives you can die
 

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:12.700
the case of war narratives you can die
it's your life you can die they can also

it's your life you can die they can also
 

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:18.520
it's your life you can die they can also
kill and a lot none of the narratives

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:18.530
kill and a lot none of the narratives
 

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.740
kill and a lot none of the narratives
about the war narratives are about

00:34:22.740 --> 00:34:22.750
about the war narratives are about
 

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:26.620
about the war narratives are about
killing

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:26.630
 

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.690
in the case of the hospital stories

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:28.700

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:53.710
 

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:58.630
ultimately these stories are about
