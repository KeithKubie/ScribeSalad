00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.070
We’ve all been there.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.650
Stuck with aches, pains, and runny nose, and
the cough medicine in the cabinet is five

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.650
years old.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.360
The question is, do you take it and risk it?

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:13.769
Or toss it and suffer?

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.669
Hey pill poppers Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.380
We’ve talked on DNews before about food
expirations dates or ‘sell by’ dates as

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.380
they’re sometimes called.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.839
And we’ve found well.. their less actual
rules and more like guidelines.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.970
Most food lasts well beyond that date.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.960
Others, well you have do a quick sniff test.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.380
But have you ever noticed that medication
has an exp date too?

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.120
Rachael Lee asked us, Can you get sicker from
expired medicine?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.219
The FDA started slapping an expiration date
on medicines in 1979.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.629
So it’s been over 30 years since that decision,
has it made a difference?

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.510
Typically the expiration date is set a year
to five years beyond the date of manufacture.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.989
It’s less of an expiration date and more
of a date of guaranteed potency.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.129
Basically after that date, manufacturers can’t
guarantee the drug will be 100% potent, it

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.870
doesn’t necessarily mean it will be unsafe
or less effective.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.410
But there’s some evidence that some medicines
can hold their potency for quite awhile especially

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.820
in controlled conditions.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.140
A study conducted by the FDA on behalf of
the Military found ways to extend the life

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.090
of medicines in storage in a program called
SLEP or shelf life extension program.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.140
They found that they could extend the life
of 88% of the drugs in govt facilities by

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.079
at least a year by simply keeping them in
climate controlled storage.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.850
Most drugs lasted on average five and half
years past the expiration date.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.830
While civilians like you and I might not have
access to tightly controlled storage facilities,

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.310
there’s always the fridge.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.560
Which some experts recommend a cool, dry,
place, for extending the life of your medication.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.540
But maybe drugs last longer than five years
even without chilin the fed’s fridge.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.310
One study published in the journal Archives
of Internal Medicine found that some medicines

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:44.899
can hold their own for DECADES.

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.679
They were all 28-40 years past their due date.

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:49.679
[[ gel vs pill ]] [[ specific examples ]]

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.720
They only looked at a handful of medicines,
8 different medications like with 15 different

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.640
compounds between them like caffeine, aspirin,
or hydrocodone.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.189
They found that most, 12 of those compounds
remained in amounts of at least 90% decades

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.509
after their expiration date.

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.770
And that 90% is crucial, that’s how much
of the good stuff a drug needs to be considered

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.210
“effective” by the FDA.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.920
So most of the decades old medicine didn’t
lose it’s potency.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.810
Although two medicines, aspirin and amphetamine,
seem to lose some of their juice after all

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.810
that time.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.460
They were present in amounts less than 90%.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.200
But before you go poppin grandma’s pills,
which you shouldn’t take someone else pills

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200
anyways….

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200
that’s illegal.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.920
But really the FDA recommends listening to
those expiration dates.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.390
They caution that drugs gone bad could be
“less effective or risky due to a change

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.390
in chemical composition or decrease in potency.”

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.961
FDA pharmacist, Ilisa Bernstein, straight
up says “If your medicine has expired, do

00:02:37.961 --> 00:02:39.460
not use it.”

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.550
Especially with living saving drugs like an
epi-pen.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.540
If a drug’s expired, the FDA recommends
tossing it.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.630
The best way to dispose of a drug is usually
on the bottle or some cities have prescription

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.370
medicine take back programs.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.620
So look into that if you’re worried about
all the leftover medication in your bathroom

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.620
cabinet.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.890
So it seems drugs last longer than their “good
by” date, but at the end of the day I’d

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.320
still listen to the FDA just to be on the
safe side.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.970
But it’s not just medicines that expire,
there’s lots of common things you didn’t

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.480
know have an expiration date.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:37.480
Trace has the whole list of things in your
house that go bad, right here.
