00:00:01.051 --> 00:00:08.325
 

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:14.057
In 1964, a woman named Kitty Genovese was raped and stabbed to death in the middle of an open

00:00:14.057 --> 00:00:19.298
apartment complex in Queens, New York. It is said by New York Times, that about 37

00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:25.135
bystanders who witnessed the murder did not call for the police, nor did they help her in any

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:25.715
way.

00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:30.753
Another similar incident happened when a 2 year old named Wang Yue was wondering around

00:00:30.753 --> 00:00:36.144
an open market when she was  run over by a truck. The truck did stop, but only for a moment,

00:00:36.144 --> 00:00:41.473
running her over with the front and back tires. Nineteen people walked past her body, some

00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:46.965
stopping to stare, but none to help. It was only an hour later that a bystander helped Wang Yue,

00:00:46.965 --> 00:00:52.183
but unfortunately, it was too late. She died in the hospital shortly after.

00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:57.404
Why is it that no one helped Kitty or Wang when they were in clear need of aid? Well, a possible

00:00:57.404 --> 00:01:04.082
explanation could be because of the 'bystander effect' or 'bystander apathy.' It's when individuals

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:10.012
are less likely to take action when others are present due to the diffusion of responsibility in

00:01:10.012 --> 00:01:15.488
social influences. In other words, the greater amount of bystanders, the less likely it is for an

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:20.714
individual to take action. People in the group assume that someone else will help and that their

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:25.529
individual action is not needed. But, if everybody in the group all has this apathetic manner,

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:30.680
incidents like Kitty Genovese's murder and Wang Yue's hit and run will happen.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.412
How could this behavior be explained? Well, according to Richard Dawkins, a professor at

00:01:35.412 --> 00:01:41.329
Oxford University, what differentiates humans from every other species in the animal kingdom,

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.717
is the development of the prefrontal cortex, or PFC. The medial and dors-medial parts of the PFC

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:53.837
controls cognitive function and rational thought. The argument is that the empathy and ability to

00:01:53.837 --> 00:01:59.083
mentalize can motivate nonselfish behavior. Humans are special because we can choose to act

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:04.822
kindly to our fellow humans. However, evolutionary biology says that humans, throughout

00:02:04.822 --> 00:02:10.564
history, have only acted out prosocial behaviors to benefit themselves. Or else, nobody would

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:15.497
have survived. Which puts the saying "Survival of the fittest" on the play.

00:02:15.497 --> 00:02:20.406
An infamous example of apathy is the Holocaust, in which the world closed its eyes during this

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:25.655
catastrophe. People could have spoken out to help individuals who were afraid of speaking if

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:29.429
they could have suffered the same fate as the people they were trying to help. So, biologically

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:34.860
and socially, humans are just inclined to be apathetic and ignore things in which they don't

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.841
benefit from or which they could be harmed by.

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:43.384
Since we're the only species to have PFC, I don't want to get involved is often said whenever an

00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:48.777
undesirable event should occur. Bystanders will report not wanting to be involved because they

00:02:48.777 --> 00:02:53.841
fear negative consequences for themselves. And also, because they assume someone else could

00:02:53.841 --> 00:02:59.488
offer help, not just me. But, if people were more aware, events like Wang Yue and Kitty where people

00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:01.583
didn't respond, could have been avoided.

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:05.828
So, just remember, even if you're just helping a sick family member or friend, maybe even

00:03:05.828 --> 00:03:09.962
helping someone carry something heavy, don't even nudge them off because you think someone else

00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:13.945
could help them. Lend a hand. It could mean the world to somebody.

00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:18.290
