00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's think about what'll
happen if

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.980
we have this molecule.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.490
Let's name it.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.940
We have one, two, three,
four, five carbons.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.910
No double bond.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.210
Five tells us pent.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.740
It's pentane, and it has two
groups on the number three

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.140
carbon, one, two, three.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.270
It doesn't matter which side
we start counting from.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.160
We have a bromo group, and we
have an ethyl group, two

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.520
carbons right there.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:30.470
On the three carbon, we have
three bromo, three ethyl

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.430
pentane right here.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.190
So we have 3-bromo 3-ethyl
pentane dissolved in a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.330
solvent, in this right here.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.420
It's an alcohol and it has
two carbons right there.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.530
Meth eth, so it is ethanol.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.100
This right there is ethanol.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.010
Let's think about what might
happen if we have 3-bromo

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.610
3-ethyl pentane dissolved
in some ethanol.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.000
Now ethanol already
has a hydrogen.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.920
It's not super eager to get
another proton, although it

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.740
does have a partial
negative charge.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.790
It is polar.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.800
Oxygen is very electronegative.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.530
It has a partial negative
charge, so maybe it might be

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.150
willing to take on another
proton, but doesn't want to do

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.320
so very badly.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.760
It's actually a weak base.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.260
Ethanol right here
is a weak base.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.840
It's not strong enough to just
go nabbing hydrogens off of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.520
carbons, like we saw
in an E2 reaction.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.630
It's just going to sit passively
here and maybe wait

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.630
for something to happen.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.010
What might happen?

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.550
Well, we have this bromo
group right here.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.790
We have this bromine and the
bromide anion is actually a

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.230
pretty good leaving group.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.590
It's a fairly large molecule.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.540
It's able to keep that charge
because it's spread out over a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.430
large electronic cloud,
and it's connected

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.830
to a tertiary carbon.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.510
This carbon right here.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.230
This carbon right here
is connected to

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.050
one, two, three carbons.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.670
So if it were to lose its
electron, that electron right

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.500
there, it would be-- it might
not like to do it-- but it

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.920
would be reasonably stable.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.820
It's within the realm
of possibilities.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.350
It could occur.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.280
Maybe in this first step since
bromine is a good leaving

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.840
group, and this carbon can be
stable as a carbocation, and

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.870
bromine is already more
electronegative-- it's already

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.680
hogging this electron-- maybe
it takes it all together.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.940
Let me draw.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.690
Neutral bromine has one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.950
valence electrons.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.820
Maybe it swipes this electron
from the carbon, and now it'll

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.410
have eight valence electrons
and become bromide.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.150
What happens now?

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.610
And of course, the ethanol
did nothing.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.550
It's a weak base.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.080
It wasn't strong enough to
react with this just yet.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.400
What is happening now?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.780
This is going to be
the slow reaction.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.340
What I said was that this isn't
going to happen super

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.750
fast but it could happen.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.610
This is actually the
rate-determining step.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.130
What happens after that?

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.340
Let me just paste everything
again so this is our set up to

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.320
begin with.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.640
But now that this little
reaction occurred, what will

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.060
it look like?

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.340
The bromine has left so
let me clear that out.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.590
We clear out the bromine.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.540
It actually took an electron
with it so it's bromide.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.990
Let me draw it like this.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.300
I'll do it in blue.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.250
This is the bromine.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.810
The bromine is right
over here.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.820
It had one, two, three,
four, five, six,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.200
seven valence electrons.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.800
It swiped this magenta electron
from the carbon, now

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.870
it has eight valence
electrons.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.480
It has a negative charge.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:51.000
The carbon lost an electron,
so it has a positive charge

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.080
and it's somewhat stable
because it's a tertiary

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.960
carbocation.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.790
Now let's think about
what's happening.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.950
And I want to point
out one thing.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.650
In this first step of a
reaction, only one of the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.790
reactants was involved.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.350
This rate-determining, the slow
step of reaction, if this

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.600
doesn't occur nothing
else will.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.180
But now that this does
occur everything

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.650
else will happen quickly.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.600
In our rate-determining step,
we only had one of the

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.880
reactants involved.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.390
It's analogous to the SN1
reaction but what we're going

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.810
to see here is that we're
actually eliminating.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.579
We're going to call this
an E1 reaction.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.760
We're going to see
that in a second.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.540
Actually, elimination
is already occurred.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.770
The bromide has already left so
hopefully you see why this

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.680
is called an E1 reaction.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.590
It's elimination.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.950
E for elimination and the
rate-determining step only

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.640
involves one of the reactants
right here.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.550
It didn't involve in this
case the weak base.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.310
Now that the bromide has left,
let's think about whether this

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.380
weak base, this ethanol, can
actually do anything.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.370
It does have a partial negative
charge over here.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.590
It does have a partial negative
charge and on these

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.740
ends it has partial positive
charges, so it is somewhat

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.680
attracted to hydrogen, or to
protons I should say, to

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.810
positive charges.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.730
But not so much that it can
swipe it off of things that

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:04.380
aren't reasonably acidic.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.980
Now that this guy's a
carbocation, this entire

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.160
molecule actually now becomes
pretty acidic, which means it

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.700
wants to give away protons.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.510
Another way you could view it is
it wants to take electrons,

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.830
depending on whether you want
to use the Bronsted-Lowry

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.150
definition of acid, or
the Lewis definition.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.000
Either way, it wants to
give away a proton.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.750
It could be this one.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.640
It could be that one.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.260
It has excess positive charge.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.850
It wants to get rid of its
excess positive charge.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.160
So it's reasonably acidic,
enough so that it can react

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.760
with this weak base.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.270
What you have now is the
situation, where on this

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.310
partial negative charge of this
oxygen-- let me pick a

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.870
nice color here-- let's say
this purple electron right

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:57.690
here, it can be donated,
or it will swipe

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.720
the hydrogen proton.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.770
Then hydrogen's electron
will be taken

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.810
by the larger molecule.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.940
In fact, it'll be attracted
to the carbocation.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.120
So it will go to the carbocation
just like that.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.960
Now in that situation,
what occurs?

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.890
What's our final product?

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:16.890
Let me draw it here.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.770
This part of the reaction is
going to happen fast. The

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.750
rate-determining step
happened slow.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.560
The leaving group had
to leave. The

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.920
carbocation had to form.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.970
That's not going to happen
super fast but once that

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.560
forms, it's not that
stable and then

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.030
this thing will happen.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.780
This is fast.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.730
Let me paste everything again.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.710
So now we already
had the bromide.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.960
It had left.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.130
Now the hydrogen is gone.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.230
The hydrogen from that carbon
right there is gone.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:02.890
This electron is still on this
carbon but the electron that

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.550
was with this hydrogen is now
on what was the carbocation.

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.710
That electron right here is now
over here, and now this

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.590
bond right over here,
is this bond.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.380
We formed an alkene and now,
what was an ethanol took a

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.930
hydrogen proton and now becomes
a positive cation.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.390
Let me draw that.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:33.390
So this electron ends
up being given.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.640
It's no longer with
the ethanol.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:47.960
It gets given to this
hydrogen right here.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.270
That hydrogen right there.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.870
And now they have formed a new
bond and since this oxygen

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.490
gave away an electron, it now
has a positive charge.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.940
And all along, the bromide
anion had left in

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.350
the previous step.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:09.150
The bromide anion is floating
around with its eight valence

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:12.950
electrons, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, and

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.950
then it has this one
right over here.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.440
That makes it negative.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.180
Then our reaction is done.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:25.090
We had a weak base and a good
leaving group, a tertiary

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.070
carbon, and the leaving
group left.

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.550
We only had one of the
reactants involved.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.930
It was eliminated.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:35.080
And then once it was eliminated,
then the weak base

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.409
was then able to take a hydrogen
off of this molecule,

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:41.760
and that allowed this molecule
to become an alkene, formed a

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.690
double bond.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.170
This is called, and I already
told you, an E1 reaction.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.100
E for elimination, in this
case of the halide.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:52.460
One, because the
rate-determining step only

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.480
involved one of the molecules.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.460
It did not involve
the weak base.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.890
We'll talk more about this,
and especially different

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.450
circumstances where you might
have the different types of E1

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.830
reactions you could see, which
hydrogen is going to be picked

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.500
off, and all the things
like that.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:14.490
And we're going to see with
E1, E2, SN1, and SN2, what

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.700
kind of environments or
reactants need to be there for

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.640
each one of those to occur in
different circumstances.
