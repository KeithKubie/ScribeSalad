00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.220
To start with, the viewport on
the phone is about 320 pixels,

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.730
which is 640 divided by 2.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.280
For the phablet, or

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.400
the phone tablet, anything around
about 300 is going to be accepted.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.510
Sometimes device manufacturers fudge
the numbers just a little bit,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.740
which is going to give you fractions.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.740
So, anything around 300's fine.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.070
The tablet's pretty easy.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.320
It's device pixel ratio is 1,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.360
which means that its viewport
is the same size as its width.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.170
So 1024 pixels.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.020
And same thing for the laptop.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.850
With a device pixel ratio of 1 and and

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.190
a browser width of 800 pixels, you'll
get a viewport width of 800 pixels.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.240
Notice on the laptop that the whole
screen is larger than the browser.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.820
But the viewport is only
about the browser's width,

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.360
not the whole screen, so
it's just 800 pixels.
