00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.160
RACHEL GARB: Good afternoon.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.590
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.660
We're really excited
to be here.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.380
I'm Rachel Garb, and I lead
interaction design for

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.540
Android's apps at Google.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.220
HELENA ROEBER: Hi.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.880
I'm Helena Roeber, and I led
Android's UX research team

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.270
from its beginning
through 2012.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.030
RACHEL GARB: Let's just jump
right in, because we have a

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.140
lot to cover.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.310
Let's start with a vision.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.750
"Enchant me.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.240
Simplify my life.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.160
Make me amazing." If it seems
a little touchy-feely, well,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.470
that's intentional.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.760
You see, it's about people.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.660
Now of course, this is
not a revelation--

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.890
certainly not to the people
in this room.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.740
Those of us in the business
of creating technology for

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.610
people, we're well-accustomed to
thinking through use cases

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.400
and analyzing user metrics.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.360
But there's another aspect to
people that may not come up as

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.020
much, and that's emotion.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.500
We all respond emotionally to
every moment we experience.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.560
And according to Nobel
Prize-winning scientist Daniel

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.090
Kahneman, we experience about
20,000 of these moments in a

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.740
waking day.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.560
Now, we don't remember all of
them, but the ones we do are

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.045
almost always either positive
or negative.

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:19.420
Now Kahneman and other
scientists are studying the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.300
effects of these emotions, and
here's what they're finding.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.110
Negative emotions, like anger
and fear and hate and shame,

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.390
can be harmful to your
health and may even

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.180
shorten your lifespan.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.920
Now positive emotions, on the
other hand, like hope and joy

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.790
and love, they're an
essential daily

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.750
requirement for survival.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.360
They improve our physical and
mental health, and they

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.120
protect us from depression
and illness.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.120
So as designers, every decision
we make affects

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.620
people emotionally.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.060
Now our team sees this as a huge
opportunity, but also a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.880
responsibility we take
very seriously.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.540
So about two years ago, we
developed this design vision.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.690
Now, you'll notice it's phrased
in the first person.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:07.810
That's intentional.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.360
We want this to read not as our
vision, but as the vision

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.120
that our users have for us.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.820
Now how do we know this
vision is valid?

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.140
Well, from all the user research
we've done to date,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.890
which Helena will talk about
in a little bit, it really

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.850
boils down to these
three sentences.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:26.450
So it's a tall order.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.690
What exactly does it mean to
enchant me, simplify my life,

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.940
and make me amazing?

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.820
Answers can be found in
Android's design principles.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.230
They're based on the same
research that informed our

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.700
vision, and they've been
guiding us to create

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.770
beautiful, usable, and
innovative designs.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.140
Now, we're certain they can do
the same for you, and that's

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.100
why we're here today.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.220
So we're going to introduce you
to these design principles

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.660
and talk about why we
believe in them.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.220
We'll show many examples,
including from some

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.860
groundbreaking projects, and
we'll talk about how you can

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.680
use them with your teams.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.970
HELENA ROEBER: I will now
quickly go through the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:08.840
principles.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.630
And don't worry if I'm going
a little bit too fast.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.280
We will later spend a lot of
time on in-depth examples that

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.380
explain each of them.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.840
The principles are grouped
into the three pillars of

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.980
Android's vision.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.680
"Enchant me" is about filling
people with joy, showing them

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.080
beautiful visuals and graceful
motions, letting them

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.130
customize their space, and
letting them directly touch

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.980
objects and interact
with them.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.350
And here are the four design
principles for "Enchant me."

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.020
RACHEL GARB: Delight me
in surprising ways.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.050
HELENA ROEBER: Real objects
are more fun

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.490
than buttons and menus.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.090
RACHEL GARB: Let me
make it mine.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.840
HELENA ROEBER: Get to know me.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.920
The second pillar of Android's
vision, "Simplify My Life," is

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.950
about making things easy for
people, making their world

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.570
simple to navigate, explaining
it in clear words and

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.080
sometimes even with pictures,
and bringing attention to what

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.680
is essential.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.940
And here are the eight
principles for "Simplify My

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.760
Life."

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.240
RACHEL GARB: Keep it brief.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.829
HELENA ROEBER: Pictures
are faster than words.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.140
RACHEL GARB: Decide for me, but
let me have the final say.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.170
HELENA ROEBER: Only show what
I need when I need it.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.990
RACHEL GARB: I should always
know where I am.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.710
HELENA ROEBER: Never
lose my stuff.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.900
RACHEL GARB: If it looks the
same, it should act the same.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.680
HELENA ROEBER: Only interrupt
me if it's important.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.290
And finally, the last pillar,
"Make Me Amazing," is about

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.990
making people feel capable,
strong, and smart, giving them

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.960
things that they would love to
show off to their friends, and

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.160
making them feel like they're in
charge of this powerful and

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.760
magical force.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.970
And here are the five principles
for "Make Me

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.830
Amazing."

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.610
RACHEL GARB: Give me tricks
that work everywhere.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.290
HELENA ROEBER: It's
not my fault.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.760
RACHEL GARB: Sprinkle
encouragement.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.340
HELENA ROEBER: Do the heavy
lifting for me.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.930
RACHEL GARB: Make important
things fast.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.800
HELENA ROEBER: Next, I'll talk a
little bit about the origins

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.200
of the design principles, how
we realized we needed them,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.880
how we developed them, and the
difference that they made once

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.870
we started to apply them.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.610
During an extensive UX research
project called the

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.090
Android Baseline Study,
consisting of diaries, in-home

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.520
interviews, and observations,
we saw the profound effect

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.830
that technology design had
on people's lives.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.320
This photo here is one of our
engineers at one of the

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.570
in-home visits.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.150
We saw when, how, and why people
were using computers,

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.140
tablets, and mobile devices.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:17.010
And we saw that technology had
become so pervasive that

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.350
people had started to schedule
deliberate offline times and

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.460
enforce them so they could spend
quality time with their

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.120
family and friends.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.410
We saw joy in people's faces
when they used technology and

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.980
something happened that they
considered magical or

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.820
something that brought them
closer to their friends or

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.980
maybe something that just gave
them a welcome break

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.090
during their day.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:49.320
But we also saw, unfortunately,
the flip side.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.220
It turns out we tend to blame
ourselves whenever something

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.900
goes wrong in technology, and
we realized that all those

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:05.180
non-ideal implementations,
they eroded people's

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:08.670
confidence in their own
abilities and often just

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.500
caused sheer frustration.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.470
I'm sure you have all
experienced the same.

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:16.870
I certainly have experienced
it myself.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:23.820
So this was a call to Android
to touch people's hearts, to

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.990
do more of the good stuff and to
fix some of the annoyances

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.380
in the product.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:36.630
So the entire Android UX team
got together and started to

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.360
unpack what wasn't working
and why, and we came

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:42.440
up with a long list.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.440
And to be honest, because the
team had such high aspirations

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.310
for their work, it was a
little bit of a bummer.

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.690
So Rachel and I, we looked at
each other, and we thought,

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:00.220
what if we turn this long list
of shortcomings that bum us

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:04.470
out every time we look at it
into something that actually

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:10.090
inspires us to create beautiful
and usable designs?

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:15.530
So we took the long, negative
list of shortcomings, and we

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.720
organized it.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:26.800
We painstakingly wordsmithed
and crafted it to be short,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:30.160
memorable, and in the
voice of the user.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.400
Let me give you an example.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.100
One of the insights from this
baseline study was users are

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:42.030
overwhelmed by options and
limitless flexibility.

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:47.520
So our first try at rewording
this was "Don't overwhelm me

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.190
on the first date." So you can
see, we actually have a lot of

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.640
fun with this.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.830
But in true iterative design
fashion, this was

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.920
not the last version.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:02.210
So we gave it one more try, and
we came up with "Only show

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:07.190
me what I need to see." And this
was pretty close, but it

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.930
didn't have that time element
that is actually really

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.540
important to progressive
disclosure.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.110
So we gave it one more try,
"Only show what I need when I

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.490
need it," and this
was a winner.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:22.450
This is one of our design
principles that we have today.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:30.910
We started to use the design
principles during Android's

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.130
Ice Cream Sandwich release,
which is the biggest

00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:39.060
qualitative jump in Android's
user experience to date.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.610
Two years later, they are still
serving the team well.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:49.000
What they do is they remind the
team what good design is

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.170
all about, and they give the
team a common language to talk

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:58.320
about design in terms
of people.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:05.570
And finally, they help the
team to tap into people's

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:14.530
emotions and to specifically
design for those emotions.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.100
Many of the principles are aimed
at avoiding negative

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.810
emotions in people.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.390
For example, "Only interrupt me
if it's important" prevents

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.490
users from feeling
annoyed or angry.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:31.430
Others are geared at triggering
positive emotions.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.930
"Let me make it mine" makes
people feel more at home.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:44.190
So the design principles give us
designers control over the

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.780
emotions that our products
trigger in people

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.520
when they use them.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:53.220
And this is important, because
from all our research, we know

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:58.610
that our mobile devices have
become almost as close to us

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:03.560
as our best buddies, our
partners or colleagues.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.690
They wake us up in
the morning.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:11.090
They entertain us and make us
productive during the day, and

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.110
they even tuck us into bed.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:20.160
So it makes sense to take a
closer look at research that

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.230
examines relationships
and emotions.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.090
Psychology professor John
Gottman at the University of

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:32.090
Washington has done extensive
research on marriage.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:38.470
And he did this one study where
he was able to predict

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.780
whether a couple would stay
together or not after

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:45.430
observing them for only 15
minutes shortly after they got

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:51.750
their marriage license, and he
was right with 94% accuracy.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.630
So that's pretty cool.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.370
So how did he do it?

00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:58.690
So his predictions were based
on a simple formula.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.910
And his predictions, actually he
checked back 10 years later

00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:04.790
to see whether he was right.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.650
So his predictions, they were
based on a simple formula--

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:13.760
the ratio of positive to
negative emotions.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:19.270
He predicted that a marriage
is heading toward a good

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:26.370
outcome when that ratio
is close to 5 to 1.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:30.570
And he predicted that a marriage
is heading toward

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:37.490
divorce when that ratio
is closer to 1 to 1.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.770
Other people, like the
psychologist Marcial Losada,

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:44.640
has done similar research in the
workplace as director of

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.060
the Center for Advanced
Research

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.880
in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.680
And he found that work groups
that have a positive to

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:57.990
negative ratio of 3 to 1 are
significantly more productive

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:02.750
than work groups that don't
reach that ratio.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.680
Another psychology professor,
Barbara Frederickson, she runs

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:10.140
a lab at the University of North
Carolina, Chapel Hill

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:13.270
called the PEPlab, which stands
for Positive Emotions

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:15.290
and Psychophysiology.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:21.060
She found that we need three
positive emotions to lift us

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:27.110
up for every negative emotion
that drags us down.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.090
Does this apply to design?

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.640
Absolutely.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.810
Think about how common it has
become for people to spend

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:40.120
more time with their technology,
their mobile

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.200
devices, and computers than
with their partners.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.940
And the message for designers
is clear.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.680
All those little annoyances
in your product, they're

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.930
unfortunately not so little.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:58.250
They have the power to
erase all the magic

00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:59.500
that you have created.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.640
RACHEL GARB: Here's a way
to visualize this.

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:06.940
Imagine we have two
jars side by side.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:10.190
One is a positive jar, and
one is a negative jar.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.160
If we trigger a positive
emotion because we are

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.080
excelling at a design principle,
we put one marble

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.840
in the positive jar.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.950
If, on the other hand, we
trigger a negative emotion

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.840
because we are ignoring a design
principle, we put not

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.020
one, not two, but three marbles
in that negative jar.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.880
Now, once the marbles
go in the jars, they

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.980
can't be taken out.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.170
But the difference in
amounts in each jar

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:38.720
can change over time.

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:41.950
If both jars have the same
number of marbles, it does not

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:42.990
mean our job is done.

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:46.150
Heck, research tells us we're
barely out of the doghouse.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.300
And if this were a marriage,
we'd be halfway to divorce.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.090
So what we're really after is
to fill the positive jar and

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.830
keep the negative jar empty.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.565
HELENA ROEBER: Let me give you
an example of visual motion.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.180
So we all know the Android has
multiple Home screens.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.220
And if you reach the end of the
final Home screen, this is

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.400
what happens.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.660
The screen tilts a little
bit and changes color.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.770
I'll get back to that design
in a little bit.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.160
I'd like to just explore a
couple of other ways to solve

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.070
that design problem of
communicating that we've

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.740
reached the final screen.

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:38.070
What if we did nothing when we
reached the final screen?

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.650
How would that feel?

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.170
I know how I would feel.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:47.000
I would probably keep tapping
it, and then eventually I'd

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.900
give up, thinking that I
did something wrong.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.760
And even though this was
probably not the most

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.950
important event in my
day, there would be

00:15:55.950 --> 00:15:58.540
this nagging feeling.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.640
What did I do wrong?

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:07.400
So let's see how we're doing
with the design principles.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.380
We missed the boat on "I should
always know where I am"

00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.310
and "It's not my fault," because
I just blamed myself

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.240
for doing something wrong.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.540
So that's not so good.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.580
That's six negative marbles, and
we would need six positive

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.750
marbles just to get
kind of even.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.370
Let's try something different.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:35.180
What if, when we reach the last
screen and we try to go

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:38.720
beyond it, we pop up a little
message that says, "This is

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.670
the last screen"?

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:46.510
It turns out whenever we pop up
something on screen, it's a

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:48.300
little bit like being nagged.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:54.800
And in the worst case, it's like
being shouted at, and it

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.360
takes us out of what
we were doing.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.920
And now, we have to read the
words, understand them, and

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.460
try to decide whether we need
to act on the message.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:10.170
So how are we doing with
our design principles?

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:13.030
We still get three negative
marbles for "It's not my

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:17.930
fault," because I
just got nagged.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:19.800
And there's more.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.530
We also get three negative
marbles for "Only interrupt me

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:29.500
if it's important." So even
though this design has more

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.840
feedback, it's not necessarily
a better design.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.390
Let's look at the
actual design.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.130
When people encountered this
in user studies, they just

00:17:42.130 --> 00:17:43.950
kept playing with it.

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.800
They just really seemed to enjoy
how it changes colors,

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.170
how kind of the physics
work out.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:55.840
And it was really clear that
people enjoyed what they were

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.340
doing, and they enjoyed
interacting with it.

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:05.740
Not only did it tell them that
they did everything right, it

00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:11.280
also kind of helped establish
the virtual spaces.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:18.190
And it provided this feedback
in an elegant, subtle, and

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.350
non-disruptive way.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.660
So how are we doing with
the design principles?

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.850
So the things that were
previously an issue are no

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:30.310
longer, so negative marbles.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.560
Yay.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.420
But we do get positive marbles
for "Delight me in surprising

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.790
ways," because this interaction
was just really

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:43.820
enjoyable, as we could see
in the user studies.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:48.820
We also get a positive marble
for "Sprinkle encouragement,"

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:52.320
because we just encouraged
people to interact with the

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:55.410
device through touch.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.310
We get a positive marble for
"Pictures are faster than

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.300
words," because there
are no words used.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:05.980
And we get a marble for "Give
me tricks that work

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:11.040
everywhere," because this is
a pattern that is applied

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.435
throughout the platform.

00:19:13.435 --> 00:19:18.700
So if you work in design, you
know that creating a beautiful

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.620
and graceful animation like
that is not simple.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:26.730
And our motion and visual
designers, they spent many

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:30.600
iterations to get this
interaction just right.

00:19:33.546 --> 00:19:34.528
RACHEL GARB: OK.

00:19:34.528 --> 00:19:38.947
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:38.947 --> 00:19:42.780
RACHEL GARB: A segue to
another topic, words.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.440
So one of the principles that
Helena just mentioned was that

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:48.970
"Pictures are faster than
words." Now, to be clear, the

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:51.570
principle is not saying that
we should never use words.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:53.720
Of course, there are many things
that words can say that

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:54.880
pictures can't.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.620
But the wrong words can
really backfire.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.510
So some error messages, they
just scream at us, right?

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:03.570
They talk down to us, make
us feel like idiots.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:07.040
And some welcome messages when
you open up a new app, boy,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:09.150
they try way too hard
to impress us.

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:11.220
They act a little too chummy,
or maybe they

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.270
ramble on and on.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:15.220
When it comes to shaping
emotions,

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.990
words are truly powerful.

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:20.730
That's why the Android design
team has a dedicated writer,

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.590
and he's taught us to pay
attention in particular to

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:26.600
these three principles
when we write--

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.810
"Keep it brief," "It's not
my fault," and "Sprinkle

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.250
encouragement."

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.940
Let's look at a few examples
of each of these.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:36.940
So say the user has just signed
in to their new Android

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.000
device, but they have to wait
a moment because we're

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.500
connecting with Google servers
to authenticate the account.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:48.800
Now, we could say it like
this or like this.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.100
Here, we're describing only
what's necessary and nothing

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.800
more, and we've eliminated
redundancy.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.040
And that's an example
of "Keep it brief."

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:01.630
Another way we keep it brief
is to help people skim by

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:03.520
putting the most important
thing first.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.110
That way users get a taste of
the main idea right away.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:12.570
So if Larry Page is your best
friend, that's more important

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.900
than the 76 other people.

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.410
"Keep it brief."

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:19.380
Next example.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.950
There was a time, admittedly,
when we had a setting with

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:23.850
this label.

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.720
And I cringe just
seeing it now.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.970
But we've changed it, and
now it says this.

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:32.310
Much cleaner, right?

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.520
RACHEL GARB: When we write for
the UI, we like to pretend

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.920
that we're talking to someone
who is smart and competent but

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.720
may not speak the language
very well.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:45.370
So we use short words, active
verbs, and common nouns.

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.760
And we avoid technical jargon.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.280
It makes people feel like
they're not smart enough to

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.450
use our products.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.800
This is an example of
"It's not my fault."

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.010
And speaking of "It's not my
fault," here's an example of

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.640
what not to say in
an error message.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.040
Even if the user could have
prevented the situation from

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:06.090
happening, we never point
it out, and we

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.930
certainly don't shout.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:11.240
So here's a better way that
doesn't even feel like an

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.250
error message anymore.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.660
"It's not my fault."

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.940
OK, another example.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:20.010
We have a feature in Android
called Face Unlock that keeps

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.710
your device secure with
facial recognition.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.310
Now, if a face isn't recognized
for whatever

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.880
reason, we need to display
a message.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.580
Now, we could say
it like this.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:32.450
It's direct, but it's a
little off-putting.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.830
Or maybe inject some humor.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.200
But here's how we
actually say it.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.990
We talk directly to the reader
using second person with

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:46.240
contractions, just like we do
in casual conversation.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.780
Now, by using a tone that's
human and approachable, we are

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.740
sprinkling encouragement
in the form of words.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:53.970
Now what about humor?

00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.400
Well, for some products and
brands, it's perfectly

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.160
acceptable--

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:58.550
maybe even expected.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.770
But Android's an operating
system.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.490
Our voice has to fit with
a very wide variety of

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:07.330
situations and people, and that
makes humor a more risky

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.060
proposition.

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:12.060
Now while we strive to be
friendly, we don't go

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.820
overboard with being polite,
because too much "hello" and

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:17.070
"please" and "thank you"
everywhere can get to a point

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.590
where it really exhausts
the reader.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:24.780
So go for just a sprinkle
of encouragement.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.340
So to avoid negative emotions,
we write with these three

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.720
principles in mind.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.690
But even ahead of that, we ask
ourselves, do we need to write

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.370
anything in the first place?

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:37.480
Now we already talked about
looking for ways

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.920
to say it in pictures.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.170
Here's something else we do.

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:45.330
If we're thinking about having
a dialogue that asks "Are you

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:51.020
sure?" we'll just do it and
then offer a way to undo.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.250
And that's our principle "Decide
for me, but let me

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.070
have the final say." Oh, and
by the way, our team has

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.210
banned the use of the phrase
"Are you sure?" because it

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.930
places blame on the user by
presuming that they didn't

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:04.190
think something through.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:07.540
So again, "It's not my fault."

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.750
Now, I want to switch topics and
show you an example of how

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.030
principles influenced a feature
called Android Beam.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:17.650
Does everybody know
what that is?

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:18.080
OK.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.070
Well, for those who haven't
heard of it, I'll just give

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:21.970
you a quick background.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:24.190
We released this in Ice
Cream Sandwich.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.970
It lets you quickly share
information with someone else

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.780
simply by touching your
devices together.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.930
It's really great for sharing
web pages, YouTube videos,

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.470
photos, contact info, things
like that, and it's one of the

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.270
Android projects that I'm most
proud to have worked on.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.180
We designed it with the future
in mind-- a future where

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:45.240
everyone's Android devices
could beam and every app

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.910
developer does something
useful or cool with it.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.110
Now let's say I want to
share this picture of

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.730
Lulubelle with Helena.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.060
We just bring our devices
together, and that puts us

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.510
directly into a mode
for sharing.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.030
I don't have to choose
anything from a menu.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:03.070
But you may be wondering, what
if I didn't know Helena, and

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.840
we're crowded together on a
subway, and our phones are in

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.860
our pockets?

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.550
Could I accidentally pocket
beam that photo?

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.000
And at the same time, could
Helena accidentally send

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.970
something to me that
she didn't want to?

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.500
Well, the answer is no.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.720
Because once the devices are
together, I confirm with a

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.840
touch, and then the
beam happens.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.280
And that's an example of "Decide
for me, but let me

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.020
have the final say." Here,
Android decided that when two

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:32.560
phones are put back to back,
somebody probably wants to

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:33.550
share something.

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:38.150
But it won't happen unless a
sender touches to confirm.

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:40.940
Now because we've stripped down
on-screen interactions to

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.710
the bare minimum in Android
Beam, we've made it the most

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.160
effortless way to share.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.660
When two people are in the same
physical space, Android

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:52.170
Beam avoids extra steps that
both the sender and receiver

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.670
would have to take with
emailing or texting.

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:59.210
And that's an example of "Do
the heavy lifting for me."

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:02.360
When the devices come together,
sound and vibration

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.670
let you know Android Beam
is ready for you.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.000
[ANDROID BEAM CONFIRMATION
TONE]

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.730
RACHEL GARB: And that's a
sprinkle of encouragement.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.230
Now, if Beam doesn't work for
some reason, like the devices

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.950
pull away before anyone could
send, the sound indicates that

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.390
in a gentle way.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:20.830
[ANDROID BEAM REDO TONE]

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.800
RACHEL GARB: And that's an
example of "It's not my

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.990
fault." Now, instead of choosing
from a dialogue that

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.620
says, "Do you want to beam your
screen?" with buttons for

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.000
yes and no, you simply touch
an object that's an exact

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.930
representation of your screen,
because "Real objects are more

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:39.040
fun than buttons and menus."

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.020
Now we excel at this principle
in another way too.

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:45.010
The devices themselves are real
objects, and bringing

00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:47.390
them together is kind of fun.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.390
Now the animation that happens
when you touch to beam makes

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:53.010
it seem like your screen is
actually flying into the other

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:54.170
person's device.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:55.420
It's very satisfying.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:02.300
And that's an example of
"Delight me in surprising

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:04.220
ways."

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.360
Now no matter what app you're
using, when you touch to beam,

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.770
something always happens.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:11.700
If the developer of the app
didn't implement any special

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.710
behavior, then by default we
just open the app on the

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:16.010
recipient's device.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:18.700
If the recipient doesn't have
that app, then we launch the

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:21.630
Play store to the exact screen
where they can get it.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:24.640
And that's an example of "Give
me tricks that work

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.580
everywhere."

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.460
So as you can see, even when
a user interface is pretty

00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:33.510
minimal, like Android Beam, it
can be shaped by a lot of our

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:34.760
principles.

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:40.690
HELENA ROEBER: Our last example
is about the leading

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:43.370
edge of interface design.

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:46.260
I am honored that I got to
participate in creating what I

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.650
consider one of the most
exciting new developments in

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:52.120
user interfaces, Google Now.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.630
It's an interface, as you
probably know, that aims to

00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:58.420
make your life better by
predicting what you need at

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.260
any given moment.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.220
It came out last June
with Android's Jelly

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.510
Bean software release.

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:09.540
Google Now is accessed by
swiping up from the bottom of

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:12.325
Android's Home screen
like this.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:26.340
And then, beneath the search
box, it displays

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.980
context-dependent cards
that show you

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:32.290
information that you need.

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:35.410
For instance, most people's
lives involve many logistical

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:39.930
challenges, and Google Now can
show you how long it takes to

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.490
go to work, when your package is
getting delivered, or what

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:47.400
the weather will be, all
depending on your context.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.080
What makes Google Now innovative
is that it goes

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:54.930
beyond traditional interface
conventions, and it pushes

00:28:54.930 --> 00:29:00.560
some of our design principles
further than most interfaces.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.860
One of those principles is
"Delight me in surprising

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:10.050
ways." Imagine you love where
you live, like I do, or maybe

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:14.900
you're visiting a place that
you always wanted to visit.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.380
Google Now changes the
background of Google's search

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.850
box to beautiful art pieces,
depending on where you are and

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.950
what time of day it is.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:29.200
When people encountered this
first in user studies, we

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.320
observed pure joy.

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.330
And later on, we saw
that same joy every

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:38.220
time that header changed.

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:42.570
It was a very clear success,
and it's a good example of

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:46.490
"Delight me in surprising
ways."

00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:49.410
Here's another one.

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.980
Imagine you've spent a long
day in the city walking

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:57.340
around, and you just would love
to have a warm drink.

00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.350
I personally like
hot chocolate.

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:05.040
Google Now will show you the
restaurants nearby, and one of

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.430
them may just have that
hot chocolate

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.540
that you've been craving.

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:12.350
And this is another way that
Google Now scores points for

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:16.450
"Delight me in surprising
ways."

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:20.600
Another design principle that
Google Now exceeds at is "Do

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:25.680
the heavy lifting for me." For
example, flying abroad can be

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.240
a big production, and Google
Now finds ways to make it a

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.400
little bit easier for you.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.870
It will let you know if your
flight is delayed and will

00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.745
give you time maybe for
an early dinner.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.580
Good example for "Do the
heavy lifting for me."

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:43.800
Another example.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:49.540
So once you're abroad and you're
jet-lagged, it's often

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.640
kind of tricky to do
time zone math.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.950
Because you're awake when nobody
else is, and you're

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.730
sleepy when you're supposed
to be awake.

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:03.450
So Google Now does something to
help you out with this by

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:07.080
showing you what time
it is at home.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:12.290
Another example of "Do the
heavy lifting for me"

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:13.360
Another example.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:17.060
We decided to go for a lean back
experience with Google

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.830
Now with almost no setup,
because we knew that if you

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:24.340
had to tell Google Now about
all your preferences in

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:28.550
painstaking detail, it would
kind of spoil the fun.

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:33.670
So now, this is all you have
to do to get started.

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:41.080
It's "Do the heavy lifting for
me." And instead, Google Now

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.380
implements the principle
"Get to know me."

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:48.350
In fact, it's all about "Get to
know me." If you drive to

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.840
work, you probably have
a preferred time.

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:56.240
And most of us would very much
like to know if there is an

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.170
accident or just if there's
bad traffic

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.020
that they could avoid.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:05.200
Google Now learns about your
habits, cross references it

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.240
with traffic and other
data, and adjusts

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.380
what it shows to you.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.940
It sounds kind of easy when I
say it, but I think you know

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.540
it's clearly not.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.770
We're giving the design
principle "Get to know me" a

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:20.190
serious workout.

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.310
Most interfaces would implement
this design

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:27.515
principle as maybe remembering
one user preference.

00:32:27.515 --> 00:32:31.640
Google Now completely
reconfigures itself based on

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.035
automated data triangulation.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.680
Here's another example.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.240
I like freshly baked bread.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.810
And there's a bakery close to
where I live that sells

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.650
delicious bread, and I
go there quite a bit.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.550
Google Now has learned that
this place might be of

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:51.260
interest to me and is giving me
the choice to get traffic

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.130
to that place.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:57.180
Another good example for
"Get to know me."

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:03.050
Here's another one that Google
Now pushes to its limits.

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:08.000
"Only show what I need when I
need it." We have simplified

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.390
Google Now to the point where it
only shows content when it

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:16.730
has something to say, and it
will show nothing when there's

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.180
nothing to say.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.240
It's a pretty bold move.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:23.450
It looks like this.

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:28.340
And it applies "Only show what
I need when I need it" to

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.120
almost everything in the UI.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.550
Here's another example
of something similar.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.680
Whether you're traveling or
not, weather is usually an

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.980
important topic.

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.740
And there's a million details
one could show--

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:48.760
precipitation percentages, air
pressure, humidity, and so on.

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:54.270
On the weather card, we've
stripped everything down to

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.070
its bare essentials.

00:33:56.070 --> 00:34:01.050
And it's another example of
"Only show what I need when I

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:02.920
need it."

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.620
There are a lot more principles
applied in Google

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:09.860
Now, but these are
the ones that it

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:11.625
really pushes very far.

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:21.340
RACHEL GARB: From the examples
we've shown you, you can see

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:24.580
the tremendous impact that the
design principles have had on

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.790
Android's user experience, and
we hope you're inspired to

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:30.690
bring them back to your teams
and try them too.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.590
Is there a specific process
that you should use?

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:34.280
No.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.060
Your design team has its own way
of doing things, and the

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.699
principles can fit into
whatever that is.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:43.320
So instead of process, let's
focus on activities--

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.889
things that we all do,
like exploring design

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:48.730
solutions to a problem.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.270
If you're having trouble getting
started, you could

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:53.960
scan the principles and see if
any sticks out to you as

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.389
relevant to the problem that
you're trying to solve.

00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:58.500
This could help generate
ideas.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.090
Or if you don't have that
problem-- you've explored and

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.870
have come up with several
approaches--

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.820
you could evaluate each of
them in terms of the

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:08.340
principles and see which
one does best.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.770
And then, take your winning
approach, and see if you can

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:14.010
improve upon it even more by
excelling at more design

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.690
principles.

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:19.410
So a few weeks ago, I was in a
really heated discussion about

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:22.160
design with a product team,
and we had two competing

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.400
interaction models.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.900
We'd been sitting around
probably for 90 minutes.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.260
It was getting to
be dinner time.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.260
And it just hit me all of a
sudden, and I said to the

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.660
group, hey, you know what?

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:34.220
This is really a battle between
"I should always know

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.060
where I am" and "If it looks
the same, it should act the

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:40.710
same." And once we recognized
the principles, we started

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:42.680
looking for a way to excel
at both of them.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:43.290
And we did.

00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:46.720
We arrived at a new
interaction model.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.490
Now, here's another thing that
we all do or the designers

00:35:50.490 --> 00:35:53.870
that you work with do, which
is presenting designs.

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.490
And when you present designs,
you could bring along the

00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:59.150
principles for everyone
to refer to.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:01.680
As the designer, you could quote
from the principles to

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.680
explain your thinking or
defend your choices.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:07.420
You could also encourage others
to point to principles

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.450
when they give you feedback
or ask you questions.

00:36:10.450 --> 00:36:13.390
So I'll never forget the time
that I presented my first pass

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:18.340
of a design for Android Beam
to my fellow designers.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.790
The first thing I told the team
was that I was focusing

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.820
on the "Enchant me" pillar of
our vision for this feature,

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.530
and everybody was very excited
to see what was next.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.500
And then, I showed a screen
where you could touch one of

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:31.250
two buttons to indicate
whether you

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:33.090
were sending or receiving.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.390
Now, the immediate reaction was,
understandably, you call

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:37.680
that enchanting?

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.750
It teased out an important
principle that I'd been

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.630
overlooking, which is "Real
objects are more fun than

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:46.370
buttons and menus." And that
moment was pivotal for the

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:49.520
design of Android Beam.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.360
Here's something else
we all do--

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.410
research.

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:55.340
And it can come in handy in
several ways to use the

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.160
principles.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:59.590
When you're developing your
research plans, you could use

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:02.090
the principles to help you
determine your goals.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:04.630
And then, when you're delivering
the findings from

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.530
your studies, you could use the
principles to name reasons

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:10.680
for what you observe, both the
successes and the failures.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:12.780
And Helena can tell you
all about this.

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.090
HELENA ROEBER: Yeah.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:16.770
So when we developed Google Now,
one of our primary design

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:19.440
goals was to be delightful.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:24.660
So when we ran this one study,
we actually started to keep

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:29.630
track of all the moments where
participants voiced either

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:32.420
delight or disappointment
or frustration

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:33.880
or were just neutral.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:40.990
And it was a really nice way for
the team to be reminded of

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:44.480
their original vision, but
also to see how they were

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.110
doing with respect to it.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:50.290
And identify the places that we
should definitely keep and

00:37:50.290 --> 00:37:53.200
develop further, but also
find the places

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:54.450
where we can do better.

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:59.200
RACHEL GARB: And here's one I'm
sure everyone in the room

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.480
is very familiar with--
prioritizing fixes, especially

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.170
at the 11th hour.

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:06.550
Here, you could use the
principles to help make your

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.890
case for what's most
important.

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:12.220
And the principles might also
help you identify some quick

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.040
wins, which are things that you
could easily change that

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.810
also pay off well in terms of
excelling at the principles.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.180
HELENA ROEBER: So Rachel earlier
talked a lot about the

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.670
importance of words, and you now
know what emotional impact

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.690
they can have.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:29.490
So when you're looking for
something to fix at the 11th

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:33.750
hour, look at how you're talking
to the people using

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:34.720
your product.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.770
And you now know with relatively
small changes, you

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:43.080
can have a big impact.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.020
RACHEL GARB: And finally, when
you're brainstorming the

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.410
future of your product with a
group, you could start off by

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:49.880
going over the principles.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:53.310
It's a really great way to frame
the challenge and also

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:55.320
encourage everyone
to think big.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.200
And I've been doing
this for a while.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.740
The first time I did this,
I organized a brainstorm

00:39:00.740 --> 00:39:03.790
workshop with a cross-functional
team to

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:06.510
envision the future of a
particular area of Android.

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.520
And I started out by giving a
five minute refresher on our

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.130
design vision and principles.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:14.240
And then, we asked everyone to
brainstorm, what would it mean

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.570
for this experience to enchant
me, simplify my life, and make

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:20.960
me amazing, or to excel at any
of the principles they saw?

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:23.310
And the thing I noticed right
away, as people were writing

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:27.030
down their ideas on sticky notes
and handing them to me,

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.340
these ideas were phrased in the
voice of the user, in the

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.040
first person.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.590
I just thought that
was very cool.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:36.030
And I was also really excited
to see that everyone was not

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.340
really thinking about
implementation challenges or

00:39:38.340 --> 00:39:39.270
feasibility.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:42.080
They were really able to step
away from that as they put

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:44.750
themselves in the shoes of
users and focused on the

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:46.075
vision and the principles.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:52.370
HELENA ROEBER: We have some
parting thoughts for you.

00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:56.745
And we will leave you with three
questions to ponder, and

00:39:56.745 --> 00:39:58.930
we'll ask them in the
voice of the people

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:01.590
who use your products.

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:03.500
Are you enchanting us?

00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:07.590
Are you looking for ways to
activate the pleasure centers

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:11.190
of our brains with pictures,
real objects, slick

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.380
animations, and pleasing
sounds?

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.610
Are you bringing a ray of
sunshine into our lives every

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:18.930
time we use your product?

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.320
Are you simplifying our lives?

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.260
Are you removing all those
things that burn us out--

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.890
inconsistencies, being
lost, confusing

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:32.450
messages, placing blame?

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:36.050
Are you keeping our time and
attention focused on what

00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:38.330
really matters?

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:41.050
And finally, are you
making us amazing?

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.040
Are you creating something that
we want to show off to

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.450
our friends?

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.980
Are you solving real
problems for us?

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.070
And are you giving us the power
to do things that we

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:54.530
never thought we could?

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:56.980
And with that, we thank
you very much.

00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:01.170
The design principles are
published on the Android

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.820
developer website.

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:07.560
Soon, this slide will change
to a barcode and a link.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:08.840
Here we go.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.040
So yeah.

00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:11.230
And this ends our session.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:12.200
Thank you very much.

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:14.178
[APPLAUSE]
