00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.509
in classical ideas about how the memory

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:07.519
in classical ideas about how the memory
 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.330
in classical ideas about how the memory
records memories of events for example

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:13.340
records memories of events for example
 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.910
records memories of events for example
there's the idea that the brain

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920
there's the idea that the brain
 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.259
there's the idea that the brain
processes a sequence of signals and the

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:21.269
processes a sequence of signals and the
 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:24.979
processes a sequence of signals and the
signals come from the perceptual regions

00:00:24.979 --> 00:00:24.989
signals come from the perceptual regions
 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.009
signals come from the perceptual regions
of the brain and they sort of go in one

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
of the brain and they sort of go in one
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.150
of the brain and they sort of go in one
direction to higher and higher order

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160
direction to higher and higher order
 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.290
direction to higher and higher order
regions of the brain like for example

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
regions of the brain like for example
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.810
regions of the brain like for example
the anterior temporal lobe or the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
the anterior temporal lobe or the
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.049
the anterior temporal lobe or the
anterior frontal lobe and it is there at

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
anterior frontal lobe and it is there at
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.979
anterior frontal lobe and it is there at
that point that the both the most

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
that point that the both the most
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.959
that point that the both the most
complex perceptions of complex events as

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969
complex perceptions of complex events as
 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.779
complex perceptions of complex events as
well as the most complex memories of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
well as the most complex memories of
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.169
well as the most complex memories of
complex events are formed so the idea is

00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:54.179
complex events are formed so the idea is
 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.459
complex events are formed so the idea is
that if you are listening to somebody

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469
that if you are listening to somebody
 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.310
that if you are listening to somebody
singing or talking and at the same time

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
singing or talking and at the same time
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.670
singing or talking and at the same time
seeing the person and sort of feeling

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
seeing the person and sort of feeling
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.560
seeing the person and sort of feeling
yourself sitting in a chair because you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
yourself sitting in a chair because you
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.260
yourself sitting in a chair because you
are in a concert hall that those

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270
are in a concert hall that those
 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.380
are in a concert hall that those
separate impressions are only going to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390
separate impressions are only going to
 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.290
separate impressions are only going to
come together in very high order regions

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300
come together in very high order regions
 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.170
come together in very high order regions
of the brain and that's where they they

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180
of the brain and that's where they they
 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.850
of the brain and that's where they they
are going to be perceived so that's

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
are going to be perceived so that's
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.310
are going to be perceived so that's
where you have your sort of film

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320
where you have your sort of film
 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.660
where you have your sort of film
experience with soundtrack and whatnot

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670
experience with soundtrack and whatnot
 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.430
experience with soundtrack and whatnot
and that's also where the recording is

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440
and that's also where the recording is
 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.130
and that's also where the recording is
going to be made and there a lot of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
going to be made and there a lot of
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.510
going to be made and there a lot of
reasons why this cannot work this way

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520
reasons why this cannot work this way
 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.240
reasons why this cannot work this way
and about 20 years ago we were dealing

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250
and about 20 years ago we were dealing
 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.600
and about 20 years ago we were dealing
with this problem and then we proposed

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
with this problem and then we proposed
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.760
with this problem and then we proposed
the framework in which we said well

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770
the framework in which we said well
 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.510
the framework in which we said well
first of all we now are beginning to

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
first of all we now are beginning to
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.050
first of all we now are beginning to
know that everything that moves forward

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
know that everything that moves forward
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.870
know that everything that moves forward
in terms of signaling in the brain does

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880
in terms of signaling in the brain does
 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.410
in terms of signaling in the brain does
not move just in a forward direction but

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
not move just in a forward direction but
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.290
not move just in a forward direction but
as it moves forward there's also a

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300
as it moves forward there's also a
 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.170
as it moves forward there's also a
feedback loop that comes to the origin

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
feedback loop that comes to the origin
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.490
feedback loop that comes to the origin
of the feed-forward

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500
of the feed-forward
 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.980
of the feed-forward
so basically we're dealing with loops

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
so basically we're dealing with loops
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.090
so basically we're dealing with loops
that advance but also can come back on

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100
that advance but also can come back on
 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.720
that advance but also can come back on
their tracks to the original point there

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
their tracks to the original point there
 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.309
their tracks to the original point there
was something there was begin

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319
was something there was begin
 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.099
was something there was begin
to be known in that was very interesting

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109
to be known in that was very interesting
 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.020
to be known in that was very interesting
because it opened up possibilities about

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030
because it opened up possibilities about
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.390
because it opened up possibilities about
the circuitry so this is not just in one

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
the circuitry so this is not just in one
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.629
the circuitry so this is not just in one
direction but in multiple directions

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:25.639
direction but in multiple directions
 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.009
direction but in multiple directions
that include both the forward and the

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019
that include both the forward and the
 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.959
that include both the forward and the
backward and the other thing is that

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969
backward and the other thing is that
 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.890
backward and the other thing is that
there was clear evidence that when you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900
there was clear evidence that when you
 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.740
there was clear evidence that when you
lose as a result of damage to the brain

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
lose as a result of damage to the brain
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.289
lose as a result of damage to the brain
when you lose regions of the brain that

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299
when you lose regions of the brain that
 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.720
when you lose regions of the brain that
are very high up like an anterior

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730
are very high up like an anterior
 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.179
are very high up like an anterior
temporal lobe or interior frontal lobe

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189
temporal lobe or interior frontal lobe
 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.239
temporal lobe or interior frontal lobe
lo and behold you don't lose the

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:47.249
lo and behold you don't lose the
 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.970
lo and behold you don't lose the
possibility of having a complex

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980
possibility of having a complex
 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.699
possibility of having a complex
perception of the world in other words

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709
perception of the world in other words
 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.059
perception of the world in other words
your filmic experience still remains nor

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069
your filmic experience still remains nor
 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.509
your filmic experience still remains nor
do you lose the possibility of

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519
do you lose the possibility of
 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.699
do you lose the possibility of
remembering a complex perception in fact

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709
remembering a complex perception in fact
 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.259
remembering a complex perception in fact
the only thing you lose is the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269
the only thing you lose is the
 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.580
the only thing you lose is the
possibility of dating and recognizing

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590
possibility of dating and recognizing
 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.789
possibility of dating and recognizing
the uniqueness of the perception so that

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799
the uniqueness of the perception so that
 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.039
the uniqueness of the perception so that
discrepancy led us to propose this idea

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049
discrepancy led us to propose this idea
 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.399
discrepancy led us to propose this idea
that there was a system of convergence

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409
that there was a system of convergence
 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.659
that there was a system of convergence
that went over multiple hierarchies

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669
that went over multiple hierarchies
 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.729
that went over multiple hierarchies
towards certain anchor points in the

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739
towards certain anchor points in the
 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.119
towards certain anchor points in the
brain in that what the convergence was

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129
brain in that what the convergence was
 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.059
brain in that what the convergence was
achieving with leading signals to a

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069
achieving with leading signals to a
 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.309
achieving with leading signals to a
certain point the convergence divergence

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319
certain point the convergence divergence
 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.149
certain point the convergence divergence
zone and what was being recorded there

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159
zone and what was being recorded there
 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.089
zone and what was being recorded there
was not all that was happening in your

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099
was not all that was happening in your
 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.089
was not all that was happening in your
filmmaking experience but rather the

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099
filmmaking experience but rather the
 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.059
filmmaking experience but rather the
fact that something had happened back

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069
fact that something had happened back
 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.689
fact that something had happened back
here that had happened simultaneously in

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699
here that had happened simultaneously in
 

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:53.210
here that had happened simultaneously in
this region in this region in this

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220
this region in this region in this
 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.349
this region in this region in this
region and then by dint of the feedback

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359
region and then by dint of the feedback
 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.499
region and then by dint of the feedback
the the the the the backward projection

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:00.509
the the the the the backward projection
 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.929
the the the the the backward projection
we would have the possibility later on

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939
we would have the possibility later on
 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.830
we would have the possibility later on
of reactivating the entire experience

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840
of reactivating the entire experience
 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.349
of reactivating the entire experience
now what this is she and that's that the

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359
now what this is she and that's that the
 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.619
now what this is she and that's that the
notion of convergence divergence so I

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629
notion of convergence divergence so I
 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.330
notion of convergence divergence so I
actually at first I only called it

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340
actually at first I only called it
 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.089
actually at first I only called it
convergence and I remember Francis Crick

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:17.099
convergence and I remember Francis Crick
 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:19.249
convergence and I remember Francis Crick
telling me don't call it just

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259
telling me don't call it just
 

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.409
telling me don't call it just
convergence that's what people are going

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419
convergence that's what people are going
 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.029
convergence that's what people are going
to remember they will never think about

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039
to remember they will never think about
 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.060
to remember they will never think about
the divergence part and then I later

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070
the divergence part and then I later
 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.469
the divergence part and then I later
corrected this because it was quite

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479
corrected this because it was quite
 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:28.150
corrected this because it was quite
right

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160
right
 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.180
right
and so the idea is that when you are

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190
and so the idea is that when you are
 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.340
and so the idea is that when you are
asked to remember a certain experience

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350
asked to remember a certain experience
 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.950
asked to remember a certain experience
that you have today in which you're

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960
that you have today in which you're
 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.060
that you have today in which you're
talking with person a listening to the

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070
talking with person a listening to the
 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.610
talking with person a listening to the
person's voice but you also are in a

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620
person's voice but you also are in a
 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.550
person's voice but you also are in a
certain context B which is the context

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560
certain context B which is the context
 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.400
certain context B which is the context
of a certain room in a certain building

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410
of a certain room in a certain building
 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.270
of a certain room in a certain building
you're going to have the separate

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280
you're going to have the separate
 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.990
you're going to have the separate
recordings of the of the voice of the

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000
recordings of the of the voice of the
 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.090
recordings of the of the voice of the
person the sight of the person the place

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100
person the sight of the person the place
 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.390
person the sight of the person the place
but those recordings are going to be

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400
but those recordings are going to be
 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.960
but those recordings are going to be
reactivated only if another recording of

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970
reactivated only if another recording of
 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.160
reactivated only if another recording of
the simultaneity of the event has been

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170
the simultaneity of the event has been
 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.190
the simultaneity of the event has been
made in a convergence diversions so and

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200
made in a convergence diversions so and
 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.480
made in a convergence diversions so and
so you you send signals forward through

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490
so you you send signals forward through
 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.060
so you you send signals forward through
convergence and then divergence will

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070
convergence and then divergence will
 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.000
convergence and then divergence will
allow for what I call the process of

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010
allow for what I call the process of
 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.270
allow for what I call the process of
retro activation in the retro activation

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280
retro activation in the retro activation
 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.670
retro activation in the retro activation
is going to take place in different

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680
is going to take place in different
 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.610
is going to take place in different
sites at the same time approximately or

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620
sites at the same time approximately or
 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.220
sites at the same time approximately or
in rapid sequence at those different

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230
in rapid sequence at those different
 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.860
in rapid sequence at those different
places like for example when we when we

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870
places like for example when we when we
 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.100
places like for example when we when we
replay music in our minds and so what

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110
replay music in our minds and so what
 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.990
replay music in our minds and so what
this does just to finalize the story is

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000
this does just to finalize the story is
 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.660
this does just to finalize the story is
create a solve a great problem of

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670
create a solve a great problem of
 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.150
create a solve a great problem of
economy in other words in instead of

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160
economy in other words in instead of
 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.290
economy in other words in instead of
having to record every event that you're

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300
having to record every event that you're
 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.610
having to record every event that you're
going through in your life every day

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620
going through in your life every day
 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.920
going through in your life every day
with every kind of person with the books

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930
with every kind of person with the books
 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.440
with every kind of person with the books
you read the things you see and hear in

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:05.450
you read the things you see and hear in
 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.220
you read the things you see and hear in
touch and smell what you need to do is

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:09.230
touch and smell what you need to do is
 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.940
touch and smell what you need to do is
record conjunctions of the occurrence of

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950
record conjunctions of the occurrence of
 

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:16.120
record conjunctions of the occurrence of
certain events and then out of the

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130
certain events and then out of the
 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.520
certain events and then out of the
conjunction you can replay you can

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530
conjunction you can replay you can
 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.640
conjunction you can replay you can
reconstruct and so memory in this

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650
reconstruct and so memory in this
 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.790
reconstruct and so memory in this
perspective is always reconstructive you

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800
perspective is always reconstructive you
 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.220
perspective is always reconstructive you
are always trying to get at some

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230
are always trying to get at some
 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.860
are always trying to get at some
approximation of what went on rather

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870
approximation of what went on rather
 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.150
approximation of what went on rather
than an exact recording of what went on

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160
than an exact recording of what went on
 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.770
than an exact recording of what went on
and that's where the big difference

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780
and that's where the big difference
 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.260
and that's where the big difference
between the the recording in terms of

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270
between the the recording in terms of
 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.680
between the the recording in terms of
the photograph or in terms of celluloid

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:41.690
the photograph or in terms of celluloid
 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.010
the photograph or in terms of celluloid
the picture comes we are not like that

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.020
the picture comes we are not like that
 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.370
the picture comes we are not like that
we don't have these they are all of this

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380
we don't have these they are all of this
 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.070
we don't have these they are all of this
celluloid or polaroid pictures filed in

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080
celluloid or polaroid pictures filed in
 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.380
celluloid or polaroid pictures filed in
some place and we don't just replay them

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390
some place and we don't just replay them
 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.050
some place and we don't just replay them
in a screening room we have something

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060
in a screening room we have something
 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:01.540
in a screening room we have something
that is both far far more complex but at

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:01.550
that is both far far more complex but at
 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.570
that is both far far more complex but at
the same time far more economic and that

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580
the same time far more economic and that
 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.390
the same time far more economic and that
also to certain extent because of its

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400
also to certain extent because of its
 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.030
also to certain extent because of its
fragmented nature far more prone to

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:10.040
fragmented nature far more prone to
 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.520
fragmented nature far more prone to
error all of these things come into the

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530
error all of these things come into the
 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.680
error all of these things come into the
picture
