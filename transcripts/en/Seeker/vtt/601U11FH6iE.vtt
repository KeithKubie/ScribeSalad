00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.920
DNA is a double-helix, so I guess you could
say guess his DNA was

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.100
bent into shape.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.830
[YYEEAAAHHH]

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.560
Hey all you Gary Sinise groupies, Trace here
for DNews.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.620
DNA evidence is often seen as the silver bullet
of crime scene investigations...start with

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.789
a tiny dab of blood, add a 10 second lab montage,
and the perp is behind bars.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:26.789
Right?

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.050
Well, no.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.590
As powerful as DNA analysis is, it’s not
the perfect evidence that the general public,

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.460
and the court system, make it out to be.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.690
First, a little background.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.620
DNA fingerprinting was developed back in 1984,
and it exploits some basic truths about genetics.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.560
All DNA is comprised of four chemical bases:
Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.450
These link together to form base pairs, and
long chains of base pairs link up to form

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.320
strands of DNA.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.571
Different combinations of those base pairs
define different genes, and thus different

00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:56.571
traits.

00:00:56.571 --> 00:01:01.180
In total, the human genome contains about
3 billion base pairs... but only about point

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.590
one percent of those vary from person to person,
and that tiny slice of the pie accounts for

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.450
everyone’s unique traits.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.020
And it’s that 0.1% that DNA fingerprinting
utilizes.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.000
When samples of blood, saliva, or other “leavings”
are found at a crime scene, experts analyze

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.990
the DNA fragments within those samples and
compare them to a suspect’s DNA...or to

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.630
a database of people with criminal records.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.979
The more distinct sets of base pairs you can
find, the more confidently you can match,

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.249
or rule out, samples.

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:37.029
Since 1984 this procedure has gotten quicker,
cheaper, and more accurate, and has exploded

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:38.029
in use.

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:42.539
But here’s the problem: as useful as DNA
testing is, it’s not necessarily the forensic

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.429
turn-key solution that shows like CSI make
it out to be.

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:50.920
And that’s largely because the process of
collecting and analyzing DNA can be surprisingly

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.079
ambiguous.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.149
First off, DNA is everywhere.

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.159
Tiny traces of skin, saliva, blood or other
DNA-containing material are often found all

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.039
over a crime scene, and collecting samples
is low-tech, time-consuming, and fairly error-prone.

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.829
Once samples are in, investigators must figure
out which are relevant to the crime...no small

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:13.829
task.

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.790
Worse, DNA from the perp is often mixed with
that of the victim, requiring lab techs to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.620
tease out which is which.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.680
All in all, DNA evidence is frequently messy,
requiring experts to try and extrapolate whether

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.520
an incomplete or mixed DNA profile truly matches
a reference sample.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.909
It’s sort of like trying to figure out whether
a few scattered puzzle pieces even belong

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.739
to the picture on the box, let alone fit together.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.560
This ambiguity can lead to labs fudging results
to help out investigators, or genuine errors

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.560
in analysis, or outright fraud.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.560
And all that opens the door for false positives
in DNA matches.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.400
Sadly, there are many examples of misused
DNA evidence ruining lives.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.890
In 1998 Josiah Sutton was arrested and charged
with raping a woman in Houston, Texas.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.670
A crime lab employee testified at the trial
that Sutton was an “exact match” with

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.650
the DNA recovered from the scene.

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.980
He was convicted, and spent almost five years
in prison before a second round of testing

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.090
found he was in no way an “exact match.”

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.469
That second test didn’t make use of any
new evidence...it simply interpreted the DNA

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:18.610
more accurately.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.719
And then there’s DNA mixups wasting valuable
time and money.

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:26.739
For more than 15 years, investigators in Europe
searched for the Phantom of Heilbronn, a criminal

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.750
mastermind who left identical DNA traces at
more than 40 crime scenes across the continent.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.560
After an exhaustive manhunt, the DNA in question
was finally matched...to a factory worker

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.819
who helped make DNA test kits.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.819
So, look.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.719
We’re NOT arguing that, “DNA evidence
doesn’t work because some people don’t

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:45.719
use it right.”

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:51.239
DNA fingerprinting has revolutionized forensics,
and to date has exonerated 347 wrongfully-convicted

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.720
people in the US alone.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.769
But there is a perception that DNA testing
is both simple and infallible.

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.269
Jurors tend to overcommit to physical evidence
when it’s presented as fact by experts.

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.969
Researchers have even proposed a “CSI Effect,”
which is the tendency of juries expect fast

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.609
and conclusive DNA evidence in every trial.

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.769
These are dangerous trends because, as sound
as the science is, it’s no good to anyone

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.590
unless it’s used within its limits.

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.590
Like any science.

science?
