is defined by the presence of current
dental disease conditions so just to

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500
dental disease conditions so just to
 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.820
dental disease conditions so just to
talk about a few of them dental disease

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830
talk about a few of them dental disease
 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.820
talk about a few of them dental disease
conditions like we said I just had you

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830
conditions like we said I just had you
 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.020
conditions like we said I just had you
guys stand up about tooth decay and

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030
guys stand up about tooth decay and
 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.320
guys stand up about tooth decay and
we're gonna go for it for a second some

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330
we're gonna go for it for a second some
 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.719
we're gonna go for it for a second some
people call it dental caries so what is

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729
people call it dental caries so what is
 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:16.540
people call it dental caries so what is
tooth decay and see us it's interactive

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550
tooth decay and see us it's interactive
 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.100
tooth decay and see us it's interactive
I don't like to sit in the lecture to

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110
I don't like to sit in the lecture to
 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.839
I don't like to sit in the lecture to
people so I'd like to have what I call a

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849
people so I'd like to have what I call a
 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.960
people so I'd like to have what I call a
town hall panel presentation was very

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970
town hall panel presentation was very
 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.390
town hall panel presentation was very
interactive which really helps with the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400
interactive which really helps with the
 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.430
interactive which really helps with the
understanding of everything and since I

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440
understanding of everything and since I
 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.810
understanding of everything and since I
have some very bright young people in

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820
have some very bright young people in
 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.020
have some very bright young people in
the room does anyone want to stand up

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030
the room does anyone want to stand up
 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.060
the room does anyone want to stand up
and tell me what they think a cavity or

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070
and tell me what they think a cavity or
 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:43.390
and tell me what they think a cavity or
tooth decay is

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400
 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.740
not to put anybody on the spot

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750
not to put anybody on the spot
 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.790
not to put anybody on the spot
and you're forgetting everybody

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800
and you're forgetting everybody
 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.980
and you're forgetting everybody
everybody's a love shot that's fun I can

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990
everybody's a love shot that's fun I can
 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.969
everybody's a love shot that's fun I can
take with a tooth decay is no call the

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979
take with a tooth decay is no call the
 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.560
take with a tooth decay is no call the
tears okay well we gotta go on cuz I

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570
tears okay well we gotta go on cuz I
 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:10.420
tears okay well we gotta go on cuz I
gotta get through this yeah

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430
 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.180
that is very good there whatever she

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190
that is very good there whatever she
 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.050
that is very good there whatever she
said that is very good that is you just

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060
said that is very good that is you just
 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.060
said that is very good that is you just
saw my whole definition problem right

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070
saw my whole definition problem right
 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.190
saw my whole definition problem right
there and that is basically what it is

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200
there and that is basically what it is
 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.190
there and that is basically what it is
the folks who are older are receiving

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.200
the folks who are older are receiving
 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.340
the folks who are older are receiving
people a little more scientific

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350
people a little more scientific
 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.830
people a little more scientific
explanation is basically what she said

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840
explanation is basically what she said
 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.580
explanation is basically what she said
but tooth decay is basically active

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590
but tooth decay is basically active
 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.610
but tooth decay is basically active
disease process which is the destructive

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620
disease process which is the destructive
 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.340
disease process which is the destructive
process of tooth structure whether it be

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350
process of tooth structure whether it be
 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.140
process of tooth structure whether it be
the outside of the tooth which is these

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150
the outside of the tooth which is these
 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.530
the outside of the tooth which is these
enamel going into the inside or in the

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:44.540
enamel going into the inside or in the
 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.960
enamel going into the inside or in the
root surfaces and basically you have to

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:46.970
root surfaces and basically you have to
 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.420
root surfaces and basically you have to
have three things in order for Cabot's

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430
have three things in order for Cabot's
 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.850
have three things in order for Cabot's
to occur of course you have to have a

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860
to occur of course you have to have a
 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.460
to occur of course you have to have a
tooth the second thing is you have to

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470
tooth the second thing is you have to
 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.040
tooth the second thing is you have to
have food and the last thing is bacteria

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050
have food and the last thing is bacteria
 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.980
have food and the last thing is bacteria
so when we speak of the bacteria there

00:06:59.980 --> 00:06:59.990
so when we speak of the bacteria there
 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.480
so when we speak of the bacteria there
are normally two different types of

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490
are normally two different types of
 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.170
are normally two different types of
bacteria responsible and that is

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:05.180
bacteria responsible and that is
 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.660
bacteria responsible and that is
actually called streptococcus mutants

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:07.670
actually called streptococcus mutants
 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.720
actually called streptococcus mutants
and oneness now we're both of those what

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730
and oneness now we're both of those what
 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.990
and oneness now we're both of those what
happens is the bacteria and I know we

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000
happens is the bacteria and I know we
 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.700
happens is the bacteria and I know we
all think that our mouths are very clean

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710
all think that our mouths are very clean
 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.580
all think that our mouths are very clean
places but your mouth is wanted the

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.590
places but your mouth is wanted the
 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:24.790
places but your mouth is wanted the
nastiest places in your whole body okay

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800
nastiest places in your whole body okay
 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.700
nastiest places in your whole body okay
there are over 500 bacteria in your

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710
there are over 500 bacteria in your
 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.110
there are over 500 bacteria in your
mouth

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120
mouth
 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.580
mouth
some of them are what we call good

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:30.590
some of them are what we call good
 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.830
some of them are what we call good
bacteria because there's a bacteria the

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840
bacteria because there's a bacteria the
 

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.130
bacteria because there's a bacteria the
thing is when this bacteria we're just

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:39.140
thing is when this bacteria we're just
 

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.740
thing is when this bacteria we're just
transmitted through your saliva it

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:41.750
transmitted through your saliva it
 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.230
transmitted through your saliva it
attaches to a little sticky pellicle on

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240
attaches to a little sticky pellicle on
 

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.170
attaches to a little sticky pellicle on
the teeth called plaque and when this

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:47.180
the teeth called plaque and when this
 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.690
the teeth called plaque and when this
bacteria in this plaque gets on the

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:49.700
bacteria in this plaque gets on the
 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.900
bacteria in this plaque gets on the
teeth now you start to eat and you start

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:52.910
teeth now you start to eat and you start
 

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.780
teeth now you start to eat and you start
to digest carbohydrates and the

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:55.790
to digest carbohydrates and the
 

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.880
to digest carbohydrates and the
carbohydrates are broken down into sugar

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:57.890
carbohydrates are broken down into sugar
 

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.030
carbohydrates are broken down into sugar
and it produces an acid called lactic

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:01.040
and it produces an acid called lactic
 

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.030
and it produces an acid called lactic
acid so when this assets to the teeth

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.040
acid so when this assets to the teeth
 

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.220
acid so when this assets to the teeth
and it starts to corrode the teeth teeth

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:06.230
and it starts to corrode the teeth teeth
 

00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:08.530
and it starts to corrode the teeth teeth
are in the state of demineralization of

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:08.540
are in the state of demineralization of
 

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:12.370
are in the state of demineralization of
remineralisation for a period of time so

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:12.380
remineralisation for a period of time so
 

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.960
remineralisation for a period of time so
sometimes you can go to a dentist and

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:13.970
sometimes you can go to a dentist and
 

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:16.000
sometimes you can go to a dentist and
dentists may say you just have a little

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.010
dentists may say you just have a little
 

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.680
dentists may say you just have a little
bitty small cavity so I just want to

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:17.690
bitty small cavity so I just want to
 

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:19.670
bitty small cavity so I just want to
kind of watch it that means that

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680
kind of watch it that means that
 

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.600
kind of watch it that means that
is still able to remineralize itself the

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:23.610
is still able to remineralize itself the
 

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:25.760
is still able to remineralize itself the
pH in your mouth which is a very acidic

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:25.770
pH in your mouth which is a very acidic
 

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.060
pH in your mouth which is a very acidic
place if that pH gets below five point

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:29.070
place if that pH gets below five point
 

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.240
place if that pH gets below five point
five then the to stability to repair

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.250
five then the to stability to repair
 

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.040
five then the to stability to repair
itself is not going to happen anymore

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.050
itself is not going to happen anymore
 

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.719
itself is not going to happen anymore
that cavity ends up getting deeper

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:35.729
that cavity ends up getting deeper
 

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:39.140
that cavity ends up getting deeper
deeper until you end up having pain you

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.150
deeper until you end up having pain you
 

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.760
deeper until you end up having pain you
end up either losing the tooth have an

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:40.770
end up either losing the tooth have an
 

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.440
end up either losing the tooth have an
half something called a root canal and

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:42.450
half something called a root canal and
 

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.800
half something called a root canal and
worst case scenario if the tooth ends up

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:45.810
worst case scenario if the tooth ends up
 

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.780
worst case scenario if the tooth ends up
performing an infection and you get an

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:47.790
performing an infection and you get an
 

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.120
performing an infection and you get an
abscess and the abscess goes untreated

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:50.130
abscess and the abscess goes untreated
 

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.350
abscess and the abscess goes untreated
you can't it can't result in death so

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360
you can't it can't result in death so
 

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.450
you can't it can't result in death so
there's nothing cavities are not just

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:56.460
there's nothing cavities are not just
 

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:58.160
there's nothing cavities are not just
this young lady was correct they do

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:58.170
this young lady was correct they do
 

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.019
this young lady was correct they do
start off just as holes but they can

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:00.029
start off just as holes but they can
 

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:02.420
start off just as holes but they can
progress on into something more serious

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:02.430
progress on into something more serious
 

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:04.730
progress on into something more serious
and I'll give you some examples of that

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740
and I'll give you some examples of that
 

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:11.060
and I'll give you some examples of that
a little bit later there okay and just

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.070
a little bit later there okay and just
 

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.780
a little bit later there okay and just
two cavities can I know this incise I'm

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:14.790
two cavities can I know this incise I'm
 

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.100
two cavities can I know this incise I'm
glad my young people here could not he

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:16.110
glad my young people here could not he
 

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.310
glad my young people here could not he
is I mean you know these are examples of

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320
is I mean you know these are examples of
 

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.380
is I mean you know these are examples of
cavities here and they can come in all

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:21.390
cavities here and they can come in all
 

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.680
cavities here and they can come in all
forms they can come in big holes in the

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:24.690
forms they can come in big holes in the
 

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.240
forms they can come in big holes in the
teeth but they can come on the side of

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:26.250
teeth but they can come on the side of
 

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:26.750
teeth but they can come on the side of
the teeth

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760
the teeth
 

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.880

the reason x-rays are important is

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:28.890
the reason x-rays are important is
 

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.590
the reason x-rays are important is
because sometimes the case starts in

00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600
because sometimes the case starts in
 

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.180
because sometimes the case starts in
between the teeth where if you don't

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:32.190
between the teeth where if you don't
 

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.920
between the teeth where if you don't
have proper oral hygiene and you're not

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:33.930
have proper oral hygiene and you're not
 

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.980
have proper oral hygiene and you're not
flossing we as dennis can't see it just

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:36.990
flossing we as dennis can't see it just
 

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.900
flossing we as dennis can't see it just
clinically looking in your mouth we have

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:38.910
clinically looking in your mouth we have
 

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.940
clinically looking in your mouth we have
to take x-rays to see how it starts in

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:40.950
to take x-rays to see how it starts in
 

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:45.380
to take x-rays to see how it starts in
between okay now let's move on go

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:45.390
between okay now let's move on go
 

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.360
between okay now let's move on go
quicker on this crash course here okay

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.370
quicker on this crash course here okay
 

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.570
quicker on this crash course here okay
paradigm disease no one put anybody else

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580
paradigm disease no one put anybody else
 

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:52.850
paradigm disease no one put anybody else
on the slide but periodontal disease and

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:52.860
on the slide but periodontal disease and
 

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:57.829
on the slide but periodontal disease and
it is an infection that is of your gods

00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:57.839
it is an infection that is of your gods
 

00:09:57.839 --> 00:10:00.410
it is an infection that is of your gods
and of your of your bone that's the area

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420
and of your of your bone that's the area
 

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.030
and of your of your bone that's the area
that holds the teeth in there your

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040
that holds the teeth in there your
 

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.970
that holds the teeth in there your
surroundings tooth structure supporting

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:04.980
surroundings tooth structure supporting
 

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.500
surroundings tooth structure supporting
structures that hold the teeth in there

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:06.510
structures that hold the teeth in there
 

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:10.910
structures that hold the teeth in there
and periodontal disease can come in two

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:10.920
and periodontal disease can come in two
 

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.490
and periodontal disease can come in two
major categories it normally starts off

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500
major categories it normally starts off
 

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.850
major categories it normally starts off
as gingivitis and gingivitis is

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860
as gingivitis and gingivitis is
 

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:18.920
as gingivitis and gingivitis is
basically when your gums get real puffy

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:18.930
basically when your gums get real puffy
 

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.800
basically when your gums get real puffy
red and bleed very easily reason is

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:21.810
red and bleed very easily reason is
 

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.120
red and bleed very easily reason is
doing that is because of that plaque

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.130
doing that is because of that plaque
 

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.940
doing that is because of that plaque
that's embedded up underneath the gums

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:25.950
that's embedded up underneath the gums
 

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:29.960
that's embedded up underneath the gums
as gingivitis progresses on it ends up

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:29.970
as gingivitis progresses on it ends up
 

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:31.790
as gingivitis progresses on it ends up
turning into

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800
turning into
 

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.079
turning into
the limousines and their different

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:33.089
the limousines and their different
 

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:35.150
the limousines and their different
stages of periodontal disease so this is

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160
stages of periodontal disease so this is
 

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.220
stages of periodontal disease so this is
a very important part to because

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:37.230
a very important part to because
 

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.699
a very important part to because
periodontal disease a lot of times what

00:10:39.699 --> 00:10:39.709
periodontal disease a lot of times what
 

00:10:39.709 --> 00:10:42.379
periodontal disease a lot of times what
young people am adults don't understand

00:10:42.379 --> 00:10:42.389
young people am adults don't understand
 

00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:44.809
young people am adults don't understand
is that basically when your gum tissue

00:10:44.809 --> 00:10:44.819
is that basically when your gum tissue
 

00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:46.249
is that basically when your gum tissue
attaches to the tooth

00:10:46.249 --> 00:10:46.259
attaches to the tooth
 

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:48.439
attaches to the tooth
it makes what's called a pocket and is

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:48.449
it makes what's called a pocket and is
 

00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:50.449
it makes what's called a pocket and is
basically scientific name is a solace

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459
basically scientific name is a solace
 

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:52.789
basically scientific name is a solace
when that plaque gets you not underneath

00:10:52.789 --> 00:10:52.799
when that plaque gets you not underneath
 

00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:54.949
when that plaque gets you not underneath
the gum tissues with the bacteria

00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959
the gum tissues with the bacteria
 

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:56.660
the gum tissues with the bacteria
embedded in there the gum tissues were

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:56.670
embedded in there the gum tissues were
 

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.549
embedded in there the gum tissues were
starting to cool down and so you're

00:10:58.549 --> 00:10:58.559
starting to cool down and so you're
 

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:00.169
starting to cool down and so you're
you're actually start seeing the roots

00:11:00.169 --> 00:11:00.179
you're actually start seeing the roots
 

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:02.269
you're actually start seeing the roots
of the teeth that it teary eights on

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279
of the teeth that it teary eights on
 

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:04.970
of the teeth that it teary eights on
until the teeth eventually get loose and

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:04.980
until the teeth eventually get loose and
 

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.319
until the teeth eventually get loose and
they even have to come out before they

00:11:06.319 --> 00:11:06.329
they even have to come out before they
 

00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:10.009
they even have to come out before they
fall out so para Don disease is

00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019
fall out so para Don disease is
 

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:11.840
fall out so para Don disease is
something that we definitely need to get

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:11.850
something that we definitely need to get
 

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.660
something that we definitely need to get
a control on and we'll see later how

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:13.670
a control on and we'll see later how
 

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.650
a control on and we'll see later how
periodontal disease and it's bacteria

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660
periodontal disease and it's bacteria
 

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.350
periodontal disease and it's bacteria
I'm talking about has a lot more total

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360
I'm talking about has a lot more total
 

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.660
I'm talking about has a lot more total
body effects where it can affect other

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:20.670
body effects where it can affect other
 

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.189
body effects where it can affect other
systemic things in your body and this is

00:11:25.189 --> 00:11:25.199
systemic things in your body and this is
 

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:26.629
systemic things in your body and this is
basically what I understand I just like

00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639
basically what I understand I just like
 

00:11:26.639 --> 00:11:28.039
basically what I understand I just like
to kind of explain it like that where

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:28.049
to kind of explain it like that where
 

00:11:28.049 --> 00:11:30.470
to kind of explain it like that where
you have a little pocket and if you take

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480
you have a little pocket and if you take
 

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.109
you have a little pocket and if you take
your pocket I had a pocket and you stick

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:33.119
your pocket I had a pocket and you stick
 

00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:35.179
your pocket I had a pocket and you stick
stuff down in there that Plagueis this

00:11:35.179 --> 00:11:35.189
stuff down in there that Plagueis this
 

00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:36.590
stuff down in there that Plagueis this
stuff is going down in there so that

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600
stuff is going down in there so that
 

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.840
stuff is going down in there so that
pocket gets full so you've got to take

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:38.850
pocket gets full so you've got to take
 

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.609
pocket gets full so you've got to take
all that stuff out of the pocket in

00:11:40.609 --> 00:11:40.619
all that stuff out of the pocket in
 

00:11:40.619 --> 00:11:42.289
all that stuff out of the pocket in
order to get those gums to tighten back

00:11:42.289 --> 00:11:42.299
order to get those gums to tighten back
 

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:44.720
order to get those gums to tighten back
up and where you have you never can get

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:44.730
up and where you have you never can get
 

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.090
up and where you have you never can get
rid of unfortunately you never can get

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100
rid of unfortunately you never can get

rid of all the bacteria in your mouth
 

00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:50.710
rid of all the bacteria in your mouth
but you do want to keep it under control

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720
but you do want to keep it under control
 

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.960
but you do want to keep it under control

to keep you from having these problems
here okay all pathology just some of the

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:56.610
here okay all pathology just some of the
 

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.759
here okay all pathology just some of the
things we want to mention I'll start

00:11:58.759 --> 00:11:58.769
things we want to mention I'll start
 

00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:00.439
things we want to mention I'll start
with the Aptus ulcers those are the

00:12:00.439 --> 00:12:00.449
with the Aptus ulcers those are the
 

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:02.629
with the Aptus ulcers those are the
things where you get those little areas

00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639
things where you get those little areas
 

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.340
things where you get those little areas
in your mouth and look like little

00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:04.350
in your mouth and look like little
 

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.840
in your mouth and look like little
blisters it's two different types of

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:05.850
blisters it's two different types of
 

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.939
blisters it's two different types of
blisters now one is an actus ulcer and

00:12:07.939 --> 00:12:07.949
blisters now one is an actus ulcer and
 

00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:10.629
blisters now one is an actus ulcer and
then the other one is what we call a

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639
then the other one is what we call a
 

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:13.280
then the other one is what we call a
herpetic lesion or some people call it

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:13.290
herpetic lesion or some people call it
 

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.400
herpetic lesion or some people call it
herpes okay and some people like to call

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:16.410
herpes okay and some people like to call
 

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.280
herpes okay and some people like to call
them cold sores that's the nice name for

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:19.290
them cold sores that's the nice name for
 

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.789
them cold sores that's the nice name for
it okay but basically you can occur

00:12:22.789 --> 00:12:22.799
it okay but basically you can occur
 

00:12:22.799 --> 00:12:24.530
it okay but basically you can occur
anywhere in your mouth your tongue your

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540
anywhere in your mouth your tongue your
 

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.230
anywhere in your mouth your tongue your
roof of your mouth your cheeks your your

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:27.240
roof of your mouth your cheeks your your
 

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:30.019
roof of your mouth your cheeks your your
gum tissue and on the outside of your

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:30.029
gum tissue and on the outside of your
 

00:12:30.029 --> 00:12:32.359
gum tissue and on the outside of your
lips there so that's what the herpetic

00:12:32.359 --> 00:12:32.369
lips there so that's what the herpetic
 

00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:34.249
lips there so that's what the herpetic
lesion and then apis also is usually

00:12:34.249 --> 00:12:34.259
lesion and then apis also is usually
 

00:12:34.259 --> 00:12:36.909
lesion and then apis also is usually
only a curl on the inside or cancer

00:12:36.909 --> 00:12:36.919
only a curl on the inside or cancer
 

00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:39.829
only a curl on the inside or cancer
basically occurs in occur in the same

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839
basically occurs in occur in the same
 

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:40.940
basically occurs in occur in the same
areas your

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:40.950
areas your
 

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.800
areas your
your cheeks your lips your tongue the

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:43.810
your cheeks your lips your tongue the
 

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.720
your cheeks your lips your tongue the
most common place for oral cancer is on

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:45.730
most common place for oral cancer is on
 

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:47.790
most common place for oral cancer is on
the lateral border of the tongue like if

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:47.800
the lateral border of the tongue like if
 

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.769
the lateral border of the tongue like if
you lift your tongue up and in dental

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:49.779
you lift your tongue up and in dental
 

00:12:49.779 --> 00:12:53.010
you lift your tongue up and in dental
offices now pretty much this standard is

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.020

syndrome or cleft lip and palate so

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:18.290
syndrome or cleft lip and palate so
 

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:21.130

these are some of the health disparities

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:21.140
these are some of the health disparities
 

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.090
these are some of the health disparities
some of the burdens and some of the

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:24.100
some of the burdens and some of the
 

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:30.000
some of the burdens and some of the
reasons for the disparities with kids

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.010
 

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.330
okay

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:31.340
okay
 

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:34.960
okay
with adults and we're talking about

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:34.970
with adults and we're talking about
 

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:38.700
with adults and we're talking about
statistics as far as dental sealants

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:38.710
statistics as far as dental sealants
 

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:42.669
statistics as far as dental sealants
less than 40% of African American

compared to 60% of white children
 

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:55.930
compared to 60% of white children
usually receive dental sealants so the

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:55.940
usually receive dental sealants so the
 

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.690
usually receive dental sealants so the
reason that is is mailing do it's a

00:20:58.690 --> 00:20:58.700
reason that is is mailing do it's a
 

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.220
reason that is is mailing do it's a
couple of different reasons of course

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:00.230
couple of different reasons of course
 

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:03.159
couple of different reasons of course
number one sealants are not free and so

00:21:03.159 --> 00:21:03.169
number one sealants are not free and so
 

00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:05.289
number one sealants are not free and so
when you go into the lobe you know two

when you go into the lobe you know two
different barriers like socioeconomic

00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:07.549
different barriers like socioeconomic
 

00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:09.220
different barriers like socioeconomic
status and things like that

just talking about they have the highest
 

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.770
just talking about they have the highest

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.900
incidence of oil and pharyngeal cancer
and by the way United so just diagnosed

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:37.910
and by the way United so just diagnosed
 

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:39.970

three cancers in the last six months all

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:39.980
three cancers in the last six months all
 

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.470
three cancers in the last six months all
three of those were african-american

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:41.480
three of those were african-american
 

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.039
three of those were african-american
males so and I have a diverse population

00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:45.049
males so and I have a diverse population
 

00:21:45.049 --> 00:21:48.820
males so and I have a diverse population
so I look fruits and screen everyone but

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:48.830
so I look fruits and screen everyone but
 

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.169
so I look fruits and screen everyone but
that's just to give you an example of

00:21:50.169 --> 00:21:50.179
that's just to give you an example of
 

00:21:50.179 --> 00:21:53.200
that's just to give you an example of
how prevalent that is with their of

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:53.210
how prevalent that is with their of
 

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:55.330
how prevalent that is with their of
course higher levels of gingivitis and

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:55.340
course higher levels of gingivitis and
 

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.770
course higher levels of gingivitis and
here alone disease we're seeing in

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:56.780
here alone disease we're seeing in
 

00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:58.900
here alone disease we're seeing in
african-americans as reported to white

00:21:58.900 --> 00:21:58.910
african-americans as reported to white
 

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:01.240
african-americans as reported to white
and of course that's the paradigm

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:01.250
and of course that's the paradigm
 

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.530
and of course that's the paradigm
disease that are coming about the

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:02.540
disease that are coming about the
 

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:03.700
disease that are coming about the
gingivitis and that's why I gave that

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:03.710
gingivitis and that's why I gave that
 

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:05.049
gingivitis and that's why I gave that
crash course because I didn't want to

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:05.059
crash course because I didn't want to
 

00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:06.610
crash course because I didn't want to
assume anybody knew what I was talking

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:06.620
assume anybody knew what I was talking

assume anybody knew what I was talking
about when I say it periodontal disease

00:22:08.049 --> 00:22:08.059
about when I say it periodontal disease
 

00:22:08.059 --> 00:22:10.450
about when I say it periodontal disease
because some some people call it area

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:10.460
because some some people call it area
 

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.919
because some some people call it area
some people call it different things so

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:11.929
some people call it different things so
 

00:22:11.929 --> 00:22:13.030
some people call it different things so
I wanted us to be on the same

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:13.040
I wanted us to be on the same
 

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.320
I wanted us to be on the same
terminology with that and like I said

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:16.330
terminology with that and like I said
 

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:18.310
terminology with that and like I said
african-american churches are 40 percent

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320
african-american churches are 40 percent
 

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.669
african-american churches are 40 percent
less likely to have dental sealants

00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679
less likely to have dental sealants
 

00:22:20.679 --> 00:22:24.700
less likely to have dental sealants
employed Hispanic males usually we

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:24.710
employed Hispanic males usually we
 

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:26.710
employed Hispanic males usually we
receive and this kind of confused me

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720
receive and this kind of confused me
 

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.240
receive and this kind of confused me
with this statistic but I say employ

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:28.250
with this statistic but I say employ
 

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.900
with this statistic but I say employ
Hispanic males usually have less than

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:31.910
Hispanic males usually have less than
 

00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:34.870
Hispanic males usually have less than
more care than white but I guess that's

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880
more care than white but I guess that's
 

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.900
more care than white but I guess that's
significant because they're employed and

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:37.910
significant because they're employed and
 

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:39.730
significant because they're employed and
yet they still have less little care

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:39.740
yet they still have less little care
 

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:43.750
yet they still have less little care
then the majority population here okay

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760
then the majority population here okay
 

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:48.340
then the majority population here okay
see so the disparities do exist even

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:48.350
see so the disparities do exist even
 

00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:51.640
see so the disparities do exist even
though we have come a long way with with

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:51.650
though we have come a long way with with
 

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:54.840
though we have come a long way with with
our dentistry and improving the health

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:54.850
our dentistry and improving the health
 

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:57.270
our dentistry and improving the health
but like I said it's just certain

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.280
but like I said it's just certain
 

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.039
but like I said it's just certain
populations that are still being left

00:23:00.039 --> 00:23:00.049
populations that are still being left
 

00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:05.909
populations that are still being left
behind with that so if we talk about the

00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919
behind with that so if we talk about the
 

00:23:05.919 --> 00:23:10.590
behind with that so if we talk about the
barriers now what I'd like to say is it

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600
barriers now what I'd like to say is it
 

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.960
barriers now what I'd like to say is it
in my opinion what is the difference

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:13.970
in my opinion what is the difference
 

00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:16.240
in my opinion what is the difference
between disparities with the rest of the

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:16.250
between disparities with the rest of the
 

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.060
between disparities with the rest of the
medical health its vs. or health the

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:19.070
medical health its vs. or health the
 

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:21.419
medical health its vs. or health the
biggest thing that I see is the biggest

00:23:21.419 --> 00:23:21.429
biggest thing that I see is the biggest
 

00:23:21.429 --> 00:23:25.510
biggest thing that I see is the biggest
barrier to access is what we just said

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520
barrier to access is what we just said
 

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.330
barrier to access is what we just said
insurance coverage because most of your

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:28.340
insurance coverage because most of your
 

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:30.250
insurance coverage because most of your
population and a half some form of

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:30.260
population and a half some form of
 

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.250
population and a half some form of
medical coverage although you see the

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:32.260
medical coverage although you see the
 

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.720
medical coverage although you see the
statistics with that where a lot of the

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:34.730
statistics with that where a lot of the
 

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:35.830
statistics with that where a lot of the
population did not have medical

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840
population did not have medical
 

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:37.899
population did not have medical
insurance as well but what dental

00:23:37.899 --> 00:23:37.909
insurance as well but what dental
 

00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:39.730
insurance as well but what dental
coverage just to give you an example and

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:39.740
coverage just to give you an example and
 

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:42.130
coverage just to give you an example and
some of you all in here may be awareness

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:42.140
some of you all in here may be awareness
 

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.440
some of you all in here may be awareness
for your particular jobs most of the

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:44.450
for your particular jobs most of the
 

00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:46.960
for your particular jobs most of the
time if you have double coverage it

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:46.970
time if you have double coverage it
 

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:50.159
time if you have double coverage it
maxes out at a very low amount per year

00:23:50.159 --> 00:23:50.169
maxes out at a very low amount per year
 

00:23:50.169 --> 00:23:53.769
maxes out at a very low amount per year
okay and so of course my dentistry has

00:23:53.769 --> 00:23:53.779
okay and so of course my dentistry has
 

00:23:53.779 --> 00:23:57.010
okay and so of course my dentistry has
changed so much that is not just taking

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:57.020
changed so much that is not just taking
 

00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.820
changed so much that is not just taking
out teeth you have to do these proxies

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:00.830
out teeth you have to do these proxies

00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159
the time you get your deep cleaning done
 

00:24:10.159 --> 00:24:12.549
the time you get your deep cleaning done
your insurance is next out and you can't

00:24:12.549 --> 00:24:12.559
your insurance is next out and you can't

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.360
get your your fillings done and so if
your I don't enough to have the general

insurance coverage is basically I don't
really even like to call it coverage and

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:24.140
really even like to call it coverage and
 

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.779
really even like to call it coverage and
the general coming out see we just call

00:24:25.779 --> 00:24:25.789
the general coming out see we just call
 

00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:28.269

it a extra benefit and for those who do
 

00:24:28.279 --> 00:24:31.840
it a extra benefit and for those who do
not have any dental coverage at all you

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:31.850
not have any dental coverage at all you
 

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.240
not have any dental coverage at all you
either have to resort to Medicaid and

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:34.250
either have to resort to Medicaid and
 

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.039
either have to resort to Medicaid and
Medicare Medicare doesn't cover

00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:36.049
Medicare Medicare doesn't cover
 

00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:39.070
Medicare Medicare doesn't cover
dentistry so Medicaid is a whole nother

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080
dentistry so Medicaid is a whole nother
 

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.639
dentistry so Medicaid is a whole nother
governmental issue with that so if you

00:24:42.639 --> 00:24:42.649
governmental issue with that so if you
 

00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:46.060
governmental issue with that so if you
have Medicaid they're not paying for all

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:46.070
have Medicaid they're not paying for all
 

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:47.590

the treatment it was adults they're

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600
the treatment it was adults they're
 

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.529
the treatment it was adults they're
paying to have your teeth taken out and

00:24:49.529 --> 00:24:49.539
paying to have your teeth taken out and
 

00:24:49.539 --> 00:24:53.260
paying to have your teeth taken out and
that's basically it there's one group

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:53.270
that's basically it there's one group
 

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:56.080
that's basically it there's one group
with adults that is covered a little bit

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:56.090
with adults that is covered a little bit
 

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.409
with adults that is covered a little bit
more and that's with that's with some

00:24:59.409 --> 00:24:59.419
more and that's with that's with some
 

00:24:59.419 --> 00:25:02.680
more and that's with that's with some
mothers and actually with prenatal

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:02.690
mothers and actually with prenatal
 

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.740
mothers and actually with prenatal
mothers and a reason being is because

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:04.750
mothers and a reason being is because
 

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:09.130
mothers and a reason being is because
the prenatal connection between mothers

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:09.140
the prenatal connection between mothers
 

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.769
the prenatal connection between mothers
and preterm babies and you guys have

00:25:11.769 --> 00:25:11.779
and preterm babies and you guys have
 

00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:12.880
and preterm babies and you guys have
probably heard the research

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:12.890
probably heard the research
 

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.460
probably heard the research
now what happens with that that's one of

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:15.470
now what happens with that that's one of
 

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.700
now what happens with that that's one of
the variants as well because when you're

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:18.710
the variants as well because when you're
 

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.860
the variants as well because when you're
trying to get access to care as a

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:20.870
trying to get access to care as a
 

00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:24.280
trying to get access to care as a
preterm I mean as a expectant mother if

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:24.290
preterm I mean as a expectant mother if
 

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:26.890
preterm I mean as a expectant mother if
you do not get your teeth clean the

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:26.900
you do not get your teeth clean the
 

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.720
you do not get your teeth clean the
bacteria that's in your mouth they form

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:28.730
bacteria that's in your mouth they form
 

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.190

an ingredient that actually initiates
 

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:35.500
an ingredient that actually initiates
later and so that's why you're having a

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:35.510
later and so that's why you're having a
 

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.540
later and so that's why you're having a
preterm labor so there are a lot of

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:37.550
preterm labor so there are a lot of
 

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.300
