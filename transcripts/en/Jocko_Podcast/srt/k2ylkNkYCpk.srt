1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:03,280
I'm a chef in a large operation kitchen.

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,300
I'm second in command overseeing a large
kitchen staff and part of a five person

3
00:00:07,301 --> 00:00:09,820
management team overseeing
thing to entire account.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,590
Recently during my last review I was
given some advice by my boss and his boss.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,080
I'm unsure about my last two annual
reviews have gone very well and I'm on the

6
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:22,000
rise in the company.
However,

7
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,900
they said if it was important
for me to get or heat Harvard,

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,240
they said it was important for me to
give up some of my kitchen dog mentality

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,090
and work to showcase my artistic side
and embrace more of a star role in the

10
00:00:40,091 --> 00:00:44,170
spotlight, get out of the kitchen
a bit more, gain more exposure.

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,750
Specifically with our
high profile clients.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,650
While I appreciate their sentiment and
respect their big management skills,

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:55,710
their style isn't one I strive to emulate
or feel would work for me and the way

14
00:00:56,411 --> 00:00:57,244
I operate.

15
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,590
I've always approached my work is more
of a craft than an art and I've always

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,960
like being a trench dug with my team.

17
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,490
My team responds to it and I get results
for the business and I feel the results

18
00:01:09,491 --> 00:01:14,290
should speak for themselves.
It has propelled my career
rapidly through thus far.

19
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:17,320
So why would I want to change
and be something I'm not?

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Should I heed their advice or stick to
what I do best and keep getting after it

21
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:23,854
on my terms?

22
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:28,600
Ah, it's one of those
questions. It's just funny how,

23
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:31,300
how that last statement is framed,
right?

24
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:36,430
Should I stick to what I do best and
keep getting after it as if to say,

25
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:37,270
if you say no,

26
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:41,950
you should not stick to what you do best
and you should not get after it. Right.

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,430
That's, that's the frame
there. And actually this guy,

28
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,060
I answered the question real tersely.

29
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:51,940
I think this came through Facebook
messages. I, you know, I said, uh,

30
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,540
sounds like you found a comfortable zone
for yourself and you want to stay in

31
00:01:55,541 --> 00:02:00,460
their little cold blooded
response. And he's like, ah,

32
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:04,750
I knew it because as we know
in the comfort zone, there's,

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,310
there was no growth in the comfort zone.

34
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,180
So it's interesting this guy
is actually getting some,

35
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,560
some good solid and straight forward
advice from up the chain of command.

36
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,043
Uh,

37
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,390
plus I think if they have him as more of
a personality than the restaurant will

38
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:24,970
do better and they're trying to build
their reputation and your reputation at

39
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:27,790
the same time. And that seems
pretty reasonable to me. Right.

40
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,490
And I'm not real familiar
with the restaurant business,

41
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,640
but I'm familiar enough to know if you've
got a good reputation with the staff

42
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:37,960
that works at the restaurant.
It brings in more people,

43
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,840
like there's no doubt about
it, the, the relationship,

44
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,010
just like any other business,

45
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:46,540
the relationship that you build
with the customers strengthens them,

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,050
strengthens that relationship and makes
them want to come back for more. Right.

47
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:54,490
That's the way it works. And so
for them to say to you, hey man,

48
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,120
hey, you know, you're a good cook. We
get that, but we need a little bit more.

49
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:02,980
We want a little bit chef. We need
somebody that has, yeah, chef.

50
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,930
Sorry. You're good. Yeah. Yeah.
Sorry. You're a good chef. Well,

51
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:12,910
actually what I think I might've
actually purposely said that like, hey,

52
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:16,060
you're doing a good job
in the kitchen as a cook.

53
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,490
We don't need someone that's
just cooking the food.

54
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:23,010
We need a chef with a reputation
with a personality, right? Yeah.

55
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,310
There's a difference there,
right? Yes sir. So it was
called out for reason. Gotcha.

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,730
He's happy and you can see like kitchen
dog. Yeah. He's proud of that. Right.

57
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,330
And I get that man, I get that. I get
that. Like you're one of the boys,

58
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,480
you're back in the, in
the grind. Well let me,

59
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:43,270
let me ask you this or let
me make this statement.

60
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:47,560
Guess what you have to do as a CEO, as
a CEO leader, guess what you have to do?

61
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,330
You have to build relationships.

62
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,130
You have to make your
commanding officer trust you.

63
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,970
You have to build
relationships with the army.

64
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:57,610
You have to build relationships
with Marine Corps. You have to end.

65
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,010
In order to do that,
you have to like raise your,

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,040
you have to call a little bit of attention
to yourself and raise your hand and

67
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:07,780
say, Hey, this is who I am. You
have to take, this is who I am.

68
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,100
You have to actually have to step into
the spotlight a little bit so that you

69
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,220
can let people know who you are.
Because if people don't know who you are,

70
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,870
how do you have a relationship with you?

71
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,250
And if you don't have relationship with
people, how can they trust you? So, so

72
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,950
that's part of it, right? That's part
of what they're asking you to do. Now,

73
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,320
in all seriousness,
if if you really don't want to do it,

74
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,310
well then you can keep being the guy
that's in the back and guess what?

75
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,090
You're going to be mad in six months
when some other chef gets hired for a

76
00:04:40,091 --> 00:04:43,090
different shift than all of a sudden
he's out making friends with everyone and

77
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:47,110
he gets promoted. And why does it get
promoted? Well, look what the guy's doing,

78
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,940
but he's not as good as,
he's not as good as a cook as I am.

79
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,280
Guess what?
They don't really care.

80
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,270
Being making the food is only
part of what they want you to do.

81
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,290
Just like being a seal. Doing, doing
missions is only part of what they,

82
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,190
what you need to do to do the mission.
You can't just be tactically sound.

83
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:09,700
You've got to have the relationships
built so you can work in the battlespace

84
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,590
that's owned by a conventional commander.

85
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,290
You got to have the
relationship that you can get.

86
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,170
Your mission's approved up the chain of
command on the special operations side.

87
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,610
How do you do that? You build,
you go out, you talk to people,

88
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:26,110
you get out of your comfort zone.
It's a weird thing, you know?

89
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm kind of, I'm kind of
antisocial, right? Like

90
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:36,610
if you don't know me,
we're not going to have a conversation.

91
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,500
You know? Like we're not having
a, I'm like, it's not, I'm not,

92
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:43,780
I'm not walking up and talking
to you if I don't know you.

93
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,820
I'm not walking up and saying hi to you.
It's not happening.

94
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,680
It's not my personality. If
you say hi to me, I'll say hi.

95
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:52,660
I'm not disrespectful,
I'm not rude,

96
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,750
but I'm not looking to have a bunch of
conversations with people and so that's

97
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,084
known to me,

98
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,730
but that's not okay for the
business side of my life, which is,

99
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,880
hey, I got to talk to people
gotta build relationships. Got It.

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,510
To had to know my commanding
officer had to know, the commodore,

101
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,000
had to know the,
the,

102
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,960
the conventional battalion commander
had to know the brigade commander had to

103
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,980
build relationships.

104
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,220
Could I just talk about the
war with the brigade commander?

105
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,773
Well I could,

106
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,130
but what's more powerful that I talk
about war and I talk about where I'm from

107
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:34,760
or where he's from or what,
you know, other things. Yes.

108
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,850
Cause I want to build a relationship with
why? Because I'm trying to build trust.

109
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,990
Wah.
Why?

110
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:42,060
Because I want him to allow me to go out
there and do things in his battle space.

111
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,780
So that's what they're asking you.

112
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:47,300
They're asking you to step
out of your comfort zone.

113
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,900
It doesn't need to become
your primary focus. No.

114
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,920
Should you try and step out of the
comfort zone if you want to grow,

115
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,950
if you want to have more opportunity,
I would give it a try.

116
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,210
I would give it a try. If
not, you know, like I said,

117
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:06,560
if you hate it and you feel like you're
not being true to your true self,

118
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,161
that's okay.

119
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:11,120
Maybe your true self is meant to be the
one that's back not getting promoted.

120
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,010
Yeah. They need somebody to
do that. If it's not you,

121
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,050
it might be somebody else.
Yeah.

122
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,350
So another one of those tough questions
where people, you know, hit me with like,

123
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,243
should I just be,

124
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,700
should I be loyal to myself because the
obvious answer that everyone wants to

125
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,320
hear is like, yeah, dude,
two most important things.

126
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,380
You've got to be loyal to yourself.
That's the most important thing. Okay.

127
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,410
If that's what your priority is,
then that's the most important thing.

128
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,080
But guess what? Who does, uh,

129
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,490
who can take care of the other
kitchen dogs that respect you so much,

130
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,440
who can take better care of them then
you can cause if you get promoted,

131
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,150
if you don't get promoted.
And,

132
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,450
and Johnny Glamour boy gets promoted
because he's likes to go out and Schmooze

133
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,600
the clients and now he gets promoted and
years and now who's going to take care

134
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:04,490
of the kitchen dogs on his, on his
time, right? Not Him. He doesn't care.

135
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,940
He's got, he got promoted not
for taking care of his guys.

136
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:12,710
He got promoted because he smooths the
clients. Play the game a little bit.
