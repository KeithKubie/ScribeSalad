00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Everyone loves a good rags to riches story.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.440
Books and movies and music are full of this
idea.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.380
Whether it’s Gatsby turning himself from a nobody
to a somebody, or Drake starting from the bottom,

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.280
there’s something appealing about the idea that
anyone can make it, if they try hard enough.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.960
And more than maybe anywhere else, that idea is
embraced in the United States, where the mythos of the
land of opportunity is practically part of our foundation.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.460
But is the US a land of opportunity?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.120
Can anyone move up the rungs of the social
ladder?

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.020
Or is the American Dream just that: a dream?

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.720
To get a handle on the answer, we have to
understand changes in social position – or
what sociologists call social mobility.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:46.280
[Theme Music]

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.020
There are a few different types of social mobility,
so let’s get some definitions straight first.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.200
Intragenerational mobility is how a person
moves up or down the social ladder during
their lifetime.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.640
Intergenerational mobility, however, is about
movement in social position across generations.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.430
Are you doing better or worse than your parents
were when they were your age?

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.940
There’s also absolute versus relative mobility.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.240
Absolute mobility is when you move up or
down in absolute terms – are you better or
worse than before?

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.700
Like, if you make $50,000 a year now and made
$40,000 10 years ago, you experienced upward
mobility in an absolute sense.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.440
But what if all your peers who were
making the same amount ten years ago are now
making $65,000 a year?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.580
Yes, you’re still better off than you were
10 years ago, but you’re doing worse relative
to your peers.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.960
Relative mobility is how you move up or down
in social position compared to the rest of society.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.540
We can measure social mobility quantitatively,
using measures of economic mobility, like by comparing
your income to your parent’s income at the same age.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.120
Or we can look at mobility using qualitative
measures.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.380
A common measure used by sociologists
is occupational status.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.240
If your father worked in a blue collar job,
what’s the likelihood that you will too?

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.140
A recent study of absolute intergenerational
mobility found that about one-third of US men will
end up in the same type of job as their fathers,

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.780
compared to about 37% who are upwardly
mobile, and 32% who are downwardly mobile.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.100
It’s pretty common to remain within the
same class group as your parents.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.840
About 80 percent of children experience what’s
called horizontal social mobility,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.820
where they work in a different occupation than their
parents, but remain in a similar social position.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.460
So, how much social mobility is there in the
US?

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.280
Well, there’s good news and bad news.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.000
The good news is that if we zoom out and look
at absolute mobility across the years, the long
term trend in social mobility is upwards.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:35.220
Partially because of industrialization, median annual
family income rose steadily throughout the 20th century,
going from around $34,000 in 1955 to $70,000 in 2015.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.400
Standards of living now are much better than
they were 60 years ago.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.160
Unfortunately, more recent trends in social
mobility have been less rosy.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.880
Since the 1970s, much of the economic growth in
income has been at the top of the income distribution.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.360
Meanwhile, family incomes have been pretty
flat for the rest of the population.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.700
This unequal growth in incomes has meant less
absolute mobility for Americans.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.380
A recent analysis of tax data by a group of
economists and sociologists found that absolute
mobility has declined over the last half century.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:08.320
While 90% of children born in the 1940s
earned more than their parents as adults, only
50% of children born in the 1980s did.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.980
The other bad news is that within a single
generation social mobility is stagnant.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.760
While people generally improve their income
over time by gaining education and skills,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.200
most people stay on the same rung of the social
ladder that they started on.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.020
Of those born in the bottom income quintile,
36% remain in the bottom quintile as adults.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.840
Only 10% of those born at the bottom end up
in the top quintile as adults.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.860
Started at the bottom, now we’re probably
still at the bottom, statistically speaking.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.180
And socioeconomic status is sticky at the
top, too.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.800
Researchers at the Brookings Institution, including
Crash Course Sociology writer Joanna Venator,

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.660
found that 30% of those born in the
top quintile stay in the top quintile as adults.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.440
Plus, social mobility differs by race/ethnicity,
gender, and education.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.300
White Americans see more upward
mobility than Black Americans:

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.420
half of Black Americans that are born at
the bottom of the income distribution are still
in the bottom quintile at age 40.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.960
Black Americans also face higher rates of
downward mobility, being more likely to move out
of the middle class than White Americans:

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.020
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to take a look
at research on race and social mobility in action.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.300
In 1982, American sociologists Karl Alexander
and Doris Entwisle began following the lives

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.700
of a random sample of 800 first grade students
growing up in a variety of neighborhoods in
the Baltimore area.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.080
What began as a study meant to last only three
years eventually ended up lasting 30 years,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.260
as the researchers followed up with the kids
throughout their lives, to see the paths that
their early circumstances put them on.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.500
Alexander and Entwisle collected data on everything
imaginable, interviewing the kids yearly about

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.400
who they lived with, where they lived, work
history, education, drug use, marriage, childbearing,
you name it.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.000
And what they found was that poverty cast a long
shadow over the course of these kids’ lives.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:53.380
45% of kids with higher socioeconomic status,
or SES, had gotten a college degree by age 28 –
only 4% of low SES kids had.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.840
Those born better off were also more likely
to be middle class at age 28.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.250
And these unequal outcomes were heightened
for African American kids.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.900
Low SES white kids ended up better off than
low SES Black kids.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.900
89% of white high school dropouts were
working at age 22 compared to only 40% of black
high school dropouts.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.680
And contrary to what The Wire might have made
you think about inner-city Baltimore lifestyles

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.040
– these differences can’t be explained away
by differences in criminal behavior or drug use.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.340
Low SES White men were more likely to use
hard drugs, smoke, and binge drink than low
SES Black men.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:33.140
And holding all else constant, a police record
was more of an impediment to getting a job
for African American men than White men.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.280
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.100
So, the impacts of where you’re born on the
social ladder can have far reaching consequences.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.300
And in addition to race, social mobility can
also vary by gender.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.100
Over the last half century, women as a whole
have experienced absolute mobility –

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.240
85% of women earn higher wages than
their mothers did.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.800
And the income gap between men and women has
narrowed significantly.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.300
In 1980, the average income for a woman was
60% that of men, whereas by 2015 that gap was 8%.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.360
But despite the great strides over the last half
century, there are still gaps in opportunity for women.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.680
Women born at the bottom of the social class
ladder are more likely to remain there than men –

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.700
about half of women born in the bottom
quintile are still there at age 40 compared
to only about one-third of men.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.640
Also, women born at the bottom experience
more downward mobility than men,

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.280
with more women than men having family
incomes lower than that of their parents.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.240
Some of these differences by gender may be
because women are much more likely to head
up single parent homes than men are.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.400
Being married is a huge plus for social mobility,
because two incomes are better than one.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.460
People who marry tend to accumulate wealth
much faster than those who are single, making
it easier to ascend the social ladder.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.580
Modern-day Cinderella doesn’t just move
up the social ladder by marrying the prince,

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.780
she’s also more likely to build a solid 401K
and stock portfolio, key sources of wealth.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.900
As we’ve seen, social class mobility depends
on where you start and who you are.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.840
So let’s go back to the question we asked
at the beginning is America the land of opportunity?

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.960
If you’re a glass half full kind of person,
you might think so based on some of what
we’ve talked about today.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.380
After all, most people are better off than
past generations were.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:09.080
Accounting for inflation, about three times
as many Americans make incomes above
$100,000 now than did in 1967.

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.080
But not all groups have benefitted equally
from this economic growth –

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:18.740
your chance at upward mobility can vary a
lot by education or race or gender, or where
you start on the income distribution.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.300
For those in the middle of the income distribution,
earnings growth has stalled for many workers,

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.400
but the costs of necessities like healthcare
or housing have climbed ever higher.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.300
Manufacturing, an industry that historically provided
stable jobs and decent pay to less-educated workers,

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.620
has been declining for a while now and was particularly
hard hit by the recession from 2007 to 2009.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:42.900
In the wake of this decline, most of the jobs
available for less-educated workers tend to be
low-paying service industry jobs,

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:46.100
contributing to lower absolute mobility
than we’ve seen in the past.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.520
All of these patterns, plus the growing income
inequality we talked about a couple episodes ago,

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.010
mean that the rungs of the social mobility
ladder in the United States seem to be getting
harder to climb.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:02.320
Today, we talked about intergenerational and
intragenerational mobility and the difference
between absolute and relative mobility.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.600
We talked about the long run upward social
mobility trends in the United States as well as the
recent declines in absolute social mobility.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.460
Then, we touched on how opportunities for
social mobility differ by your class, race, and gender.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:21.660
