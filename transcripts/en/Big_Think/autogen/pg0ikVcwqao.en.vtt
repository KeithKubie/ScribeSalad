a flashbulb memory is a memory that
 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.000
a flashbulb memory is a memory that
forms kind of as though a flash is going

memories of where they were when they
heard about it what they were thinking

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070
heard about it what they were thinking
 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.490
heard about it what they were thinking
doing who they were with what they did

doing who they were with what they did

doing who they were with what they did
next and he found also four other

next and he found also four other
 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.520
next and he found also four other
significant events like the

significant events like the
 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.720

people had formed similar memories and

00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:38.519
people had formed similar memories and
 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:42.569
people had formed similar memories and
he concluded on that basis that highly

he concluded on that basis that highly
significant events sort of imprint

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960
significant events sort of imprint
 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.149
significant events sort of imprint
themselves into your memory and you're

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159
themselves into your memory and you're
 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.549
themselves into your memory and you're
going to always remember them it turns

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559
going to always remember them it turns

going to always remember them it turns
out that and this is kind of a natural

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390
out that and this is kind of a natural
 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.849
out that and this is kind of a natural
belief that this is this shouldn't

belief that this is this shouldn't
 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.040

surprise us for example we all probably
 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.389
surprise us for example we all probably
have a pretty good idea where we were

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399
have a pretty good idea where we were
 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.799
have a pretty good idea where we were
when we heard about the terrorist

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809
when we heard about the terrorist
 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.739
when we heard about the terrorist
attacks on September 11 2001 I have a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:00:58.749
attacks on September 11 2001 I have a
 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.419
attacks on September 11 2001 I have a
good memory of it I actually heard about

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429
good memory of it I actually heard about
 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:01.919
good memory of it I actually heard about
on the Howard Stern Show of all places

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929
on the Howard Stern Show of all places

when I woke up I was in graduate school

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579
when I woke up I was in graduate school
 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.969
when I woke up I was in graduate school
so I woke up late those days and I

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979
so I woke up late those days and I
 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.080
so I woke up late those days and I
actually tuned in the Howard Stern Show

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090
actually tuned in the Howard Stern Show
 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.760
actually tuned in the Howard Stern Show
and that's how I found out about it at

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770
and that's how I found out about it at
 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.109
and that's how I found out about it at
least I think that's how I found out

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119
least I think that's how I found out
 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.580
least I think that's how I found out
about it that's how I remember it when

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590
about it that's how I remember it when
 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.020
about it that's how I remember it when
people have actually done clever studies

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030
people have actually done clever studies
 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.179
people have actually done clever studies

went to a class full of students and had

went to a class full of students and had
 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.149
went to a class full of students and had
them write down all this information

them write down all this information
 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.700

they heard about it and so on and then

they heard about it and so on and then
 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.080
they heard about it and so on and then
followed up several years later before

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090
followed up several years later before
 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.240
followed up several years later before
they graduated college and had them

they graduated college and had them

they graduated college and had them
recall it again found out that their

recall it again found out that their
 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.529
recall it again found out that their
recall years later did not really match

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539
recall years later did not really match
 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.179
recall years later did not really match
what they had written down the day after

what they had written down the day after
 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.249
what they had written down the day after
but their confidence was extremely high

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259
but their confidence was extremely high
 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.630
but their confidence was extremely high
they were sure that that's exactly how

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640
they were sure that that's exactly how
 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.800
they were sure that that's exactly how
they remembered if they had no doubt

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810
they remembered if they had no doubt
 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.060
they remembered if they had no doubt
whereas of course they couldn't tell you

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070
whereas of course they couldn't tell you
 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.169
whereas of course they couldn't tell you
what they were doing the day before the

what they were doing the day before the
 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.550
what they were doing the day before the

Challenger exploded to the day after the
 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.919
Challenger exploded to the day after the
Challenger exploded just like all of us

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929
Challenger exploded just like all of us
 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.029
Challenger exploded just like all of us
probably have no memory of what was

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039
probably have no memory of what was
 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.960
probably have no memory of what was
going on in September 10 2001 so the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970
going on in September 10 2001 so the
 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.250
going on in September 10 2001 so the
thing about flashbulb memories that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260
thing about flashbulb memories that
 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.420
thing about flashbulb memories that
really makes them

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
really makes them
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.200
really makes them
sort of

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210
sort of
 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.720
sort of
deceptive is that there no more accurate

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730
deceptive is that there no more accurate
 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.670
deceptive is that there no more accurate
than ordinary memories they're subject

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
than ordinary memories they're subject
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.930
than ordinary memories they're subject
to the same kind of distortions that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940
to the same kind of distortions that
 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.220
to the same kind of distortions that
just happened in time to all of our

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230
just happened in time to all of our
 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.680
just happened in time to all of our
memories but we're more confident in

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690
memories but we're more confident in
 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.300
memories but we're more confident in
them because they're so vivid and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310
them because they're so vivid and
 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.730
them because they're so vivid and
they're so detailed and we sort of place

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740
they're so detailed and we sort of place
 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.320
they're so detailed and we sort of place
really unwarranted faith in them

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330
 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.250
um memory is not a complete fraud we do

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260
um memory is not a complete fraud we do
 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.660
um memory is not a complete fraud we do
remember some things it's not as though

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670
remember some things it's not as though
 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.010
remember some things it's not as though
everything in our memory is a distortion

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020
everything in our memory is a distortion
 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.440
everything in our memory is a distortion
and inaccurate and so on one thing

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450
and inaccurate and so on one thing
 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.700
and inaccurate and so on one thing
that's been learned from a lot of

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710
that's been learned from a lot of
 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.550
that's been learned from a lot of
research on memory over decades is that

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560
research on memory over decades is that
 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.760
research on memory over decades is that
memory for the gist of something for the

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770
memory for the gist of something for the
 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.790
memory for the gist of something for the
main idea is much better than memory for

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800
main idea is much better than memory for
 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.250
main idea is much better than memory for
specific details memory for details can

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260
specific details memory for details can
 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.280
specific details memory for details can
change and fade over time memory for

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290
change and fade over time memory for
 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.250
change and fade over time memory for
sort of main ideas themes emotional

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260
sort of main ideas themes emotional
 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.680
sort of main ideas themes emotional
experiences probably nobody really

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690
experiences probably nobody really
 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.270

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820
remember where they were who told who
 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.850
remember where they were who told who
told him about it and details like that

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860
told him about it and details like that
 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.110
told him about it and details like that
especially the farther away they are

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120
especially the farther away they are
 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.570
especially the farther away they are
from the epicenter of events but they're

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580
from the epicenter of events but they're
 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.070
from the epicenter of events but they're
not going to forget how they felt on

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080
not going to forget how they felt on
 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.949
not going to forget how they felt on
that day as easily so sort of the

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959
that day as easily so sort of the
 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.580
that day as easily so sort of the
overall message often comes through but

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590
overall message often comes through but
 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.770
overall message often comes through but
the details can change and fade over

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780
the details can change and fade over
 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.180
the details can change and fade over
time the problem of course is that we

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190
time the problem of course is that we
 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.980
time the problem of course is that we
don't realize that so we can get into

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990
don't realize that so we can get into
 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.570
don't realize that so we can get into
big arguments over the details of

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580
big arguments over the details of
 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.090
big arguments over the details of
memories who said what to whom when did

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100
memories who said what to whom when did
 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.640
memories who said what to whom when did
they say it exactly you know what was

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650
they say it exactly you know what was
 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.900
they say it exactly you know what was
said before that what we said after that

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910
said before that what we said after that
 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.370
said before that what we said after that
think about how many arguments you've

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380
think about how many arguments you've
 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.229
think about how many arguments you've
gotten into over the course of your life

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239
gotten into over the course of your life
 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.240
gotten into over the course of your life
where that's what's going on and those

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250
where that's what's going on and those
 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.530
where that's what's going on and those
are kind of silly arguments because

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540
are kind of silly arguments because
 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.880
are kind of silly arguments because
nobody can really trust their memory as

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890
nobody can really trust their memory as
 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.320
nobody can really trust their memory as
much as they claim to in the heat of the

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330
much as they claim to in the heat of the
 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.250
much as they claim to in the heat of the
moment

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260
 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.920
a surprising fact about memory is that

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
a surprising fact about memory is that
 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.380
a surprising fact about memory is that
our memories can be pretty weak even for

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390
our memories can be pretty weak even for
 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.789
our memories can be pretty weak even for
things that just happened a couple of

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799
things that just happened a couple of
 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.059
things that just happened a couple of
seconds ago and really a time frame when

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069
seconds ago and really a time frame when
 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.050
seconds ago and really a time frame when
you would think that memory should be

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060
you would think that memory should be
 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.160
you would think that memory should be
pretty good it's one thing for memory to

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170
pretty good it's one thing for memory to
 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.929
pretty good it's one thing for memory to
fade after a few years but it's another

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939
fade after a few years but it's another
 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.190
fade after a few years but it's another
thing for it to get completely erased

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200
thing for it to get completely erased
 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.110
thing for it to get completely erased
after a couple of seconds and a great

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120
after a couple of seconds and a great
 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.140
after a couple of seconds and a great
example of how this can happen is shown

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150
example of how this can happen is shown
 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.059
example of how this can happen is shown
in films every day every movie that you

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069
in films every day every movie that you
 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.949
in films every day every movie that you
watch has what are called continuity

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959
watch has what are called continuity
 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.270
watch has what are called continuity
errors and they're catalogs of these on

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280
errors and they're catalogs of these on
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.159
errors and they're catalogs of these on
the web you can go and type in any movie

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169
the web you can go and type in any movie
 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.569

name you want and find all the mistakes

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579
name you want and find all the mistakes

that the film editors made now sometimes

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489
that the film editors made now sometimes
 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.469
that the film editors made now sometimes
they realize they were making those

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479
they realize they were making those
 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.300
they realize they were making those
mistakes but they knew that most people

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310
mistakes but they knew that most people
 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.830
mistakes but they knew that most people
wouldn't see them and in fact when you

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840
wouldn't see them and in fact when you
 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.270
wouldn't see them and in fact when you
watch movies you hardly ever notice a

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280
watch movies you hardly ever notice a
 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.350
watch movies you hardly ever notice a
continuity error because you're paying

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360
continuity error because you're paying
 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.210
continuity error because you're paying
attention to the plot and the action and

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220
attention to the plot and the action and
 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.409
attention to the plot and the action and
the characters and so on and you don't

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419
the characters and so on and you don't
 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.939
the characters and so on and you don't
notice that for example in The Godfather

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949
notice that for example in The Godfather
 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.219
notice that for example in The Godfather
there's a glass of wine on the table in

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229
there's a glass of wine on the table in
 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.629
there's a glass of wine on the table in
one scene and then when the camera comes

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639
one scene and then when the camera comes
 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.100
one scene and then when the camera comes
back to it it's gone and then when the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110
back to it it's gone and then when the
 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.779
back to it it's gone and then when the
camera comes back again it's back again

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789
camera comes back again it's back again
 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:39.770
camera comes back again it's back again
um

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780
um
 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.390
um
but those are really sort of failures of

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400
but those are really sort of failures of
 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.340
but those are really sort of failures of
memory you looked at that scene and you

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350
memory you looked at that scene and you
 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.810
memory you looked at that scene and you
felt like you were taking it all in and

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820
felt like you were taking it all in and
 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.730
felt like you were taking it all in and
then when you came back to it from a

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740
then when you came back to it from a
 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.260
then when you came back to it from a
different camera angle or after a cut

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270
different camera angle or after a cut
 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.840
different camera angle or after a cut
you didn't bother to match up your

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850
you didn't bother to match up your
 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.879
you didn't bother to match up your
previous memory to what was then on the

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889
previous memory to what was then on the
 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:54.350
previous memory to what was then on the
screen afterwards or you didn't even

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360
screen afterwards or you didn't even
 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.670
screen afterwards or you didn't even
store as much detail about it in the

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680
store as much detail about it in the
 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.140
store as much detail about it in the
first place as you thought you did you

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150
first place as you thought you did you
 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.430
first place as you thought you did you
might not have actually even stored the

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440
might not have actually even stored the
 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:59.629
might not have actually even stored the
information about the wine glass even

00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639
information about the wine glass even
 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.430
information about the wine glass even
though he paid attention to it at the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440
though he paid attention to it at the
 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.870
though he paid attention to it at the
time so it's one thing to pay attention

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880
time so it's one thing to pay attention
 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.700
time so it's one thing to pay attention
to things and notice them but it's a

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710
to things and notice them but it's a
 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:05.659
to things and notice them but it's a
whole other thing to actually get them

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669
whole other thing to actually get them
 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.400
whole other thing to actually get them
into memory and this phenomenon of

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410
into memory and this phenomenon of
 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.719
into memory and this phenomenon of
continuity errors and how many changes

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729
continuity errors and how many changes
 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.390
continuity errors and how many changes
we can miss as a video cuts from one

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400
we can miss as a video cuts from one
 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.670
we can miss as a video cuts from one
angle to the other from one scene back

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680
angle to the other from one scene back
 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.279
angle to the other from one scene back
to another illustrates another aspect of

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289
to another illustrates another aspect of
 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.039
to another illustrates another aspect of
the illusion of memory
