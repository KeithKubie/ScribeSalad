00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.140
What is a plot hole?

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.770
It's a gap or an inconsistency in a storyline
that goes against the flow of logic established

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.470
by the story's plot.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.730
These can include illogical or impossible
events, and statements or events that contradict

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.420
earlier events in the storyline.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.920
Frankly, television is teaming with them - even
the most popular shows on the small screen

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.340
- and, in this video, we're going to run you
through just a few of them.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.970
Here are ten plot holes in the biggest TV
shows that went unnoticed.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.089
Sheldon's Financial Situation - The Big Bang
Theory

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:45.310
In The Big Bang Theory's season one episode
The Dumpling Paradox, Sheldon Cooper makes

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.150
a reference to his financial status by saying
to Leonard "Frankly, if I could afford the

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.340
rent, I'd ask you to leave," which explicitly
means he can't pay the rent on his apartment

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.340
by himself.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.710
However, in season three's The Execlsior Acquisition,
it's shown that he's so well-off that he doesn't

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.299
even cash his pay cheques, he just leaves
them in a drawer in his desk.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.210
Moreover, in season two's The Financial Permeability,
he lends Penny a large amount of money from

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.790
a huge stash he just happens to have lying
around, so he's obviously independently wealthy.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.820
Which one is it, Big Bang writers?

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.530
Is Sheldon hard-up or rich?!

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.470
Olaf's Hammer - Buffy the Vampire Slayer
The character of Olaf the Troll was introduced

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.980
in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer fifth season
episode Triangle.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.000
In that episode, it was established that he
was a former lover of Anya's, whom she had

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.910
punished for his unfaithfulness by turning
him into a troll.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.300
Later that season, when Buffy went to fight
Glory, she used Olaf's hammer to do so - with

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.690
the reason being that, to fight a god, you
should use a god's weapon.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.560
At no point previously had Olaf been referred
to as a god - and, given that his troll form

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.320
was actually a curse, it makes no sense whatsoever
to have described him as one.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.961
The Friends' Ages - Friends
There were so many inconsistencies with the

00:01:53.961 --> 00:01:59.120
main characters' ages in classic sitcom Friends
- and it's an issue that has now come to irk

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.130
fans of the show.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.260
For example, when Ross first told Joey when
his birthday was, he said it’s in December,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.120
but a few seasons later he claims it’s October
18th.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.120
He was also 29-years-old for three seasons
of the show, despite going through several

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.370
Christmas and other Holiday episodes.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.810
He wasn't the only one with age problems,
however.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.040
In the episode The One Where They All Turn
30, the cast celebrate Rachel’s birthday,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.290
and she's the last one to hit the milestone
- yet Joey is actually established as the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.290
youngest.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.390
For instance, in the early episode The One
with The Birth, he said he was 25, while Rachel

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.819
and Monica were both already 26.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.150
Quagmire's Age - Family Guy
By its very nature, Seth MacFarlane's brilliant

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.819
Family Guy is inconsistent and silly, so a
lot of it doesn't make sense - but there's

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.629
one particular issue that can only be described
as a plot hole; Glenn Quagmire's age.

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.150
According to his driver's license in the epsiode
FOX-y Lady, Quagmire is 61-years-old and puts

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.279
his youthful appearance down to eating carrots.

00:02:54.279 --> 00:03:00.469
However, he recounts a "youthful" sexual encounter
with Tracey Bellings in 1986 in A Fistful

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:05.120
of Meg, and he was at a school dance in 1984
in Meet the Quagmires.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.689
Quagmire being so young in those years would
mean he couldn't possibly be 61 - especially

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.780
given that he was at the school dance with
Peter and Lois, who are both in their 40s.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.900
The House Homer Grew Up In - The Simpsons
Like Family Guy, you'd be foolish to go overboard

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.999
with your criticism of plot holes in The Simpsons,
as it's just a fun animation for all the family.

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:26.269
However, there are some that can't be ignored.

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.040
In the episode E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt), Homer
and his family flee to the farmhouse where

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040
he grew up.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.769
However, Homer and Grandpa had accidentally
burned the house down in the earlier episode

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.800
Grandpa vs. Sexual Inadequacy.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.629
Inexplicably, the house is still standing
when the family arrive.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.870
Moreover, when Homer can't grow any food there,
a neighbouring farmer tells him that's why

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.010
Grandpa Simpson abandoned the place, but in
Grandpa vs. Sexual Inadequacy, Abe said he

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.709
left because the cows started giving sour
milk.

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.499
David's Fireworks Party - Coronation Street
We now come to Great Britain's most popular

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:04.150
soap opera - Coronation Street - which has
been running on ITV for no less than 56 years.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.249
Even with that amount of production experience,
the writers still get things wrong.

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:10.290
Take David Platt's 2016 character arc, for
example.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.220
When David tried to commit suicide, he accidentally
set his neighbour Anna Windass on fire - and

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.770
she ended up in hospital with serious burns.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.580
David was distraught and disappeared for a
few weeks but, when he returned to the screen,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.690
guess what he did first?

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.780
He planned a huge fireworks party for his
kids!

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.690
That's such an out-of-character act that it
has to be described as a plot hole - and poor

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.510
writing and forgetfulness on the part of the
writers.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.230
The Doctor's Regenerations - Doctor Who
It is a long-established fact in the Doctor

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.190
Who canon - or the Whoniverse, as it's known
- that the titular Doctor can only use his

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.280
regeneration ability thirteen times.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.620
This has now proven to be problematic, however.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.920
Although there have only been twelve official
Doctors - meaning he's only used eleven of

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.590
his regenerations on himself - the Doctor
has also used his regenerations to heal his

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.850
friends over the years.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.160
Frankly, therefore, he should have run out
of them long ago.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.600
Yet he's still going - and there's no sign
of the show slowing down, so we'll undoubtedly

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.540
get a thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth
Doctor, and so on.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.990
Why Did Nobody Notice They Were Missing?

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.150
- Mighty Morphin Power Rangers
In 1993, the world was introduced to the Mighty

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.440
Morphin Power Rangers - a group of teenagers
recruited by the wizard Zordon and his robot

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.600
assistant Alpha 5 to protect the Earth - and
there was a recurring plot hole that basically

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.920
happened in every single episode.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.030
More often than not, the Power Rangers were
contacted at school to report for duty, and

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.510
they would teleport to Zordon at his command
center.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.290
At no point, however, did their school's faculty
notice that their star pupils were missing

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.290
classes.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.690
It was never questioned or even addressed,
even though it happened all the time.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.360
Warp 10 Irregularities - Star Trek
Star Trek has been around in various forms

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.950
since 1966, but there's one thing that the
writers of the TV shows can't seem to agree

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.900
on, which has resulted in a plot hole - and
that's the idea of travelling at the speed

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.900
of warp 10.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.440
In the original 1966 series and Star Trek
the Next Generation, the Enterprise reached

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.800
warp 10 on several occasions - and all that
resulted in was the ship travelling faster

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.800
than normal.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.320
However, in the Voyager episode Threshold,
Tom Paris achieves warp 10 and is described

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.410
as being the first human ever to have done
so.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:20.030
Moreover, the ship doesn't just go faster
- Paris is also described as existing at every

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.390
point in the universe at that speed (something
that wasn't declared previously).

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.090
Michonne's Walkers - The Walking Dead
When viewers were first introduced to the

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.980
now established character of Michonne - played
by Danai Gurira - in AMC's brilliant The Walking

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.070
Dead, the character was accompanied by two
shackled walkers, who have been revealed to

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.800
be her reanimated boyfriend and his best friend.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.150
She used them for camouflage and was able
to walk amongst other walkers because of their

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.290
presence next to her.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:45.630
But why?

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.850
It is established that walkers can smell living
humans and there's no viable explanation as

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:54.410
to why Michonne would be able to avoid detection
just because she had two of them next to her.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.320
