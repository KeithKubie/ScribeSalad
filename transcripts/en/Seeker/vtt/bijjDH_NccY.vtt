Happy birthday DNews, Trace here!

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:11.940
I think my favorite episode of DNews might
be the time I got to go to the North Pole,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:12.940
that's pretty awesome.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.129
And go inside the seed vault.

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.369
And then go to The Large Hadron Collider all
in one trip.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:17.369
That was crazy!

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.539
2016 phew what a year!

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:21.720
Happy birthday Dnews!

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.590
I may not be your host anymore but that doesn't
mean I can't still learn from you.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.460
Episodes like Should You Drink a Bottle Of
Wine A Day?, Is Smoking Weed While Pregnant

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.570
Dangerous?, and The Four Weirdest Animal Penises
remind me why I subscribe to you in the first

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.570
place.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.739
So happy 4th birthday and here's to 4 more
years of hard hitting scientific investigative

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.739
journalism.

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.010
I miss you guys.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.870
Happy birthday, DNews!

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.329
My favorite thing about being on this show
is when we bring up a topic, some people have

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.800
never even thought about and they get really
excited to learn about it.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.760
That's the best part.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.570
That and when people react to all the jokes
I put in my videos.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.910
You know what happens when you hold your pee?

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.519
Urine trouble!

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.320
Who is writing these?!

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.480
Okay that's the best part.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.580
And then educating people is, is like, is
a close number two.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.900
Happy birthday DNews!

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.900
Thanks for being born.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.820
I hope you're having a wonderful day and I
think my favorite episode was... did Anthony

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.390
Carboni drink breast milk once on camera?

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.400
And I'm not totally sure why.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.140
But I'm sure there was a very scientifically
valid reason for it.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.140
Thanks DNews!

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.840
Happy birthday DNews!

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.390
Congrats on 4 years.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.190
Probably one of my favorite times hosting
on DNews was doing that sex space gecko episode

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.190
with Trace.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.880
So congrats on four years, here's to at least
another 4!

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.790
Happy birthday DNews from New York City where
it's raining and I can't thinking about Trace's

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.570
episode on acid rain.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.320
Kinda forgot about acid rain but now I want
to know how much sulfuric acid's landing on

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.320
my head!

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.700
Hey guys, Jules here, wishing DNews a very
happy 4th birthday.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.170
It's a huge milestone.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.780
So my favorite thing about working on this
show, by far, is you guys, the commenters,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.929
who are so quick to pick up on all the little
jokes, all the little, even the little mistakes.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.959
My beard, my mustache; lot of comments about
those.

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.030
And I love them.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.030
Keep them coming.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.950
Keep being you and we'll keep being us and
making fun, informative videos.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.030
Oh hi there, DNews, it's Natalia.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.260
I wanna wish you happy fourth anniversary!

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.110
And what's my favorite time or moment at Discovery?

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.710
Well, that would have to be, an episode I
did about race.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.270
I was also able to talk about the work of
a good friend and biological anthropologist,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.650
Dr. Robert Sussman, who has unfortunately
passed away this year.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.980
So I'm honored to have been able to cover
such a controversial subject but also featuring

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.569
the work of a prominent scholar, friend and
anthropologist, Dr. Bob Sussman, so thank

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.569
you.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.210
Hey guys, it's Amy and by far my favorite
moment of my time with DNews.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.350
two and a half years now, is when Trace and
I blew up that pie for Thanksgiving.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.180
Because A. I was not expecting the flame to
get that big and B. I'm the smart one.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.272
I ran from the fire and Trace is the dumb
one who stayed and watched it and then he

00:03:06.272 --> 00:03:07.272
had to pull me back into the shot.

00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:11.860
That was the first, my first DNews field trip
and that was so much fun!

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.170
Happy 4th birthday DNews!

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.890
I'm so proud to have been on this show for
three of those four years and I hope we have

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.800
many happy years together.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.800
Happy birthday DNews!

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.590
It's been an amazing 4 years of science communication
and I've been privileged to be doing videos

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.060
with you now for the last 3 years and if I
remember back to my first video.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.170
That was with Trace and we were talking about
gravitational waves.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.010
I wasn't very good and that's when I realized
we got some really, really good editors on

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.010
the team.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.540
So thank you DNews, thank you to all the team,
to all the producers and all the hosts for

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.190
making my time with DNews a fun time.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.610
I'm looking forward to the next four years
of awesome science videos.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:04:10.290
Take care.
