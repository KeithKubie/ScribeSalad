00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790
one of the biggest barriers in making

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800
one of the biggest barriers in making
 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.160
one of the biggest barriers in making
computers faster is how much power they

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170
computers faster is how much power they
 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.099
computers faster is how much power they
consume and in fact one thing that

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109
consume and in fact one thing that
 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.600
consume and in fact one thing that
stopped your computer from having a

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
stopped your computer from having a
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.370
stopped your computer from having a
faster clock rate where it used to be it

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380
faster clock rate where it used to be it
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.560
faster clock rate where it used to be it
was another gigahertz every year you

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
was another gigahertz every year you
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.200
was another gigahertz every year you
double that clock rate is that that

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210
double that clock rate is that that
 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.090
double that clock rate is that that
requires a lot of energy and it's so

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
requires a lot of energy and it's so
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.950
requires a lot of energy and it's so
much that your chips would melt if we

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
much that your chips would melt if we
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.480
much that your chips would melt if we
ran them a lot faster and if you look

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490
ran them a lot faster and if you look
 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.550
ran them a lot faster and if you look
inside a modern desktop computer you've

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560
inside a modern desktop computer you've
 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.099
inside a modern desktop computer you've
probably seen it's got a big tower with

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109
probably seen it's got a big tower with
 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.929
probably seen it's got a big tower with
silver veins and fan blowing on it

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
silver veins and fan blowing on it
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.849
silver veins and fan blowing on it
that's to get all that heat out and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
that's to get all that heat out and
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.679
that's to get all that heat out and
that's making it hard to make the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
that's making it hard to make the
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.810
that's making it hard to make the
desktop computers faster in your pocket

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
desktop computers faster in your pocket
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.880
desktop computers faster in your pocket
you're limited by what the battery can

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890
you're limited by what the battery can
 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.580
you're limited by what the battery can
do and we have had better battery

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590
do and we have had better battery
 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.590
do and we have had better battery
chemistries over time but again this is

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600
chemistries over time but again this is
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.970
chemistries over time but again this is
an area where breakthroughs are needed

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
an area where breakthroughs are needed
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.420
an area where breakthroughs are needed
for cars as well as for devices we have

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
for cars as well as for devices we have
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.000
for cars as well as for devices we have
in our pockets and even for storing

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010
in our pockets and even for storing
 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.440
in our pockets and even for storing
power that's generated from the power

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450
power that's generated from the power
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.750
power that's generated from the power
grid we really would love to switch to

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
grid we really would love to switch to
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.720
grid we really would love to switch to
renewable power like solar and wind but

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730
renewable power like solar and wind but
 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.369
renewable power like solar and wind but
the problem is that these only come when

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379
the problem is that these only come when
 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.569
the problem is that these only come when
the sun is shining or the wind is

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579
the sun is shining or the wind is
 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.610
the sun is shining or the wind is
blowing and so you need to store the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
blowing and so you need to store the
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410
blowing and so you need to store the
power to use at a later time and that's

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
power to use at a later time and that's
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.479
power to use at a later time and that's
actually a pretty difficult challenge

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
actually a pretty difficult challenge
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.310
actually a pretty difficult challenge
batteries are one potential way to do it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
batteries are one potential way to do it
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.230
batteries are one potential way to do it
pumping water uphill is a way to do it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
pumping water uphill is a way to do it
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.149
pumping water uphill is a way to do it
if you have reservoirs but that itself

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159
if you have reservoirs but that itself
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.190
if you have reservoirs but that itself
presents its own challenge now when you

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
presents its own challenge now when you
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.929
presents its own challenge now when you
get down to the battery you've probably

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939
get down to the battery you've probably
 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.670
get down to the battery you've probably
if you've ever looked inside a modern

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
if you've ever looked inside a modern
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.020
if you've ever looked inside a modern
phone that is if you have one you can

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030
phone that is if you have one you can
 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330
phone that is if you have one you can
open anymore you've probably seen that

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
open anymore you've probably seen that
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.070
open anymore you've probably seen that
most of that phone is actually the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080
most of that phone is actually the
 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.230
most of that phone is actually the
battery that's the thing which is giving

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
battery that's the thing which is giving
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.850
battery that's the thing which is giving
you all the weight it's the thing that

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
you all the weight it's the thing that
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.100
you all the weight it's the thing that
makes an iPad hard to hold in your hands

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
makes an iPad hard to hold in your hands
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.859
makes an iPad hard to hold in your hands
because it's got a big heavy battery we

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
because it's got a big heavy battery we
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.330
because it's got a big heavy battery we
would love to see improvement in that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
would love to see improvement in that
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.640
would love to see improvement in that
there are lots of things in the lab but

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
there are lots of things in the lab but
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.010
there are lots of things in the lab but
there's a pretty important rule that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
there's a pretty important rule that
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.990
there's a pretty important rule that
people have come to understand when

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000
people have come to understand when
 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.730
people have come to understand when
someone tells you I can do this in the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
someone tells you I can do this in the
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.039
someone tells you I can do this in the
lab I can make it for a dollar a

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
lab I can make it for a dollar a
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870
lab I can make it for a dollar a
kilogram or whatever it is the price

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
kilogram or whatever it is the price

answer says okay I'll order a bunch and
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.999
answer says okay I'll order a bunch and
then they'll wait I can't actually

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
then they'll wait I can't actually
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.510
then they'll wait I can't actually
deliver them to you so you have to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520
deliver them to you so you have to
 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.490
deliver them to you so you have to
really make it commercialize before you

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
really make it commercialize before you
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.380
really make it commercialize before you
can say you have it and that hasn't

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390
can say you have it and that hasn't
