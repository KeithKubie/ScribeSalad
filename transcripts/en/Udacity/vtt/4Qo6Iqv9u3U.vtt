00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.670
David, which one of these do
you think are AI problems?

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.180
&gt;&gt; Science has said that all
of these are AI problems.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.070
All of these are things that we
humans do on a fairly regular basis.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.590
And if the goal of
artificial intelligence is

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.370
to recreate human intelligence,
then it seems like we need to be able

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.780
to design agents that can
do any of these things.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.890
&gt;&gt; I agree.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.560
In fact,
during this class we'll design AI agents

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.630
that can address each of these problems.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.250
For now,
let us just focus on the first one.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.070
How to design an AI agent that
can answer Jeopardy questions.
