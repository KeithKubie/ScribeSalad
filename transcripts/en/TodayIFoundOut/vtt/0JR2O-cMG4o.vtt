00:00:27.880 --> 00:01:07.350
question-markThe earliest writings, which
were syllabic and/or logographic (think Mayan

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.930
and Chinese), had no need for either spacing
or punctuation, as each word was typically

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.940
self-contained in the symbol.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.290
However, as previously demonstrated, the lack
of punctuation and spacing in alphabetic writing

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.380
made comprehension difficult; so hard, in
fact, that in ancient Greece it was a rare

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.890
feat for an individual to understand a text
they were reading the first time through and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.930
the idea of reading out-loud to a group without
extensive practice beforehand was also not

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.470
something typically done.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.200
Nonetheless, a few notable exceptions aside,
punctuation in the West didn’t really appear

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.549
until about the end of the 3rd century BC
when Aristophanes of Byzantium, head librarian

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:51.210
at the Library of Alexandria (see: What Really
Happened to the Library of Alexandria?), introduced

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.229
the precursors of today’s punctuation marks.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.750
He suggested inserting dots to indicate where
a passage ended and the length of pause needed

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.740
when speaking a text (useful in aiding knowing
how much breath was needed for the following

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.740
passage).

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.659
This convention subsequently began to appear
in various Greek works and became, to some

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.410
degree, relatively standardized.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.360
Interestingly, the Greek words that came to
be our comma, colon and period were not describing

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.260
their dotted punctuation marks themselves,
but rather the length of the piece of text

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.260
that was being set apart, to wit: a low mark
(hypostigme) denoted a “unit smaller than

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.349
a clause,” which was known as a komma; a
mid-high mark (stigma mese) distinguished

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.079
a clause or kolon; and a high mark (stigma
teleia) denoted an entire sentence, known

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.629
as a periodos.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.739
The Greeks also introduced a mark to distinguish
paragraphs (paragraphos or gamma), and set

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.079
off quotations with diples.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:44.099
Not everyone was a fan of these marks.

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.040
Given that their entire purpose was not syntactical
but, rather, elocutionary, many, like the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.859
famous Roman orator Cicero (106-43 BC), scorned
such punctuation, noting things like when

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.319
and how long to pause for breath “ought
to be determined not… by a stroke interposed

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.030
by a copyist, but by the constraint of the
rhythm.”[1]

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.900
Thanks to the influence of the Romans, the
punctuation introduced by the Greeks languished

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.370
as the oral tradition of Rome dominated.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.780
However, once Christianity began to spread
across Europe via written texts, its scribes

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.069
began punctuating again in order to try to
preserve the original meaning of the Word.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.750
(As Lynne Truss famously notes, there is a
big difference between “eats, shoots &amp; leaves”

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.340
and “eats shoots and leaves.”)

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.669
In addition, by the 7th and 8th centuries,
spaces between words were becoming more common

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.370
(and are said to have been invented, or at
least popularized, by Irish and Scottish monks

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.930
of this era who were tired of wrestling with
separating unfamiliar Latin words).

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.230
At the end of the 8th century, Charlemagne
is generally credited with the introduction

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.890
of lowercase letters after requesting that
the monk Alcuin develop a unified alphabet,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.409
which ultimately included these.

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:55.409

Aristotle printed by Aldus Manutius

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.480
With the rise of the printing press a few
centuries later, the numerous conventions

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.629
(and symbols) used in punctuation became a
bit of a problem for printers, something that

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.489
had not been as much of an issue when things
were simply written by hand.

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.310
Enter Aldus Pius Manutius, a prominent Italian
publisher and printer of the 15th century

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.620
who, besides famously introducing “pocket
editions” of Greek and Roman classic works

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.590
meant for mass consumption and relatively
inexpensive to purchase, also seems to have

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.940
been the first typographer to use the comma
and semicolon.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.620
(He also helped develop italic type with the
help of Venetian punch-cutter Francesco Griffo.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.590
Interestingly, Griffo seems to have met an
untimely end after he beat his son-in-law

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.880
to death with an iron bar and is presumed
to have been executed for this crime- after

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.470
being charged with this murder, there is no
further record of him.)

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.650
Aldus’ grandson, Aldo Manutius the Younger
(1547-1597) took over the family printing

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.030
business at the age of just 14.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.820
Not long after, he codified the modern, standardized
use of comma, colon and period, publishing

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.400
a book on the subject in the early 1560s called
Orthographiae ratio (A System of Orthography).

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.970
In the book, Aldo built on the ancient Greeks’
minimal punctuation marks and designated that

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.090
the comma would separate phrases and clauses,
the colon would be used for lists, and the

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.970
“full point” (read: period) would denote
the end of the sentence.

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.560
Aldo also explained the uses of other basic
punctuation including the question mark, apostrophe,

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.500
exclamation point and quotation marks.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.010
Aldo also explicitly noted that the purpose
of these marks was more than merely as a rhetorical

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.260
aid, but that such marks were necessary in
order to express and preserve meaning (as

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.770
previously identified by the Christian scribes
centuries earlier).

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.100
For English writers and printers, however,
while they did begin almost universally using

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.610
the marks Aldo had expounded upon, punctuation
remained widely thought of as primarily for

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.700
elocution, and authors including George Puttenham
in The Arte of English Poesie (1589) and Simon

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.430
Daines in Orthoepia Anglicana (1640) even
set out a standard for the proper use of a

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.110
comma, semicolon and colon as simply a “pause
of one unit . . . two units . . . and of three,”

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.110
respectively.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.641
This began to change after the publication
of Ben Jonson’s English Grammar (1640) in

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:19.270
which he illustrated how punctuation could
help preserve an author’s original intention,

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.820
rather than just giving a guide to how to
read a text out-loud.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:28.200
Well received, by the time of the Restoration
(1660), using punctuation for syntactical

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.320
purposes was finally common, and in fact,
by the 18th century, excessive punctuation

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.590
(such as placing a comma between every possible
phrase) had become a major problem.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.620
Overuse of punctuation continued to some extent
through the late 19th century until lexicographers

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.940
Henry Watson Fowler and Francis George Fowler
published The King’s English (1906), which

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:56.920
called for far less and established the style
of “light punctuation” that endures to

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:17.360
this day.
