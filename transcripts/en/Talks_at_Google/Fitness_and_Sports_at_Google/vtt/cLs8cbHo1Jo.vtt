[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.253 --> 00:00:08.180
SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.700
So let's start with getting
involved in a Super Bowl.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.690
So Allison, Pat, Stephanie,
how did you first

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.560
become involved with the Super
Bowl bid process for your city?

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.410
And then, what was most
exciting/daunting of taking

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.155
on that task?

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.280
ALLISON MELANGTON: I had
spent my career in sports.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.140
I worked at the Indiana
Sports Corporation,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.348
which was the first Sports
Commission in the country,

00:00:29.348 --> 00:00:31.640
as Indianapolis was trying
to build a sports strategy

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.960
and bring more sporting events.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.480
So for 20 years, I had
worked in Indianapolis,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.200
trying to bring major
sporting events.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.390
We had completed
about 400 events.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.840
We had four men's Final Fours.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.480
We had the single
largest sporting

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.380
event in the world every
year, the Indy 500.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.530
So as we built our business
center, our community

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.024
brand around sports, of
course, the Super Bowl

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:55.190
was always at the end there.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.930
And we knew at
the right time, we

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.900
were going to bid for a
Super Bowl and hopefully win.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.110
So we bid in 2006 for
the '11 Super Bowl.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.050
We did not get it.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.350
And then in 2008, we bid
for the '12 Super Bowl.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.050
And we got it.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.820
So for our city
and our community,

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270
it was a little bit of a
natural progression towards--

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.810
from having the Pan American
Games, World Championships,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.897
the Olympic Trials.

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:17.730
men's and women's Final
Fours, and so forth.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.580
So it was part of our strategy.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.080
And we were-- we had a
great time doing the bid

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.326
and thankful that we got one.

00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:23.826
SPEAKER: OK.

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:26.910
And how about in San Francisco?

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.170
PAT GALLAGHER: So I
spent over 30 years,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.690
with as the marketing business
guy for the San Francisco

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.830
Giants.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.422
And the new chairman
of the host committee--

00:01:37.422 --> 00:01:39.880
the only Super Bowl that had
ever been held in the Bay Area

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.420
was 1985.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.210
And so with the 49ers building
this new stadium coming out

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.240
of the ground, they had a
host committee chairman,

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.430
and asked if I would help
them put the bid together.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.890
And to be honest, I
wasn't really sure

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.010
what I was getting into.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.610
But it was an
incredible experience.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.740
The first part of it was to--

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.930
our sales pitch to
the NFL was to try

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.810
to convince the NFL that they
ought to actually consider

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.000
the Bay Area after all
these years of sort

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.030
of not considering us,
a lot of reasons why,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.460
and they didn't really
have a good place to play.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.675
But my role was
really to figure out

00:02:20.675 --> 00:02:23.840
how to raise the money
to make it happen,

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.080
and actually fill in
the blanks to the RFP

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.934
that Frank sent us, which
was 150 pages long, which

00:02:30.934 --> 00:02:31.725
covered everything.

00:02:31.725 --> 00:02:33.433
ALLISON MELANGTON:
And a little bit more.

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:35.780
PAT GALLAGHER: And we put
our cast of characters

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.400
together in a plan.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.940
And fortunately, we were
awarded the 50th Super Bowl.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.980
We would have been
happy, at that time--

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.770
I can say this-- with either
of the 50th or the 51st.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.339
But we were awarded the 50th.

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:49.880
And then, on the
way home, we kind of

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.060
said, oh, my god, now we
actually have to do this.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.760
So--

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.718
STEPHANIE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.457
SPEAKER: So Frank, what is the
NFL side of the experience?

00:02:59.457 --> 00:03:02.040
What are you looking for when
it comes to picking a host city?

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.476
And what's in that 150-page RFP?

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.100
FRANK SUPOVITZ: Well,
it really depends

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.320
on who is looking at the bid.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.170
So at the end of
the day, my job was

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.760
to help facilitate the
collection of bids that

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.970
would be almost impossible
to differentiate,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.470
you know, just three
great bids a year.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.760
And my job was to help the
host cities, whether it

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.720
be Indianapolis or the
Bay Area or anybody else,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.690
to come up with
the very best plan.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.250
At the end of the
day, it's actually

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.760
the 32 owners of the National
Football League, the 32 team

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.710
owners, who vote on that.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.310
So how they make the
determinations or--

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.630
well, I can't put myself in
the head of a billionaire team

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.010
owner.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.120
But what I do know is that there
is a financial aspect to it.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.830
There is a stadium and
experiential aspect to it

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.470
in terms of what the
guests and the fans

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.460
are going to encounter
and experience.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.140
And there is a novelty factor.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.920
What's unique?

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.050
What's different?

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.710
There's a legacy factor.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.780
And these are two
cities that when

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.240
it came to legacies,
second to none.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.899
You know, what does a Super Bowl
do after the NFL leaves town?

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:23.317
What does it do for that city?

00:04:23.317 --> 00:04:25.900
How is it going to fulfill the
mission of a sports commission,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.150
or the city fathers,
or a host committee?

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.770
And what good is it
going to leave behind?

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.230
And, frankly, in the case
of these two cities, which

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.580
were both remarkable, it
was the legacy program

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.700
that I think turned
the most heads because

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.430
of the uniqueness of it, and the
impact of it in the marketplace

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.950
after we had folded our
tents and went home.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.860
SPEAKER: So
Stephanie, how do you

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.417
believe that you got San
Francisco to stand out?

00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:56.000
So what did you do
in your bid process

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.612
to make yours jump off the page?

00:04:57.612 --> 00:04:59.570
STEPHANIE MARTIN: I think,
as Frank was saying,

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.100
it really was the
legacy component.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.030
So we saw this as an opportunity
to not only have a Super

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.405
Bowl come that we
hadn't had in 30 years,

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:09.530
but really to figure out,
what's the impact that we

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.750
could have on our community.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.660
And we saw this as such
a catalyst for good.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.670
And so from the
beginning, our goal

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.380
was to be the most
giving Super Bowl.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.930
We had the opportunity to
host the biggest celebration

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.450
the NFL had ever had, you
know, the 50th Super Bowl,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.070
this milestone moment.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.940
So to be able to use that
to benefit our community

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.160
and everyone in it was
a goal that we sought.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.310
And so we set aside
25% of all the money

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.020
that we raised on
a corporate basis,

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.810
and we self-funded
our Super Bowl.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.790
So that was a significant
amount of money.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.880
And at the end of the
day, we gave $13 million

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.410
back into the community.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.750
And so setting out that
model in the beginning

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.360
of, not only we have
these wonderful offerings,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.110
and wonderful food, and
amazing hotbed of technology,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.170
but the legacy component of
what could be left after a Super

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.780
Bowl, and the springboard
that it could create, was,

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.442
we felt, a great
differentiator for us.

00:06:02.442 --> 00:06:04.400
SPEAKER: And Allison,
you don't have to sell me

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.675
on how great Indianapolis is.

00:06:05.675 --> 00:06:07.580
But how did you
convince 32 owners

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.950
to let Indianapolis
host the city?

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.720
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yeah,
it was a great experience

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.680
doing the bid, and working
with Frank was fabulous.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.180
One of the things
that we focused on

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.680
is, what are your
weaknesses as a city?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.820
Indianapolis, it doesn't
jump off the pages

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.470
as necessarily a
Super Bowl city.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.350
So we took all the things
the NFL owners could question

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.030
and say in their
minds-- you know,

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.740
is Indianapolis ready
for a Super Bowl--

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.590
and then try to take those
things to be strengths.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.770
Frank talked about the financial
component of the Super Bowl.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:38.080
So we pre-raised our money.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.460
We were the first city to ever
do the bid where we walked

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.440
in with all of our money.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.040
We raised $26 million
prior to the Super Bowl,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.550
walked in with the pledge
letters at the bid, and said,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.230
we've got the money right here.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.940
So don't wonder or
worry that we won't

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.090
be able to raise our funds.

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.410
So that was the first thing.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.950
The second thing on the
experiential side of it

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.121
that Frank was referring to,
most of the Super Bowl cities,

00:07:01.121 --> 00:07:02.870
other than Atlanta and
New Orleans, really

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.220
had a spread out footprint.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.160
So if you look at Miami,
if you look at Phoenix,

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.350
Houston, very, very
spread out footprint.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:10.910
We were very condensed.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.980
We have a very compact downtown.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.540
Most of our hotel
rooms are downtown.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:16.610
Everything's connected,
which, frankly,

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.710
I think made some of the
owners a little nervous

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.780
because it was so condensed.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.080
So we went to a plan, very
similarly used by the Salt Lake

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.190
Olympics when they did the
Olympics in the '90s, and said,

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.360
you know, we're going to
take the downtown core

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.820
and make it like the
Olympics Medals Plaza,

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:33.710
and turn it into
Super Bowl Village.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.850
And we did a lot of
things in that area.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.060
But we took our
downtown compactness

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.420
and took the worries off
the plate on the things

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.890
that they could
be worried about.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.620
And the third thing we did, as
Stephanie was talking about,

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.210
we really focused on legacy.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.210
And we had a lot of
different projects in legacy,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.474
but we really focused
mostly on the Near East

00:07:52.474 --> 00:07:54.140
Side of Indianapolis,
which was a really

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.460
challenging neighborhood.

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.100
And we took it by
storm in a plan

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.540
to be able to change housing, to
build a youth education center,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.640
to really revitalize
the neighborhood.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.200
And as a part of that, for
the bid, we decided to--

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.107
and this is actually
a funny conversation

00:08:11.107 --> 00:08:12.190
I had with Frank that day.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.570
We decided to present our bid--

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.750
it's always a challenge with
the Super Bowl host committees,

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:19.080
bid committees at the time.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.840
How are you going to actually
present your bid to the owners

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.000
to get their attention
and make sure they're

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.890
going to open it and read it?

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:26.420
And we were in a
planning session

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.700
with the current
athletic director

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.310
of Notre Dame, Jack Swarbrick,
who was one of our bid chairs.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.539
And he came up with
a crazy idea to say,

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:35.330
well, why don't we have
eighth graders, who

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:39.020
are going to be seniors in 2012
when we have the Super Bowl,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.429
let's fly eighth graders
all around the country

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:43.220
and have them actually
meet with the owners

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.285
and present our
bid in 15 minutes.

00:08:45.285 --> 00:08:46.910
And I had an eighth
grader at the time.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.040
And I thought, there is
no way that's a good idea.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.270
But as we talked through it
for the next couple of hours,

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.770
you know, it became more
and more apparent to us

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:58.400
that really, what
our message was was

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.275
this was going to be
great for the community,

00:09:00.275 --> 00:09:04.430
as Pat and Stephanie shared,
And that impact of youth

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.560
and what we could do for
the youth of Indianapolis

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:09.980
at the Super Bowl was a
critical part of our bid.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.745
So I called Frank,
and I said, this

00:09:11.745 --> 00:09:13.370
is how we're going
to deliver our bids.

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:15.120
And I'll never forget
what you said to me.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.159
You said, are you
sure that you want

00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:19.700
to take all the work you've been
doing for two years in a bid

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.840
and leave it in the hands
of an eighth grader?

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.815
And I said, yeah,
we're going to do it.

00:09:23.815 --> 00:09:24.440
So we did that.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.440
And it was actually one of the
most fun days of my career,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.170
sending off all those eighth
graders across the country

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:33.214
to meet with Jerry Jones and
all the other owners to do that.

00:09:33.214 --> 00:09:35.130
So I think we grabbed
their attention on that.

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:37.670
SPEAKER: And Frank, how
did the owners take that?

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.860
FRANK SUPOVITZ: Some of them
actually got in touch with me

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.730
afterwards and were
incredibly impressed.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:49.400
It really put a human
face on Indianapolis' bid

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.310
because at that point, the
only face that they knew

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:57.560
was Jim Irsay's, you know,
the Indianapolis Colts owner.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.870
This really gave it
a very human look.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.580
And the message
behind it, which I

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:04.960
think was really the thing
that put it over the top

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.750
was, you know, we're not
going to build a house.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.770
We're not going to
build five houses.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.610
We're going to restore
a neighborhood.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:18.270
And we're going to help
develop a commercial district

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:22.080
for a neighborhood where
people who can barely

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.560
afford a bus ride,
have to take a bus

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.940
ride to get their groceries--

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.760
and it just humanized
the whole thing.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.400
It was Indianapolis'
second kick at the can,

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.910
as Allison mentioned.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:42.260
And they really wanted to bring
not only the legacy piece in,

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:46.620
but also the welcome that
the owners would receive

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.800
and that their fans would
receive if their team was

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.450
lucky enough to play in the
Super Bowl because that compact

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.490
Super Bowl Village
that she mentioned--

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.110
the one thing she
didn't mention was

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:02.730
that the stadium is actually
in that 16 blocks of downtown.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:06.312
So the experience is,
you get to your hotel,

00:11:06.312 --> 00:11:07.770
you roll out of
your hotel, and you

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:11.130
can walk through
this amazing, call it

00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:15.580
amusement park of football
and into the stadium

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.080
and then back to your hotel.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.700
You never have to drive,
get stuck in traffic.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.740
It was really a
very, very well-done,

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.919
well-thought-out plan.

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:25.710
SPEAKER: And Pat and
Stephanie, you kind of

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.200
had the reverse with
covering so much region.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.110
How did you take into account,
the geography of the Bay Area

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.160
being so widespread?

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.785
PAT GALLAGHER: Well, any of you
who know anything about the Bay

00:11:34.785 --> 00:11:37.890
Area know that the Bay itself,
it's a physical barrier,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.390
but it's sort of a
psychological barrier in a way.

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.290
You have San Francisco here.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.190
You have 45 miles to the
South, you have San Jose.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.640
You have Oakland across the Bay.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.140
And I used to get up when
I'd make the speeches,

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.050
and I'd try--

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.780
I used to say, you know,
the Super Bowl, Super Bowl

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.050
50 is the first thing that the
Bay Area has ever agreed on.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.480
And then I'd shut up.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.980
And then people would start to
laugh, because the Bay Area's

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.060
never agreed on anything.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.120
So we had to figure out
a way to somehow bring

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.980
all this stuff together.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.530
So the legacy piece
was a big part of it.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.740
But you know, if you had to boil
down our sales pitch to the NFL

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.320
and to the locals,
it really was,

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.050
if you're going to celebrate
50 years of Super Bowls

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.047
with all the history
and tradition,

00:12:21.047 --> 00:12:23.130
but more importantly,
you're going to look forward

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.610
to the next 50, there's
only one place in the world

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.650
that you can do this, which is
in the San Francisco Bay Area.

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:32.250
And part of it--

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:33.840
Allison talking
about eighth graders.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.500
We said, well, how can we
talk about the junction

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.260
of technology,
innovation, all this,

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.350
and not present our bid
in an interesting way?

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:45.630
So Apple was one of our--

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.190
I'll tell you.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:49.620
Google was the first company
who got involved with this.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.590
Apple was the company who
said, we'll give you devices.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:58.700
So we were going to put the
bid on a iPad Mini, which

00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.980
is something to do.

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:03.540
But then you realize that
a lot of the NFL owners--

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.910
I hate to say it, but
they're kind of like me.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.220
I mean, some of these guys
maybe could send an email

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:08.880
at that time.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.020
I don't know.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.496
But we weren't
sure that it would

00:13:12.496 --> 00:13:14.370
be-- as a matter of
fact, one of the owners--

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.800
and I won't say who it was.

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.570
So we put the presentation
in a big white box

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:21.330
with the iPad Mini
in it that would,

00:13:21.330 --> 00:13:25.170
if you took the lid off the box,
the presentation would start.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.870
And so one of the owners got it.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:30.030
And his assistant
just couldn't resist.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:32.760
So she opened the box, and
the presentation started.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.680
And she didn't know
how to stop it.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.090
So she called us.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.720
And we couldn't
figure it out either.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:42.375
So we wound up sending
another one to do it.

00:13:42.375 --> 00:13:46.710
But I think that the point was--
you have 15 minutes when you

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:49.270
present your bid to the owners.

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:51.030
It was a pretty intimidating.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.070
You're in a room with--

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.130
I don't know-- 200 or 300 people
in these high-backed leather

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.600
chairs, who they have
screens up there.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.680
And it's a frightening--

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.320
I said, maybe it
feels like this when

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.647
they're about to elect a pope.

00:14:05.647 --> 00:14:06.480
I don't really know.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.150
But it was a very intimidating
feeling being in there.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.930
And also when you walk out.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:14.430
There's no-- it's not like you
get any applause or anything.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:15.150
It's silence.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.570
And you walk out, and you go,
god, did we blow it or what?

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:20.970
The great thing is is
that the way it's set up

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:29.070
is the NFL Network was set up
to help record the bid process,

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:34.200
not only from where the team
rooms or the city rooms were,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.540
but they would check and
see what the reaction was.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.500
And so we'd go back
to our green room.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.540
And we're kind of sitting there.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.890
And then all of a sudden,
which comes on the screen,

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:47.880
the bidding was done.

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.830
And so the commissioner gets
up and reads this thing.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.550
I'm proud to award the 50th
Super Bowl to San Francisco.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.420
Well, we jump up like crazy.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.190
Fortunately, they said they
had a two or three second delay

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:03.170
on it, maybe longer.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.960
So if somebody had said
a bad word or something,

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.630
it wouldn't go out
on the NFL Network.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.930
And so it was a very
exciting piece of it.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:15.450
They also caught the losing
green room at the same time.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:18.750
But it was all part of
the incredible experience

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.920
of going through that.

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:28.470
Like I say, getting
people in the Bay Area,

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.350
our big challenge was having
the glue that would hold us

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.360
together in the Bay Area.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:37.200
The legacy piece of it for us,
taking 25% of all the money

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.230
that we had to raise,
because we didn't qualify.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.100
There was no public
funding at all.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.190
So we had to do
everything from scratch.

00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.640
So we had to raise
25% more money

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.020
than we would have otherwise.

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.200
But as it turned
out, the legacy was

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.200
the glue that held together.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.480
And it got people
around the Bay Area

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.980
who said, you know, OK, I
feel like this about football,

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.640
about the NFL.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.700
But I get doing something
that's good for people.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.460
And that was really maybe
one of the proudest things

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.080
of our experience.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.000
FRANK SUPOVITZ: Mike,
can I ask Allison--

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.710
I know this is unorthodox-- you
ask questions, I answer them.

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:16.280
SPEAKER: Go for it.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.630
FRANK SUPOVITZ: But
talk about the scarves.

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.250
ALLISON MELANGTON:
Oh, the scarves.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.875
FRANK SUPOVITZ:
Because, you know what?

00:16:20.875 --> 00:16:25.250
That was a legacy
piece that is not often

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.160
remembered, but was
incredibly impactful,

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.280
even on feature television.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.885
But talk a little
bit about that.

00:16:31.885 --> 00:16:33.760
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yeah,
I had one of those--

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.843
I don't know if any of
you've had a day like this.

00:16:35.843 --> 00:16:39.087
But I had one of those
days about two-and-a-half,

00:16:39.087 --> 00:16:41.420
three years before the Super
Bowl that you can't keep up

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:42.086
with everything.

00:16:42.086 --> 00:16:44.420
I probably had 2,000 or
3,000 emails that day,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.237
tons and tons of phone calls.

00:16:46.237 --> 00:16:47.570
My voicemail kept shutting down.

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.903
And what it was was people
in the community reaching out

00:16:49.903 --> 00:16:51.051
saying, how can I help.

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:53.300
We know it's two, three years
ahead of the Super Bowl.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.000
But we want to help.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.040
We want to do something.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.990
Many of those
folks were retired.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.580
Many of them had
time on their hands.

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:02.520
And I just didn't have
enough projects to pass out.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.520
Back to what Pat's saying,
getting the community

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.270
really involved in
everything you're doing

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:07.880
is so important
so that they don't

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.359
look at it just as a heads and
beds economic impact event.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:14.810
So after a long day
at work, I went home

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:17.150
and sat down with a friend
and said, oh, my gosh, I

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:18.359
had the most frustrating day.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:20.691
And we talked about, how do
you engage these people that

00:17:20.691 --> 00:17:22.109
want to be engaged this early?

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.560
So we came up with
this crazy idea

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:27.290
to ask people to knit
scarves for our volunteers

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:28.490
because it was February.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:30.410
It was going to be
cold in Indiana.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:32.210
So I came up with this plan.

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.400
We're going to have
people knit scarves,

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:37.594
any style, themselves, knit
or crochet, blue and white.

00:17:37.594 --> 00:17:40.010
And then we were going to put
patches on them, Super Bowl,

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.720
and they'd be given
to the volunteers.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.969
So volunteers would have them.

00:17:42.969 --> 00:17:43.880
So it's service.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.190
We all want to do
things for service.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:49.460
And if people knitted, then
the volunteers would get them.

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:52.514
Well, we had some
naysayers at the beginning.

00:17:52.514 --> 00:17:53.930
Our chairman
actually said to me--

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:55.490
I came to him with the idea.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:58.820
And he said, I don't think
Super Bowl and knitting

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.420
go in the same sentence.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.880
So I don't think
we should do that.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.990
But I got him over the hump.

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:04.990
And by the way, he wore
his scarf for two years.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.550
But we ended up
getting 13,000 scarves

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.820
from around the world, people
that had connections to Indiana

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.700
from all parts of the
globe, that sent them in.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.370
If you were in Africa working
for Eli Lilly and Company,

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.170
which is headquartered
in Indiana,

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.420
that was their connection
to the Super Bowl.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.991
And we had our
women's prison sew

00:18:22.991 --> 00:18:24.240
the patches on to the scarves.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.160
So it was a huge
community effort

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.250
and something that really
pulled people together

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:31.130
and unified everybody.

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:33.970
SPEAKER: So let's talk about the
social impact of a Super Bowl

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:34.720
that brings--

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.844
so you have four years that
you're planning for it,

00:18:36.844 --> 00:18:38.560
but then it comes to town.

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.227
So talk about some of the
other community involvement

00:18:41.227 --> 00:18:42.310
engagements that happened.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.270
And then, Frank, if
you want to chime in

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.640
with other things outside of
Indianapolis and San Francisco

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.310
that you saw that was
really interesting.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:47.980
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yeah.

00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:48.480
Go ahead.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.188
STEPHANIE MARTIN:
Well, one of the things

00:18:50.188 --> 00:18:52.270
that we did was a program
called Playmakers.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.240
And I think this was
the favorite program

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.010
in our organization.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.640
For 50 weeks, we identified
a small nonprofit

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.590
that would receive a grant.

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.650
And so we did big grants
of a half million dollars.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:07.300
But this program
was really focused

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.880
on finding the people
in the community that

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.470
were making an impact locally.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:14.620
So it was a $10,000
grant for an organization

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.441
where $10,000 would
really make a real impact.

00:19:17.441 --> 00:19:18.940
But the piece about
it that we loved

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:21.040
is we also had them
identify either

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.910
that volunteer or a staff
member or board member who

00:19:24.910 --> 00:19:27.700
was their playmaker, the
person who made a difference,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.760
and to highlight that
an individual can really

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.830
make an impact and be a role
model for everyone else.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.760
And so we went in then,
and sent a camera crew in.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.930
They filmed a whole story.

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.810
And we worked with a really
wonderful social enterprise

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:44.920
called BAYCAT, which is
in the San Francisco area.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.770
And they had young kids
that were coming in

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.510
from the inner city
of San Francisco,

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.740
learning digital skills.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.520
So we had this kind of
great, end-to end opportunity

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:55.750
of legacy.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.550
And these stories, we would
watch in our office every week.

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:01.030
And we'd be crying at these
stories because they would

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.880
be just these amazing
people that were doing,

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.500
like, truly amazing things.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.900
And then we were able to
take that piece of film that

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.930
was created and give it to the
nonprofits, who none of them

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.090
had ever had a
marketing piece before.

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:15.640
So now, they had their
story captured on film.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.002
So those are the things that,
for us, made so much impact, is

00:20:19.002 --> 00:20:20.710
just to hear all these
individual stories

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:23.240
in the community and be
able to share those stories.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.630
So the dollars were great.

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:28.440
It was great to be able to
give out wonderful grants,

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.910
but to be able to highlight
some of the work that

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.230
was being done.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:36.400
And then we partnered with the
NFL to create our Giant 50.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.112
So there's always the
giant numbers that you see,

00:20:39.112 --> 00:20:40.570
where you can have
your photo taken

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.970
in front of the Roman numerals.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:43.880
We had 50.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:46.421
So we had the 5-0 in
our Super Bowl city.

00:20:46.421 --> 00:20:47.920
And you'll have to
have Pat tell you

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.940
the story about Roman numerals,
because that's another story.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.565
PAT GALLAGHER: I
might as well tell it.

00:20:51.565 --> 00:20:53.590
So the Super Bowl 50
was the first Super Bowl

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.180
that had an actual number,
rather than a Roman numeral.

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.210
And so when we got it, we were
really excited about having

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:02.433
Super Bowl 50.

00:21:02.433 --> 00:21:03.807
But then somebody
pointed out, do

00:21:03.807 --> 00:21:07.630
you know what the Roman
numeral is for 50.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.840
It's L, which,
you kind of said ,

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:14.400
it's kind of the wimpiest of
the Roman numerals in a sense.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.830
So we said, we wonder if there's
anything we can do about that.

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.900
Also, digitally, if you're
having a digital address,

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.430
it winds up being Super
Bowl with two Ls, which

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:25.690
is another issue.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.037
So we actually went
and talked to the NFL.

00:21:28.037 --> 00:21:28.870
It was really great.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:29.800
They listened.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.500
And they didn't-- we said, is
there any way that we could use

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.380
50 instead of L?

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.130
And they listened.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.560
And they were very-- obviously,
it was a big decision

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.730
that they had to go through.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.590
And we learned later that
they sort of the same issues.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:46.360
So we wound up--

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.240
we came to an agreement.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.810
The NFL announced their
Super Bowl 50 mark.

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.120
We announced our
Super Bowl 50 mark.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.830
And it really got
a lot of fanfare.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.520
Except, the one
thing that happened.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.160
We got this letter that
actually, the commissioner got

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:01.840
and we got.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.230
And it was from the CEO
of an organization called

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:09.205
the Roman Numeral Society
of America, upset.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:14.590
The NFL and the Super Bowl
was like the last bastion

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.299
of promoting--

00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:17.590
and so we kind of looked at it.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:18.730
We took it seriously.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:20.680
As it turned out, it
was sort of a ruse

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:22.390
by some pretty funny person.

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.930
But anyway, it was
a total keeper.

00:22:25.930 --> 00:22:29.380
And it's just you can't do
anything without being noticed.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.130
And--

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.090
STEPHANIE MARTIN:
You're on a big stage.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.320
PAT GALLAGHER: You're
on the big stage, yeah.

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:33.778
STEPHANIE MARTIN:
And that giant 50

00:22:33.778 --> 00:22:37.030
enabled us to have not only this
great photo moment for people,

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:40.190
but we then made it a
walkthrough for the first time.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.850
And so inside, you would
walk through Super Bowl City,

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:45.752
and you'd get to see all these
stories about these individuals

00:22:45.752 --> 00:22:46.960
and the impact that they had.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.580
So all of our playmakers got
this opportunity to be seen.

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.740
So a million people
going through got to see,

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.480
to us, what makes the
Bay Area so special

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.634
is just all these people coming
together to help the community.

00:22:58.634 --> 00:23:00.550
ALLISON MELANGTON: We
had a couple of programs

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:05.430
that we felt really were great
legacy, back to your question.

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.270
Two things, we did
build an $11 million

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:10.030
youth education and health
and wellness center,

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.060
which is still thriving
today, six years later.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.510
Very successful.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.440
Many kids and families use that
facility in the neighborhood.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.140
So that's been a
long-term impact.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:22.990
And then secondly, we chose
to do a breast cancer project.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.390
Indianapolis is the only
place in the world that

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:30.070
has a tissue bank where women
can donate healthy breast

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.570
tissue for breast
cancer research.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:34.990
And Frank had
encouraged us early on

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:39.580
to take any Indianapolis,
Indiana asset that was unique

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:42.855
and try to leverage that for
the Super Bowl in some way,

00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:44.980
to strengthen those
organizations and lift them up.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:47.560
So we did that with the
breast tissue center.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.430
And we had over 1,000 women,
weekend before Super Bowl,

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:53.860
came and donated
healthy breast tissue

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.230
for breast cancer research.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.760
And the results
from that donation

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.370
are really making
huge advancements

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:03.390
in curing and identifying
breast cancer.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:05.920
So that's a project
that will continue

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.780
to give as we go forward.

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.940
And it was really an
amazing sight that weekend,

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.620
when we had 1,000 women lined
up, who have healthy breasts,

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.395
but volunteered to donate
tissue for research.

00:24:17.395 --> 00:24:20.110
SPEAKER: And Frank, on top of
these two wonderful cities that

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:22.750
did amazing work, was there
any in the other eight

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.560
Super Bowls, a community
impact project that stood out?

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.840
FRANK SUPOVITZ:
There have been many.

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.427
I'll mention one.

00:24:30.427 --> 00:24:32.260
And it's great that
we're talking about this

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:36.610
because when you've got
nine hours of television

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:38.830
on Super Bowl Sunday, it's
remarkable that you never

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:43.240
hear any of this, which
is a shame because it's

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.480
really inspirational.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.860
And clearly, we had
inspirational stories here.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.880
In North Texas in 2011,
there was a program

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:55.330
called Slant 45, which
stood for Service Learning

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.040
Adventures in North Texas.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.110
And that host committee
provided grants

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.840
to neighborhoods
and kids, basically.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:07.870
So it was all done
through the schools.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:12.100
And what the kids had to do,
or the classes had to do,

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.625
was submit a proposal,
like a grant proposal--

00:25:15.625 --> 00:25:18.160
so it taught them how to
write a grant proposal--

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.350
and say, what do you
want to accomplish?

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:23.360
What good thing can you
do in your community?

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.510
And how much is
it going to cost?

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.480
And there were literally
hundreds of these programs,

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.850
hundreds, right down to--

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:36.370
the one I remember because it's
so inconsequential globally,

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:41.080
was a group that was
going to remove graffiti

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.150
from its school.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.050
They needed $500.

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.450
And so the kids got
together and used the $500

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:51.630
to buy the materials that
they needed on the budget

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:55.530
that they had provided, and
they cleaned up their school.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.880
Well, multiply that
times hundreds of schools

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.910
and libraries all across this
1,600-square-mile footprint

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:11.490
of Dallas, Fort Worth,
Arlington, Irving area,

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:16.030
and a program like that,
just from the grassroots.

00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:20.940
And as an educational program,
as a quality-of-life program,

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.350
as a legacy program, it
was just outstanding.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.500
SPEAKER: So let's pivot
to this year's Super Bowl.

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.110
It's coming up here
in Minneapolis.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:34.470
Give us an inside look into what
their host committee and host

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:36.330
team is going through right now.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:38.440
ALLISON MELANGTON: They're
not sleeping, for sure.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:39.500
They're definitely not sleeping.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.370
FRANK SUPOVITZ: They're
not warm either.

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:40.570
STEPHANIE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:41.280
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yeah.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:42.988
PAT GALLAGHER: I would
say probably still

00:26:42.988 --> 00:26:46.800
getting over whatever their
emotions were about their home

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.780
team getting into the
Super Bowl, which,

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.154
if you think about
it, would have

00:26:50.154 --> 00:26:52.350
added a whole different
dimension to this.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.764
So yeah, they're not
sleeping right now for sure.

00:26:54.764 --> 00:26:56.430
STEPHANIE MARTIN: And
a couple of people

00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:59.460
that worked on our host
committee are there.

00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.810
And so we have talked to them,
or have tried to talk to them.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.440
So one said, thank
you for sending

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.990
a text that just said, we
wish you luck, and feel good,

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.280
and not a long one because
I can't read anything more,

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.120
because I'm getting
3,000 emails a day.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.142
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yeah.

00:27:13.142 --> 00:27:15.100
And now, they finally
know who their teams are,

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:16.110
which makes a big difference.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.730
Prior to that, you're
just sort of waiting

00:27:17.730 --> 00:27:18.730
and waiting and waiting.

00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:21.810
Now that they know their teams,
they can deploy their plans.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:23.490
But that last three
months-- these guys

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:24.990
and Frank knows
better than anybody.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:29.130
That last three months, it's 22
hours a day, seven days a week.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:30.810
You lay down and
sleep when you can.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.414
There's just so much to do
once you get to this point.

00:27:33.414 --> 00:27:35.330
SPEAKER: Allison, can
you talk to the weather?

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:37.450
Because Indianapolis had
great weather Super Bowl week.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:38.741
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yes, it did.

00:27:38.741 --> 00:27:41.100
SPEAKER: But I'm sure you had
a plan for an Indianapolis

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:41.970
winter.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.289
What's Minneapolis going
through right now with that?

00:27:44.289 --> 00:27:46.080
ALLISON MELANGTON:
Yeah, the weather issue,

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.352
that was another
thing that we had

00:27:48.352 --> 00:27:50.310
to make sure we were
completely buttoned up on.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:53.000
The year before,
unfortunately for Dallas,

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.280
they did have a massive
snow-and-ice storm in 2011.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.980
So we were down there with
them, learned some good lessons.

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:02.100
And the key with all that is
making sure all the agencies

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.150
are working together.

00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:06.870
We had a bulletproof weather
plan if we had bad weather.

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.690
I felt 100% confident in putting
my head on the pillow at night

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.160
not worrying about
weather because we worked

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.440
with 27 different agencies
and groups for over two years

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:17.400
on our weather plan.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.520
So we didn't actually enact
it, but we did share our plan

00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.640
with the NFL after.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.630
And I know they've shared
it with other cities.

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:27.010
So what they are doing right
now is praying that they have--

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.130
they can have cold
weather and snow.

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.050
Ice is a little bit of
a challenge when you're

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.591
trying to move people around,
which unfortunately for Dallas,

00:28:33.591 --> 00:28:34.890
is what they encountered.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:36.431
FRANK SUPOVITZ: And
it's a good thing

00:28:36.431 --> 00:28:40.320
you did share that because just
a couple of years after that,

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.100
we were here in the New York-New
Jersey metropolitan area.

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:49.756
That was Super Bowl XLVIII,
which was my last for the NFL.

00:28:49.756 --> 00:28:50.880
Not related to the weather.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.540
But we had the polar
vortexes coming through here,

00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.760
vortices coming through here.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.710
Temperatures were in
the single digits.

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:01.920
When we opened the fan
festival on Broadway--

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.480
it was called Super
Bowl Boulevard.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.160
It was a big, open
floor plan for that,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.410
from 34th to 48th Street--

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:11.430
it was 16 degrees.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.524
It was cold.

00:29:12.524 --> 00:29:14.190
We still got a
million-and-a-half people

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:19.110
on the street, which is kind of
the power of both the New York

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:22.740
metropolitan area and
the Super Bowl combined.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:26.400
But we had to enact
a snow plan, I

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.210
think it was four or five
times between January 2

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:34.115
and March 2, which was during
the construction and load-in

00:29:34.115 --> 00:29:36.150
period and then after.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.660
What was really
interesting was we had

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.260
taken all of these measures--

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:45.630
It was also the first outdoor
Super Bowl in a winter market.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.840
So Lucas Oil Stadium is covered.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.850
It's an indoor stadium.

00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:52.860
This was the first
outdoor stadium

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:56.250
so we had to actually
add to that plan.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:30:00.280
Does anybody know how you
takes snow out of a stadium?

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:00.780
OK.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:06.800
You take it out by hand
shoveling one row at a time

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.820
and dumping it in the
aisle in a chute that

00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.810
sends the snow down to the
field, which is exactly

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:16.940
where you don't want it.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:17.690
Right?

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.280
So we were doing that.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.860
We did that four or five times.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:28.700
And so if it had snowed on
Saturday before Super Bowl--

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.470
it's hard for
people to understand

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.840
how you can not be ready.

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.730
But with all the
stuff that we had

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:37.280
built onto the floor
of the stadium,

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:41.160
including the halftime
stages that were hidden there

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.810
and a bunch of other
things, it would

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.730
have been near impossible.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.760
So we had to have
contingency plans to play

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.420
the game on Monday night,
on Tuesday, the following

00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:55.370
Sunday, if you had a three-foot
blizzard, if the market was

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:56.240
behobbled.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.640
Interestingly, we
actually also had

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.660
media sitting outside,
which they'd never done.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.960
Media love sitting
outside in the cold.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.150
They love that.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:09.520
They don't love that.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:14.630
Actually, nobody sits outside,
even at MetLife Stadium,

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:16.487
for a normal game if
they're covering it.

00:31:16.487 --> 00:31:18.070
So we had a bunch
of people out there.

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:19.630
So we built-- and
it cost hundreds

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:20.630
of thousands of dollars.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:25.370
We put radiant heat over
them, under an overhang.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:29.000
We had some heat in the
floorboards and things

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.240
of that nature.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.280
And so of course, after
record cold in this area--

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.920
if you guys were here,
you'd know that--

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.500
on game day, it was 50 degrees.

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.210
ALLISON MELANGTON:
It was beautiful.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.360
FRANK SUPOVITZ: And all
the stuff was cooking.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.901
And it was the first
time we actually

00:31:44.901 --> 00:31:48.080
had a social media command
center in our control room.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.630
And I got a tap on the shoulder.

00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:53.330
They said, the media are
complaining that they feel like

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.925
French fries at McDonald's.

00:31:55.925 --> 00:31:57.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.110
So can you shut off
the heat please?

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.280
And so we actually
responded to that.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.070
And we said, ah, social
media can actually

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:08.450
be a really good
tool for us to be

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.230
responsive on an
operational level.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.540
We had never looked
at it that way before.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:16.790
But of course, 50 degrees.

00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:20.510
And the next day,
we had a snow storm.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.580
By 2:00 in the
morning, it is snowing.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.820
So my job at that point--

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.590
thinking you can breathe
a sigh of relief?

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:29.210
No.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.490
The Denver Broncos are
stuck on the ground.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.320
Their planes are
stuck on the ground.

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.030
And we're working with
the Port Authority

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:35.988
to try to get them out.

00:32:38.322 --> 00:32:39.780
SPEAKER: So let's
talk a little bit

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.072
about what you're up to today.

00:32:41.072 --> 00:32:43.530
So I'd love to hear how your
experience with the Super Bowl

00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:46.515
has impacted your
current position.

00:32:46.515 --> 00:32:48.390
ALLISON MELANGTON: Right
now, I am overseeing

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.990
all of the master and event
planning at the Indianapolis

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:51.930
Motor Speedway.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:54.694
And after I transitioned
through Super Bowl--

00:32:54.694 --> 00:32:57.360
there's not a lot of events that
are bigger than the Super Bowl,

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.260
but the Indianapolis
500 is one of them

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:04.590
because we have about five
times the amount of people

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:05.870
as a regular NFL game.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:09.660
We get over 350,000 people
on our property on race day.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:12.990
And so I learned a lot of
lessons at the Super Bowl,

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.930
and the million
pieces of puzzle that

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.070
go into putting a big
event like that together.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:21.150
And so now, overseeing all
the planning and execution

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:23.530
at the Indy 500,
which has been great.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.600
We've got three major
concerts that weekend.

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:28.170
So it's not just
the race itself.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.670
Like the Super
Bowl, there's tons

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.970
of things that go on around it
that aren't necessarily covered

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.150
on national television.

00:33:34.150 --> 00:33:36.330
But we've got three great
concerts, an EDM concert,

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:38.341
a country concert,
and a rock concert.

00:33:38.341 --> 00:33:39.840
We have a whole
month of activities.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:43.830
We actually have a race on
our road course mid-month,

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:47.320
and tons of days that we're
open, practice, and so forth.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.550
So the Super Bowl really
is a month-long event,

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.224
when you get down to
it, and the Indy 500

00:33:53.224 --> 00:33:55.140
is a month-long event
when you get down to it.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.860
So that's what I'm doing now,
and I'm really enjoying it.

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:00.810
FRANK SUPOVITZ: So
this is an example

00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:03.150
of why you try to
work with people

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:05.190
and make them your friends.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:07.170
Because I work with
Allison on the Indy 500.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.664
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yes, I
grabbed Frank and brought him

00:34:08.664 --> 00:34:09.179
in.

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:11.489
FRANK SUPOVITZ: Yeah, I
work on the pre-race show.

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:15.330
So I run my own event management
production company now.

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:20.062
And the Indy 500 is one
of our incredible clients.

00:34:20.062 --> 00:34:22.020
We're working on the
redevelopment of the South

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.520
Street Seaport.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.138
Pier 17 will be
opening this spring.

00:34:26.138 --> 00:34:27.929
We hope you're all
going to come down there

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:31.290
and check it out because it
really is transforming lower

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.370
Manhattan.

00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:37.230
The Super Bowl was a stop
along the way for me.

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:42.868
I'm a career, habitual
events addict.

00:34:42.868 --> 00:34:44.409
I've tried to go to
events anonymous.

00:34:44.409 --> 00:34:45.719
It doesn't work.

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:48.590
And I just have to go
in, say, I'm sorry.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.670
I just love working
on these big things

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:53.040
because they're giant
puzzles, and every one of them

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.750
is different.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.817
I started with Radio City
Music Hall in the events group.

00:34:57.817 --> 00:35:00.150
My first Super Bowl was
actually working on the halftime

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.090
show in 1988, Super Bowl XXII.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:06.910
Then I was in charge of events
for the NHL for 13 years,

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.060
then the NFL for 10.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:13.680
So now, with this
trove of experience,

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.260
I've been able to work
with groups, really,

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:20.290
all over the world on just
making their events better,

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:24.570
helping them do a better job of
putting those events together.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.990
And having a credential
like the Super Bowl

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:33.420
was one that you wave
proudly because to be honest,

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:37.800
inclusive of the person who
replaced me, in 52 years,

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.950
there has only been four
people who've run Super Bowls.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:46.390
And some of us are older now.

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:48.070
So I was the third.

00:35:48.070 --> 00:35:52.730
And it was a great honor, and I
wouldn't trade it for anything.

00:35:54.921 --> 00:35:56.920
PAT GALLAGHER: So we can
chime in on this thing.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:00.130
But this sort of
happened in that I

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.900
guess we were still
sort of convalescing

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.530
from the experience in the
weeks and months afterwards.

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:11.050
And Stephanie, who led
marketing and communications

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.740
for our Super Bowl, said,
you have to write about this.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:16.660
I'm kind of going, eh,
I'm not really sure.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.580
She said, well, what
if we do this together.

00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:21.040
So I said, I don't really know.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.720
So I started writing
some stuff down,

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.690
and then I started writing
a bunch of stuff down.

00:36:25.690 --> 00:36:29.090
And Stephanie sort of took what
I wrote and sort of cleaned it

00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:29.590
up.

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:31.586
In the process we
found a publisher.

00:36:31.586 --> 00:36:33.460
And we never really
intended, but we ended up

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:37.820
writing a book about it,
which was a great segue, Mike,

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.740
thank you.

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.150
We wrote a book
about the experience.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:45.760
And it was meant to be a
book with some of the lessons

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.750
that we learned.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:49.390
It's not a sort of
kiss-and-tell book.

00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:52.960
Some people say, I wish you'd
said more of that stuff.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.560
And we didn't.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.476
We just talked about the
incredible experience

00:36:55.476 --> 00:36:59.050
and tried to give a feel for--

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.285
planning a Super Bowl
and the organizations

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:04.120
you need is sort of
like a startup company.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.640
And we put this thing together.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.600
So as part of publishing
a book, the publisher

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.570
also wants you to
do an audio version.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:15.916
So Stephanie talked
me into actually

00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:18.480
narrating the entire book.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:18.518
STEPHANIE MARTIN:
Narrating it himself

00:37:18.518 --> 00:37:19.893
because he has a
beautiful voice.

00:37:19.893 --> 00:37:22.990
PAT GALLAGHER: Well-- and so
I sat there for like a month

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:27.160
and had to perform the book.

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.530
And then I gave it to
Stephanie, who edited it.

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.475
STEPHANIE MARTIN: That
was mistake number one.

00:37:31.475 --> 00:37:32.600
PAT GALLAGHER: Big mistake.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.330
So at the end, I
said, aren't you

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:36.300
getting tired of
hearing me talk?

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.090
And she's great.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:38.020
She's very diplomatic.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:42.080
She says, well, I'm not, but
I think my husband Mike is.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.219
So we pushed the book.

00:37:44.219 --> 00:37:45.760
We've been actually
talking about it.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.980
We're proud of it.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:51.280
A lot of universities have used
it in their sports management

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.300
programs.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:56.320
And it actually applies to other
things other than the event.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.850
And why don't you--

00:37:57.850 --> 00:38:00.130
I will, but why don't
you just tell the group

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:01.120
what you're doing now?

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.430
STEPHANIE MARTIN: And so
after writing the book

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:06.730
with Pat, which was such
a great experience to work

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:10.420
with a colleague on it, but also
just to memorialize what we did

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.860
because as we were
saying before,

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:14.170
when you work in events,
you're on to the next thing.

00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:16.150
You never think about
what you actually did.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.650
So it's like, OK, what's next?

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:18.230
What's next?

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.595
And to memorialize what
happened and to put it

00:38:20.595 --> 00:38:22.720
in a book, all the people
that we worked with said,

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.230
oh, my goodness.

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:24.250
It's actually on paper.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.700
I can remember and go
back to what happened

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:29.530
and all those funny moments
that we had together.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.990
But now I've founded
a consultancy

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:34.630
that works with athletes.

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.970
I've worked in sports
marketing for 20 years.

00:38:36.970 --> 00:38:38.740
And working with
athletes, you realize

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:42.760
that not all athletes have
access to the same resources.

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:44.890
Every athlete has an
amazing story to tell,

00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.860
and they all have a platform
from which they can tell it.

00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:51.310
And so we help them to determine
what their narrative is,

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:54.940
to really figure out what they
want to stand for, and then

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:59.782
help them to amplify that and
use their platforms for good.

00:38:59.782 --> 00:39:01.240
And it's been an
amazing experience

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:03.460
working with athletes
across all spectrums,

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:07.780
from NFL to Olympic
and beyond, and really

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.970
helping them to determine
what they want to do

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.264
and what they want to
stand for beyond sports.

00:39:12.264 --> 00:39:14.680
PAT GALLAGHER: So I'll just
say, I took a total left turn.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.800
And interestingly,
I'm doing some work

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.130
with the Walt Disney
family, who actually-- this

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.520
was Walt Disney's daughter
and her husband who

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.580
ran Disney for a while, who
happen to live in the Bay Area.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:30.040
They've developed this
incredible museum.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:31.720
But what I'm helping
them figure out

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.146
is to take sort of, if Walt
Disney was still alive,

00:39:36.146 --> 00:39:37.270
what would he be doing now?

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:39.200
He probably wouldn't
be sitting around.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.850
And so the idea is to take the
art and science of animation--

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:45.400
and it's an
incredible way to help

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.140
kids learn because it combines
art, science, drawing, music,

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.400
math, all of those.

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.990
So actually helping
them figure out

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:56.710
a way to develop educational
programs that will help

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:02.979
do that, which is a real
satisfying thing for me to do.

00:40:02.979 --> 00:40:05.270
SPEAKER: I do want to open
it up to audience questions.

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:06.310
So if people want
to start lining up,

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.559
we do have mics on both sides.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:12.850
Go ahead.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:14.230
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.930
My question is about the
halftime entertainment,

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.480
and how that's scheduled,
and how much say,

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.680
if any, the city has
in scheduling that

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.240
or who the performer
actually is.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.323
FRANK SUPOVITZ: Oh that's--
what an easy question.

00:40:25.323 --> 00:40:25.949
They have none.

00:40:25.949 --> 00:40:26.906
STEPHANIE MARTIN: Zero.

00:40:26.906 --> 00:40:28.090
ALLISON MELANGTON: Call him.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:28.860
Call him.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.990
FRANK SUPOVITZ: No, actually,
it wasn't me at all.

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.090
I had no say in it either.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:38.610
It was actually a
broadcasting decision.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.680
So it was a conversation
with the NFL Network, who

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:48.190
actually subcontracts the Super
Bowl halftime to a company

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:51.190
to do.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:56.680
My job was more to make sure it
got on and got off in a hurry.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.140
So imagine, if you
would, that you

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:02.470
have eight minutes to
set up a pop rock show,

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.650
and 12 minutes to do the show,
and seven minutes to get rid

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:08.170
of it, and make sure you
don't leave anything behind

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:11.860
that a player can trip
on or get hurt by.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:17.290
So that is what my life is
like during that very frenetic

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:19.410
28 minutes.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.890
But in terms of
selecting the talent,

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:25.240
it's a broadcast
decision typically.

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.509
PAT GALLAGHER: I told people--

00:41:26.509 --> 00:41:28.300
I didn't go through
that whole explanation.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.895
I told people that--

00:41:29.895 --> 00:41:31.520
they asked me who
was going to perform.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:32.561
Everybody would ask that.

00:41:32.561 --> 00:41:33.920
And I'd say, you know what?

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.590
If I told you, then
I'd have to kill you.

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.800
So I had no idea who
it was going to be,

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.660
but I didn't want
to explain that I

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:43.414
had nothing to do with it.

00:41:43.414 --> 00:41:44.080
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.706
Thanks for coming.

00:41:45.706 --> 00:41:47.830
I was wondering if you
could talk a little bit more

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:53.240
about how big data and analytics
helped you either put together

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.290
the bid for your city or helped
with the planning for the Super

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:57.010
Bowl.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:01.940
STEPHANIE MARTIN: Well, from a
planning perspective, sitting

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:04.730
where we were in the Bay
Area, we had a lot of pressure

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:07.250
on our shoulders
to really showcase

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.610
the technology of the region.

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:09.860
It was really important to us.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:16.280
And we had a tremendous
number of amazing partners,

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.120
in addition to
Google, SAP and HPE

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.600
and this swath of people
that were coming together

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:24.850
to be able to help us.

00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:27.840
So from a data
perspective, we used it

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.630
in a number of different ways

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.540
Super Bowl City
was the location.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:34.370
It's a free public fan village
that every host committee

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:34.920
puts on.

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.830
Ours was called Super Bowl City.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:38.690
And we had a million
people coming through.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:42.320
So we had to know at all times
how people were coming through,

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.540
how they were using Super
Bowl City, how they were

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:47.660
in the layout, because we had to
make sure that they were safe,

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.370
that they could get around
easily, that we had all

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.290
the services prepared for them.

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:54.920
So being able to have that
back end network to be

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.480
able to help us understand.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.640
We also were able
to then use the data

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.290
to help us engage people.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.060
So we had big giant
screens up where

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:05.450
people could be engaging,
either through augmented reality

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:08.546
games, virtual
reality games, and be

00:43:08.546 --> 00:43:09.920
able to see
themselves on screen,

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.290
and be able to
participate that way.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:14.210
And then with Google
in particular,

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:16.490
we had the first ever fan app.

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:19.160
I know that sounds
probably pretty pedestrian,

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.140
but there had never
been an app developed

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.280
for the public experience.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.840
There had been an app
for the game itself,

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.990
but to actually have an
app for the fan experience

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:29.073
where you have these million
people coming through

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.530
had never happened before.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.570
So Google enabled that for us.

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:35.730
They were our partner in
helping us to produce that,

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:39.530
and then also enabled us
to work with them on Maps.

00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:41.570
So all these little
things you have

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:44.960
to think about of moving all
these hundreds of thousands

00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:46.580
of people around the Bay Area.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:49.400
And, as Pat was saying,
we were 43 miles away

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:51.960
from our stadium location.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.880
Of all the NFL cities, it's
the furthest city center

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:56.780
from a stadium.

00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:59.540
So it was a fairly significant
operational challenge

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.957
we had in terms
of transportation.

00:44:00.957 --> 00:44:03.040
PAT GALLAGHER: There's
another way-- real quickly,

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:05.240
another way is that we
didn't do an economic impact

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.750
study ahead of time in order
to attract the Super Bowl.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:10.850
But a year out, we said,
we need to figure out

00:44:10.850 --> 00:44:14.040
a way to collect the
data so that after this

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:17.240
is all over with, we can report
not on what we thought happened

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:19.820
or what somebody said, but
actually what happened.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.520
So the amount of data that
was collected in terms

00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:26.120
of the number of people
who-- the number of eyeballs,

00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:29.150
the number of experiences
that were shared,

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:31.856
the other elements
of it, were a--

00:44:31.856 --> 00:44:34.400
we could actually report,
here's exactly what happened.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.710
And one of our partners
actually helped us do that.

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:40.280
So we thought it would be
helpful to report on it,

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.622
but also for whoever is
doing this in the future.

00:44:42.622 --> 00:44:43.580
STEPHANIE MARTIN: Yeah.

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.980
And the Google Maps
piece was amazing.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:48.800
To be able to work with the team
to get Super Bowl City placed

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:51.260
and to have all the street
closures marked off.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.030
Because no one's going
to go into our app

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:54.560
to determine where to go.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.400
They're going to
go where they go.

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.358
They go to Google Maps.

00:44:56.358 --> 00:44:59.180
So to be able to use those types
of tools to actually enable

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.640
movement was huge for our
region and really helped

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.790
to facilitate so many--

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:09.724
remove some of those pain
points of moving people around.

00:45:09.724 --> 00:45:10.390
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.989
Thank you.

00:45:17.994 --> 00:45:19.410
AUDIENCE: Earlier
you were talking

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:24.590
about how Indianapolis,
how that closely knit,

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.705
tied together area
where you have

00:45:26.705 --> 00:45:30.660
to plan the stadium and
the hotels and whatnot.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.990
And you were mentioning
that the owners

00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:35.280
were concerned about that.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:39.210
But I don't quite understand how
they were concerned about it,

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.180
especially since, as you
said, having everything close

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.940
together like that
makes transportation

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:47.790
and engagement easier.

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:50.820
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yeah, I would
say that traditionally, Super

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.920
Bowls were not as condensed.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.440
And so I think the
concern was how

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.230
do you fit that many
people that close together

00:45:58.230 --> 00:46:00.690
with all the activities
that have to go on and

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.360
not just create gridlock.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:06.930
Because downtown, we've
got many, many residents

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.610
that live there, many
businesses that function.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.870
So how do you take
that 16-block area,

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.120
still let people live in it,
still let people work in it,

00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.980
and then bring in hundreds
of thousands of other people

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.950
and get that to function without
everything just shutting down?

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:24.540
And so that was
really the challenge.

00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.720
And we had to make sure the
NFL had confidence in us

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.540
that we would be
able to execute that.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:34.150
And so that was
really the concern.

00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:36.210
But I think after that--

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:41.220
Frank and his team worked really
closely on that layout with us.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:42.720
We met with businesses
all the time.

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.210
We had all kinds of
town forums to be

00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:47.010
able to have businesses
come in and say,

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.930
this is how your employees
are going to be impacted,

00:46:49.930 --> 00:46:52.200
this is days we'd like
you to let them out early,

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.510
these are days we'd
like let them maybe stay

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:55.800
home and work in the morning.

00:46:55.800 --> 00:47:00.300
So it was that constant
communication and transparency,

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.920
working with those businesses,
that made it work in the end.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.100
And again, Frank was a
good partner in that.

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.975
And I think they used
that model a little bit

00:47:06.975 --> 00:47:09.311
going forward at other Super
Bowls on that real detail

00:47:09.311 --> 00:47:09.810
planning.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.100
FRANK SUPOVITZ:
Yeah, and Minneapolis

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:12.724
is going to face the
same kind of thing

00:47:12.724 --> 00:47:16.200
because their stadium is right
at the edge of their downtown

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:16.710
area.

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:19.890
I do want to thank
you for also having

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:21.510
the state capitol right there.

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:22.120
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yes,
we have the state capitol,

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.220
the state government
right in the middle of it.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:24.970
FRANK SUPOVITZ: On top
of everything else,

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:29.070
you had the center of
the state government.

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:35.300
And at the time, there was
a labor dispute brewing.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:40.230
Indiana was converting
to a right-to-work state.

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:42.720
So of course, there
were an enormous number

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:50.120
of union personnel who took that
very hard, for obvious reasons.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.410
And what was really
interesting about it--

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:56.040
this is the power of
what the Super Bowl does.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.390
I actually watched.

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:00.660
When the vote was taken to
be a right-to-work state,

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:03.450
all of a sudden there were
thousands of people mobilized

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:05.280
outside the state capitol.

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.840
And they all decide to march on
Super Bowl Village, thousands

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:10.822
of them.

00:48:10.822 --> 00:48:12.780
And there's a big crowd
of people at Super Bowl

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:14.400
Village on top of that.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:17.241
So I, of course,
alert the people

00:48:17.241 --> 00:48:19.740
I need to alert that something
like that is about to happen.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:22.030
And I'm watching it go.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.560
And then it finds its way
into Super Bowl Village.

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:28.410
And the next thing
I do is take a photo

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.270
of the protesters
with their signs

00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:32.497
down, standing in a
circle, holding a beer,

00:48:32.497 --> 00:48:33.330
having a great time.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:34.288
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yes.

00:48:34.288 --> 00:48:36.469
In line to go on the zipline.

00:48:36.469 --> 00:48:38.760
FRANK SUPOVITZ: They were in
line to go on the zipline.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:45.505
It just became everybody's
party at the end of the day--

00:48:45.505 --> 00:48:47.880
ALLISON MELANGTON: They got
absorbed into the atmosphere.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.380
PAT GALLAGHER:
--even for the people

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:51.240
who had something
to complain about,

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:54.280
and justifiably
so in some cases.

00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:56.790
They are having a blast.

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:59.010
That's the great
unifier of what a Super

00:48:59.010 --> 00:49:01.429
Bowl does as an American
cultural experience.

00:49:01.429 --> 00:49:02.720
AUDIENCE: Excellent, thank you.

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:04.179
ALLISON MELANGTON:
Yeah, thank you.

00:49:04.179 --> 00:49:06.636
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could comment a little bit

00:49:06.636 --> 00:49:07.500
about ticket prices.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:09.140
Every year, there's
always a news story

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.140
about how much they go
for on the auction sites.

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:13.260
And the armchair
economist in me has always

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:14.950
wondered, why don't
they just charge

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:19.050
the market clearing price for
the tickets to begin with?

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:21.590
FRANK SUPOVITZ: They've
been headed that way.

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:25.830
So my first Super Bowl in the
director's chair, I guess,

00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:29.700
was in 2006.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.920
And tickets were $400 and $500.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.510
And the secondary market
was largely shady.

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:38.610
You didn't have these
marketplaces that

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:41.460
are much more legitimate today.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:43.110
You were really
taking a chance back

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:47.200
then if you were buying
tickets on the open market.

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:51.760
They didn't really track it
the same way as they do today.

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:55.950
Today, the lowest
ticket price is $950,

00:49:55.950 --> 00:49:58.650
and the highest ticket
price is $4,500.

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:02.640
So if you think they
haven't closed that gap,

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.010
you're making more
money than I thought.

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:10.800
Because it went from $400
to $950 and $500 to $4,500.

00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.700
So they got there.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.730
The other thing that
the NFL is doing

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:18.100
is they're now in the
secondary ticket business.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:20.470
So they can actually resell
the ticket they already

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:26.070
sold through their
acquisition of PrimeSport

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.920
and through On
Location, which now they

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:33.420
own a percentage of, 49%
of this ticket packager

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.960
and secondary ticket outlet.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.910
So they are actually
participating

00:50:38.910 --> 00:50:41.310
in the secondary market now.

00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:46.290
And so the gap has
significantly shrunk.

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:50.190
But they also have an incentive
to keep it because now they

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:52.191
participate in it.

00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:55.129
SPEAKER: This will
be our last question.

00:50:55.129 --> 00:50:55.795
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:50:55.795 --> 00:50:56.920
I wrote down my question.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.310
So first of all, thank you
for coming and sharing.

00:50:59.310 --> 00:51:02.304
I'm a fan of all things NFL,
and specifically, a Raiders fan.

00:51:02.304 --> 00:51:03.720
Not sure if that's
a popular thing

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.150
to disclose to the San
Francisco planning team,

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:07.550
but I'm unabashed
in that regard.

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:08.610
STEPHANIE MARTIN: That's great.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:10.590
AUDIENCE: So this is
something that I'm not sure

00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:11.923
if you're at liberty to discuss.

00:51:11.923 --> 00:51:15.270
But I'm interested to hear how
national security, emergency

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:19.050
preparation concerns factor into
the decision-making process.

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:24.270
And how do those considerations
restrict what is possible?

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:26.400
And what are some things
that we could have had

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.184
were it not for those concerns?

00:51:28.184 --> 00:51:29.850
FRANK SUPOVITZ: I'm
not going to address

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:33.390
the things that could have
because your imagination can

00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:34.191
take you there.

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:35.190
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yeah.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:37.070
FRANK SUPOVITZ:
But the Super Bowl

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:38.970
is a level one national
security event.

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:41.370
It's the only annual one.

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:45.750
And that requires a
security perimeter,

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:49.200
which is pretty significant,
around the stadium.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:51.390
So typically it's
2 and 1/2 miles

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:54.780
worth of fencing
and barricading.

00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:58.200
Everyone who goes to the stadium
goes through a magnetometer,

00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:00.810
just like going to the airport.

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:02.760
Now, some of the events like--

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.490
Super Bowl Village
didn't have this issue.

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:08.760
Super Bowl Boulevard here in
New York didn't have that issue.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.620
In San Francisco,
you had the issue.

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:15.360
So they've actually started
to enclose the free fan

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.270
events as well, and you go
through magnetometers for that,

00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:19.472
too.

00:52:19.472 --> 00:52:21.180
PAT GALLAGHER: So we
had a million people

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.460
in nine days come to
downtown San Francisco.

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:26.940
And they had to go through
a security checkpoint

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.270
to get screened.

00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:33.085
We also, of the 5,500
volunteers that we had,

00:52:33.085 --> 00:52:35.460
we had to submit each one of
them for a background check.

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.060
FRANK SUPOVITZ:
Every one of them

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.504
gets FBI background checked.

00:52:37.504 --> 00:52:39.045
PAT GALLAGHER:
Everyone gets checked.

00:52:39.045 --> 00:52:43.050
So it's a wide ranging sort
of thing to sort of protect.

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:44.520
And then actually,
at the event, we

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:49.230
had security with a presence,
with weapons and stuff.

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.960
A lot of people wanted to get
their picture taken with them,

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.340
which was another issue.

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.660
FRANK SUPOVITZ: But most
of it, you don't see.

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:55.440
You don't see.

00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:56.520
Most of it you don't see.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.980
And there's a temporary
flight restriction, a TFR.

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.220
Commercial air traffic
has to be diverted away

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:05.010
from stadiums, which becomes
really difficult when

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:06.810
your stadium is right
next to an airport.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:13.920
For example, all of
the corporate folks

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.520
that come in on private jets,
they can't leave until an hour

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.210
after the game.

00:53:18.210 --> 00:53:20.418
If they want to cut out
early and get to their plane,

00:53:20.418 --> 00:53:23.000
that plane's not taking off
until an hour after the game.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.750
So there's a lot of
those kinds of things.

00:53:24.750 --> 00:53:26.708
ALLISON MELANGTON: It's
a multi-agency effort--

00:53:26.708 --> 00:53:28.130
federal, regional, state, local.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:29.070
FRANK SUPOVITZ:
Everybody's there.

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:30.600
STEPHANIE MARTIN: And you're
working on it for a year.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:31.667
ALLISON MELANGTON: Yeah.

00:53:31.667 --> 00:53:33.750
STEPHANIE MARTIN: November,
before our Super Bowl,

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:35.260
which was only
just a few months,

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:38.640
we had both the Paris and San
Bernardino attacks happen.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:42.160
And so bringing everyone back
together to just double check,

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.490
triple check every single thing.

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:48.030
You feel very fortunate because
of all the planning that

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:50.790
has gone into place, you really
feel very strongly about it

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:51.750
and very good about it.

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.030
But then you're in a place where
you feel very uncomfortable all

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.920
of a sudden.

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.050
So to be able to have
all those plans in place

00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:00.734
and then to build on
what has been happening

00:54:00.734 --> 00:54:03.150
Super Bowl after Super Bowl
after Super Bowl does give you

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:04.649
that comfort level.

00:54:04.649 --> 00:54:05.190
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:06.500
Thank you very much.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:07.360
SPEAKER: All right.

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:08.818
Well, thank you
all for being here,

00:54:08.818 --> 00:54:11.210
and thanks for
sharing your stories.

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:13.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:18.260
I did want to quickly highlight
that we do have the "Big Game,

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.400
Bigger Impact" for
sale in the back,

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.300
and Pat and Stephanie
will be there

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.630
to sign if you want a copy.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:23.269
So thanks everyone for coming.

00:54:23.269 --> 00:54:24.310
PAT GALLAGHER: Thank you.

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:25.860
STEPHANIE MARTIN: Thank you.
