00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:01.490
- [Voiceover] So I have a circle here,

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.345
with a center at point O and
let's pick an arbitrary point

00:00:05.345 --> 00:00:07.109
that sits outside of the circle.

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.524
So let me just pick this
point right over here.

00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:11.010
Point A.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.726
And if I have an arbitrary
point outside of the circle,

00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:16.083
I can actually draw two
different tangent lines

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:19.949
that contain A, that are
tangent to this circle.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.272
Let me draw them.

00:00:21.272 --> 00:00:24.835
So one of them would look like this.

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:27.464
Let me just start right over here.

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:29.208
So I make a tangent to the circle.

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:31.604
So it could look like that.

00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:35.841
And then the other one
would look like this,

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:38.105
would look like,

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:39.997
would look like that.

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:41.182
Now let's say that the point

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:44.362
that the tangent lines
intersect the circle,

00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:49.238
let's say this point right
over here, is point B,

00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:53.522
and this point right over here is point C.

00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:55.716
This is point C. Right over here.

00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:57.283
What I want to prove

00:00:57.283 --> 00:01:01.962
What I want to prove
is that the segment AB

00:01:01.962 --> 00:01:04.414
is congruent to the segment AC,

00:01:04.414 --> 00:01:07.825
or another way of thinking
about it, I want to prove,

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:10.588
let me do this in a new color
that I haven't used yet,

00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:15.588
I want to prove that this
segment, right over here,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.084
is congruent to this segment...

00:01:20.084 --> 00:01:23.683
is congruent to that segment.

00:01:23.683 --> 00:01:25.888
I encourage you to pause the video

00:01:25.888 --> 00:01:29.661
and try to work it out on your own

00:01:29.661 --> 00:01:32.006
before I work through it.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:34.467
Alright, now let's try to
work through this together.

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:35.490
And to work through this together,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.394
I'm going to actually
set up two triangles.

00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:39.532
Two triangles.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.735
And they're going to be right triangles

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:41.916
as we'll see in a second.

00:01:41.916 --> 00:01:46.246
So let me draw some lines
here to set up our triangles.

00:01:46.246 --> 00:01:47.907
So I'm going to draw one line,

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:52.907
just like that, and then we draw that.

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:56.583
And then, let me draw that.

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.071
Now what do we know

00:01:59.071 --> 00:02:00.472
about these triangles?

00:02:00.472 --> 00:02:01.435
Well, as I mentioned,

00:02:01.435 --> 00:02:02.979
we're going to be dealing
with right triangles.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.012
How do I know that?

00:02:04.012 --> 00:02:05.115
Well, in a previous video, we saw that

00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:09.039
if we have a radius
intersecting a tangent line,

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.999
that they intersect at right angles.

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.636
We've proven this.

00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:15.253
So that's a radius. That's a tangent line.

00:02:15.253 --> 00:02:16.949
They're going to intersect
at a right angle.

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:21.906
So radius, tangent line, they
intersect at a right angle.

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:26.341
We also know, since OB
and OC are both radii,

00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:28.500
that they're both the length
of the radius of the circle.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.705
So this side, right over here,

00:02:30.705 --> 00:02:32.598
let me do some new colors here,

00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:36.278
so this side is going to
be congruent to that side.

00:02:36.278 --> 00:02:39.586
And you can see that the
hypotenuse of both circles

00:02:39.586 --> 00:02:42.582
is the same side, side OA,

00:02:42.582 --> 00:02:44.848
so of course, it is equal to itself.

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:46.367
This is equal to itself.

00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:51.185
So we see triangle ABO and triangle ACO,

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:55.108
they're both right triangles
that have two sides in common,

00:02:55.108 --> 00:02:56.943
in particular, they both have a hypotenuse

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:57.999
that are equal to each other

00:02:57.999 --> 00:03:00.379
and they both have a base, or a leg.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:03.200
And we know from Hypotenuse-Leg Congruence

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.767
that if you have two right triangles,

00:03:04.767 --> 00:03:07.333
where the hypotenuses are equal,

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:08.847
and you have a leg that are equal,

00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:12.307
then the both triangles
are going to be congruent.

00:03:12.307 --> 00:03:17.008
So triangle ABO is
congruent to triangle ACO.

00:03:17.008 --> 00:03:18.924
And in that proof where
we prove it, as well,

00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:20.897
the Pythagorean theorem tells us

00:03:20.897 --> 00:03:22.047
if you know two sides of a right triangle

00:03:22.047 --> 00:03:24.380
that determines what the third side is.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.981
So the third side, so length of AB

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:29.418
is going to be the same
thing as the length of AC.

00:03:29.418 --> 00:03:30.986
Once again, it just comes out of,

00:03:30.986 --> 00:03:33.284
these are both right
triangles, if two sides,

00:03:33.284 --> 00:03:35.641
if two corresponding sides
of these two right triangles

00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:37.220
are congruent, then the third side has to,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.182
that comes straight from
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:40.203
And there you go.

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:42.722
We hopefully feel good about the fact that

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:45.137
AB is going to be congruent to AC.

00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:45.984
Or another way to think about it,

00:03:45.984 --> 00:03:47.761
if I take a point outside of a circle,

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:50.698
and I construct segments that
are tangent to the circle,

00:03:50.698 --> 00:03:52.323
that those two segments are going to be

00:03:52.323 --> 00:03:54.767
congruent to each other.
