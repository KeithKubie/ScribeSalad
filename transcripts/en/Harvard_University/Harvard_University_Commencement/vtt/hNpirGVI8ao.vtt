00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:09.780
in 1951 in a poem titled Harlem Langston
Hughes asked a question I continue to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:18.720
ask myself today what happens to a dream
deferred does it dry up like A Raisin in

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.099
the Sun when my mother was a little girl
growing up in the Nigerian village of Ososo

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.910
her and her four siblings would get
super excited whenever one of them would

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.750
accomplish something noteworthy why well
it meant that her dad would do the tree

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.680
thing that's when the smile was
stretched across his face as he climbed

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.360
a tall tree branch by branch all the way
to the very top his children down below

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.750
would look up at him eyes wide
sparkling and full of joy as he yelled

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:04.920
out higher higher and higher though
proud he was also never satisfied he had

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.280
a dream that his children and his
children's children would strive for

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.939
even greater things a big part of that
dream was a pursuit of an education you

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.680
see while in some families bedtime
stories are of dragons princesses and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.810
castles in Nigerian families our stories
consists of law school med school and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:38.640
Harvard and I'm only kinda joking after
all educational opportunity is what

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.299
drove my parents to trek across the
Atlantic from Nigeria to Toronto Canada

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.429
before I was born
and so throughout my high school

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.049
education I like many of you strove for
excellence with hours of study meetings

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.390
and practice all to fulfill the goal of
one day attending Harvard and on

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.859
December 13th 2013 that dream came true
I along with 2,000 other high school

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.369
seniors was fortunate enough to receive
an acceptance letter from Harvard

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.950
University and my first thought after
reading that letter was that my

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.739
grandfather in that tree and I knew it
was time to aim higher but I wasn't

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.290
quite sure yet we're doing eight months
later I was preparing for my freshman

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.310
year at Harvard little did I know events
happening over 700 miles southwest of my

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.239
home in Toronto Canada which transformed
my dream and my life forever

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.239
these events would shatter the sheltered
comfort of the life my parents had

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:49.590
created for me because on August 9th
2014 just over a week before I would

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.299
arrive at Harvard for the first time
Michael Brown was shot and killed by the

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.190
police in his hometown of Ferguson
Missouri through his death

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.329
I saw what happens to those whose dreams
are deferred and ultimately denied they

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:13.950
are left to dry up abandoned like his
dead murdered body which lay on the

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:22.500
streets of Ferguson under the hot
Missouri Sun for eight hours eight hours

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.650
just like me
Michael was black just like me Michael

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.760
was 18 just like me Michael was about to
go to college unlike me however he would

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:41.669
never get the chance to see that dream
realized and it was at that moment it

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:48.120
hit me after years of believing that my
grandfather's dream meant educational

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.419
attainment the accumulation of the
accolades or even acceptance to Harvard

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:59.370
Michael Brown's death woke me up
it made me realize the dream was about

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.409
much more than how high we can climb in
that tree as individuals it was about

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.599
how we can encourage and enable those
like Michael Brown whose dreams are

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:14.329
deferred and denied the climb with us

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.289
and

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.740
and while education is the essential
part of achieving that dream we often

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:32.590
forget it is an incomplete answer we
forget that textbooks don't do much to

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.910
teach us about compassion and that
problem sets don't necessarily teach us

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.949
about the unconditional and unfaltering
love of others we forget that whether

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.120
you are a banker a teacher or an
activist the dream should be about

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.440
creating the conditions for life liberty
and the pursuit of happiness for

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.389
everyone who walks his planet and so
while we strive to achieve our dreams

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.120
with the privileges that this Harvard
education affords us we can't forget

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.300
just how many dreams have been deferred
denied and left to drive like A Raisin

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:13.840
in the Sun you see I never met my
grandfather except through history of

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.949
dreams but today I stand before you as a
proud grandson of a Nigerian carpenter

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.940
the child of 2fNigerian immigrants and a
graduate of one of the greatest

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.470
institutions in the world

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:39.460
proof proof that while we all have
dreams some of us have to travel farther

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:46.260
to achieve them both figuratively and
literally my wish is that with our help

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.120
more dreams can be converted into
realities that is a calling that the

00:05:52.120 --> 00:06:00.090
class of 2018 must answer a dual mandate
to do well and to do good to wake up

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:06.210
look around and help those whose crime
is stifled by the burdens of oppression

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.810
your future in my future in the future
of our society depends on us creating

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.710
supporting and investing in the dreams
that the next generation can live up to

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.680
and build upon it depends on us looking
one another in the eye and telling one

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.680
another to continue to strive for more
to keep growing and to never ever stop

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:37.500
climbing because the next generation is
watching looking up at us eyes wide

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:48.210
sparkling and full of joy as we yell out
higher higher and higher

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:05.040
