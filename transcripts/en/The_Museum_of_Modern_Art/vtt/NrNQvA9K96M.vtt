00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.859
This is Making Space: Women Artist and Postwar
Abstraction, a new exhibition here at MoMA.

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.150
The title, “Making Space,” refers to the
fact that there were so many women artists

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.920
working in the decades right after World War
II who had to find a way to make space for

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.839
themselves in the art world and space to do
their work, and they worked with abstraction.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:31.289
And we can think about abstraction as a way
of making space within your artwork.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.580
And so that's what they were doing as well
in many different ways which are explored

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.110
in this exhibition.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.330
As you can see we have all different types
of works including photography, painting.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.230
There's sculpture.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.940
There's works on paper, drawings, and collages.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:01.570
And here we are in the first section of the
exhibition which deals with a type of abstraction

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.089
known as "gestural abstraction.”

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.469
Gestural abstraction or abstract expressionism
was all about the act of painting, the gestures

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.189
of painting.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:19.640
And it's a movement that's probably most closely
associated with a number of men, especially

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.490
Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and others.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.259
But there were a number of women artists who
we see in this section who were making amazing

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:39.770
works during this time and they have not received
the same recognition and credit as those men.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.549
And one of the women artists that I'm talking
about is Lee Krasner who made this painting

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.399
titled "Gaea" in 1966.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.530
To make this painting, Krasner used her whole
body in the process.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.220
It's such a large canvas that to get those
rolling, somersaulting shapes, she had to

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.969
use her whole arms in sort of forceful gestures.

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.319
And if you look closely, you can see these
kind of somersaulting shapes and these almost

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:19.989
floral colors that reflect her longstanding
interest in nature, the natural world in primordial

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.010
forces.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.280
You'll see all these kind of splatter marks
and splashes.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.680
So it just suggests all the energy and the
sense of freedom and spontaneity that she

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.829
poured into making this work.

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:38.829
We'll keep going.

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:46.790
There's a beautiful section that has to deal
with what we termed "reductive abstraction,"

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.870
which is almost minimalist, dealing a lot
with the grid and monochrome, especially white.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.060
And then here, this section has largely to
do with the phenomenon known as fiber art.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.890
And we're gonna look at this massive weaving
by Magdalena Abakanowicz.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.920
This work is titled "Abakan" which was the
name she gave to a lot of these large-scale

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.710
weavings that she created in the '60s.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.840
And the word “Abakan” refers to her last
name, Abakanowicz.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.099
The shape and the form of this work have all
kinds of associations and suggestions for

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.129
us as viewers.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.409
If you look closely on it, the weaving is
very uneven.

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.769
It's very coarse in some places.

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:43.099
You can see the rope aspect of it here and
some of these aspects of the weaving almost

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.940
look like scars.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.030
She had lived through World War II in Poland.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:56.709
She lived through the Soviet occupation so
there's very much a sense of trauma and healing

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.659
and scarification in her works.

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:09.069
This is a work by Lee Bontecou, an American
artist who emerged in the late '50s and '60s.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.620
Bontecou lived in New York at the time that
she made this.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:21.009
She lived above a laundry and she found the
leftover conveyor belts, the canvas from the

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:25.270
conveyor belts, and she used those to make
this work.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.460
So there's elements of canvas, and then she
stitched them with copper wire onto this steel

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.870
armature.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.110
So it's really a very...a combination.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.110
It's in a space that's sort of between painting
and sculpture.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.970
And in terms of the abstract form, it's also
is in an in-between place.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.819
On the one hand, it's very organic in its
shape.

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:57.070
On the other hand, there's a sense of the
mechanical in terms of the material that she

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.770
used.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.310
There's this black void in the center which
is also very suggestive.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:13.419
Does it refer to some kind of a body part
or does it refer to, again, something from

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.800
industry like an airplane engine or something
like that?

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.500
A lot of the works in this gallery were made
in the '60s which was in a period when many

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.319
artists—men and women—were questioning
traditional assumptions about what art could

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:33.360
be, what it could be made off, how it could
be made.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:40.759
And this was an important new direction that
women artists were especially involved in

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.389
pushing forward.

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.139
Women were very much pioneers of this new
direction.

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:53.600
And, in one way, we can see it as a way of
separating themselves from the tradition of

00:05:53.600 --> 00:06:00.210
oil and canvas, and sculpture and bronze that
had been defined by men for centuries and

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:06.170
finding a new way, making a new space where
they could do new things that didn't have

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:14.199
the weight of history, that didn't have a
hierarchical terms that put them in a separate

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.199
category.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.210
And so they became major pioneers of this
new direction in art.
