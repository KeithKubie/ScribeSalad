00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:01.757
- [Instructor] We're going
to continue our discussion

00:00:01.757 --> 00:00:03.283
on the law of supply

00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:05.760
and in particular in this video

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.103
we're gonna get a little bit deeper

00:00:07.103 --> 00:00:08.533
to make sure we understand the difference

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.277
between a change in supply

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.174
and I'm just using the
Greek letter delta here

00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:15.243
for shorthand for change in supply

00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:18.243
versus a change in quantity supplied

00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:23.085
and just as a bit of review,

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:24.834
we've talked about it in other videos,

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:27.824
supply is referring to
the entire supply curve

00:00:27.824 --> 00:00:29.078
and this curve right over here

00:00:29.078 --> 00:00:31.267
has the typical shape of a supply curve

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:32.597
following the law of supply.

00:00:32.597 --> 00:00:36.499
At low prices, suppliers
would provide low quantities

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:37.580
and at higher prices,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.190
suppliers would provide higher quantities,

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.605
so a change in supply would be a shift

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:44.121
in this entire curve,

00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:46.769
so for example, if you
were to go from this curve,

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.055
let's call this S1 and
we were to have a shift

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:51.280
to the right,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.363
this right over here would
be a change in supply,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.207
so we'd call this S2

00:00:59.964 --> 00:01:01.577
and we would have this shift,

00:01:01.577 --> 00:01:02.712
you could view it as to the right

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:04.484
or to the right and down,

00:01:04.484 --> 00:01:07.693
so this would be our change in supply.

00:01:07.693 --> 00:01:10.656
Likewise, you could have a
change in supply the other way

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:12.562
where you go to the left

00:01:12.562 --> 00:01:15.014
and up depending on
how you want to view it

00:01:15.014 --> 00:01:15.923
and so, this would be,

00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:18.378
we could call that supply curve three.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.934
These would all represent shifts in supply

00:01:20.934 --> 00:01:23.193
or changes in supply.

00:01:23.193 --> 00:01:24.992
When we talk about quantity supplied,

00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:28.545
we're talking about shifts
along one of these curves,

00:01:28.545 --> 00:01:31.568
so for example, at some price,

00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:34.242
so let's say we have this
price P1 right over here,

00:01:34.242 --> 00:01:35.572
associated with that price

00:01:35.572 --> 00:01:37.934
we would have some quantity supplied,

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.963
we have some quantity supplied.

00:01:40.963 --> 00:01:44.477
Let's call it quantity supplied one

00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:46.786
and then let's say for some reason,

00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:48.456
we have a shift in price

00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:51.318
with the market forces not changing

00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:53.158
from a supplier's point of view

00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:56.339
and so, let's say we go to price two,

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:57.554
let's say we go to price two,

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:00.577
we would shift along that same curve,

00:02:00.577 --> 00:02:02.433
the curve itself wouldn't have shifted

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:06.100
and so, then you have
quantity supplied two,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.611
so change in supply is
a shift of the curve

00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:13.402
to the left and up or
to the right and down

00:02:13.402 --> 00:02:15.374
versus a change in quantity supplied

00:02:15.374 --> 00:02:18.217
is moving along the curve

00:02:18.217 --> 00:02:20.775
and the associated quantities.

00:02:20.775 --> 00:02:22.118
Now, with that out of the way,

00:02:22.118 --> 00:02:23.732
let's do some tangible examples

00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:25.519
and think about would
it result in a change

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.407
in supply or a change
in quantity supplied?

00:02:29.407 --> 00:02:32.824
So, let's say that the government decides

00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:36.741
that gas prices are too high

00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:39.163
and so, they institute a price cap

00:02:39.163 --> 00:02:41.056
and we're gonna talk much
more about price caps

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:42.358
in future videos

00:02:42.358 --> 00:02:44.264
but a price cap might just say,

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.672
and let's say that price cap

00:02:45.672 --> 00:02:47.726
is below the current price.

00:02:47.726 --> 00:02:49.773
So, let's say the current price is at P2

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:52.440
and that the price cap is at P3,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.893
so the government says,

00:02:55.893 --> 00:03:00.539
no one is allowed to charge
more than P3 for gasoline.

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:01.662
What would that result in?

00:03:01.662 --> 00:03:03.680
Would that result in a change in supply

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.439
or a change in the quantity supplied?

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.110
Well, this is a classic case

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.777
of a shift along a supply curve,

00:03:12.752 --> 00:03:14.123
the price was there before,

00:03:14.123 --> 00:03:15.924
now it shifts here and so,
now we're going to have

00:03:15.924 --> 00:03:18.270
a different quantity supplied,

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.479
so this would be quantity supplied three,

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.812
so this is a change in quantity supplied

00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:31.761
and in this case, the
change in quantity supplied

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:34.889
would go down assuming that the price cap

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:39.495
is below what the price
was before the price cap.

00:03:39.495 --> 00:03:41.087
Now, let's give another scenario.

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:45.170
Let's say that the price
of refining gas goes up.

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:51.045
Price of refining goes up.

00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:54.809
What would that do?

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:56.153
Would that be a change in supply

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:58.515
or a change in quantity supplied?

00:03:58.515 --> 00:04:01.484
And pause this video to think about it.

00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:05.659
Well, this is something
that would increase the cost

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.409
of producing gasoline

00:04:08.728 --> 00:04:11.349
which is refined from oil across the board

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.293
regardless of what price we're at,

00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:15.353
so this would be a general shift,

00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:18.020
this would be a change in supply

00:04:19.032 --> 00:04:20.521
and the entire supply curve,

00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:22.556
think about which way it would shift,

00:04:22.556 --> 00:04:26.473
think about it from a
supplier's point of view.

00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:29.424
At a given quantity,

00:04:29.424 --> 00:04:31.898
so let's say we're at this
quantity right over here,

00:04:31.898 --> 00:04:33.071
at a given quantity,

00:04:33.071 --> 00:04:35.862
they would now want to
charge a higher price

00:04:35.862 --> 00:04:39.098
and it doesn't apply
to just that quantity,

00:04:39.098 --> 00:04:40.602
it could be this point in the curve,

00:04:40.602 --> 00:04:42.439
this point in the curve,
this point of the curve,

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.682
they'd want to charge a higher price

00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:46.493
to make up for the fact that refining

00:04:46.493 --> 00:04:47.762
is now more expensive

00:04:47.762 --> 00:04:49.305
and so, this would be a shift,

00:04:49.305 --> 00:04:51.822
you could view it up or shift upward

00:04:51.822 --> 00:04:53.452
and to the left.

00:04:53.452 --> 00:04:54.560
You could also view it the other way.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.977
At a given price,

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.487
suppliers would want to
provide less quantity

00:05:00.487 --> 00:05:01.907
because they need to make up the fact

00:05:01.907 --> 00:05:06.356
that they're paying more
for refining that gasoline

00:05:06.356 --> 00:05:08.145
and so, you could view
that as a shift to the left

00:05:08.145 --> 00:05:10.649
or a shift of up and to the left

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:13.207
and so, that would be in that direction,

00:05:13.207 --> 00:05:15.517
we're kind of shifting like that

00:05:15.517 --> 00:05:17.319
and then of course we
could talk about a scenario

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:18.907
that goes the other way.

00:05:18.907 --> 00:05:21.990
Well, let's say that the property tax

00:05:23.744 --> 00:05:24.866
in the entire market,

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:27.199
property tax on gas stations

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.330
goes down,

00:05:34.148 --> 00:05:37.956
so in theory, if the
property tax goes down,

00:05:37.956 --> 00:05:41.009
the cost of running a
gas station goes down

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:42.708
and this is for everyone in the market,

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:44.676
not just one player in the market

00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:47.679
and so, they might for a given price

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:50.764
be able to supply more of a quantity

00:05:50.764 --> 00:05:52.923
or for a given quantity

00:05:52.923 --> 00:05:54.840
be able to lower the price.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.605
Either way you could imagine shifting

00:05:56.605 --> 00:05:59.928
from S1 to something that looks like S2,

00:05:59.928 --> 00:06:01.780
going down and to the right

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.876
and so, once again,

00:06:02.876 --> 00:06:05.543
this would be a change in supply

00:06:06.507 --> 00:06:09.189
because you would have a shift regardless

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:11.868
of what price and quantity supplied

00:06:11.868 --> 00:06:13.618
you are actually at.
