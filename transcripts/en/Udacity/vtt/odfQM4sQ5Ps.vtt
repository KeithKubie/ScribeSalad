00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So let's look at these from the top down.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
First, if P equals NP would that mean that every computational

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
problem could be solved in polynomial time?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Well, no, actually it wouldn't.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
First of all, there are problems that simply can't be solved it turns out,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which we'll get to later in the course.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But even if we restrict ourselves to problems

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that can actually be solved by a computer,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
there are still problems that would not be solvable in polynomial time.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In fact, we mentioned an example of this in an earlier assignment

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
where if you wanted to print out all the sub lists of list,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
then necessarily that means that it will

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
execute in exponential time not polynomial time because

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
you have to print out every single possible sub list,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and that's a case where the if better construction doesn't actually help you out,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so this is not the case.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
However, the next one is true.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
If P were not equal to NP and we proved this,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
then that would mean that no

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
NP-complete problems could be solved in polynomial time.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That's in fact part of the definition of P not equal to NP.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And for the next one, this is also actually true.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This is a little tricky and somewhat subjective depending on

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
what you mean by easier here,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but it's certainly the case that despite NP-complete problems all being

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
in some sense as hard as each other,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we might care about a certain subset of instances of a problem

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that for whatever reason are easier to solve in practice

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
than another problem might be,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and that really depends on what in practice you are concerned about

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and which instances of a problem that tend to come up in practice.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And for the fourth one, this is not true.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The ability to solve some instances of an NP-complete problem

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
does not imply that P equals NP.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
For example, you can find the clique or a clique

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
or a minimum vertex cover too

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of an empty graph relatively easily.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's, well, nothing because the empty graph has no vertices and no edges.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
That's an example of an instance that you can

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
quite possibly always solve

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
or you should always be able to solve very quickly,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but that doesn't mean that you can solve all instances.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And for P equals NP,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we really have to concern ourselves with

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
every single possible instance of a problem,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and that's really where NP becomes quite complicated.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And finally, showing a problem is NP-complete

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
means it can't be solved in polynomial time.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Well, no. In order to do this,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
we would actually have to show that NP is not NP

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
or rather P does not equal NP.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
That's really the problem we're talking about here in not so many word.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So just being NP-complete isn't enough.

00:02:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
We also have to prove that P does not equal NP.
