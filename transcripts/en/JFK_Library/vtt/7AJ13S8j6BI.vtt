00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:01.999
- We have our ice cream truck,

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:03.941
and I always say that's
our ace in the hole.

00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:05.469
We have two ice cream trucks now,

00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:08.879
and I always joke, I said,
If you told me 37 years ago,

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.839
coming on this job, that
our officers would enjoy

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.919
riding around in full uniform,
in an ice cream truck,

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:16.891
I'd say you're crazy.

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.677
But, that's the type of
policeing that we are now.

00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:22.575
I only bring that up,
because Chelsea Byankays,

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:26.495
who's a great partner, he's
buying ice cream truck now.

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:29.576
So, like, St. Louis has
bought an ice cream truck.

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:31.707
So everyone's buying ice cream trucks now

00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:35.125
because what a better way
to interact with young kids.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:37.637
Especially after, heaven
forbid, I remember

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:41.227
in Washington Park off
of one of the boulevards,

00:00:41.227 --> 00:00:44.245
we had a young kid shot
and people were fearful

00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:46.317
to go back and the next
day we were down there

00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:47.405
giving out hoodsies.

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.881
So that's become a key
component of who we are.
