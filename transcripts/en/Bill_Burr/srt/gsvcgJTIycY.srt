1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,800
Hey. What's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:06,090
just before Friday,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,360
Monday morning podcast and just checking
in on you so I couldn't give you a big

4
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:11,911
one.

5
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:16,911
I fucked up my voice going all
the way back to San Jose Cruz,

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:21,930
uh, Beck, the San Jose Gigs. I
Dunno what I did. I know what I did.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,440
I was imitating somebody yelling.
I was having too much fun.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,800
I didn't come from my diaphragm and I
fucking choked up and I just fucking blew

9
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,610
the voice out.
That's what I did.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,110
I always spent the main rotor and my
fucking throat is what had happened.

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,580
So now I, uh, I gotta go easy. You know,
I got drink a little throat coat tea,

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,600
you know. Um, anyways, what's
going on? How are you guys doing?

13
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:51,300
You're feeling good. I get energized
and excited about the fucking weekend.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,050
Um, I've actually been
working out finally. I'm still
eating like a fucking moron,

15
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,380
so I haven't been dropped that
much weight, but I feel better.

16
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,480
You know what it is. I'm at this
fucking age. I swear to God.

17
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,430
I have one sip of this,

18
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,810
a one bite of that and it just fucks me.

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,320
It's unbelievable. I swear to God, if
I didn't work out, I would be like,

20
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:19,050
I would look like every other fucking
war on walking around the mall.

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,010
That's all it is.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,660
I'm really starting to believe that a
lot of people now was kid knew we shove a

23
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:29,250
bunch of cake down our throats. I just, I
don't, I don't know what the fuck it is. I

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,740
know.
It was just weird how he said that.

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,610
I eat like a fucking
Olympian until about three,

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,810
four in the afternoon.
I work out like a soccer mom,

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,920
but I eat like a fucking
Olympian because my shoulders,

28
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,590
my shoulders coming
around, by the way. Um,

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,740
so I'm doing like the elliptical and
that type of shit put up for the fight up

30
00:01:49,741 --> 00:01:53,370
until about three. I
fucking kill it, you know?

31
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,330
And then the weakness starts coming
in like a fucking cold front,

32
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,800
like a rainstorm.

33
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:02,160
The cloud start forming around
three or three 30 in the afternoon.

34
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,180
And I feel myself getting wheat going,
come on, Bill. Come on. Veggies, veggies,

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,890
fuzzy, shoved down your
pie hall. Let's meet baton.

36
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,190
That's me putting fucking
plywood over the windows.

37
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,790
You know, before I do something stupid.
And then just, you know, I dunno,

38
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,530
I keep trying to do this thing where
I'm going to be done eating around six

39
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:25,080
o'clock at night and then just
drink waters the rest of the time.

40
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,190
And if I get hungry, I'm just going
to have a little bit of celery.

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,720
And I know salaries on the dirty dozen
list of fucking pesticides is basically

42
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:36,840
anything where they just spray it
directly on like cantaloupes. Good.

43
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,730
Cause they spray the shit on, you know
the fucking Ebola, you know what I mean?

44
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,090
The AIDS virus, whatever the fuck
they do to keep the mosquitoes away,

45
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:47,760
they spray and spray it right
on the fucking cantaloupe.

46
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,440
But it doesn't get to the part that you
eat and you don't lick the outside of it.

47
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,540
You know the way fat show licked is the
bottom of his sneakers in the MTV cribs.

48
00:02:57,541 --> 00:03:00,310
I will never get over
that. It's like, dude,

49
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:04,660
those were made in a sweatshop cause you
to walk around New York and we have no

50
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:09,130
fucking idea. Don't get
a tetanus shot, John. Um,

51
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,680
anyways, uh, fuck was I talking
about? And so salary, you know,

52
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,590
cause I'll spray it right on it cause
it doesn't have a husk or whatever the

53
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:19,450
fuck it is.
Um,

54
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,790
so this person tells you who just
go get organic salary, salary,

55
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,960
salary,
just get our Kerrick celery.

56
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,770
And I wanted it to be like [inaudible]
how to fuck you don't know where the fuck

57
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:37,940
any of this shit is. I think it all
comes from the same God damn farm.

58
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,790
And they go, oh that one looks greener
than those ones. Call them on organic.

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,790
That's about ready to go
and say that's organic.

60
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,820
And they'll think that the reason why
it's rotting is because, uh, you know,

61
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,670
because it's so fucking fresh.
I Dunno.

62
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,520
So at night I tried to do like the salary
have just a little bit half a spoonful

63
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:02,230
of sugar, no half full, half a spoonful
of peanut butter to try to get me through.

64
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,710
And, uh, you know, and then
you just go to bed like upset.

65
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,810
That's what happened. If you're
eating right, you go to upset,

66
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:18,490
you're not in a good mood. All right.
Now a lot of fucking nutritionists,

67
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,440
Dietitians, fucking personal trainers,
fucking crossfitters and all that.

68
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,430
It'll say like, no, if you really,

69
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,290
you shouldn't feel hungry at all because
you body will be full of all the new

70
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,350
cheesing needs and it will be
craving a shut the fuck up.

71
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,440
We get tight clothes dressing like
a goddamn x men to do fucking curls,

72
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,760
workout clothes at the dumbest.
It's a stupid as shit.

73
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,290
Yeah.

74
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,940
I was watching an old,
uh, odd couple Boto Ooh,

75
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,960
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh.

76
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,290
Two.

77
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,730
No. My favorite part of that song is
when the horn section kicks in ballet,

78
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,410
but that the to to do bow

79
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,780
[inaudible] back then when it
was actually a fucking orchestra,

80
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,340
it wasn't some guy with a laptop fucking
pumping his fists like he's going to

81
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:13,640
reboot the Arsenio show for the third
fucking time. It wasn't like that.

82
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,503
It was actual,

83
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,600
it was somebody that practice the
fucking trombone since he was knee high.

84
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,360
Fight in the dust bowl
during the depression right
before fucking Pearl Harbor

85
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:28,120
and he had to beat out
50,000 other Tuba players.

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,310
Everybody trying to put their own
stamp on [inaudible] but up buddy,

87
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,923
how you know,

88
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,310

known as dad's going to give him the

89
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:41,620
belt if he doesn't fucking book it right?

90
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,120
Yeah.

91
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,060
He's on the other side of the door just
listening to other people audition,

92
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,830
you know, proper proper
fuck. That guy nailed it.

93
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,330
Um, I was watching, I'm getting off track
here. I was watching that show and uh,

94
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,530
Oscar,
yeah,

95
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,560
Oscar w had come from the gym and he
just had on a gray sweatshirt and gray

96
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,600
sweatpants. He didn't have to go
in there all fucking aerodynamic.

97
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,510
Like he was doing a time
trial in the Tour de France.

98
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,790
All of this fucking shit that Nike makes.
Who's kidding?

99
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,210
Who that children make in
the Nike Factory? You know,

100
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,030
before they tried to jump out the
fucking window. Or is that apple?

101
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,900
I have no idea. It's all a
legend. I don't they, it,

102
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,490
it's fake news is children are happy.

103
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,200
They put the nets outside the window
because he enjoyed jumping into them.

104
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,000
It's a religious holiday. Um, Oh
God, I gotta work on my Trump.

105
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,300
I got to work my Trump. It's, well,
I'll tell you. It's rough, you know. Um,

106
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,660
that's all the fuck you need
now. Everybody's got all,
they got all the fucking,

107
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:51,650
but he's walking around dressed
like captain America. Oh my God.

108
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:56,651
I saw a shit show at the mall
yesterday and absolute fucking,

109
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,300
she,
she was such a shit show.

110
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:03,590
I actually was looking around for
someone to be trying to film me for my

111
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:08,330
reaction. Um, I had gone to the
mall again, that's twice in a week.

112
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,530
I never go to the mall
twice in a fucking week.

113
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,480
And this time I went to the growth. Now
if you don't, if you don't live in La,

114
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,850
okay.
The Grove is basically,

115
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,170
it's like going to times square on
New Year's Eve, except it's a mall.

116
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,890
It's a fucking nightmare.
All right.

117
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,960
But I was going down there
because I'm a man and I,

118
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:38,350

122
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,070
it gets really fucking cloudy for come
on pages and then it comes out again.

123
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,900
It's a great book.
Um,

124
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,500

was doing a book signing and as I said,

Thank you to everybody who showed up to

incredible read, man. I'm telling you.

143
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,790
It's fucking brutal. It's fucking
like if you already read his, his, uh,

144
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,090
Stevens was brutal enough,

145
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:15,430
but now to hear the mother's side going
through the pain to try and help them

146
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,910
out. I tell you, I'm going to be honest
with you. I haven't gotten through it yet.

147
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,440
That's so fucking brutal.
It is.

148
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,850
I just got into the part where Stephen
starts going off the rails and I'm just,

149
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,800
I got mad. I got to go like one
chapter at a time. Um, in other words,

150
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:32,520
she pulls no punches. So, uh, definitely
check that out if you can. So anyways,

151
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:37,440
back to this shit show. So
I'm going to the mall, right?

152
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,180
And uh,
I Polen I valet right?

153
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,090
I valet like a fucking big
shot cause this is our,

154
00:09:45,091 --> 00:09:49,970
this is to two things or I don't give
a fuck. I'm usually a frugal comment.

155
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,730
All right. My Malcolm
young tee shirt, right.

156
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,380
And I don't spend any fucking money cause
I know how this business works. Right?

157
00:09:58,381 --> 00:10:02,070
When you go out, you buy something
flashy. It's a look at him. Look at him,

158
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,160
look at that freckled gun.
He thinks he made it.

159
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,530
Then they come over and they walk in
here and get right out from underneath.

160
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:12,270
That's not ongoing out. Uh
Huh. Not, not me. Nope. I'm
going to buy some strip malls.

161
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,190
I'm going to start having some money
coming in from outside of this VA me,

162
00:10:19,191 --> 00:10:22,070
Hollywood,
um,

163
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,600
who's was who it's going to
be a sad ending just like
everybody else's. You know,

164
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,240
I'll come walking out one day on
some fucking telethon, you know,

165
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,620
my jaw fucking quivering uncontrollably.
And you guys all going to be like, oh,

166
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,420
what happened? Whenever I
used to be so young. Right.

167
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,160
And all you guys will have to shut
it off because I'll look so bad.

168
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:47,660
It's going to remind you of your
own mortality. Right? There you go.

169
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,020
There's something to look forward
to this weekend. Sorry. Anyways,

170
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,530
plowing ahead here. Um, so I'm
walking to the, to the mall, okay.

171
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,000
And a half shirts or back or
as they call them, crop tops.

172
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,340
All the ladies,

173
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,240
all the ladies who fucking
eat right or aware, a,

174
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,393
you know what I mean?

175
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:11,240
And I'm sure the fatties at some point
are going to hate them and say that those

176
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:15,560
crop tops are sexist and you're creating
an impossible body image and they're

177
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:20,000
going to blame those women that
actually took the time to fucking push

178
00:11:20,001 --> 00:11:25,001
themselves away at five o'clock and
just sit there eat and salary and shit.

179
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,170
Pass that drinking waters
hating themselves. You know,

180
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:35,000
here's all the people that are going to
resent the crop tops where they, huh? Oh,

181
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,140
they're sitting there having a great
fucking time to getting gelato. Well,

182
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,123
the side a case,

183
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,500
that's something fat people
do. You know? Oh, I'm low.

184
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,420
I'm fucking blowing up this
spot. I live with a fatty, I do.

185
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,880
I'm telling you I have fat,
French, okay. All of that shit.

186
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,860
All of those ice creams that you see,

187
00:11:56,861 --> 00:12:01,390
those unholy matrimonials of
fucking candy bars in ice cream.

188
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:04,900
Like who then now fuck thought
of that out. The fat people,

189
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,730
fat people, fat people, you don't Pat,

190
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,220
right?
They all came up with that shit.

191
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,820
They all came up with that shit late at
fucking night. They're like junkies. Okay.

192
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:21,630
And what happens is,
is after awhile doing heroin isn't enough.

193
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,720
You gotta put a little coke in there
and then you got to speed bullet.

194
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,730
So the fat fucking person speedball is
when you take and you, if you get fat,

195
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:33,150
you listen to it, you know it's fucking
true. You know you shouldn't be doing it.

196
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,570
You know, you're excited. You
know you're excited, right?

197
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,430
When you know you've got the
ice cream at home, right?

198
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,720
And you stopped at the red light,

199
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:43,230
you look over to the left and it's
at seven 11 right in that demon in.

200
00:12:43,231 --> 00:12:48,210
You just goes, Hey, are you
driving? Then go get a Zag.

201
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,203
Not by,

202
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,120
he had vanilla ice cream at home.

203
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:56,700
I was kind of playing and he'd
need to take it up a notch bond,

204
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:01,630
you know you want to do it, you
know, you start crying. Well see him,

205
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,770
he likes it. So I'm just going
to have the ice cream man.

206
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,770
I said make a left turn,
drive in there and get her shot.

207
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,620
I'm not bar and you fucking turn in there
and you buy the fucking thing, right?

208
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,810
Like you're going in there or rent a porn
back in the 90s and element of shame.

209
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,290
You don't want to make eye contact, but
you don't want to look away. You know,

210
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:26,250
cause it got a couple of git films in
there. You know, you gotta have that.

211
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:29,070
Maybe I'm going to rent sleepless
in Seattle. Look on your face,

212
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,510
right as you walk into the pawn shop,

213
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:35,130
except it's the seven 11 and you walk
past all the other fatties in the fucking

214
00:13:35,131 --> 00:13:35,964
people.

215
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,240
You know the junkies buying those fucking
hot dogs that have been there since

216
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,940
fucking Ronald Reagan got shot,
right.

217
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,290
You fucking go in there.

218
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,610
Probably grab a couple of healthy things,

219
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,980
like maybe one of their fucking bananas.
It's still green.

220
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,520
You know the hand of
the kid that picked it,

221
00:13:55,521 --> 00:13:57,650
you know his fingerprints is
still fucking on it, right?

222
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,340
Then you just walk right up to the
cash register at the last second.

223
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:05,330
You try to make it seem like you know it
would not be old and you gotta be like,

224
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,800
uh, yeah, I'll stop right there.
You go the fuck exact nut bar.

225
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,500
And then you take that fucking thing home,
right?

226
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,070
Driving home now excited while
hating yourself. Excited.

227
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:21,880
Passing over the Double Line
into your fucking house, right?

228
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,390
You put on fucking Netflix and then
you sit down and what do you do?

229
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,150
You've got to take the ice cream out.
Now this part's the hardest.

230
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:31,450
It's killing you. You gotta let the
ice cream melt a little bit, right?

231
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:35,050
So you can fucking GM at Goddamn
candy bar right in there, right?

232
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,800
That's what fatty still, I don't
want, I'm talking about here.

233
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,530
So I'm at the fucking mall. Okay, I'm
going to fill up a half hour. Okay.

234
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:44,400
I gotta have some tangents here.
You know,

235
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,280
you want to do a half hour don't material.

236
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:48,830
Yeah.

237
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:52,280
You want to try to fill
it up a lot. Right. Um,

238
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,570
so anyway, so I'm walking through
so this fucking, you know,

239
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,570
this is another person that I can't stand.
You know,

240
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:01,190
cause I'm so goddamned perfect,
right?

241
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,810
The fucking person just refuses to
admit that they're old. You know,

242
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,660
I don't mean like just your old,
just go sit there on the fucking couch.

243
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:10,370
I don't mean that, you know,
definitely get out there.

244
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:12,620
You don't get yourself sitting here,
but you know, put on some sunscreen.

245
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,480
You old fuck.
Okay.

246
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,510
The people that you passed a certain
age and they're still trying to keep up

247
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:23,360
with young people with the styles
and shit. I saw this woman, right?

248
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,080
Tragic trauma from fucking 80 yards.

249
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:31,280
You could tell there was no father
ever in her life. Okay. Which is sad,

250
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,990
but you know, at some
point you've got, you know,

251
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,050
you've got to put your tips of ways and
you gotta look in the mirror and just be

252
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:39,470
like, look, all right, so he wasn't there.
Fuck that guy. He's a piece of shit.

253
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,310
I'm worth something. This
lady did not have that. Okay.
She's fucking walking. Okay.

254
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,760
She is like,
I don't know what age she was.

255
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,930
She should have been 33 do something about
or said 33 but she looked like 47 and

256
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:58,400
she was in good shape
for her fucking aids,

257
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:02,210
but she's wearing the crop top.
Okay.

258
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,370
And she's doesn't have a flat stomach.
She has just that little bit of of uh,

259
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,060
it caught belly or whatever you call it.
Right. So it's hanging over in the front,

260
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,410
it's hanging on the back and she's wearing
a fucking crop top and the crop top

261
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,790
said bitch on it.

262
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,990
She's wearing these little short shorts
and these fucking high heels and you

263
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:24,230
know,

264
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,220
you know the lady's feet after fucking
three decades of sticking yourself in

265
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,060
horseshoes, you feed a beat up.
You know, you see like the heels,

266
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,900
there's like those white circles
from like no blood supply and shit.

267
00:16:35,901 --> 00:16:38,870
And it's just like, oh my God, get
yourself a player of flat shoes.

268
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,550
You know, I'll put on a sport coat
and you, you, you put on like some,

269
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:48,320
something flowing. You did your
time like young people be young.

270
00:16:48,321 --> 00:16:52,040
So she fucking walks by and uh,
I dunno,

271
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,140
the only excuse I can make was maybe
she was a hooker. She was a hooker.

272
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,040
I don't have a problem with it. God bless
her. You know what I mean? If she had it,

273
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,520
she had a, uh, a fucking, I
don't know what you'd call it.

274
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:06,800
A goddamn I'm charity I would give to it.

275
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,270
But if she was just a regular
fucking person man, shit
show. Right. And once again,

276
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,380
half the reason why she was driving me
nuts is it just reminded me of how old I

277
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:17,790
was. I was like, uh,

278
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,520
I am old enough that I was alive
when that woman was still high.

279
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,010
Okay.

280
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:30,170
And I'm not going to apologize, Freddy and
this shit, if you're going to walk out,

281
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:33,710
okay, you got to know your age. All
of these fucking, you know, you know,

282
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:37,850
people tell you that, you know, you
know, being fifty's the new 40, you know,

283
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:42,470
fucking says that 50 year olds, no,
50, 50 put some fucking clothes on.

284
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,680
Um, Geez, I'm on a fucking tangent
here. Not a rant. It's not a rant.

285
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,500
Don't even say it's a fucking rant.
All you guys have ruined that word rant.

286
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,950
Rant is your complete. You're barely
holding your shit to get a rant.

287
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:59,790
Goes with raving like hall and Oates.
Rant and raving.

288
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,070
All right. This whole thing that, hey,

289
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,180
he talked about the same subject and
he reasonably calm tone for the last

290
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:08,910
fucking seven minutes.
He's on a rant. You don't,

291
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,410
you don't see no defines it that fucking
millennials. And you know why that is?

292
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,040
Cause they wear helmets when they ride
bicycles and they had play dates and they

293
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,190
had helicopter parents. So then in
Denver even know what yelling is.

294
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:22,743
God help us.

295
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,640
God help us when Isis that doesn't have
a plane or a boat somehow figures out

296
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:31,350
how to fucking get over here from the
other side of the world, you know,

297
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,600
in their pajamas or whatever the fuck
it is they're doing over there. Okay.

298
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,930
God help us when they show up in
the millennials have to fight him,

299
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,130
you know Jesus Christ.
Anyways,

300
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,080
so here's the good stuff.
The good side of it,

301
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,590
aside from the fact that DNA ads are
sold a bunch of fucking books. Um,

302
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:52,540
there's a store over there out of Detroit,
Michigan, and it's called Shinola.

303
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,100
So I'm going to shine.
I immediately,

304
00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:00,390
I got to go in there because of that old
school expression. My Dad always said,

305
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:03,390
I'll cry set guy crazy.
He doesn't know shit from Shinola.

306
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,863
Wow.

307
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,480
That was a great one. That one of
my, another one of my favorite,

308
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,980
my dad got try sec.
I could fuck up a free lunch.

309
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,900
Oh that one made me laugh
every time you fucking said it.

310
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,600
Cause he always said it to
them about the right person.

311
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,640
And then just just doing the math.

312
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:31,090
Like what would you have to do to fuck
up a free lunch where you can literally

313
00:19:31,091 --> 00:19:35,410
have the person, you know what fuck
you go somewhere else to get your food.

314
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,870
You know, like what would you have to
do? The guy's giving you a free lunch.

315
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:41,410
What would you say to the guy
other than thank you. Um, anyways,

316
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:46,860
so there was an expression, it was kind
of a Midwest thing, right? I think a,

317
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,680
you don't know shit from Shinola.
Shinola was a shoe Polish,

318
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:56,070
uh, that was in Michigan, I
believe outside of Detroit.
So the expression going,

319
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,110
you don't know shit from Shinola
basically means you would know if you are

320
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,260
shining your shoes with
shoe Polish or shit.

321
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,220
It's basically saying you're a fucking
moron. So I'm like, all right, Shinola.

322
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:07,120
I got to go in there.

323
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:10,510
So I come walking in there and the first
thing I say to the guy was like, dude,

324
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:12,700
I had to come in here.
Are you familiar with the expression?

325
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,700
You don't know shit from
Shinola? He goes, absolutely.

326
00:20:15,701 --> 00:20:19,210
That's how we came up with the name of
the store. So evidently this company,

327
00:20:19,211 --> 00:20:23,530
they make all these cool shit in America,
in Detroit,

328
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:27,730
a city that needs fucking industry,
great goddamn city,

329
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:31,360
just waiting for someone to invest in it.
Um,

330
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,510
they make all of this stuff.
So I fucking go in there, dude,

331
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,510
you got to look these things up, man. Um,

332
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,630
aside from all the watches and all the
shit they had and they had these fucking

333
00:20:40,631 --> 00:20:44,720
bikes, um, you know, I'm actually
gonna post a video and, um,

334
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,650
and I say, hey dean, check this
shit out because I sending it to

335
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,980
Dean del Rey Cause Dean del Rey is,
is a, a a a connoisseur of fine shit.

336
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,820
The man does not own a lot of shit,
but the shit that he owns is fine.

337
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:02,560
She top of the line shit.
So they had bicycles in there and um,

338
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,280
they look like paperboard
bikes from the 1950s, you know,

339
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,120
when I fucking did my time from third
grade to ninth grade to like fucking,

340
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,010
I did it all the way up to
high school, you know. Um,

341
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,330
so I always liked those bikes even though
they look corny too, a lot of people,

342
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:22,800
but it was all modern technology.
So when you quickly looked at it,

343
00:21:22,801 --> 00:21:26,110
it looked like a peewee
Herman style fucking bike, um,

344
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,580
with the bell and everything on it.

345
00:21:27,581 --> 00:21:30,850
But then it was all this state of the
ash shit. It's kind of like a resto mod,

346
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,640
but like a bicycle version.
And they had this one,

347
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,530
it was like an 11 speed bike in all,
like the, all the gear changing was like,

348
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:41,590
I can't explain where the fuck or was,
it was like a,

349
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,110
I guess where you would say the
differential would be on a car,

350
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,560
but I'm just the part that it's
usually just part of the wheel.

351
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:48,400
All the gears were in there.

352
00:21:48,401 --> 00:21:50,530
I'm not enough of a gearhead
to explain this properly.

353
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,110
They had the wires going into the bike.
It was all like streamlined.

354
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,150
It had fucking disc brakes on the front
and the back that things were crazy.

355
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,870
Crazy. So, um, wait a minute, I got
the fucking pamphlet right here.

356
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,290
I swear to God,
if I,

357
00:22:08,291 --> 00:22:11,950
if I wasn't trying to downsize my life
and they weren't so God damn expensive,

358
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,450
I would have fucking bought
one. Um, yeah, I do these,

359
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,340
but these bikes, they're
really fucking, you know,

360
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,010
a lot of you guys are gonna think
these are nerdy looking bugs,

361
00:22:21,011 --> 00:22:23,860
but I think they're fucking sick.
They got one called the Detroit aero ones,

362
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:28,150
the Bixby and one's the
Runwell. Um, and I'll tell you,

363
00:22:28,151 --> 00:22:32,720
I'll tell you the chief, you know, but uh,
the fucking sick man. That's why I wish,

364
00:22:32,721 --> 00:22:34,930
you know,
I don't know how it happened.

365
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,760
Part of it was because there was sweatshop
labor and then you had the unions and

366
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,490
the unions became what the fucking cops
were. And then everybody just said,

367
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:45,460
you know what? Fuck a union. And
they just left the country would,

368
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:47,590
wouldn't it be great if we just
made shit in this country again?

369
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,640
I'm telling me we got to start with,
we'd all right.

370
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:55,690
They got to legalize it on a fucking
federal level and we should make the best

371
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,980
fucking weed in the world.
We export that shit.

372
00:22:59,981 --> 00:23:03,580
You get the whole world, you know,
fucking buy in are we? They got the best,

373
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:06,580
like the, like the way Cubans
got the cigar thing locked down.

374
00:23:06,581 --> 00:23:09,130
We should do that with weed.
Okay.

375
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,920
The government should
fucking stay out of it.

376
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:16,690
Just make it legal and walk away
and then tax the shit out of it.

377
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,530
Okay.

378
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,460
And have your eyes wide shut parties and
fuck some other woman while you look at

379
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:24,160
your wife getting banged by senator,
whatever it is,

380
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:29,050
you upper 1% people fucking do. All
right, but just walk away from that Shit.

381
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,700
Let us grow the [inaudible]. Couldn't
we? In the fucking world. We export it.

382
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:37,990
We make all that fucking money. You get
your fucking your skin with the tax,

383
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,020
right? Send it to those costs
over at the Federal Reserve,

384
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:43,390
whatever the fuck it is they do.
And then you know,

385
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:46,810
you pay off the war and then we just,
right.

386
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,010
Just given the Tesla, we just fucking
will drive those fucking cars.

387
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,620
Have the fucking blue blood
constant run the oil industry.

388
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:00,020
Just slide them over
to the electrical shit.

389
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,730
They'll still make the
same amount of money.

390
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,710
Then we don't have to be
over in the Middle East.

391
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:08,030
Stick in our fucking nose and all that
shit. We all fucking come home. Right?

392
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,010
You put on a game,
you've got some solar energy,

393
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:18,230
you know you've got some
fucking weed. I know, I know.

394
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:22,310
I'm over simplifying all of
this. Yeah, I'm over simplifying.
All of us. Um, anyways,

395
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,610
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about here. Let me, uh,

396
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,290
let me do some advertising reads.
It's do some advertising reads,

397
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:33,920
man. Um, I got to type
in my fucking password.

398
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,060
It's of course vulgar.
I don't know why,

399
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,510
because of this fucking
anger that you have in you.

400
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,630
I don't know what your problem is anyway.
To own, to be the same thing. All right,

401
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,020
let's see. So everybody safe though. Um,

402
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,720
every hear of something being
a barrel of laughs. Well,

403
00:24:53,721 --> 00:24:58,700
a barrel might not be enough laughs
in the days of horses and buggy. Well,

404
00:24:58,701 --> 00:25:03,260
a barrel might've been enough laughs
in the days of horse and Buggies,

405
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,850
but you live now or do you gotta
put your laughs on the cloud

406
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,710
by the way? You don't have technology.
I fucking love those fucking headphones.

407
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:17,090
That guy gave me right from Bose wireless.
I was against that shit gone.

408
00:25:17,091 --> 00:25:21,110
I don't need any more radio waves going
into my brain, man. I fucking love them.

409
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,180
I don't give a shit what it's doing to me.

410
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,060
I don't care if I turn into a fucking
Zombie. That's how convenient they are.

411
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,510

417
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:01,130
There's no business like show

445
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,410
it takes off everything from the waist

I did one in San Jose.

465
00:28:58,051 --> 00:29:01,320
That one's going to be coming up soon.
It's all on my youtube page,

Like I told you my fucking youtube page.

469
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,020
That's got to be blown up soon.
I hired a fucking animator.

470
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,150
I got some people doing some shit right?

471
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,540
I'm gonna be doing towards them
every fucking city. Excuse me,

472
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,250
that I go to get the hiccups. Um,
and all of that shit. All right,

473
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:30,270
so here we go. What can we talk about
here in the final couple of minutes? Uh,

474
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,900
all the Bruins, the Bruins had
their backs up against the wall.

475
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,440
We were after having a nice
comfortable fucking leave,

476
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,700
we would up to like a fifth seat.

477
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:43,120
We tumbled all the way down to an eighth
seed one ahead. The Tampa Bay lightning.

478
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,180
All right.
And I wasn't paying attention to Tampa.

479
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,590
I was just watching the Bruins lose.

480
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:50,740
And then I looked at the fucking standards
because one night I was watching the

481
00:29:50,741 --> 00:29:55,390
lightning play in the Black Hawks
and the Blackhawks dog dog, dog.

482
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,070
We're up fucking four to one and you know,

483
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,330
the lightning started coming back
and I'm fucking in it. Oh Shit.

484
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,990
Forward it to Oh shit. What
the fuck? What a great game.

485
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:08,640
I didn't realize that
that was hurting my team.

486
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,790
And they ended up winning in overtime.
They get two points and they will,

487
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:16,230
they will one point behind us. So we beat
the fucking, uh, we beat long island.

488
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,113
All right.

489
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,310
Long Island be the islanders that playing
Brooklyn. Figured that one out. And um,

490
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,850
and then Tuesday night we
beat the fucking press.

491
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,120
So tonight,
who do we got?

492
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:34,950
The fucking staff is such a Boston week,
predators,

493
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,940
stairs. Um, that's who
we're playing tonight.

494
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,030
And in the lightening have the Detroit
Redwings who are not having a good year,

495
00:30:42,031 --> 00:30:44,280
but they, you know, they
always get some fucking

496
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,140
Sergei Federoff next phenom coming
up. You know, they kind of like, uh,

497
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,900
the Pittsburgh penguins where they just,
they got the fucking,

498
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:57,180
they got that down man. Somehow they,
you know, I mean the penguins are crazy.

499
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:00,900
Do they had fucking Mario Lemieux and
Jaromir Jaga then he had like a fucking 10

500
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,730
year drought,
15 year drought or whatever,

501
00:31:02,731 --> 00:31:06,990
and then they come back with
fucking Gino and sit, you know,

502
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:07,770
and you know something,

503
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,190
the Bruins could be like that if we
didn't fucking ship 'em out all the time.

504
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,890
You know, we had Tyler say again, Hey,

505
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,370
what'd you have a fucking cores light
a get out of town buddy. That's, so,

506
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,520
that's not what we do here in this racist
town. This is an upstanding community.

507
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,340
So we shipped him out
and now look what we got.

508
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,590
We got fucking Pasta Knoxx
become, uh, you know,

509
00:31:27,591 --> 00:31:31,610
he's become a super sa Brad Marshawn,
you know,

510
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,410
it's just like what a
Tyler was still there.

511
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,010
You could centrally be rolling in three
fucking, I don't know shit about hockey,

512
00:31:39,011 --> 00:31:41,950
but I mean, I don't know. We're always
doing shit like that. Look at you.

513
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,910
Look at all the goals Joel.

514
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,480
Joe Thought and scored in San
Jose for why they never won shit.

515
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:50,350
We didn't get shit for him in the fucking
trade. We just didn't want to pay him.

516
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:55,930
But anyways, anyways, that's an
important, we have the stars tonight.

517
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,560
Okay.

518
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:01,560
The stars at night are big
and by Beekman out of Texas.

519
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,040
Um, but Dallas is not deepen our to
Texas. It's right out there in the open.

520
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:09,280
So we're going to win tonight, I hope.
But you never know. They got Jamie van,

521
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:13,210
they gave fucking Patrick's yet.
Patrick shap on the Dallas Diaz.

522
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,790
I'm the next f one race by the
way, is in, I'm not this Sunday.

523
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:23,200
It's going to be next Sunday. And that's
in China in dokie. And by the wait,

524
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:26,290
speaking of China, um, I
got satellite radio now.

525
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,440
So I finally get to listen to
the Howard stern show again.

526
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,220
And his wife has some sort of cause.
And you know,

527
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:35,890
I'm always worry of a cause dude,

528
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,620
I only listened to half of it and
I had to turn the fucking channel.

529
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,900
How would is describing they got some
day over there or I don't know what the

530
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:45,740
fuck they're doing with dogs
where they torture them.

531
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:48,650
They scare the shit out of them.
They think that they have like adrenaline,

532
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,680
you know, high anxiety. It
makes the meat taste better.

533
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,010
They fucking torture them in front of
the other dogs to make them more for the

534
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,350
dogs here, the, the, it's, it's
going to give you the rest of it.

535
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,180
It made me sick to my fucking stomach.

536
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:03,860
So there's a petition that you can sign
to try to get the fucking animals that

537
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:08,861
are doing that shit to stop on Howard
stern.com you just scroll down and uh,

538
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,200
you know,
I had to sign that shit cause uh,

539
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,280
even if you got to do something
about how to you do that to a dog,

540
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:19,070
you know what I mean? I know what
all you vegetarians, you'd say,

541
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:21,860
well the shit they do to cows and all
that, you know what you fucking right.

542
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,580
Isn't that a way to just,
you know,

543
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,900
fucking give a cow to behind the year
when it's not even like paying attention.

544
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,000
The thing is once you kill one,
the other sense it and everyday it's,

545
00:33:33,001 --> 00:33:35,000
it's fucking brutal. But you
know, then at the end of the day,

546
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:37,910
a fucking hamburgers delicious. I
don't know. But do you know you,

547
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,710
why don't you fucking have some cows?

548
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:43,430
Maybe it's because they have
a billion people over there.

549
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:46,220
So there's not enough cows for
people. I don't, I don't fucking know.

550
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:49,610
But I love dogs.
So if you love dogs,

551
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,900
Howard stern.com sign that fucking
petition anyways. And then as far as, um,

552
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,330
the motorcycle racing goes,

553
00:33:56,331 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm going to try and get into
this shit cause he's racist.

554
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:03,170
A nice increase races got a
little Christopher Walken.
There is rice is there.

555
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,140
I'm not going to do Christopher Walken.
All right. Listen to fucking Craig.

556
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:10,040
Guests are fucking Jay
Moore. Uh, the, the next, uh,

557
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:13,020
I think the first one of that season,
if you want to get into racing now,

558
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,150
motorcycle racing is fucking insane
cause they still bump each other and shit

559
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:20,330
and they're on motorcycles doing that.
Don't no fucking 190 miles an hour.

560
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,580
That one is on April 9th.
Sunday,

561
00:34:22,581 --> 00:34:26,150
April 9th in Argentina at
3:00 PM east coast time.

562
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,680
I'll actually be in San Antonio.
Um,

563
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:36,470
and uh, let's see. So that game
will come on from me at two o'clock.

564
00:34:36,471 --> 00:34:37,304
For me.

565
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,880
It's going to come on at two o'clock and
I just have to figure out how the fuck

566
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:46,550
I'm going to, uh, where the hell I'm
going to watch it. I think it's on Fox,

567
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,510
but uh, I'm totally into this shit up
totally into it. All right. All right.

568
00:34:50,511 --> 00:34:53,360
That's it. Everybody. Go fuck
yourselves. Have a great weekend.

569
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,750
You [inaudible] and I'll, uh,
I'll talk to you on Monday

570
00:34:58,470 --> 00:35:02,150
with, um, also listen to this music here,

571
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,330
a little bit of musical or music bed here
and then we're gonna play you some, uh,

572
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,070
some classic Monday morning podcast that
Thursday afternoon just before Friday,

573
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:14,780
Monday morning podcast from a Thursday
or a Monday from the year gone by.

574
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,190
Um, a lady roommate. Hey
Bill, huge fan of the show.

575
00:35:20,191 --> 00:35:22,830
Wanted to see if you had any
advice for this situation.

576
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:25,740
I found myself in a
little over a month ago.

577
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,370
I moved to Phoenix and moved
in with the friend of Iad.

578
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:34,170
You go up camelback mountain yet. That's
a fucking great hike. You got to go up.

579
00:35:34,171 --> 00:35:36,450
That one.
Somebody dies up there every fucking year,

580
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,990
which always me up to be
like alone in the wilderness.

581
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,050
While you can actually see
buildings in the distance.

582
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,080
It's got to be so frustrating.
Um,

583
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:50,220
little ugly ass fucking roadrunners.
All right.

584
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,850
A little over a month ago I moved to
Phoenix and moved in with a friend from

585
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,100
college.
No real problems there.

586
00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:00,540
But he did have a female college
age roommate that he got along with.

587
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,410
So we ended up setting settling
on a three bedroom. All right,

588
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:07,020
so it's two dudes in a chick.
This is already like a sitcom.

589
00:36:07,021 --> 00:36:09,000
This is like fucking
reverse three's company,

590
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:15,420
Colin. [inaudible]. Well it gives us,

591
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,740
I'll fucking, America was just like
that, you know, ice and simple.

592
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,890
I guess it was probably fucked up then.

593
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:23,420
I was just too young to notice
sitting there eating a popsicle.

594
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,550
We'll look is his own

595
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:32,480
bloody do Beatty booty.
Boop. Larry's upstairs.

596
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:36,200
50 years old. Fucking everything
that moves. Um, all right.

597
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:40,040
I only know a few people in town
and my work schedule is grueling.

598
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:44,780
It makes it really hard to meet to too
many people over the course of the week.

599
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,201
All right,

600
00:36:45,201 --> 00:36:48,380
so you're setting up to your excuse to
why you're already fucking your friends

601
00:36:48,381 --> 00:36:52,830
friend. All right. You know, I work,
Lord, I can't get to meet people. Uh,

602
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,910
why go out for pussy when it's right next
door? I get it buddy. I get it. You know,

603
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,860
it's discovery channel.

604
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,110
Does the line go after the toughest
zebra or the fucking wounded one of the

605
00:37:06,111 --> 00:37:10,280
little baby one or the one walking
around wearing the fucking juicy shorts.

606
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,380
Um, I'm sure by now you've pinpointed the
key word in the above paragraph. Female.

607
00:37:15,381 --> 00:37:19,280
Yes, I am Sir. Yes I have. So
you can see where this is going.

608
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,620
My second weekend here,

609
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,650
we all go out get sloppy jalopy drunk
and she informs me that she broke up with

610
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,680
their boyfriend of five
years. Ah, wonderful.

611
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:35,090
So of course I do the gentlemanly
thing and fuck your brains out.

612
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,970
Oh, he goes, oh, of course. Yeah.

613
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I do the gentleman thing and fuck her
brains out or flop around like a dead fish

614
00:37:43,131 --> 00:37:47,900
on top of her. Um, it's one of
those too. Once I'm done, I leave,

615
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:52,670
I go to my room and we don't mention in,
we don't mention it,

616
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:56,390
don't mention it in the morning.
And it's not awkward at all. Ah,

617
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,120
if I add the Allah your song,
Oh, that's fucking great.

618
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:07,010
Would you guys look down at me if I
told you that I was just jealous of this

619
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:09,740
person right now?
That's fucking perfect.

620
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,840
And the hardest thing is going to be for
you to not fuck this up for you not to

621
00:38:14,841 --> 00:38:19,520
develop feelings. Okay. You know,

622
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,890
that's going to be a hard one.
But if you can somehow do it,

623
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:25,880
if you can somehow keep
yourself separated, you know,

624
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,510
you could just,
it would be like a,

625
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,490
it'd be like stamps.com having the
post office and you fucking apartment.

626
00:38:34,491 --> 00:38:38,770
Now you've the post ups should apartment
and now you have this blow job machine

627
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,470
also there.
I mean it's tremendous,

628
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,713
you know,

629
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,850
and then all you gotta do is just decide
what kind of food you're always going

630
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:51,150
out for and you really like
and you buy that appliance,

631
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,490
be it a Panini maker or a
fucking cappuccino maker.

632
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:59,140
You got that stamps.com and the blow job
machine down the hall. And I tell you,

633
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:04,030
lets it get the NFL package,
call it a life.

634
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:07,690
Um, so anyways, he goes,

635
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,930
we've gone about doing
this for a few weeks now,

636
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,960
but since I'm never home during the
week and she works during the day on

637
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:18,740
weekends, we don't exactly see
each other. And when we do, we,

638
00:39:18,741 --> 00:39:23,200
we literally never say anything about
it or hint edited, all et Cetera.

639
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,960
Dude,
please don't fuck this up.

640
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:31,190
Please don't fuck this up. Okay? He says,

641
00:39:31,191 --> 00:39:36,191
my question being as this is the first
time something like this has happened,

642
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:41,330
is this a time bomb waiting to happen
where all the crazy is going to come

643
00:39:41,331 --> 00:39:46,280
flying out like the Ark of the
covenant or is she just rebounding?

644
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:50,450
And I'm the free and clear until I
settle in and find something else.

645
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,690
Keep in mind, keep in mind that Jesus
Christ, sorry I didn't go to church today,

646
00:39:55,890 --> 00:40:00,620
has died for rose and
is risen from the grave.

647
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,800
He did it all for you.

648
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:07,250
There's no way for you to thank him

649
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,080
once you give us a bunch of money.
Um,

650
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,240
keep in mind I've never been accused of
being good looking and she's pretty cute

651
00:40:17,241 --> 00:40:19,310
with the grade a ass on her.

652
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:23,750
Any advice is appreciated and
I guess go fuck yourself. Um,

653
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,130
okay. All right. You did
the right thing. You know,

654
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:33,020
you've got a great situation and you
don't want to fuck it up. You know,

655
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,010
this is like the first time
I went deep sea fishing.

656
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,120
I got a bite and I looked at the dude next
to me, my doing it right. What do I do?

657
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,570
And I let it run a little bit. Let it
run a little bit. Hey, bringing it right.

658
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,900
You're doing the same thing. All
right, so what is your questioning?

659
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,800
Is this a time this, this is okay, this,

660
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,720
there's the wildcard that
she's a psycho, but she, she,

661
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:56,000
she would have shown her colors by now.
I would think if she was a psycho,

662
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,640
you know, there would have been some sort
of, you know, God, you worked so much.

663
00:41:01,641 --> 00:41:04,840
I don't get to see you when your 20

664
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:08,330
[inaudible] going to do on that,
you know,

665
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,650
fucking twisting your arm here or
doing something fucking annoying.

666
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,460
Some sort of annoying sort of touching.
Right? So she hasn't done that.

667
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,910
She's totally putting out the vibe

668
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,123
that

669
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,810
she's basically in the mindset.

670
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,590
It's this thing seems like it's
exactly what it is. You know,

671
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,520
she was in a relationship for
five years, five years. Man.

672
00:41:32,521 --> 00:41:34,980
She's got to decompress from that.
All right.

673
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,010
She likes to go out and get hammered
and get fucked and go to bed and not see

674
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,700
your dumb ass for the whole week.
All right? Just keep it at that.

675
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,830
This is the deal.
You don't ever bring it up either.

676
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,710
You don't have to bring it up or you
just keep it the way it is. All right?

677
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,060
If she's barely talking to you,

678
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:56,870
you barely talk to her and he'd just have
fun with it and this is another thing

679
00:41:56,871 --> 00:41:59,870
you do. All right. Have
Fun with this shit.

680
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,090
What is some things that you always wanted
to do with the woman and you haven't

681
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:09,020
done yet? This is the girl
you do it with. All right,

682
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,470
and she's going to probably do it with
you too because she doesn't give a fuck

683
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:17,060
about you, which is a great thing.
What you have sir, as a fuck buddy,

684
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:21,620
congratulations. This is your first
one. This is what men dream of.

685
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:26,360
This is what men really want for, this
is what we want for Christmas. You know?

686
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,580
If we could just have a fuck buddy,

687
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,230
somebody who was clean with no diseases,
you know,

688
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:37,670
and somehow then had this pill they
could give you that you drank, you know,

689
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:40,670
you washed it down and it got
rid of any sort of fucking guilt.

690
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,420
It will be perfect. But you're
single do to, there's no guilt.

691
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:49,340
So my thing is just don't, don't open
your mouth and fuck this thing up.

692
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:54,680
All right. You got a great thing going.
Okay. Just keep doing what you're doing.

693
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,560
And uh, the only thing I would correct
is this whole thing where you say,

694
00:42:57,561 --> 00:43:01,730
you know, I'm not that good looking at
guy, you know, work on your self esteem.

695
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,060
She's pretty cute. Hey, you know,
good for her. She got a nice ass.

696
00:43:08,061 --> 00:43:11,810
Why don't you go to fucking do something
to it, but not during the week.

697
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:14,540
No fucking during the week
you focused on your job,

698
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:16,880
you have a great fucking
time. And I know it, you know,

699
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:21,530
I guess eventually if you do meet somebody
and you start bringing them around,

700
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:27,650
there's part, there is a potential, but,
uh, you just got to nip that shit in the,

701
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:32,510
but I guess you've actually met
somebody that you liked, uh,

702
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,330
that Jesus. Yeah, I
didn't think about that.

703
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,230
All right. First, first things first
before we even get over to her.

704
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:51,200
Uh, I mean dis, okay. Whole
new can of worms here, dude.

705
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:55,340
You have to be cool first and foremost.
All right. Because eventually,

706
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:58,640
you know,
if she meets some other dude,

707
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:01,310
you've got to make sure that
you're not going to flip out.

708
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,830
So do not develop any
feelings for this girl.

709
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,220
And the only way you're not going to
develop any feelings with the squirrels.

710
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:09,890
If you see her once a fucking
week and your Banger, okay?

711
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,370
You don't want to know how many
brothers and sisters she has, right?

712
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,550
It's like reservoir dogs. You guys
shouldn't even know each other's names.

713
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,180
Tell you name them to be a fucking, I
don't have any name. Yeah. You know,

714
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:24,380
you don't. You want that. All right. All
right. You fucking Mr Pink or whatever.

715
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:28,910
She's mister blonde or
Mrs Blonde. Uh, sorry.

716
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,810
Um, that's the only thing
you got to worry about.

717
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:37,110
All right.
So,

718
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,840
and I've learned to just be totally
fucking up front and honest.

719
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:42,870
So if I got some new girlfriend,
I would just tell her what's up?

720
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:45,660
What's your deal? Yeah. I'm single.

721
00:44:45,661 --> 00:44:49,340
I'm kind of banging my fucking roommate
once a week, you know, we don't, you know,

722
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,130
just sort of a fuck buddy thing. Oh,
does that make you uncomfortable? Well,

723
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:57,630
all right, well then this relationship
isn't going to work because you're already

724
00:44:57,631 --> 00:45:02,310
uncomfortable with me.
Now if I got feelings for you,

725
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:04,230
I wouldn't keep banging her,
but you know,

726
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,980
I'm not taking it off the table
after one fucking trip to Applebee's,

727
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,110
Jesus Christ free pussy. That's
like free shoes for you, right?

728
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,490
You know, I dunno. That's all I all, I
can tell you dude, you can't control her.

729
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:20,530
Who gives a fuck?
Dude?

730
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,840
Someday you're going to be 50 and you've
got to be married and she's going to be

731
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:27,900
bitching at you about something. And
even if you love or you're at some point,

732
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,460
you just can be reminiscent going,
you know,

733
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:34,580
where my life was the greatest was when
I had that little fucking goddamn three

734
00:45:34,861 --> 00:45:35,850
bedroom apartment.

735
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:39,870
All I had to do was make this amount of
money a week and I had some check once a

736
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:44,310
week with just fucked my brains out and
not talk to me for the other six days.

737
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,940
Goddamn dream. You got
the dream, sir. All right.

738
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,890
And I don't know where you're going to
wake up, but enjoy it while it lasts.

739
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,320
Okay. I hope I answered
your question. I really do.

740
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:03,150
You're in a hell of a situation.
Enjoy it. All right. Kudos to you.

741
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:04,223
I am jealous.

742
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:11,760
Hey, what's going on?
This is bill bar and this

743
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,300
is, uh, this is the Monday morning
podcast. This is the official one.

744
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,520
That other one that I just left was
a, was an unofficial and was not, uh,

745
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:25,340
was not sanctioned by the board of
directors of the Monday morning podcast.

746
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,230
I've had a crazy day. I've been talking
all day long. Uh, trying to be cute,

747
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:31,020
trying to be funny.

748
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,580
You're trying to sell tickets from my
theater dates this weekend and I am pretty

749
00:46:35,581 --> 00:46:40,560
much all fucking talked out. So this is
going to be a straight ahead, no bullshit.

750
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,750
Let's get right to the meat of the
fucking issue podcasts because,

751
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,950
uh, I'm going to the ranger
game tonight and, uh,

752
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:54,600
I'm going to a bar first, which
is stupid. I'm going to get sick,

753
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,960
but I don't know how to say no, you
know, I don't know how to say no.

754
00:46:58,050 --> 00:47:00,290
What the fuck else am I gonna do?
You know,

755
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,150
so just regard the unofficial podcast,

756
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,450
which said that I would be doing this
podcast after the hockey game cause I'm

757
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:07,890
not,
I just decided fuck it.

758
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:12,570
I'll do a quick 20 minute one
within 19 minute intro. Um,

759
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,100
if you're new to my podcast,

760
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I do one of these every Monday and I do
them right here on Bill bird.com and uh,

761
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,900
I also do them on my myspace
page. No, I am not on Facebook.

762
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,830
If you want to know why I'm not
on Facebook for a, to the podcast,

763
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,960
the one before this.
And even though it's unofficial,

764
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,930
it is my official feeling
of fucking Facebook.

765
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:39,010
Do you like this is footnotes with this
podcast. All right. And this is the deal,

766
00:47:39,011 --> 00:47:42,310
man. Every week I do one of these
and I answer people's questions.

767
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:45,880
I read shit that they find underrated.
Overrated. I give people advice,

768
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:50,930
I read stories about revenge and whatever
else this thing spins into when I also

769
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,990
heightened my gigs. Like for example,
this weekend I'm going to be on April 3rd,

770
00:47:55,991 --> 00:48:00,970
I'm going to be at the lake shore
theater in Chicago, Illinois. Um,

771
00:48:00,971 --> 00:48:05,740
all the information is on billboard.com
myspace.com/bill burr.

772
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:06,880
It's all up there.

773
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:11,830
And on a Saturday I am going to be at the,
uh,

774
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,220
Trump marina.
Isn't that what it is?

775
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:18,910
I can't remember. I think
that's what it is. Yeah.

776
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,280
Will be in Atlantic city
at the Trump marina.

777
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:25,270
Why doesn't that sound right when it
comes out on my fucking mouth or whatever,

778
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,010
that's where I'm gonna say I'm
going to be a Trump marina.

779
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:30,310
We just added a second show, which is
why I've been doing all this media today,

780
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,180
which is why I'm fucking half asleep.
So I'm going to sign a little bit drunk,

781
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:38,170
but I'm not. Um, that Gig
is this Saturday, April 4th,

782
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:41,740
and I will be working
with young Joe de Rosa,

783
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:46,590
one of the new stars of the
OB and Anthony Show. Um,

784
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,390
and he will also be on the opening.
Anthony show with me as well.

785
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,980
I this whole week,
I'm going to be on it on Tuesday,

786
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:54,370
Wednesday and Thursday of this week.

787
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:59,370
That would be March 31st April 1st and
April 2nd and Joe to Rose's coming on on

788
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:02,170
April 2nd. So there you go. Look at that.

789
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:06,160
I got all my high-pitch out
of the way and like I said,

790
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:09,640
this is going to be really quick. All
right. And uh, let's talk about my gig.

791
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:14,641
This past weekend I was working at the
house of comedy in Saint Louis and I had

792
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:19,090
a great time,
unbelievable crowds all weekend.

793
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,430
Uh, my, uh,

794
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:26,460
my eight person fan club showed
up to members strong and a,

795
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:29,720
I want to thank them for showing up.
Uh,

796
00:49:29,721 --> 00:49:32,320
that's the group of people
that followed me to Nashville.

797
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:36,400
And you guys remember that story
when they went to Kansas City?

798
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:41,560
You want a quick recap because we've
patched things up, um, between,

799
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,530
it's actually had a blowout with
my fan club. There's only, I can't,

800
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,370
who the fuck gets into a fight with
the fucking fan club? All right.

801
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,890
I just like saying I have a fan club.
I feel like a teen idol.

802
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,750
Like it should be singing some song
about teenage teenage anx, you know,

803
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,400
no bill. We don't, yeah,

804
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:02,080
you deal with my fucking hair slicked
back if I still adhere to slick back,

805
00:50:02,081 --> 00:50:02,530
you know,

806
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:07,530
I'm looking over my shoulder
like a fucking gay actor
trying to be straight and

807
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:11,080
then I fucking cat crashed my car and
Mulholland drive is basically what

808
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:13,000
happened.
My Fan Club last time they saw me,

809
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:16,990
they went to at least
these St Louis Chapter. Um,

810
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,950
um, basically they went to Kansas
City when I was working the Improv.

811
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,600
I'll tell you this story
really quick. And, uh,

812
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,200
they came in and they were excited
and evidently they were being loud.

813
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:29,360
So I'm sitting in the green room and
the bouncer, it comes back and says,

814
00:50:29,361 --> 00:50:32,570
hey bill, this is a table. People out
there that really loud, they seem drunk.

815
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,490
Do you want me to tell
him to, uh, you know,

816
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,550
sort of chill out a little bit before he
go up? And I go, sure, that'd be great.

817
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,940
And evidently the bouncer goes out there
and he says to the fan club, he says,

818
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:44,630
Hey, Bill Burke told you guys to shut
the fuck up or something like that.

819
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:48,950
So naturally they were besides
themselves and for some reason decided to

820
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:53,090
continue to drink so they could have a
nice rational conversation about it after

821
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,460
the fucking show. So the show
went, next thing you know,

822
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,360
I get 20 people come to me with, hey,
bill written on their shirt and uh,

823
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,300
they're all telling me what
a fucking asshole I am.

824
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:06,650
And I had nothing to do with it. And I
explained myself on a podcast about it.

825
00:51:06,651 --> 00:51:10,780
I don't know when the fuck is was. This
was years ago. And uh, but anyways,

826
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,510
it's the first time I've met any of
them since then. And they were nice.

827
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:18,200
They didn't try to kick the shit out of
me. So evidently everything is all good.

828
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:22,970
So I want to say thanks to them for
coming out and also thanks to that crew of

829
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:27,930
guys from the University of Kansas.
That's right. Mother fuckers.

830
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,040
They're sitting right now around a laptop,
high fiving each other,

831
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,420
probably doing drugs,
legal or not legal.

832
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,860
I want to thank all those guys, those
motherfuckers on college, kid money,

833
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:43,850
you know, drove all the
way from uh, basically uh,

834
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,950
the other side of Kansas
City to come out to my show,

835
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:48,560
which was really flattering
on college kid money.

836
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:51,530
Unless they got one rich French,
which they probably do.

837
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:54,320
There's always one rich front and you
act like you're friends with them.

838
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,330
I'm going to blow up this spot right now.

839
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,510
Act like you fucking friends
with them and you're really not.

840
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,270
He just had gas money in the fucking car,
you know,

841
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,600
then all of a sudden you wreck it.
And then what do you do?

842
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,520
You have the guy who
should be in a biker gang,

843
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:09,230
but for some reason he's still in college,

844
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:13,880
welds a new front end to it and you
turned it into a float and then you do a

845
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:17,330
bunch of shit that would be considered a
terrorist act in the air with the whole

846
00:52:17,331 --> 00:52:21,560
nine 11 Patriot Act. You'd never get
away with it, right? Sound familiar?

847
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:25,900
All right. Animal House reference for
all you youngsters out there. All right,

848
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,750
so this is the Monday morning podcast and
this is going to be a lean mean one in

849
00:52:29,751 --> 00:52:34,120
these lean mean times of a fucked
up economy. Anybody else who do uh,

850
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,950
did the right thing with their money
and they're sick of people telling them

851
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:40,460
that they have to pull themselves up by
their bootstraps. It's like, no I don't.

852
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,660
No, I don't. I have to fucking,
I have to. What do I have to do?

853
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,530
I don't know what have to,

854
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:49,160
I had to pick myself up off the floor
because he had done fucking ass.

855
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,740
Knocked me down to it. I
didn't do anything. You know,

856
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,150
this whole all this time and make the
front of that MTV cribs lifestyle,

857
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:58,010
I should have been living
in everyone else's,

858
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,030
doesn't make a fucking
difference in the end. You know,

859
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,390
I'm trying to figure a way out, man.
I'm trying to get off the wheel.

860
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:09,000
I was trying to stop running on the
wheel and I can't use fucking bankers.

861
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,980
Got The whole thing sewed up. If it
go, this is another dick in my face.

862
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,600
There's no way to
fucking escape this shit.

863
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,620
I'm really just going to have to work
until I'm 106 and then I'm going to die

864
00:53:18,621 --> 00:53:20,720
and then that's going to be the end of it.
You know,

865
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,890
you think I don't have dreams.

866
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:26,520
I don't want to retire open some fucking
stupid ass bar down on the Florida keys.

867
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,130
Sit there in a Hawaiian shirt.
You know what I mean?

868
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:36,050
It's like fucking sell drinks to convicted
felons and a gay mass murderers who

869
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:39,540
are on the run because they
killed the fucking, sorry,

870
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:40,880
I can't remember how that
one went in front of you.

871
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:45,060
What Andrew Cunanan referenced there?
What did he kill Versace?

872
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:50,010
Uh, I saw a really good looking
woman sort of down. You don't,

873
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:53,970
you don't like my girl gets like so good
looking is so super model looking that

874
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,560
they kind of look like an alien.

875
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:00,120
I was actually doing this interview with
this Guy John McCarthy who has his own

876
00:54:00,121 --> 00:54:01,950
fucking website which escapes me.

877
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:06,480
The name of it escapes me cause I'm half
asleep and I did 10 of those interviews

878
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:08,910
today but we were looking at this one.
We were like,

879
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:11,160
she's beautiful isn't she said,
yeah, she's unique. He's like,

880
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,390
is kind of looks reptilian.

881
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:17,760
There's something about like once you're
taller than five 11 as a woman and you

882
00:54:17,761 --> 00:54:22,440
still are somehow under 120 pounds,
you know your eyes get really big.

883
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:26,430
You just, you walk like literally alien.
He look, you know what they look like.

884
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:28,980
They're little,
they look like big praying mantises

885
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:34,710
praying mantises that you want to fuck.
Okay.

886
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,100
Um, anyways, let's get to the
podcast questions. Like I said,

887
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:40,090
this is going to be a real quick one.
Other this,

888
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:43,230
we're only 10 minutes in and Mario
on the questions. All right bill,

889
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,000
I love this question by the way, cause
this question needed to be asked. Bill,

890
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,980
what the fuck is the deal
with Ed hardy shirts?

891
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:52,200
Can everybody just relax,

892
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:57,590
take a big inhale and then exhale and
just be happy that somebody questioned

893
00:54:57,591 --> 00:55:01,470
those fucking things? I'm gonna read it
again so much. I love this question. Bill.

894
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:05,310
What the fuck is the deal
with Ed hardy shirts?

895
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,270
Seems like it has become the
uniform of the power tool.

896
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:13,800
Am I an ask for not realizing these
aren't the, these are the coolest things.

897
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:14,491
Wait a minute.

898
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:18,300
Am I asked for not realizing these
are the coolest things ever or am I

899
00:55:18,301 --> 00:55:22,320
accidentally smart for realizing that I
don't need to wear a dress shirt with a

900
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:24,660
drawing of a dragon fucking Buddha,

901
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,730
thanks in advance for help, Todd,
you couldn't be more right. I don't,

902
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:33,210
I don't get those. You know what,
those things are going to be, you know,

903
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:38,070
every period I'm going to
talk about fashion right now,

904
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:42,300
every period has a moment
where somebody where you know,

905
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,690
a style comes out where
you know that you know,

906
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:50,100
10 20 years down the line when they do
the dazed and confused movie of that

907
00:55:50,101 --> 00:55:52,860
period, that's like, you know,

908
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,170
they'll try to act like
everybody was wearing that shit.

909
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,260
Jesus Christ built say what you're
trying to say. But at this way,

910
00:55:58,261 --> 00:56:01,830
I was alive during the 70s but
I never worked bell bottoms.

911
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,300
You know what I mean?

912
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:08,100
I never had a big pink comb in my
back pocket with feathered back hair.

913
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:11,970
Brandon, my hair used to be like a
fucking Brillo pad so I couldn't do it.

914
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:13,860
But you know what I'm
saying? Well, you know,

915
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:16,980
whenever they do a movie about
the 70s everybody looks like that.

916
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:20,430
You know what I mean?
Everybody dresses like that.

917
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:22,080
That's what those Ed hardy shirts are.

918
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:26,230
Those are the fashion mistake of a,

919
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:30,700
of this time period did fucking horrific.
And not only that,

920
00:56:30,701 --> 00:56:33,580
that whole a bunch of
drawing on your shirt.

921
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,190
I wasn't that in like three years ago.

922
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:41,200
I remember when I was still trying to
be young three years ago at a, a at a,

923
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,750
at a very, uh, very tipsy 37
years old. I, I, you know,

924
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:48,160
I started wearing shirts like that.

925
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,670
It was those shirts where initially for
the people who weren't man enough to get

926
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:55,900
a tattoo over their entire torso.
And I remember like,

927
00:56:55,901 --> 00:56:59,860
literally like I think like a year and a
half ago, I was just like, you know what,

928
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,870
these, these fucking bedazzled shirts
with the eagles and the fucking,

929
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,460
uh, I dunno, ant eaters on them,

930
00:57:06,461 --> 00:57:09,960
whatever the hell they are with all
these like prison tattoo designs,

931
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:14,590
this shit's over. And evidently it
isn't. They're continuing with them.

932
00:57:14,591 --> 00:57:16,820
And Ed hardy doesn't dare like these.
Uh,

933
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:20,530
it's like those awful
designs and bright colors,

934
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,540
you don't seem like they would wear them.

935
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:27,190
And the growing up Gadi sort of
kids seems like they would wear,

936
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,820
you know, big Wareham and they'd
still get pussy, you know,

937
00:57:30,821 --> 00:57:34,750
cause they got the guns, they've got the
attitude, you got the end, they go red.

938
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:38,470
Now you get the attitude that
movie fast times at Ridgemont High,

939
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,260
every movie reference I'm gonna make is
gonna be fucking 30 years old at this

940
00:57:41,261 --> 00:57:43,510
point. All right, you're absolutely right.

941
00:57:43,511 --> 00:57:45,250
I don't know what the deal
with Ed hardy shirts are.

942
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,060
They fucking horrific and not even
Armenian guys wear them. They,

943
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:50,410
at least as far as I know,

944
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:55,330
they seem to wear those other bizarre but
there bizarrely designed and they step

945
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:59,530
out of Maseratis or at least to Armenian
guys did at a car wash I saw in La.

946
00:57:59,531 --> 00:58:03,790
So now that becomes every
Armenian guy in my mindset,

947
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,580
but that's even fucking make
sense. I don't care. Okay.

948
00:58:06,581 --> 00:58:09,460
I'm working on five hours sleep and I've
been running my mouth. I'll fucking day.

949
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:14,140
Uh, and yes, I will be giving excuses
every five seconds for this podcast.

950
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:17,650
All right. Question number two, Bill,
I'm recently new to your podcast,

951
00:58:17,651 --> 00:58:22,600
but thanks to iTunes or the,
the, uh, my podcast question is,

952
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:26,530
do you follow the World Cup
soccer in general? If so,

953
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:28,960
do you root for any team specifically?
And if not,

954
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:33,961
you should consider the Seattle sounders
then come up to Seattle for his show

955
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,440
and a game they,
Seattle sounders.

956
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:41,773
All right.

957
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:46,420
Just when I thought Ed Hardy was going
to be the worst thing I could picture in

958
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:46,991
my mind,

959
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:51,010
I'm just picturing the crew of people
who sat around a fucking conference table

960
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:54,340
and came up with a name
for your soccer team. Dude,

961
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:57,310
I'm not shitting on soccer before
I trashed the name of your team.

962
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:02,080
Let's get back to the first question. Do
I follow World Cup soccer now? I don't.

963
00:59:02,110 --> 00:59:06,240
I would love to. You know, I,
I've tried to follow that uh,

964
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:11,020
w premier league. I tried to get into
it cause I think it is cool as hell.

965
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,640
And I actually, I actually liked
soccer. You know, I actually like it.

966
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:18,430
I know a lot of Americans don't like
to shit, but I actually like it.

967
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,340
But I don't like American soccer just
because Americans don't seem to be into it

968
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:26,740
that much. So it just kinda seems
like you're watching the WWE NBA.

969
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:30,020
There's no excitement in the crowd.
And you know,

970
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:34,910
I can't get excited if no one else
is excited cause I'm codependent. So,

971
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:35,410
uh,

972
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,390
the only time I followed the World Cup
is when they actually have the World Cup.

973
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:43,460
And when I watch it, I just root
for the countries that I am. Um,

974
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,250
you know,
that my ancestors were,

975
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,940
I guess some German Irish
with a little bit of English.

976
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:55,160
So I pretty much just, I root for uh,
Germany because I think it's funny.

977
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,910
It's just funny to root for Jeremy to
be in a crowd of people rooting for

978
00:59:58,911 --> 01:00:03,080
Germany. It's just so fucking Cliche,
like Naziesque, you know what I mean?

979
01:00:03,081 --> 01:00:07,010
There's no way to fucking sit there and
a crowd full of people be sharing on

980
01:00:07,011 --> 01:00:11,330
Germany and somehow not feel like you're
advocating the policies of Adolf Hitler.

981
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:15,200
That's what I, that's what I like
about Rudy for Germany is the,

982
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:18,830
he just start laughing halfway through
it. Like, Hey, wait, am I not be,

983
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:21,140
oh wait a minute. No, no. I'm just
waiting for the soccer team. That's right.

984
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:25,640
That's right.
And uh,

985
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,880
I also root for the teams in South
America because evidentaly if they miss a

986
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:33,650
penalty shot, they go home and they
get executed. So, um, but you know,

987
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:37,770
there can only be one winner.
So getting back to, uh,

988
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:42,200
the Seattle sounders, I get
it. What? Because uh, what is,

989
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:45,980
what is outside of us at Puget sound?
I know that some sort of sound,

990
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,690
I just hate that fucking word.
I gotta look it up again.

991
01:00:50,691 --> 01:00:51,920
What the fuck is this sound?

992
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:54,553
You don't

993
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:55,543
something?

994
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,540
I don't know that I could define any sort
of body of water other than an ocean.

995
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:05,030
I know what an ocean is, right?
I know what the fucking ocean is.

996
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:07,370
We're trying to psych myself
up so I can answer this.

997
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:12,860
And Ocean is a, it's a lot of
water. Water between continents.

998
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:15,100
Yeah.

999
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,980
What else does it have? Well, I
had sharks that has salt water.

1000
01:01:17,981 --> 01:01:20,590
I'm a fucking moron.
What does this sound?

1001
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,220
We're just going to type sound in.
Let's see what happens here.

1002
01:01:24,221 --> 01:01:28,810
Sound is a vibration transmitted.
That's not what I'm talking about.

1003
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,200
Hang on a second. Sound.
Let's just write sound water.

1004
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:40,060
Water, sound effects. Geography.

1005
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:44,290
The glacier produces a
sound speed of sound.

1006
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:49,390
How sound in air differs? Sound
water productions. What the fuck?

1007
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:54,660
All right, how about this? Let me, let me
write it and then you gotta be a moron.

1008
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,900
This is how you find shit on the Internet.
What is a sound?

1009
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:03,880
Enter web definition.
Sound, sound, investments.

1010
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:08,830
You fucking con.
I'm spelling it wrong.

1011
01:02:08,831 --> 01:02:12,880
How do you spell sound for water?
Here it is.

1012
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,540
Sound geography.
Let's go to Wikipedia.

1013
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:21,570
God knows they're credible and geography
sound or a seaway is a large sea or

1014
01:02:23,611 --> 01:02:27,750
ocean inlet? Larger than a bay. All right.

1015
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:32,780
What the fuck is in inland and inlet
is a narrow body body of water between

1016
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:37,560
islands or leading inland
from a larger banal.

1017
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:39,990
I'm not going to read the rest of it
cause it's just going to get confusing.

1018
01:02:40,110 --> 01:02:43,890
I like that. An inlet is a narrow
body of water between islands.

1019
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:49,620
Okay. So if sound is a big inlet, uh, Bay,

1020
01:02:49,621 --> 01:02:53,370
I don't give a fuck. And then,
Oh, Jesus Christ. I like,

1021
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,010
did she get a definition than every other
word is highlighted because they know

1022
01:02:56,011 --> 01:02:56,970
you're fucking stupid.

1023
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:03,060
So geography is sound or seaways a large
sea or ocean inlet larger than a Ba.

1024
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,090
So I guess it is salt water.

1025
01:03:08,550 --> 01:03:08,640
Huh?

1026
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,170
Okay. I sort of get what that
is. So they're the sounders.

1027
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:18,780
All right, let's look up Seattle sounders.
Let's look this up. This is exciting,

1028
01:03:18,781 --> 01:03:20,570
isn't it?
Seattle sounder.

1029
01:03:23,690 --> 01:03:24,230
Jeez.

1030
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:24,471
Jesus Christ.
You know,

1031
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:27,080
it's a small club when they're not even
the number one fucking thing there.

1032
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:30,350
The third,
that third lead on that Seattle sounders

1033
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,800
and see,
do they have history?

1034
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,040
Yeah.

1035
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:37,873
Jesus Christ.

1036
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:42,170
You guys are really into that
awful green and blue up there.

1037
01:03:42,171 --> 01:03:45,020
Why don't you guys always have that? What
does everything you have to look like?

1038
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:48,460
Algae when it comes to your sports teams.
You know,

1039
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:53,390
given the algae isn't a good team
color. Um, all right, let's get,

1040
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:57,620
let's get the stop fucking car. I actually
liked soccer and I'm trashing that.

1041
01:03:57,621 --> 01:04:00,020
I mentioned the shadow to the
people from Kansas University.

1042
01:04:00,021 --> 01:04:05,010
Let me get back to fucking anyway. What
the fuck are we here? Hmm. All right.

1043
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:08,280
Anyways, well here's the kid hyping
up the Seattle sounders game.

1044
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:13,290
Are there new mls expansion team up
here and the atmosphere was electric.

1045
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:17,040
I suppose I'm a little bias in the soccer
is easily the greatest sport in the

1046
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:20,670
world, but having been over in
Germany for the 2006 World Cup,

1047
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:24,600
the sounders game felt oddly similar.
Okay.

1048
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,900
Now do you work for the Seattle sounders?

1049
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:33,350
Are you really going to say going to
Germany for the 2006 World Cup that going

1050
01:04:34,081 --> 01:04:38,630
to a home game for the Seattle sounders
was equivalent to that? I don't know.

1051
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:43,590
Evidently he is saying that it's a shit
and he should have and you only go up

1052
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,040
there and you have a good time
because you'll be surrounded by a sea,

1053
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:51,780
not a sound,
not an inlet of a of green.

1054
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:57,270
That was stupid. Why we just said
that. I see. Not a sound, not a bay.

1055
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:01,980
That's what I should've said inlet.
That didn't make sense.

1056
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:04,920
Did it cause an inlet is why she
and let does make sense, doesn't it?

1057
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:08,310
What does an inlet, I
can't even remember. See,

1058
01:05:08,311 --> 01:05:11,700
this is why something in school and
inland and let is a small, straight,

1059
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,630
sorta fucking body of water between,

1060
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:15,603
okay.

1061
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:18,820
He didn't want,
if this sailor listened to this shoot,

1062
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,310
I hope you're enjoying this because
I know you're fucking laughing,

1063
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:24,750
but just know that you dressed like
you're in the village people. Alright,

1064
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:27,970
let's get onto the revenge
stories, shall we. Uh, well,

1065
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:30,580
how about we do overrated underwear
because I didn't close with the revenge

1066
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:33,070
stories cause he thinks
he's so fucking long.

1067
01:05:33,071 --> 01:05:35,770
And not to mention there's a guy talking
a little bit of shit about some of your

1068
01:05:35,771 --> 01:05:39,010
other revenge story. All right,
let's get with overrated, underrated.

1069
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:43,440
All I have this week is one overrated
because this is going to be the stripped

1070
01:05:43,441 --> 01:05:47,710
down. Send me a text message out,
right? The stripped down version. Okay.

1071
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,680
Over, I gotta end this thing in five
minutes, so I got to hurry here. Uh, Ross,

1072
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:55,850
I'm going to miss my drinking time.
Overrated. Uh, thanks for the end.

1073
01:05:55,940 --> 01:06:00,280
I'm a little tall kid, then I got an
overrated for you fucking relationships.

1074
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:04,870
Why in the hell can't guys get it out?
Get on the damn boat already.

1075
01:06:04,871 --> 01:06:07,960
The single guys have it down.
Wind them.

1076
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,670
Dynam fucking and fucking leave.
I guess it's like you said,

1077
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,820
uh, I'm sorry. People like I can't, I,
you know, I usually suck at reading them.

1078
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:20,740
Just really even worse.
Signup Dynamynd you fucking leave.

1079
01:06:20,741 --> 01:06:23,440
That's all the single guys do it.
I guess it's like you said,

1080
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,160
I think it was two Paul
podcasts ago or so.

1081
01:06:27,161 --> 01:06:30,580
You feel the gravitational pull
to get married and have kids.

1082
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:35,530
I guess that's guys had the same poll
about being dumb enough to try and make a

1083
01:06:35,531 --> 01:06:39,430
relationship work. Uh, yeah. I think
there's a lot of truth to that.

1084
01:06:39,431 --> 01:06:43,000
I think what you should do is you should
just remain signals for your entire

1085
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:46,960
twenties, you know, and right time,
right about the time you're like 30.

1086
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:50,140
Then you know, once you get all
your fucking out of your system,

1087
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:54,250
then you can just kind of be like, all
right, I need to, I need to, you know,

1088
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,470
you're going to want to hang with
somebody at some point. You know,

1089
01:06:57,620 --> 01:06:59,290
you don't want to be the
old guy in the bar like me.

1090
01:06:59,350 --> 01:07:03,640
Like I'm about to be in 45 minutes,
you know, hey, there's sugar, you know,

1091
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:07,780
calling women by old
old rat pack names.

1092
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,430
Um, all right, well let's get on
to the, uh, the revenge story.

1093
01:07:12,431 --> 01:07:15,490
I'm going to read this guy's first cause
he's talking a little bit of trash and

1094
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:18,430
I like this guy's coming up calm and
he's coming out really confident.

1095
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:22,140
All alright. Revenge story number
one, Bill. It seems if all the,

1096
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,940
it seems like all their events or
stories that you've been reading on the

1097
01:07:24,941 --> 01:07:29,941
podcast lately have been sent sent by
a bunch of pansies that take the pussy

1098
01:07:30,971 --> 01:07:34,630
passive form of revenge and
fuck with somebody's car.

1099
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:39,040
Shit like that is lame and a pathetic
attempt to get back at someone.

1100
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,730
What they really need to do is
take a more aggressive approach.

1101
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,820
Here is my revenge story and
I want you guys to know this.

1102
01:07:45,821 --> 01:07:48,970
I haven't even reviving read this one yet.
All right.

1103
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,060
I just saw that intro and I'm like,
well, with an intro like that,

1104
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:56,200
this has to be the best revenge
story we've heard so far.

1105
01:07:56,590 --> 01:07:57,490
So with that,

1106
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:02,020
let's all judge this guys revenge story
as I read it for the first time and I

1107
01:08:02,021 --> 01:08:04,510
want you to know that things
like fucking nine pages long,

1108
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:08,950
Goddamn people take revenge is a quick,
what the fuck did I just do?

1109
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:12,670
Revenge is not a quick thing here.
Hang on.

1110
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:16,670
I just accidentally hit the wrong
button. All right, I'm back. I'm back.

1111
01:08:17,670 --> 01:08:20,030
All right, here we go. The
revenge story. Hi Phil.

1112
01:08:20,031 --> 01:08:23,930
This happened a few years ago when I
was 17 and working at a fast food joint.

1113
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:29,450
One night I was closing the place and I
was rolling a blunt at one of the tables

1114
01:08:29,451 --> 01:08:31,910
to smoke after I got off
of work and other words.

1115
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:35,090
He was a typical fucking fast
food kit. So anyways, a new,

1116
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:40,070
a new kid that just started working there
a couple of weeks before thinking he

1117
01:08:40,071 --> 01:08:41,330
was doing the right thing.

1118
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:44,490
Oh,

1119
01:08:44,490 --> 01:08:48,090
did you read? You read, you know,
half the shit isn't my problem.

1120
01:08:48,091 --> 01:08:49,900
You guys don't write in
complete sentences. End.

1121
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:52,080
It was a new kid just got
thrown on a fucking joint,

1122
01:08:52,081 --> 01:08:53,490
a goddamn table in the new kid.

1123
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:57,150
Thought he was doing the right thing and
he turned me into the manager on duty

1124
01:08:57,151 --> 01:08:57,984
that night.

1125
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:03,000
The manager laughed at him because he
couldn't care less about what I was doing.

1126
01:09:04,230 --> 01:09:08,250
All the fact that his employees
smoked weed. That isn't that Nice.

1127
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:11,190
A great manager.
Next day when I go into work,

1128
01:09:11,191 --> 01:09:15,720
that same manager tells me what happened
the night before. I'm not pissed,

1129
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,500
but I'm more like,

1130
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:21,120
you know what the fuck does this guy
would run to the manager and think that

1131
01:09:21,290 --> 01:09:24,780
he's some sort of whistleblower.
I decide.

1132
01:09:24,781 --> 01:09:28,740
So I decided that the guy needs
to learn his lesson. Jesus Christ.

1133
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:32,640
Nice set up so far and I'll see you
guys. I'm enjoying this. So anyways,

1134
01:09:32,641 --> 01:09:37,641
I call up a friend of mine to get what I
need and when the kid goes on his break

1135
01:09:39,001 --> 01:09:43,770
in order to his lunch, when he's not
looking, I dropped the two hits of acid.

1136
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,260
I brought two with me in his drink.

1137
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,220
Okay, what did I read that wrong?
I got two hits of acid. Okay,

1138
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,013
you're not you guys,

1139
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:58,620
can you proofread these fucking things
so I don't sound like the dumbest person.

1140
01:09:59,130 --> 01:09:59,791
You know what he did?

1141
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:02,940
He took two hits ass and he dropped him
in his fucking fruit punch. So anyways,

1142
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:08,240
he sits down and he starts eating and
I go back to work and I wait for it to

1143
01:10:08,581 --> 01:10:13,440
kick in and the entertainment to start.
All right,

1144
01:10:13,441 --> 01:10:15,630
I'm starting to get the guest
to the vibe of this story.

1145
01:10:15,631 --> 01:10:17,670
Evidently when he says your king the car,

1146
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:22,380
he doesn't mean that you're
a pussy because you didn't
do something face to face.

1147
01:10:22,381 --> 01:10:25,860
Evidently this maniac doesn't
think you took it far enough.

1148
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:30,420
All right, back to the story and an
hour later when he clocks back in,

1149
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:32,310
I can tell it's beginning to kick in.

1150
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:37,670
Hard I watch is to do good or current
starts to trip balls and freaks everyone

1151
01:10:39,901 --> 01:10:42,570
out.
Such a trip balls and freaks everyone out.

1152
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:45,510
Nobody else knows what what
is going on with the guy,

1153
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:50,750
so they lock them in the back manager's
office to this is really dangerous

1154
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,550
because he didn't know he was
probably never done drugs.

1155
01:10:53,551 --> 01:10:54,930
He probably thought he was going crazy.

1156
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:57,180
Okay.
That's

1157
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:01,110
really dangerous and fucking hilarious.
All right. When he's in there,

1158
01:11:01,111 --> 01:11:04,980
he really starts to lose his
shit and tear the place apart.

1159
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:09,090
My manager calls the cops and when
they get there they go back and cuff.

1160
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:12,930
They go back and cut them and
put them in the back of a squad.

1161
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,010
There's a lot of confusion in the place
and everyone tries to figure out what

1162
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:17,940
the hell just happened.

1163
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,630
The cop starts to question everyone to
try and figure out just what went on,

1164
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:24,630
but I play it up dumb just
like everyone else saying.

1165
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:29,280
He just started to act crazy too.
What do you have a life of crime?

1166
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:30,330
You're playing that shit off,

1167
01:11:30,331 --> 01:11:33,660
not worry that you're going to get
caught or you want to work release from

1168
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:36,870
prison. Anyways, after
taking everyone's statements,

1169
01:11:36,871 --> 01:11:39,270
the cops leave and caught the guy off.

1170
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:45,240
He never did come back to work or even
show his place face in that place again.

1171
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:50,190
Don't know if it was out of embarrassment,
confusion to what happened.

1172
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:55,590
Hang on. Diffusion to what happened
or outright fear of the place,

1173
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,630
so I don't know.
Whatever happened to him,

1174
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:01,050
it's still is the best 15
bucks that I ever spent.

1175
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:06,990
Jesus Christ. Dude, that's
fucking hardcore, man.

1176
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,720
I like you. I you confuses. I Dunno
why. I Dunno if he was embarrassed.

1177
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:16,980
If he was confused through do you don't
think he figured out what the fuck

1178
01:12:16,981 --> 01:12:21,981
happened and he wasn't able to put fucking
one and one together and make to how

1179
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,710
big? That's what I had to say.
Really instead said, rather than say,

1180
01:12:25,711 --> 01:12:29,280
put two and two together and get four,
this is so easy. This is one in one.

1181
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:31,770
Let's see.
I read it out.

1182
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:35,370
I mean people do think he read it out
for doing drugs in the last 24 hours.

1183
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:38,850
Then all of a sudden he
starts fucking tripping. Wow.

1184
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:40,860
I'm such a sadistic fuck.

1185
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,380
Maybe there would be a part of
me that would really enjoy that.

1186
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:48,300
Especially if he was like, uh,
like always doing the right thing.

1187
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:49,741
You know what I mean?
You know,

1188
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:52,920
people who always fuck up in life just
really hate people who are doing the

1189
01:12:52,921 --> 01:12:55,440
right thing. You know? I told them,

1190
01:12:55,470 --> 01:12:58,980
I talked to you about these people they
called [inaudible] and as much as I hate

1191
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:01,770
cons, I really am one when it
comes to certain kinds of people,

1192
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:05,460
I have no tolerance for people
who are pussies. I don't,

1193
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,620
and it's not because I'm a tough guy,

1194
01:13:07,621 --> 01:13:10,770
probably reminds me of a certain part
of my personality that I don't like.

1195
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,160
But in general,
you know who goes on and tell somebody,

1196
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:16,920
you know what?
Fuck that guy.

1197
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:19,770
What was he trying to take you a position
at the fryer later so it could be

1198
01:13:19,771 --> 01:13:22,110
fucking Douche bag of the month

1199
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,480
that really must've psychologically
damaged and made me think about that.

1200
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:32,010
You know, his whole life, that Mama's
boy, he probably always like, you know,

1201
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:36,330
Eddie just said it sandwich.
Now we swim and he didn't wait 15 minutes.

1202
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:38,300
Oh,
that's very good Mike.

1203
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:41,700
He always got rewarded for it and
then he fucking ratchet you up. Hey,

1204
01:13:41,701 --> 01:13:43,890
you know that fucking,

1205
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:48,180
you know guy over there smoking weed and
then the manager. So it's like, yeah,

1206
01:13:49,110 --> 01:13:52,290
that's what you do.
We work in a fast food joint.

1207
01:13:52,291 --> 01:13:55,290
Do you think this was our dream
in life for the love of God?

1208
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:59,760
Somebody give me a hit because I can't
take the fucking paint a reality anymore.

1209
01:14:01,850 --> 01:14:04,680
Once you go mop something up your little
pussy, that's probably what happened.

1210
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:07,770
And the next day's a cheat. If
I went home, talked to his mom,

1211
01:14:07,771 --> 01:14:11,260
I couldn't believe it. I
mean, I mean he was doing,

1212
01:14:11,261 --> 01:14:12,970
he had a marijuana cigarette.

1213
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,410
Well don't you worry you
did the right thing. Okay.

1214
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:20,800
And you just stay away from him and you
go to work tomorrow and you make sure

1215
01:14:20,801 --> 01:14:25,801
you doing coach and then he goes to work
and he fucked a fucking puts the date

1216
01:14:26,651 --> 01:14:29,620
rape drug in there at the date rape drug.
You know what I'm saying?

1217
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:34,420
He puts acid in that Jesus Christ
that you've never even had mentioned.

1218
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:35,590
You've never even had a sip of beer in.

1219
01:14:35,591 --> 01:14:37,660
The first thing happens to
you is to hit the athlete.

1220
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:41,770
I never took assets that God, thank
God, thank God I never read it out.

1221
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:46,750
Somebody doing drugs. Um,
anyways. All right, here's,
here's another revenge story.

1222
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:50,020
I'm going to read this one, then I
got to wrap it up. Uh, hey bill. Uh,

1223
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:53,590
I'm with you on the no revenge
rule. People suffer. Oh,

1224
01:14:53,591 --> 01:14:56,560
this wasn't even a revenge thing.
This is just a question.

1225
01:14:56,561 --> 01:14:58,860
This guy needs some
advice. This, this, uh,

1226
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,520
falls into the asset bill
portion of the podcast.

1227
01:15:03,521 --> 01:15:06,430
The advice people like to ask me for
advice, even though I'm a fucking moron.

1228
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:10,920
Let me just read this whole
thing. Cause, uh, anyways,

1229
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,810
I was writing to you to talk about,
okay here,

1230
01:15:12,811 --> 01:15:15,280
here's the part where he s
he needs some advice. Anyway,

1231
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:17,480
so I was writing to you
and talk about my cousins,

1232
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:20,710
have a girlfriend and
hopefully to get some advice.

1233
01:15:20,711 --> 01:15:24,820
I love how con is just become the
catchphrase of the podcast here. Anyways,

1234
01:15:24,821 --> 01:15:28,120
me and my girlfriend have been together
for about two and a half years.

1235
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:31,400
We knew each other as teenagers.
Um,

1236
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:34,930
along with some other people she dated.
Um,

1237
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:39,640
she dated one of our friends and he
eventually moved on and got married.

1238
01:15:39,670 --> 01:15:42,910
Me and her remained friends and eventually
we became close. We started dating.

1239
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:48,280
She isn't the best girlfriend.
I figure that.

1240
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:49,570
Consider your calling her a con.

1241
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:51,940
Yeah because she had a couple
of things that annoyed you.

1242
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,820
She has the best girlfriend
but I have become pretty,

1243
01:15:55,240 --> 01:16:00,240
pretty comfortable having her
around and her two kids not from me.

1244
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,120
You love or two kids?
Not For me.

1245
01:16:04,121 --> 01:16:06,850
They love me and we have
become quite the family.

1246
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:09,850
Here is where Shit went wrong

1247
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:16,300
recently we visited our friends in New
York and we are all partying and shit and

1248
01:16:16,301 --> 01:16:19,300
I get a horrible headache and sit
down on the couch to rest it up.

1249
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:24,430
I was out of it, so like 30 minutes
and I wake up to a nightmare here.

1250
01:16:24,431 --> 01:16:29,320
My friend in the kitchen hitting
on my girlfriend. Wow. If,

1251
01:16:29,321 --> 01:16:34,090
if, if that's not bad enough, she's
into this shit and encourage him,

1252
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:37,900
encouraging him and flirting back.
After I had all I could take,

1253
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:42,010
I walked into the kitchen and they made
the oh shit face when they looked at me,

1254
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,820
but I didn't say anything.
Then I didn't say anything.

1255
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:49,860
Then in there the next night for possibly
or possibly the same nights since that

1256
01:16:49,861 --> 01:16:51,550
was hammered.
Every day I was there,

1257
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:56,740
me and my girlfriend go to bed in the
guest room while we are laying there,

1258
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,610
she gets up to go to the bathroom
and after she didn't return,

1259
01:17:00,611 --> 01:17:01,870
after about 15 minutes,

1260
01:17:02,290 --> 01:17:06,580
I opened the door and what do I see
him and her standing there alone in the

1261
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:09,500
hallway,
having a quiet conversation.

1262
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:14,540
Jesus Christ to this is getting creepy.
Here's her story.

1263
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:18,650
She was just entertaining herself
and it wasn't going to go anywhere.

1264
01:17:18,980 --> 01:17:22,730
She feels she didn't sleep with him
or anyone else. So I'm overreacting.

1265
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:28,040
I'm overreacting by considering
breaking up, considering all we really,

1266
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:32,170
she have to lose. Oh, considering
all that you guys have to lose. Yeah.

1267
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:35,240
It's really her with the two
fucking kids. All right. So anyways,

1268
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:39,260
she's been walking around crying and
upset about the shit she has told me she's

1269
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:40,850
sorry and will never happen again.

1270
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:44,780
She has been pretty much worshiping
me the last few days and the shit is

1271
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:45,980
starting to eat away at me.

1272
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:50,780
I also know that I purchased most of the
shit in this house and if slash when we

1273
01:17:50,781 --> 01:17:55,781
separate I'll be taking most of it with
me and that is going to make it a lot

1274
01:17:56,091 --> 01:17:59,720
more difficult and painful for her
and her kids at this point I'm like,

1275
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:03,620
fuck all of this and I am ready to leave.
I'm ready to leave and shit.

1276
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:06,920
But honestly I'm starting to feel like
a real douche for not being able to get

1277
01:18:06,921 --> 01:18:07,754
past this shit.

1278
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:11,590
The kids will be devastated and they
pretty much doomed once I leave because I

1279
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:16,280
am pretty much the glue that holds
this family together. At the same time,

1280
01:18:16,281 --> 01:18:21,020
I feel like if she would do this
shit after years, we're kind of hope.

1281
01:18:21,021 --> 01:18:22,310
Does that give us for the future?

1282
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:25,550
What kind of relationship can we
have app to some shit like this?

1283
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,200
I would love some feedback on this bill.

1284
01:18:27,830 --> 01:18:32,830
Even though you never read my letters
during the podcast insert guiltier just

1285
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:35,720
telling me what you think I should
do in this situation. All right dude.

1286
01:18:36,710 --> 01:18:41,420
A year in that classic
halfway point between emotion,

1287
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,420
you know for your feelings.
For the kids.

1288
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:49,550
You're in the halfway point between that
and knowing exactly what the fuck you

1289
01:18:49,551 --> 01:18:52,700
need to do and you're
doing what you need to do.

1290
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:57,701
You need to reach out to people who are
going to re affirm what you know in your

1291
01:18:57,741 --> 01:19:00,770
heart of hearts. What you have to do is
you have to get the fuck out of there.

1292
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,740
You gotta get out of there.
All right.

1293
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:08,510
Do you think that's the first
guy she hit on? You know,

1294
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:11,780
and if she's hitting on guys, that
means she's probably fucking other guys.

1295
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:14,030
And if she's not,
she's going to,

1296
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:18,120
and right now she's just in a panic
mode and she's in a panic mode,

1297
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:22,490
not because she's worried about losing
you because of all that other bullshit

1298
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:28,870
that you mentioned because you sound
like you're the most responsible of the

1299
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:30,014
people there.

1300
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:35,020
And the only fucking hope her kids have
is that you'll stick around because she

1301
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:40,700
is a, I don't know, she doesn't
have her shit together. Um,

1302
01:19:41,890 --> 01:19:45,330
you got to get out to, you got
to get out and you know, you,

1303
01:19:45,960 --> 01:19:47,510
you might be good for the kids right now,

1304
01:19:47,511 --> 01:19:51,000
but eventually you're not going to be
because of the misery that you're going to

1305
01:19:51,001 --> 01:19:51,834
have.

1306
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,980
Being in a relationship with somebody
that you can't trust as far as you can

1307
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:59,810
fucking throw him is eventually going to
rub off on how you feel about the whole

1308
01:19:59,811 --> 01:20:00,644
situation.

1309
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:04,890
And it's going to be really hard for
you not to be a fucking douche around,

1310
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:05,823
but those kids,

1311
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:09,570
you probably gonna start drinking and
eventually you're going to start a fucking

1312
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:12,810
relationship. And the longer you're
there, the more shit you're going to buy.

1313
01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:19,200
This is what you gotta do. You gotta give
yourself fucking six weeks, all right?

1314
01:20:19,500 --> 01:20:21,150
Just break it up in two week increments.

1315
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:22,890
The first two weeks is going to be brutal.

1316
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:28,200
Just cry on the floor with
a pint of fucking Haagen
daas like a little bitch and

1317
01:20:28,201 --> 01:20:29,034
get through it.

1318
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:33,060
And every time you want to call that
fucking cunt that you can't trust anymore,

1319
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:34,860
you call a friend of yours.
Instead,

1320
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:39,120
you call a buddy of yours to kind of
buddy who's gonna fucking take you out

1321
01:20:39,121 --> 01:20:43,260
drinking and gets you back in the
fucking game. That's what you do.

1322
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:46,500
All right?
And you do that and turn that time.

1323
01:20:46,501 --> 01:20:50,850
The last bucket thing you do is get
into another relationship. All right?

1324
01:20:51,450 --> 01:20:53,400
Don't fucking do that. Don't do the J. Lo,

1325
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:57,510
we get out of that and you jump into
something else. Fuck that. All right?

1326
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:00,150
You stay fucking single,
you know,

1327
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:06,420
and just just get through six fucking
weeks in gradually and that after two

1328
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:09,330
weeks goes by, you know what I
mean? You start having a life.

1329
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,150
You'll start going down the park, playing
Frisbee with your next door neighbor.

1330
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:15,300
I don't know what the fuck
you'll start filling up the time.

1331
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:20,580
That's all it is in the breakup. Haven't
been, you know, after like a few days,

1332
01:21:20,610 --> 01:21:22,980
unless you really love somebody,
you're already getting past them.

1333
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:25,200
What you're really trying
to do is wondering,

1334
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,810
well what the fuck did I
do during all this time?

1335
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:31,440
How did I use to fill up my free time?
And that's what you got your boys for.

1336
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:35,100
They'll take you out, go
drinking, go to games, you know,

1337
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,230
by the big fucking industrial
sized box of condoms.

1338
01:21:41,490 --> 01:21:45,340
Just fucking, you know, Bang away, do
all the shit you gotta do. But Dude,

1339
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:46,920
you got to get out of that relationship.
You know,

1340
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:49,470
you got to get out of the relationship
and it sucks. But you know what, dude?

1341
01:21:49,650 --> 01:21:54,540
It's a fucking, it's a 20
minute conversation. 20 minutes.

1342
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:57,930
What you have to say?
It takes fucking 30 seconds,

1343
01:21:57,931 --> 01:22:01,290
but you got to deal with
fucking the next 20 minutes,

1344
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:04,470
all her bullshit trying to use all these
different techniques to try and get you

1345
01:22:04,471 --> 01:22:07,380
to stay. She's going to go with the
guilt. She's going to go with the Stereo.

1346
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:08,460
She's going to go with anger.

1347
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:13,670
She's gonna fucking unload her female
fucking gun of emotion at you and you just

1348
01:22:14,551 --> 01:22:18,510
have to stick to your fucking, you
gotta stick to your guns. I'm out.

1349
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:23,640
I'm out. Cause you fucked up. You fucked
up. I can't trust you. I can't trust you.

1350
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,360
The relationship is over.
Relationship is over. It's over.

1351
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:30,270
Not only were you hitting on another guy,
hitting all my best friend,

1352
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:33,390
you fucking cunt,
you untrustworthy fucking con.

1353
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,240
And you've got the balls to sit here and
act like I'm going to fucking stay with

1354
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:41,100
you. How are you out of your fucking
mind? Wait a minute. Strike that.

1355
01:22:41,101 --> 01:22:43,920
Don't say that mean Shit.
Don't say that means shit.

1356
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:46,320
Cause then then you had done two.
Don't do like that. Just say, look,

1357
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:50,190
I can't trust you. You
know what? Yeah. Fuck that.

1358
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:53,520
I don't know what the fuck ups man,
you know what you gotta do. All right,

1359
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,840
but don't, don't, don't, don't get sucked
into a, you know, fuck you. Fuck you.

1360
01:22:57,841 --> 01:23:01,050
Fight with her. Right. And she's going to
do the usual shit that women always do.

1361
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:05,380
Once she gets to the anger
thing, then uh, she'll,

1362
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:09,070
she'll go with to go with
the usual chill somehow.

1363
01:23:09,071 --> 01:23:12,700
She'll question your sexuality,
you, your, your ability and bed.

1364
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:15,590
She'd probably do that. Well maybe
if you fucking blah, blah, blah.

1365
01:23:15,591 --> 01:23:18,730
I wouldn't be hitting on your friend.
She's just going to do that.

1366
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:23,620
And a last ditch hope that you're going
to turn around blast during in the

1367
01:23:23,621 --> 01:23:27,910
fucking face so she can get a little
more money out of you and you can go to

1368
01:23:27,911 --> 01:23:32,110
jail and she can keep your
fucking playstation. So
don't get sucked into that.

1369
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:37,600
When she says that remark, just be
like, yeah, you know what? Yeah,

1370
01:23:37,601 --> 01:23:41,380
I guess I guess I do suck in bed. So
you know, have fun fucking my friend.

1371
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:45,400
You know, you seem like you really
want to, you know, or whatever.

1372
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:48,850
Now that was lame, but you know,
most of that was good. Okay.

1373
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:50,020
Don't get sucked into that.

1374
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:53,080
Don't get sucked into any sort of
domestic violence thing. All right.

1375
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,270
I'm not trying to judge you,
but that's a really white trash,

1376
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:59,020
that sort of situation. You're
involved in there where you got this,

1377
01:23:59,021 --> 01:24:02,830
you know we do. Dude, you said in the
beginning that you fucking thing. Yeah,

1378
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:07,360
I'm Kinda, I'm only kind of end to this
girl and she's got two fucking kids.

1379
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:11,680
You know what I mean? Cause why
you got to stay single, dude,

1380
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:15,430
you got to figure out what the fuck is
with you that you got yourself into this

1381
01:24:15,431 --> 01:24:18,640
mess to begin with. All right? But
do it, it could have been worse.

1382
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,690
You could have fucking,
you could have had kids with her.

1383
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,080
He could even married eight years.
They could have been who?

1384
01:24:23,081 --> 01:24:26,950
She could have been fucking poison in
you every morning. You know those girls,

1385
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,960
they don't know how to break up to
these. So they start putting fucking, uh,

1386
01:24:30,630 --> 01:24:34,180
that cyanide and you and you
got damn a rice krispies.

1387
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:39,790
Alright dude, I'm telling you.
I'm telling you, get the fuck out.

1388
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:44,110
You know what to do. Alright. Get the
fuck out. He called one of your friends.

1389
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,990
They listened to it. I got to get
out of this situation. It sucks.

1390
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:50,140
So I'm going to need you
over the next six weeks.

1391
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:54,580
Anytime I call you and I'm like, I need
to go out boozing. You've gotta be there.

1392

You and your fucking liver have
got to be there for me. You know,

1393
01:24:59,170 --> 01:25:02,080

All right, there you go.

1394
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,410
I know I just said the same thing
for fucking 20 minutes, but you know,

1395
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:08,560
I've been in that situation never with
the two kids. But you got, you got,

1396
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:12,890
you got to go. Do you
got to go? All right.

1397
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:17,310
I at grasshopper, they'll make me proud
and send me an email on the weekend.

1398
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:22,060
Tell me that you got the fuck out of
there. All right. All right. That's it.
