00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:03.920
PROFESSOR: I want to use this
applet, Amplitude and Phase:

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.450
First Order, to show you some
of the functionalities that

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.790
are common to the MIT mathlets.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.870
First of all, if your browser
window looks like this,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.600
so that the label at
the top is too large,

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.790
or like this, so that it's
missing some of the window,

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.300
it's because you have the zoom
on your browser set wrong.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.250
And you can adjust it
with command or control

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.600
plus or minus keys, so
that it looks correct.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.950
So let's see what we
have in this applet.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.360
At the top, you can see
the differential equation

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.340
that this applet deals with.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.850
This differential
equation models

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.850
many different
physical phenomena,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.850
and the story I want to tell
you involves the ocean, measured

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.780
by this blue level
here, connected to a bay

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.310
by this channel.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.420
And here's a measure of
the water level in the bay.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.290
As time goes on,
the level of water

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.319
in the ocean changes
because of tides,

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.020
and the water level
in the bay follows

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.350
suit mediated by a slanting
level in the channel.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.630
I'm dragging this time slider
under the graphing window,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.240
and you can set it
wherever you want.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.120
In fact, if you want to
set it at exactly 12,

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.135
because there's a hash mark
here, I can click on this 12,

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:29.470
and the time slider
moves to that point.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.810
Or you can return time to
time zero by this arrow key,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.820
and then animate by pushing
this double right arrow key

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.750
and watch the tide
move up and down.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.400
There's very carefully
designed color

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.650
coding in all of these applets.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.980
In this case, blue
represents the ocean,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.340
and you can see that
it also represents

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.490
the curve traced out by
the height of the ocean

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.030
as time increases.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.170
And yellow represents the
water level in the bay.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.350
When I drag the cursor
over this graphing window,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.470
you can see a crosshair
forming, and below the window,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.430
you can see readout of time
and the x variable, vertical

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.720
direction.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.350
You can use this to
make measurements.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.190
For example, I can see
that the tide in the bay

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.470
seems to have maximal
height of 0.38.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.410
In many of these applets,
you can make measurements

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.490
by using a rollover over
the graphing window.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.970
Let's see what else we
have in this applet.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.650
Down here, there's
a slider marked k.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.550
This is the coupling constant.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.190
It reflects the width of
the channel in the story

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.630
that I'm telling you.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.180
When k is small, the
channel is very narrow

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.090
and the ocean level
has very little effect

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.800
on the water level in the bay.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.480
In fact, when k is equal to
zero, it has no effect at all.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.530
On the other hand,
when k becomes larger,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.130
the water level in the bay
tracks the ocean water level

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.290
very closely.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.680
Let's set k to one, here.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.430
And think about another
thing you can vary.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.150
In reality, you can't change
the period of the tides.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.330
Even King Canute
couldn't do that.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.790
But here in this tool, we can.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.520
And I can vary the circular
frequency of this tidal input

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.570
signal by changing the omega
slider over here on the right.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:35.740
I can make it small, and so the
period is very long, or larger

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.910
and make the tides
happen faster.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.840
So we can animate this again.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.780
You can see things
happen faster.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.210
The curve is tighter, and
the effect is different.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.820
In fact, if we watch what
happens when I move omega

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.570
from one down to
a smaller number,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.410
you can see the maximum
height of the tide changes.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.300
The amplitude of
the tide changes.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.780
It depends upon omega.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.410
In fact, one of the nice
things about these systems

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.770
is that if you have a sinusoidal
input-- as we do here,

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.580
this blue curve--
then the output signal

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.380
is also going to be sinusoidal
and of the same frequency.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.010
So there's only
two things we need

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.960
to know about the output
here, this yellow signal.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.530
Namely, the amplitude
and the phase

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.460
lag behind the input
signal, the blue curve.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.560
And those two quantities can
be measured, can be graphed,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.080
against the input frequency,
and we can see those graphs

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.320
by clicking on this check box
called Bode Plots down here.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.090
So this opens two new windows.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.180
The upper one
records the amplitude

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.900
as a function of the
angular input frequency,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.420
and the lower one
records the number

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.480
of degrees behind the input
frequency that the bay falls.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.850
So as omega changes, you can
see all these various things

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.080
changing simultaneously.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.365
This is a characteristic
feature of these applets.

00:05:13.365 --> 00:05:18.610
The same information is recorded
in several different places

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.990
and always connected
visually by placement.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.970
So you can see the
amplitude is 0.71 here.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.020
This yellow horizontal
line connects it

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.060
with the maxima of
the output curve.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.870
And also by color.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.370
What else do we see here?

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.350
There's a red line segment
here on this curve, which

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:52.432
I can make a little bit bigger
if I decrease the k a bit

00:05:52.432 --> 00:05:55.630
and decrease the
frequency a little bit.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.590
What is this red curve
here, this red line here?

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.140
Well, it connects to
this vertical strut

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.500
which goes up to the
maximum of the output curve.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.390
And it begins at the
maximum of the input curve.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.140
In other words, it's
the amount of time

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.590
that the output falls
behind the input.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.160
It's the time lag,
and that time lag

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.800
is recorded
numerically down here.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.270
It's 1.96 in this example.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.530
There's one more
check box to explore

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.330
called Nyquist Plot here.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:29.950
Let's click it and
see what happens.

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.540
This opens a window
at the bottom here

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.090
which records a complex number.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:45.310
That complex number contains
a magnitude and an angle.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.870
And the magnitude is the
amplitude of the system

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.100
response, and the angle
represents the phase lag

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.200
of the system response.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.520
You can see these things
changing together when

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.620
I move the omega slider here.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.800
Watch both the windows above
the slider and the window

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.640
below the slider, and you can
see that they change together.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.410
This bottom representation
is a complex number.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.570
It's very useful in
understanding the relationship

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.750
between phase lag and
amplitude, and it also

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.710
represents the way we
solve these differential

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:27.070
equations in the Differential
Equations course at MIT.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:30.040
This is just a
beginning and indication

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.170
of some of the functionalities
of these MIT mathlets.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.450
If you want to see
a list of them that

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.770
are associated any
one of the applets,

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.790
there's always a Help key in the
upper right hand corner which

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:45.360
will open a page
that simply describes

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.180
the functionalities present
in that particular applet.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:51.660
So have fun with these.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:52.910
You can play around with them.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.890
You can't break anything
by clicking buttons

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:01.020
and experimenting with rollovers
and moving the sliders.
