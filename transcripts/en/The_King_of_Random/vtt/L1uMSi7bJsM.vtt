00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.220
For this project, I’m going to show you
how to make a cool 3D handgun, out of styrofoam.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.610
That you can use for props, cosplay, or even
backyard metal casting.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.180
To get started, we’ll first need to whip
out the Hot-Wire “Styro-Slicer” we made

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.449
in a previous video. And watch this.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.449
Simply unbuckle the latch on the side, and
you can have the whole thing set up and ready

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.720
to slice foam, in under 10 seconds.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.680
And like most of my other styrofoam creations,
this pistol all starts, with dollar-store foam-board.

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.640
I like these sheets of foam because they’re
all about the same thickness, and once the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
paper layers are peeled off the front, and
the back, they’re really easy to work with.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.690
If you want to make the same gun I used in
my “styrofoam to aluminum” video, then

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.910
you’ll just need to print off 2 copies of
this template I made in Photoshop

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.640
I based this template, around a design I found
on YouTube, for an “M9 rubber band handgun”,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.000
by RBguns. And I’ve put links in the description
to where you can find them for free.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.180
Go ahead and cut out all the shapes, and lay
them on the table. And you should end up with

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.350
11 tracing templates, which are basically
all just mirror images of each other.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.530
These pistol parts are designed to stack together,
to form a really cool looking 3D prop.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.480
But we need to carve the custom parts out
of the foam first, so let’s get to work making that happen next.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.250
Smear the surface of the paper templates with
a glue-stick, and focus on getting good coverage

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.680
around the edges, so you can transfer the
paper to the foam, and stick them firmly in place.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.260
Alright, the time has come to power up the
Styro-Slicer, and the first thing I like to

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.620
do, is chop the board into smaller pieces,
to make the templates a bit more manageable to work with.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.300
From here, it’s pretty easy to glide around
the edges, of the individual shapes, and trace

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.010
them out with an impressively, professional
finish.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.090
It always amazes me how the wire slices through
the foam so easily, but not through the paper

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.540
templates themselves. But that’s exactly,
why this works.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.760
Now, when you’re preparing to cut around
the trigger guard, it’s not as difficult as it might seem.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.880
The “Styro-Slicer” actually has a cool
little feature, that’ll make it quick and easy for you.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.299
Just poke a descent sized hole, in an area
you don’t need, then turn off the power

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.840
and give the wire, a couple seconds to cool
down.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.170
You can simply unhook the spring from the
eye-bolt at the top, thread the wire through

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.860
the hole in the trigger guard, and re-hook
the spring back onto the eye-bolt.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.500
As easy as that, you’ve got the ability
to make detailed inside cuts, in some of the hardest to reach places.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.610
Alright, we’ve got all the components manufactured,
and we’re just about ready to assemble the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.690
foam weapon. All that’s left to do is remove
the paper, and glue it together.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.500
Slowly and carefully peel the templates off
the foam, the same way you did with the board

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.099
in the beginning. And if you’re careful
enough, you’ll be able to reuse them again.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.930
Now to assemble this foam firearm, simply
lay the pieces out, so you can better visualize

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.319
how they’re going to stack together. And
just for planning purposes, each half of your

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.450
handgun, needs to look like this.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.680
If you’re ready to commit to this design,
then go ahead and apply a generous amount

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.860
of glue to the backs of the foam components,
and carefully set the pieces in place.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.760
The slide assembly, and the pistol grip go
on last, and should line up with some of the obvious features on the base.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.010
And the last little piece is just for decoration.
So push it into the little gap, in the middle.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.560
This completes one half of the gun. And we’ll
need to assemble the other side the same way,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.000
but make sure this other side, is pointing
the opposite direction. That’s important.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.540
With the two sides complete, you should have
twin “half-pistols”, that are mirror-images

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.790
of each other. So if you do, then let’s
make the two, become one.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.280
Smear a generous amount of glue on each of
the bottoms, then slowly and carefully line

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.080
up the two halves, and gently press them together.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.310
Double-check the edges match up on every side,
and give it a few minutes for the glue to

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.810
start setting. And with that, your styrofoam
sidearm, is pretty much done.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.000
Now to polish it up a bit, try using a 220
grit sanding sponge, to smooth out any imperfections.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.160
The foam is pretty soft, so by lightly sanding
it, you can get your gun to clean up really nice.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.239
With the handgun sanded, the very last step,
is to add the small circle to the tip, completing the barrel.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.209
And that’s it. You’ve just made yourself
a really cool looking, 3D foam pistol, that

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.660
you can use for props, or cosplay.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.069
Of course if you want to take it to the next
level, you could always transform it into

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.769
solid aluminum as well.

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.010
If you adjust the cutting arm of your “Styro-Slicer”
to roughly match the base of the gun, you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.900
can easily make a custom foam riser that will
glue to the handle.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.330
This is the setup I used, for burying my pistol,
nose down into a bucket of sand.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.590
And to turn it into solid metal, all you have
to do is dump in a crucible full, of hot liquid aluminum.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.500
The scorching, molten metal, vaporizes the
foam instantly, and somehow rushes in to fill

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.430
all the spaces, as it does.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.930
Of course your styrofoam creation gets completely
destroyed in the process, but you’ll get

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.760
a solid metal casting, in return.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.280
By the way, if you want to make anything else
out of foam, your imagination is the only limitation.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.180
I designed and built a whole squadron of 3D,
foam fighter jets, that are actually puzzles

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.220
you can take apart, and put back together.

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.820
So if you want to try making them next, look
for these foam fighters, in another project video.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.300
Well now you know how to use dollar store
foam-board, and your homemade “Styro-Slicer”,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.080
to make a realistic, and three dimensional,
“Saturday Night Special”.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.400
Well that’s it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
