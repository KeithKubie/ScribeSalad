00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey guys you know what I love

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.308
Yes, I'm pretty sure all of us would love a personal elevator and a giant mansion that has a cool Sailor Moon phone

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.200
Oh but before I go on you may have noticed I'm in a hotel room

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.200
And that is because I am currently

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.280
Overseas starring in a movie called go back to China.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.840
YaAaaAaay *fireworks* *confetti*

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.989
I'm very excited for all the friends. I'm making

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.199
Blub Blub Blub Blub Blub~~~~

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.369
But even though I'm in China. I didn't want to talk today about a

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.810
universally needed trait

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.510
Empathy you know we can't control

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.909
What happens to us, but what we can control is our reaction to those events and you know I'm not

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.530
I'm not the best of us all of it

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.800
Okay, like I have a lot of anger issues about stuff that may or may not be justified

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.180
Why does every fruit plate have honey - honeydew with the poor man strawberry!?

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.180
Honeydews have 90 percent water!

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.180
I want some nutritious Blueberries!

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.120
Kiwi, Pineapple, Dragonfruit, and there's rasberries!

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.360
NO ONE LIKES THIS HONEYDEW!!

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.960
Anna... that's Cantolope...

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.960
Oh wow...

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.920
wow I feel so foolish

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.010
Guess I don't like cantaloupe

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.070
But I have learned

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.599
That when you approach a situation with gentleness instead of going with your first instinctive reaction of being like harsh and defensive and angry you

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.610
Learn so much more about yourself and about others so about like a year ago now

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.999
I had this lady sort of explode at me out of nowhere

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.250
She was texting on her phone, and she had bumped into me, and I was like. "Oh sorry!", and she just went off

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.179
And it was so uncalled for like her reaction did not fit this situation at all, and I was just like hey

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.580
Are you okay is something going on here? I I don't know what came over me. I'm really sorry dad

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.749
I'm sorry yeah, my sister actually died

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.889
It turned out that her father had recently died by suicide and for those of you who don't know my sister

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.769
Died that way as well, and we had this very long conversation just sort of about mortality

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.140
And what it what it means to like lose an immediate family member this way and after the whole incident

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.390
I was just like you know what wow I never would have shared this connection with a

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.989
stranger if I had just given

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.619
Into that first instinct of being really defensive and angry I'd just been like well screw you too lady so the next time you're in

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.569
a circumstance that ignites your anger jealousy insecurity or any other negative emotion try to respond in a more gentle more kind way instead I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.480
Truly believe in the idea that every other human being is you and I know it's hard to like actually live that

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.410
But it's true

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.799
I mean we all have our unique and individual experiences

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.400
but ultimately

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.150
feelings are universal so be kind to yourself be kind to others spread that stuff around because

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.729
One day you're gonna be in the position where you really need someone to pick up the slack and be kind to you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.150
And it's gonna make all the difference so thank you so much Pantene for sponsoring today's video and promoting such a mindful

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.180
Message of like compassion and empathy, that's just awesome as you guys know. I have a beautiful mane of hair

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.230
And I feel really lucky and honored that I get to be sponsored by a company

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.829
That's so conscious of like the social messages that they're putting out into the world

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.230
You know the Internet can be a dark scary place like a very sad from it a lot of the time and so it's really

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.659
