00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.270
Let's say we have the
indefinite integral of the

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.890
square root of 6x minus
x squared minus 5.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.290
And obviously this is not
some simple integral.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.350
I don't have just, you know,
this expression and its

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.540
derivative lying around, so
u-substitution won't work.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.410
And so you can guess from just
the title of this video that

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.060
we're going to have to
do something fancier.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.950
And we'll probably have to do
some type of trig substitution.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.360
But this immediately doesn't
look kind of amenable

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.250
to trig substitution.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.190
I like to do trig substitution
when I see kind of a 1 minus x

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.280
squared under a radical sign,
or maybe an x squared minus

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.590
1 under a radical sign, or
maybe a x squared plus 1.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.030
These are the type of things
that get my brain thinking in

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.340
terms of trig substitution.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.650
but that doesn't quite
look like that just yet.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.600
I have a radical sign.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.455
I have some x squared, but it
doesn't look like this form.

00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:50.810
So let's if we can get
it to be in this form.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.000
Let me delete these guys
right there real fast.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.280
So let's see if we can maybe
complete the square down here.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.920
So let's see.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.029
If this is equal to,
let me rewrite this.

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:06.110
And if this completing the
square doesn't look familiar

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.610
to you, I have a whole
bunch of videos on that.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.740
Let me rewrite this as equal to
minus 5 minus-- I need more

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.530
space up here-- minus
5 minus x squared.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.520
Now there's a plus 6x, but
I have a minus out here.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.070
So minus 6 x, right?

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.730
A minus and a minus
will becomes plus 6x.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.090
And then, I want to make
this into a perfect square.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.430
So what number when I add it
to itself will be minus 6?

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.550
Well, it's minus 3
and minus 3 squared.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.290
So you take half of this
number, you get minus

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.760
3, and you square it.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.200
Then you put a 9 there.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.220
Now, I can't just
arbitrarily add nines.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.610
Or actually, I didn't
add a 9 here.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.050
What did I do?

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.080
I subtracted a 9.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.050
Because I threw a 9 there, but
it's really a minus 9, because

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.060
of this minus sign out there.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.030
So in order to make this
neutral to my 9 that I

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.180
just threw in there,
this is a minus 9.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.210
I have to add a 9.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.240
So let me add a 9.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.280
So plus 9, right there.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.920
If this doesn't make complete
sense, what I just did, and

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.350
obviously you have the dx right
there, multiply this out.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.560
You get minus x squared plus
6x, which are these two terms

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.155
right there, minus 9, and then
you'll have this plus 9, and

00:02:14.155 --> 00:02:16.790
these two will cancel out, and
you'll just get exactly back

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.750
to what we had before.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.110
Because I want you to realize,
I didn't change the equation.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.000
This is a minus 9
because of this.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.570
So I added a 9, so I
really added 0 to it.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.750
But what this does, it gets
it into a form that I like.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.020
Obviously this, right here,
just becomes a 4, and then this

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.110
term right here becomes, what?

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.290
That is x minus 3 squared.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.680
x minus 3 squared.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.880
So my indefinite integral now
becomes the integral, I'm just

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.290
doing a little bit of algebra,
the integral of the square root

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:57.990
of 4 minus x minus
3 squared dx.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.160
Now this is starting to look
like a form that I like, but

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.510
I like to have a 1 here.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.220
So let's factor a 4 out.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.410
So this is equal to, I'll
switch colors, that's equal to

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.720
the integral of the radical,
and we'll have the 4, times 1

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.520
minus x minus 3 squared over 4.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.100
I just took a 4 out of
both of these terms.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.270
If I multiply this out, I'll
just get back to that,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.030
right there, dx.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.790
And now this is starting to
look like a form that I like.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.150
Let me simplify it even more.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.630
So this is equal to the
integral, if I take the 4 out,

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.790
it becomes 2 times the square
root of 1 minus, and I can

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.800
rewrite this as x minus 3,
let me write this way.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:51.310
1 minus x minus 3
over 2 squared dx.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.680
And where did I
get that 2 from?

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.010
Well, if I just square both
of these, I get x minus 3

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.330
squared over 2 squared.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.740
Which is x minus 3 over 4.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.630
So I have done no
calculus so far.

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.370
I just algebraically rewrote
this indefinite integral as

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.420
this indefinite integral.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.690
They are equivalent.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.070
But this, all of a sudden,
looks like a form

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.290
that I recognize.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.580
I showed you in the last video
that cosine squared of theta

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.290
is just equal to 1 minus
sine squared of theta.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.490
You could actually do
it the other way.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.260
You could do sine squared
is equal to 1 minus

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:20.890
cosine squared.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:21.970
No difference.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.360
But they both will work out.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.120
But this looks an
awful lot like this.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.200
In fact, it would look exactly
like this if I say that that is

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.670
equal to sine squared of theta.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.170
So let me make that
substitution.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:46.180
Let me write that x minus
3 over 2 squared is equal

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.620
to sine squared of theta.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.840
Now, if we take the square root
of both sides of that equation,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:01.230
I get x minus 3 over 2 is
equal to sine of theta.

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.410
Now we're eventually, you know
where this is going to go.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.130
We're eventually going to have
to substitute back for theta.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.050
So let's solve for
theta in terms of x.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.980
So theta in terms of x, we
could just say, just take the

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.530
arc sine of both sides of this.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.900
You get theta is equal to,
right, the arc sine of

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.030
the sine is just theta.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:28.380
Theta is equal to the arc
sine of x minus 3 over 2.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.340
Fair enough.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.910
Now, to actually do the
substitution, though, we're

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.960
going to have figure out what
dx is, we're going to have to

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.290
solve for x in terms of theta.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.360
So let me do that.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.160
So we get, if we multiply both
sides of the equation by 2, we

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.340
get x minus 3 is equal to 2
times the sine of theta,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.195
or that x is equal to 2
sine of theta plus 3.

00:05:51.195 --> 00:05:54.010
Now, if we take the derivative
of both sides with respect to

00:05:54.010 --> 00:06:00.030
theta, we get dx d theta, is
equal to 2 cosine of theta,

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:01.790
derivative of this is just 0.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.460
Or we can multiply both sides
by d theta, and we get dx is

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.530
equal to 2 cosine
of theta d theta.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.060
And we're ready to substitute
back into our original

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.950
indefinite integral.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:19.050
So this thing will now be
rewritten as the integral of 2

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:25.680
times the radical, if I can get
some space, of 1 minus,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.050
I'm replacing this with
sine squared of theta.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.930
And all that times dx.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.360
Well, I just said that dx is
equal to this, right here.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:43.020
So dx is equal to 2
cosine of theta d theta.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.460
What does this simplify to?

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.730
This action right here, this is
just cosine squared of theta.

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:51.880
And we're going to take
the square root of

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:53.390
cosine squared of theta.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.950
So this, the square root of
cosine squared of data, this

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.960
whole term right here, right?

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.010
That becomes the square root of
cosine squared of theta, which

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.780
is just the same thing
as cosine of theta.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.900
So our integral becomes, so our
integral is equal to, 2 times

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.120
the square root of cosine
squared of theta, so that's

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.720
just 2 times cosine of theta,
times 2 times cosine of theta.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.490
That's that one, right there.

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:30.180
This is this, and all of
this radical sine, that's

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.040
this, right there.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.370
1 minus sine squared was cosine
squared, take the radical,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.800
you get cosine squared.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.060
And then everything
times d theta.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.390
Now this is obviously equal
to 4 times cosine squared

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.890
of theta d theta.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.310
Which, by itself, is still not
an easy integral to solve.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.160
I don't know, you know, I
can't do U-substitution or

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.240
anything like that, there.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.480
So what do we do?

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.700
Well, we resort to our
good old trig identities.

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:05.110
Now, I don't know if you have
this one memorized, although it

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:08.140
tends to be in the inside cover
of most calculus books,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.840
or inside cover of
most trig books.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:19.040
But cosine squared of theta
can be rewritten as 1/2 times

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.330
1 plus cosine of 2 theta.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.390
And I've proven this
in multiple videos.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.330
So let's just make
this substitution.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.890
Let me just replace this
thing with that thing.

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:35.010
So this integral becomes,
it equals, 4 times cosine

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.920
squared of theta, but cosine
squared of theta is this.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:44.725
4 times 1/2 times 1 plus
cosine of 2 theta d theta.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.910
Now, this looks
easier to deal with.

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.350
So what is it?

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.810
4 times 1/2, that's 2.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:09:00.250
So my integral becomes the
integral of 2 times 1, so it's

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:09.200
2, plus 2 times 2 cosine of 2
theta, all of that d theta.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.030
Now, this antiderivative is
pretty straightforward.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.240
What is this, right here?

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:20.150
This is the derivative
with respect of theta of

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:23.580
sine of 2 theta, right?

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.250
This whole thing.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.340
What's the derivative
sine of 2 theta?

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.900
Take the derivative of the
inside, that's 2, times the

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.900
derivative of the outside,
cosine of 2 theta.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:34.110
And this, of course, is the
derivative of 2 theta.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.650
So this is equal to, the
antiderivative of 2 with

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:41.420
respect to theta, is just 2
theta, plus the antiderivative

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:51.740
of this, which is just sine of
2 theta, and then

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.080
we have a plus c.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.330
And of course, we can't forget
that we defined theta, our

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.830
original antiderivative
was in terms of x.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.230
So we can't just leave
it in terms of theta.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.840
We're going to have to
do a back substitution.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.020
So let's just remember,
theta was equal to arc

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:07.080
sine of x minus 3 over 2.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.620
Let me write that
on the side here.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:20.230
Now, if I immediately
substitute this theta straight

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.430
into this, I'm going to get a
sine of 2 times arc sine of x

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.710
minus 3 over 2, which
would be correct.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:28.990
And I would have a 2 times arc
sine of x minus 3 over 2.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:30.880
That would all be fine,
and we would be done.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.060
But that's not satisfying.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.480
It's not a nice clean answer.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.090
So let's see if we can simplify
this, so it's only in

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.100
terms of sine of theta.

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:43.240
So when you take the sine of
the arc sine, then it just

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.150
simplifies to x minus 3 over 2.

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:49.210
Let me make that clear.

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.730
So if I can write all of this
in terms of sines of theta,

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:57.990
because the sine of theta is
equal to the sine of the arc

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:06.230
sine of x minus 3 over 2.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.180
Which is just equal
to x minus 3 over 2.

00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:12.250
So if I can write this in terms
of sines of theta, then I can

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.390
just make this substitution.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.520
Sine of theta equals
that, and everything

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.700
simplifies a good bit.

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.610
So let's see if we can do that.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:25.140
Well, you may or may not know
the other identity, and I've

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:30.200
proven this as well, that sine
of 2 theta, that's the same

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:42.485
thing as sine of theta plus
theta, which is equal to sine

00:11:42.485 --> 00:11:48.940
of theta cosine of theta plus,
the thetas get swapped around,

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:53.320
sine of theta plus cosine of
theta, which is equal to, this

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.740
is just the same thing written
twice, 2 sine of theta

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.760
cosine of theta.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.540
Some people have this memorized
ahead of time, and if you have

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.600
to take an exam on trig
substitution, it doesn't hurt

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.310
to have this memorized
ahead of time.

00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:06.180
But let's rewrite
this like this.

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.320
So our indefinite integral
in terms of theta, or our

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.870
antiderivative, became 2 theta,
plus, instead of sine of 2

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:18.490
theta, we could write, 2 sine
of theta cosine of theta, and

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.500
of course we have a plus c.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.380
Now, I want to write everything
in terms of sines of theta, but

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.960
I have a cosine if theta there.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.370
So what can we do?

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:30.440
Well, we know we know that
cosine squared of theta is

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:35.410
equal to 1 minus sine squared
of theta, or that cosine of

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.530
theta is equal to the square
root of 1 minus sine

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:40.990
squared of theta.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.800
Which seems like we're adding
complexity to it, but the neat

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.800
thing is, it's in terms
of sine of theta.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.480
So let's do that.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.160
Let's make the substitution.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:53.150
So our antiderivative, this is
the same thing as 2 data plus 2

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:57.920
sine of theta times cosine of
theta, which is equal to this,

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.400
times the square root of 1
minus sine squared of theta,

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.510
and all of that plus c.

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.030
Now we're in the home stretch.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:09.930
This problem was probably
harder than you thought

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.980
it was going to be.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.430
We know that sine theta is
equal to x minus 3 over 2.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:18.190
So let's make that
reverse substitution.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.690
So we have 2 times theta.

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:24.290
This first term is just 2
times theta, right there.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.400
So that's 2 times, we can't
escape the arc sine.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.170
If we just have a theta, we
have to say that theta is

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:37.270
equal to arc sine of
x minus 3 over 2.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.280
And then we have plus,
let me switch colors,

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.500
plus 2 sine of theta.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:46.710
Well, that's plus 2 times sine
of theta is x minus 3 over 2.

00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:51.970
So 2 times x minus 3 over 2,
and then all of that times

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:59.460
the square root of 1 minus
sine of theta squared.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.630
What's sine of theta?

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:05.706
It's x minus 3 over 2 squared.

00:14:05.706 --> 00:14:07.510
And of course we have a plus c.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.040
Let's see if we can simplify
this even more, now that

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.350
we're at the home stretch.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:19.410
So this is equal to 2 arc sine
of x minus 3 over 2, plus these

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:24.170
two terms, this 2 and this 2
cancel out, plus x minus 3,

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:29.280
times the square root of, what
happens if we multiply

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:35.090
everything here by, let's see,
if we take a, so this is equal

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:45.180
to 1 minus x minus 3 over 4. x
minus 3 squared over 4.

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.780
This simplification, I should
write that in quotes, is taking

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.280
me longer than I thought.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.850
But let's see if we can
simplify this even more.

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.760
If we multiply, let me just
focus on this term right here,

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.180
if we multiply the outside,
or say, let's multiply

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.920
and divide this by 2.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:04.460
So I'll write this as--
so let's just multiply

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.490
this times 2 over 2.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:10.910
You might say, Sal, why
are you doing that?

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.940
Because I can rewrite this, let
me write my whole thing here.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:21.000
So I have 2 arc sine of x
minus 3 over 2, and then

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.530
I have, I could take this
denominator 2 right here.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.830
So I say, plus x
minus 3 over 2.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:29.130
That 2 is that 2 right there.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:32.010
And then I could write
this 2 right here as

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.470
a square root of 4.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:37.330
Times the square root
of 4, times the square

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.100
root of all of this.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:44.300
1 minus x minus 3
squared over 4.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.350
I think you see
where I'm going.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.090
I'm kind of reversing
everything that I did at the

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:48.260
beginning of this problem.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.210
And maybe I'm getting a little
fixated on making this as

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:53.820
simple as possible, but I'm
so close, so let me finish.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:59.390
So I get 2 times the arc sine
of x minus 3 over 2, which I'm

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:04.410
tired of writing, plus x minus
3 over 2, and if we bring this

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.780
4 in, right, the square root of
4 times the square root of that

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.380
is equal to the square root
of 4 times these things.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:16.700
So it's 4 minus x minus
3 squared, all of

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.280
that that plus c.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.790
And we're at the home stretch.

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:27.740
This is equal to 2 times the
arc sine of x minus 3 over 2

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:34.650
plus x minus 3 over 2 times the
radical of 4 minus, let's

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:41.260
expand this, x squared
minus 6x plus 9.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:47.960
And then this expression right
here simplifies to minus minus,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:53.270
it's 6x minus x squared, and
then you have a 4

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.050
minus 9 minus 5.

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.180
Which is our original
antiderivative.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.000
So finally, we're
at the very end.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:08.020
We get the antiderivative is 2
arc sine of x minus 3 over 2

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:16.430
plus x minus 3 over 2 times,
time the radical of 6x

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.340
minus x squared minus 5.

00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:24.840
That right there is the
antiderivative of what this

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.170
thing that we had at the very
top of my little chalkboard,

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.820
which is right there.

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.620
So that is equal to the
antiderivative of the

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:39.050
square root of 6x minus
x squared minus 5 dx.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.120
And I can imagine that you're
probably as tired as I am.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.550
My hand actually hurts.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.880
But hopefully you find that
to be vaguely satisfying.

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.960
Sometimes I get complaints
that I only do easy problems.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.630
Well, this was quite a hairy
and not-so-easy problem.
