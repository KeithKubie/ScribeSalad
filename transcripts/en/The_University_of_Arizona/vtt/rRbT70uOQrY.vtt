Every time you drive through
a signalized intersection,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.450
the traffic signals change
state-- and red, yellow, green.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.150
And it operates, and it's
all kind of magic, right?

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.260
It's not really magic.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.750
Every intersection has
one of these cabinets.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.060
And so, let me show you
what's in the cabinet.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.970
25 years ago, I
was asked to work

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.850
on a real-time adaptive
signal control project.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.250
And at that time, I was
doing nonlinear differential

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.040
equations for monitoring
patients in anesthesia.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.060
And I thought, traffic?

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.230
That's red, yellow, green.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.800
That's easy.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.910
I can do that.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.310
I wonder what I'll do
after the summer's over.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.170
That was 25 years ago.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.790
This is the real brain.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.500
It's called the
signal controller.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.680
And this is what's responsible
for timing the different phases

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.150
of the traffic signal.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.380
In the road are loops of wire.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.620
And that's what used to
detect vehicles as they

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.990
flow among the intersection.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.890
But that's only right here, 60
foot from the stop bar, right?

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.270
And so, what we do is we use
connected vehicle technology

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.070
to talk to the vehicles.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.790
So on top of the signal
out here is a radio,

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.600
and that allows us to have
conversations with vehicles.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.680
This project is a
collaboration of the University

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.640
of Arizona, ADOT, and Maricopa
County working together.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.399
You know, if we can save even
two seconds to a fire truck--

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.690
to the emergency vehicle that
is responding to somebody

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.460
having a heart
attack, it can make

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.210
a difference of life and death.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.420
So obviously, the
public is paying for it.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.440
But if you look at
the cost benefit,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.730
I mean, to compare the cost of
one radio, which is currently

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.080
about $2,400 to
value of saving life?

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.730
I mean, if we can reduce
fatalities by 80%,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.390
that's a huge benefit
to the public.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.230
Transit One is en route now.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.950
So what happens is, when
the intersection receives

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.810
the request for
priority-- from one,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.870
two, three, four-- however
many vehicles are asking

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.660
for priority, the
research that we've done

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.500
is to focus on those requests,
the structure of the traffic

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.590
control at the intersection,
and how we can optimally

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.100
solve a timing problem to
allow the vehicles to go

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.825
through the intersection
in the most efficient way?

00:02:16.825 --> 00:02:18.950
Signals didn't talk to each
other in the beginning.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.260
We made them talk to
each other, right?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.910
Now cars are talking to signals.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.680
And now we're able to
really do something.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.910
And I love it because we
can make a difference.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.820
We can make a difference
in people's lives every day

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.840
by making it safer, making
it more efficient for them

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.510
to drive.
