00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.063
Let's see if we can better understand what a cash flow statement

00:00:04.063 --> 00:00:09.311
for my simplified shipping truck example company would actually look like.

00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:12.701
Now I say it's simplified because this is a very simplified income statement

00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:16.091
for each of these periods. I'm not really showing all the expenses

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:18.506
or all of the details that you would actually have for a shipping company

00:00:18.506 --> 00:00:20.921
but we really just care about the accounting.

00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.918
So let'a just say that at the beginning of this fiscal year,

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:26.587
when I started this company, I had $60,000.

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:29.884
We know from our example that we used that $60,000

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:32.903
to buy a $60,000 truck.

00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:35.600
And on the cash flow statement you express that saying

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.219
"I spent $60,000 on Capital Expenditure"

00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:41.587
sometimes it's "property plant and equipment".

00:00:41.587 --> 00:00:46.600
So you would actually put the $60,000 right over here, on capital expenditures.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.553
and hopefully we'll understand this in a little bit

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:52.354
Now remember, the cash flow statement is really a way of reconciling the profit

00:00:52.354 --> 00:00:54.484
with the starting and the ending cash.

00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:56.982
So let's just think about this a little bit.

00:00:56.982 --> 00:00:59.886
Our profit here, if we just take the number that we have here,

00:00:59.886 --> 00:01:03.507
Our profit in the first period is $30,000.

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:07.222
We're assuming nothing shady is happening with the Accounts Payable,

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:10.533
Accounts Receivable, that they're not changing over the course of the year.

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:14.559
And then we have depreciation, and we want to think a little bit in this video,

00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:17.253
what does the depreciation do to the cash flow statement?

00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:19.110
So I'll just write down the number first.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.918
So we have this depreciation value. This is the truck depreciation.

00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:27.888
It's not just the expent value of the truck, we're spreading that cost over 3 years.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:30.906
So $20,000 over 3 years is the life of that truck.

00:01:30.906 --> 00:01:34.575
So the depreciation in each of these periods is $20,000.

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:36.688
And what I'm going to show you here is,

00:01:36.688 --> 00:01:42.162
To figure out the cash from operations from actually how much cash the operations are producing.

00:01:42.193 --> 00:01:47.985
We want to add back this depreciation to the profit

00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:51.618
so our cash from operations is going to be $50,000.

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:54.683
And it might not seem obvious to you at first, but I want you to think about it.

00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:58.631
This $20,000 that we're showing as an expense in every period,

00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:02.392
and it actually might be more obvious if we think about period 2 or period 3

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:08.894
We're showing it as an expense but $20,000 did not go out of the door in year 2, or year 3.

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:12.052
We're just showing some of the expense from previous years.

00:02:12.052 --> 00:02:14.049
So no cash went out of the door.

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.557
So in any of these periods, the depreciation expense

00:02:16.557 --> 00:02:19.018
should be added back to the operating profit,

00:02:19.018 --> 00:02:22.036
to figure out the cash from operations.

00:02:22.036 --> 00:02:22.687
And you might say

00:02:22.687 --> 00:02:25.891
"Wait! But we spent that $60,000, especially in year 1"

00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:28.956
And that goes here, under Capital Expenditures.

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:33.879
The operations didn't push that cash up, the business itself,

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.225
this is just an investment that we made.

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:39.359
So it all works out, because what we see is that we got

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.888
$50,000 cash from operations, and that makes sense

00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:44.885
because our revenue was $100,000

00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:48.043
just the labor, the cash labor, people's salaries, were $50,000

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:50.318
So that's $50,000 of profit.

00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:54.730
This was not a cash expense, so from our operations we had $50,000 dollars,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.814
But then we did have the capital expenditures of $60,000 for the actual truck.

00:03:00.814 --> 00:03:05.829
So our ending cash would be $60,000+$50,000-$60,000.

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.848
So our ending cash is going to be $50,000

00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:11.170
Now it might make a little bit more sense if we go to the next period.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.185
Our starting cash here is $50,000. It's our ending cash of the previous period.

00:03:16.185 --> 00:03:19.343
Our profit, once again, is $30,000.

00:03:19.343 --> 00:03:25.178
You add the profit to the depreciation, you get a $50,000 operating profit

00:03:25.178 --> 00:03:27.238
same as the previous year.

00:03:27.238 --> 00:03:29.932
Or I should say cash form operations, and that makes sense,

00:03:29.932 --> 00:03:31.533
because our operations really haven't changed.

00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:33.182
We have a very, very steady business.

00:03:33.182 --> 00:03:36.573
But this year, I have no capital expenditures.

00:03:36.573 --> 00:03:42.563
So I'm using the same truck as last year. So now Our ending cash:

00:03:42.563 --> 00:03:46.511
Our starting cash was $50,000, we had $50,000 from operations,

00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:51.015
now our ending cash is $100,000.

00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:55.241
So hopefully that gives you a sense of why we add back depreciation

00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:57.424
when we figure out the cash from operations

00:03:57.424 --> 99:59:59.999
and how it works out in our cashflow statement.
