00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.430
&gt;&gt; Talia Guzman-Gonzalez: Okay.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.730
I'm going to start.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.080
I was giving people a couple
of minutes to find the room.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.560
Good afternoon, everyone,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.580
and welcome to the
Library of Congress.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.530
My name is Talia Guzman-Gonzalez
and I am reference librarian

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.400
in the Hispanic Division.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.280
On behalf of the Hispanic
Division and our co-sponsors,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.610
the Music Division and the
Hispanic Cultural Society,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.520
it is my immense pleasure

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.030
to welcome three
outstanding musicians.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.700
Eva and I have been working
on this event for a month now

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.170
so it's very exciting
to finally see it,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.260
you know, come to fruition.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.650
We have here with us Adonis
Gonzalez, Yunior Terry,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.870
and Yosvany Terry, three
highly accomplished musicians

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.990
that will be talking
about sounds and rhythms

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.290
of Cuban music, and
their careers as musician

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.970
and educators in
the United States.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.620
I will talk a little bit
about them in a little bit.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.350
I want to say something first

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.910
about our collections
at the library.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.650
We have a small display
in the back,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.950
and you're welcome to browse.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.440
They're books from the
general collections

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.950
so please take a look at them.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.170
The library has been
collecting Cuban material

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.600
since the mid-nineteenth
century.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.360
And we have probably the
largest collection here

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.610
in the U.S. The Hispanic
Division is the gateway

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.580
to explore those collections
but it is in every format

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.240
across the library,
including, obviously, music.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.250
Some resources that you can use

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.090
to explore those
collections come from the work

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.590
of the Hispanic Division.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.530
One of them is the Handbook of
Latin American Studies and it's

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.830
in the Hispanic Division.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.900
And also the Archive of
Hispanic Literature and Tape

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.760
which has recorded nearly
30 authors, Cuban authors,

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.670
reading from their work.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.980
The American Folk Life Center
also recorded Cuban music

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.530
and culture from
the 1920's onward.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.510
And there you can find a set
of long playing records titled

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.150
"[Foreign Language Spoken]",
published in Havana and compiled

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.360
by the great anthropologist,
Lydia Cabrera.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.940
I could on and on about our
resources and I hope you come

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.970

them with us, but you're here

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.480

to allow you to know
them better.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.200
And I'm going to start,
using Yosvany first.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:46.680
Yosvany, in a video
about your visit to Cuba

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:50.510
with the Harvard Jazz
Ensemble, we hear your mom,

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:55.080
who wasn't there before, saying
that when you were little,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:59.510
she wanted you to be a doctor
because you were so serious.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:02.340
[ Laughter ]

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.330
Instead you chose to be a
musician like your father.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.150
The same is true for
your brother, Yunior,

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.700
also for the three of you.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.630
To me the association
of being serious

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.370
with medicine is very
interesting since your training,

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.910
and this is true, is
a leading testament

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.940
that studying music
is a serious business.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.450
Can you talk a bit about
your schooling in Cuba

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.190
and how did it prepare you

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.230
for continuing your musical
education in the U.S.

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.640
and succeed professionally
as musicians,

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.130
composers, and also, educators?

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.340
I'm passing the microphone
to you.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.640
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez:
That microphone.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.740
Who wants to start?

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.520
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Cisnero:
Who going to start?

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:47.270
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: Well, music
is serious, as we all know.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:54.180
And it's such a rigorous
discipline, I would say.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:00.320
But I believe from my mother,
since my father was a founder

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.370
of [Foreign Language
Spoken], which is one

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.520
of the more important
[inaudible] orchestras

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:14.140
in the interior, and she saw
how much sacrifice he put

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:18.010
in behind his craft
with the orchestra.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.720
And besides that since she was
a nurse, you know, specializing

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.620
in pediatrics, she has
different ambitions for us.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:32.360
But unpredictably we
all decided for music.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.090
You know, music played
such an important role

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.670
in the house growing up.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:41.610
And also it was one of the
biggest sources of experience

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.610
because every time when my
father would play in town

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:50.180
and we will go to his
performances, that was clearly,

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.100
that's what we wanted to be.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.830
So but my father was
really adamant in instilling

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:03.070
in us the disciplines
and the rigorous work

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:04.370
that was behind music.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.400
And that's why at the
beginning it was opposed for us

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.720
to be [inaudible] but then after
we showed that we were serious

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.800
about it then that
was the end of playing

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.430
with friends on the weekend.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:23.460
So, yes, you know, because
of that incredible role model

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.310
that we have at home,
we had at home,

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:32.910
we went through the conservatory
system [inaudible] right before.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:39.850
And, yes, for me, it's like
music is an art in general.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:43.370
It's a serious [inaudible]
discipline as we know.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.460
And the time, the
dedication, the discipline

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:53.170
that goes behind the incredible
work that most people don't see

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:55.780
when they see you
performing on stage.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:13:01.110
It's a testament of like how
hard musicians have to work

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.650
to polish and develop
their craft.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:11.760
So just because of that
I would say and because

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.020
of the [inaudible] work that
we put behind all the time,

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.820
we have been able
to keep growing.

00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.780
And this is something
that doesn't finish.

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.400
It's like we still today,
we're just working as hard

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.220
as we were working before
in order to keep growing

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.730
and to keep doing
different things.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:34.030
And I think it's this hard
work also that help us

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:39.200
to join a bigger community which
is a community of New York,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:48.220
and the community of where we
live now also has I would say

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:58.620
allowed us to join the
big educator community

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.850
which is something that we
believe before leaving Cuba,

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:04.550
and even the time we
were living in Cuba.

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.540
So I hope this answer
the question.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.910
I don't know if I, it
was a long question.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.210
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Cisnero: Yeah.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.510
[ Laughter ]

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.820
Yeah. Let me give a
chance to Adonis as well.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:17.590
And talk - sorry -- if you
can comment a little bit more

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.660
about the school of
art system [inaudible].

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.960
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez: Absolutely.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.850
The music education in
Cuba is very well organized

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.320
that you have to study certain
instruments at a certain age.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:37.080
So I wanted to play the piano
but he didn't know [inaudible].

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:40.630
And because piano and
violin you start earlier

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:44.490
than other instruments like
from the third grade on.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.390
When all my courses were
[inaudible] I finally had

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.690
to put some hours.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.090
And my mom was very
strict about that

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:51.600
and I'm very grateful
because of that.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.860
But that discipline, you know,
carry on all through your life

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.930
and that's, just expanding
on what he was saying,

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:01.760
that has helped me, has
helped me to keep growing

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.060
as I became a professional,
so to speak.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.960
But I also wanted to say
there is a similarity

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.860
between being a doctor
and a musician

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:15.080
because I know the doctor
had to constantly be updating

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.680
so we have to do
exactly the same.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.280
This never ends like
Yosvany said.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.590
But it's a great thing,

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:27.790
especially when you played a
long [inaudible] ready to teach,

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:30.380
you are teaching but at the same
time you are learning so it's

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.960
so enriching for our lives

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.370
as a [inaudible]
musician [inaudible].

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.540
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Cisnero:
What about you, Yunior.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.840
I have a microphone here.

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:41.140
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Oh.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.440
Okay.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.740
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Cisnero:
You can use this one.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.040
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: I'll go stereo.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.340
[Laughs]. Hello, everyone.

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.560
I just want to add a
little bit what they said.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.320
Yes, we have the,
in Cuba, the system,

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.930
it's like a conservator based
on the Russian standards.

00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:00.540
So like at a certain age, what
Adonis said, violin, piano,

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.020
cello, dancers like
ballet dancers,

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.750
start at seven years old.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:10.200
So all the instrument like
the saxophone, percussion,

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.500
start when you're like ten,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:16.950
eleven when you're
already in fifth grade.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.360
So for us, we have to make
a decision really quick.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.690
Actually I didn't, I knew from
the start I was going to be a,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.030
that I wanted to be a
musician and a violinist

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:28.370
because my father
plays a violin.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:32.650
And that was real
important for us growing

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:38.530
up that we already knew
so how, like I already,

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:41.180
my mom has like a story
of me already saving soap

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.560
to go it's a boarding school.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.040
So you have to be in
the boarding school

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.360
so I was saving soap when
I was five years old.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.660
This is coming for when I go.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.960
[ Laugher ]

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.260
At the boarding school.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.410
And all the other kids I
remember, she always said

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.210
that all the other
kids were like crying

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.500
or their parents were crying
because imagine taking your kid

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.800
at seven years old to a school

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.930
and only see him
in the weekends.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.390
From Sundays to Friday and
on Friday you come back home

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:09.250
and you go back again
on Sunday night.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:12.030
So a lot of moms kind
of like in the middle

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.740
of the week they would
cry and bring sandwiches

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.310
and I said to her, "Don't come.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.050
I'm good here."

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.090
[ Laughter ]

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:23.010
"I'm enjoying it here."

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:29.830
But, yeah, so based in that
system we had our first teacher

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.130
was Russian.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.430
I don't know for you guys?

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.840
My first teacher was a Russian,
[Foreign Language Spoken].

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:40.020
And I just remember that we
couldn't understand a word he

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.000
said and we had a translator.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.130
And all of us came
out of the room crying

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:50.770
because [inaudible]
brought napkins

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.200
for us like, "Oh, you going?

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.500
Okay. Can you not [inaudible]?"

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.820
He couldn't talk but he wanted
to say so much, you know,

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:04.550
and be so specific
about it to [inaudible]

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:07.550
that at certain times
it was too much

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:09.070
and he was kind of [inaudible].

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:15.870
But he was really, he provided
a really strong foundation

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.270
for all of us.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.160
Since we grew up in Cuba,
you know, a lot the books,

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:26.670
a lot of the information was,
you know, Russian information

00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:31.900
and the way of approaching
the music was from Russia,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.310
either directly from Russia
or some of the professors

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.610
that went on study [inaudible].

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.250
That was like one thing
you look forward to,

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:45.620
to like be really good to get a
scholarship to study in Moscow.

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.990
So that was something
to look forward

00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:48.360
at that time [inaudible].

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:52.770
So based on that I just
wanted to add a little bit

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:56.320
about the education
because that's something

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.250
that maybe wasn't clear because
here it's completely different.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.770
I've been here in
the system here.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:04.980
I did my bachelor in California.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:10.480
And when I came in, the levels
are completely different here,

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.540
the levels of knowledge
[inaudible]

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.840
completely different.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.340
In Cuba you sort of, you can
track like everybody sort

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:19.540
of at the same level because
studied like the same roots and,

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:22.790
you know, here you maybe
have like a private teacher

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:29.940
until when you get to
school you have, you arrive

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.240
and maybe you [inaudible].

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.480
It's completely different
way of studying here.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.900
I don't know where I'm going.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.310
I could say many things.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.070
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez: But, yeah.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.680
I also wanted to add that for
me has been like a full circle

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.030
because of what you said
about the Russian teachers.

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:49.070
My theory teachers and
my [inaudible] teachers

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.370
from early on were Russians.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:55.680
And I didn't understand them,
but I make fun of the accent.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.810
So now I'm on the other side.

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.780
They say [inaudible] the accent
is so different [inaudible].

00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:06.080
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Yeah.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.380
It's like -- .

00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:08.680
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Cisnero:
That is great

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.980
that you bring those
stories right now

00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.280
because part of that I forgot.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.970
[Laughs]. It's also [inaudible]
to mention that in the school

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.110
of art, that system, that
is a boarding school,

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:23.160
is not only the music students
living in, it's all dancers,

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:26.880
classical ballet
students, the fine arts.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.180
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Painters, too.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:29.480
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Cisnero:
Later on the actors

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:31.360
and actresses join the school.

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.310
So you can, basically you
build a family that's going

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.610
to continue with you.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.350
It's not just like, you
can track the students,

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:40.000
but every one at that year are
going to be playing something,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.100
at the same level, but it's
also you can track the group

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.400
of the family.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.990
You go back three decades so.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:47.970
[Inaudible] we played
together since second grade

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:49.290
so it's very interesting.

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.590
And finishing with that, let
me just move on to something

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:53.690
that is very important because
that is what you're doing

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.990
right now.

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:57.550
And there is a long tradition
with musical exchange

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.580
between Cuba and
the United States.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:05.340
Starting in the nineteenth
century with, for example,

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.360
the [inaudible], even
through the frequency

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.060
of the social exchange it
was many times dictated

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:13.740
for a long time, especially
in the twentieth century,

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:15.650
I have been dictated by
the political climate

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.560
between the two countries.

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.970
During your years as
musicians in Cuba,

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:24.860
could you mention any
musician from the United States

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:29.210
that inspire you, that you were
looking forward to playing with,

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:33.070
that you were trying to copy in
the style of the performance,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:35.180
that you were I imagine
at a certain point

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:38.320
that you would come to
the U.S. and study here

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.150
because you were listening to
them in Cuba and there was kind

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.450
of like a goal to go to -- .

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:43.750
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Mm-hmm.

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:45.100
Mm-hmm.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:46.400
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: Yes.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.970
Well, the saxophone is
different than piano and violin

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.710
because it's like the saxophone
school was developed in France

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.660
so all of the saxophone teacher,

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:57.390
at least that's the
information that they had.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.380
There was a strong
French school.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:05.790
But looking up to American
artists, yes, something happened

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:09.680
to me at the age of thirteen,

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.040
fourteen years old
I discovered jazz.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:18.190
And jazz became for
me an obsession.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.050
It was an obsession but at the
same time I loved classical

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:26.510
music for sure so you
have to really work harder

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:28.380
in order to practice both.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.090
But, yes, some of the
biggest inspiration for me

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.990
from the U.S. came from
the jazz [inaudible],

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:38.530
looking up to Miles
Davis, to John Coltrane,

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:42.060
to Charlie Parker,
Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell,

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.280
Sonny Rollins, Clifford Brown.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.160
I mean the list is on and on

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:55.820
which is basically they
biggest contributors

00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:57.190
to these musical traditions.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.380
So, yes, I remember growing up
and finding what jazz was about

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.120
and then finding great
stations and then -- .

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.740
There were two radio stations
that broadcast jazz in Cuba

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:14.840
so that became, we knew exactly
when the jazz shows started.

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:21.970
So they had a really white
programming I would say,

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.550
going from the 40's all the way

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:30.120
to the most contemporary
art parts of jazz,

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.400
including Ornette Coleman, and
everything that was happening

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.020
with what then was
called new music.

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:41.830
So that's in my imagination,
you know, the biggest influence

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:45.400
that I would say from
jazz from the same time I,

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.970
so that I noticed that there
was always a collaboration

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:55.350
between Cuban and American
artists, not only going back

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.640
to [foreign language spoken]
which was like the, you know,

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.940
the great [foreign
language spoken].

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:06.880
They were the architects of what
is called African [inaudible]

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.090
but also even going back
in history, you know,

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:14.090
when the word [inaudible]
between bands from Cuba

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:16.140
that would interpret
[inaudible],

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:20.550
that would visit New Orleans,
would visit Mexico and Haiti.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.190
And there was a lot of
exchange in the Caribbean.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:29.360
So it's always been a
great exchange between Cuba

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.500
and the U.S. and the
central Caribbean.

00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.610
You want to say something?

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:40.230
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez:
Honestly, because of the times

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.160
when I was student, we didn't
have that much exchange

00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:45.690
of American classical
musicians coming to Cuba.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:49.750
So for me it wasn't an
inspiration at that time.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:53.610
I did have the opportunity
to see many American artists

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.520
at the jazz festival in Cuba.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.900
Dizzy Gillespie, I remember

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.740
when I saw Carmen McRae
it was really -- .

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:01.040
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: Max Roach.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.270
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez: Oh, yes.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:07.530
But unfortunately not
even the recordings

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:13.340
of the first biggest stars of
the American pianist tradition

00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:18.240
like Van Cliburn, [Inaudible],
we didn't get any of that.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:23.140
We got a whole bunch of
Russian recordings [inaudible].

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.880
But I do want to mention
that before that happened,

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:30.140
a century before that,
there was [inaudible]

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.750
and we was constantly
[inaudible].

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:33.370
It was like his backyard.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.260
Because when there he
toured the whole island

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:41.660
and I did the research on him
and [inaudible] for piano.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:44.120
And I considered him,
even though he was born

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.400
in the United States, the
first Afro-Cuban musician.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:51.680
He wrote more, probably almost
more Cuban dances than any

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.980
of the other composers.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.210
He was especially supported
music from the Caribbean.

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:59.790
They called that kind of
music Caribbean freedoms.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.970
His symphony, one his
symphony [inaudible] is called

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.540
"A Night in the Tropics".

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.150
He goes at first to
[inaudible] to bring a group

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:11.330
of Black musicians playing their
drums, amazing classical music

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:12.630
that had not been done.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:20.240
The popular music of
Cuba was the influenced

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.420
by the country dance and
for the European dances.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.590
But it has its place.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:28.550
It was at the ballroom, but
not in the concert hall.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:32.760
So the first one that
dared to do that was him

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:37.620
and [inaudible] what we
call today crossover.

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:43.220
But that exchange of culture and
traditions between the Americans

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.600
and the Cubans goes a long time,

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:52.040
even before the jazz is
started doing the same thing.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.900
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: No, I just,
yeah, I would just want

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.690
to add a little bit of
what you were saying.

00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:58.540
[Inaudible] was really
ahead of his time

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.610
because he was really traveling,
and picking up information

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.040
and tradition from
different places,

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.430
and including it in his music.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:10.090
And even the titles
[inaudible] so it's

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:17.620
like a real important
composer and actually influence

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.730
at the time what was [inaudible]
influenced like [inaudible].

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:24.340
He met at the time [inaudible].

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.750
But he influence, he was,

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:30.260
he had like a this [inaudible]
he was just compiling

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:33.090
and then was able to
put it in his music

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.000
so he was really
ahead of his time.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.510
So let's just keep
it as a [inaudible].

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:42.050
[ Laughter ]

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:43.350
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez:
[Inaudible] the culture.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:44.650
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Yeah.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:45.950
Yeah. Yeah.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.250
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez:
Even the [inaudible]

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:51.870
which is a very specific things
[inaudible] not many know he

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.510
wrote one of the biggest
fantasies for piano based

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.810
on the greatness of that.

00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:58.110
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: And
brought musicians to Havana

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:02.530
from Santiago and made one
of the biggest concert,

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:05.300
he put one of the biggest
concert at the time

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.600
with [inaudible] musicians.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.890
So it never happened before.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:13.370
I would say that I came,
I'm younger than him.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:14.670
We're brothers.

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.000
So he was already listening
to jazz and he got me into it.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.500
I was first started with the
violin and after that switched

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.080
to bass because somehow
he was playing the piano.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.610
He was like, "Oh, can you
find the notes on the bass?"

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.050
And so how little
by little I started.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.490
And after that went to
school and really studied.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:35.110
But there were some recordings
of artists that we grew

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:39.010
up listening to like
Coltrane, as he was saying,

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:43.620
but also some more contemporary
like Branford Marsalis,

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:48.420
Jeff "Tains" Watts,
Charlie Hayden that we got,

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.030
that we've been here and
since we've been here,

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:52.070
we've been able to
work with them.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:57.750
And that's been really an
experience for us and an honor,

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:00.770
actually, to being able
to be friends with them

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:02.400
and actually to work with them.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.120
I was able to study with Charlie
Hayden, as I said earlier,

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.960
which I listened to
when I was a kid.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.590
I just never imagined my life

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:12.360
that I would be able
to study with him.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:15.120
And with Jeff "Tain" Watts,
one of the living legends,

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.570
drummers these days, that I
never imagined to be working

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:23.780
with him and to be, you know,
to call my friend, you know,

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.990
that's just been really an
amazing experience for us.

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:30.290
And it's something that
we both always keep -- .

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.580
One time I was in
a tour with Tain.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.020
That's an interesting story.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:38.570
One time I was in a tour with
Tain and we went in Europe.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:43.770
And I felt, when I
started working with him,

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:45.410
we had a couple of
drinks at the time.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:48.190
And I asked him, "Why
did you call me?"

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.840
Because there's a lot of other
bassists, young bassists,

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.760
anybody from here that
already grew up playing jazz.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.360
And he said, "Because you
have something different.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.470
You have something
interesting that is different.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.540
You have another way
of looking at it."

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:07.010
And that broke open the gate
for me to be even more wild.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.590
[ Laughter ]

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:12.260
Now I knew he was
really interested

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:16.100
of me not really imitating
while they're recording

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.380
that I have to play.

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.560
I could be more myself.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.890
And that was something, that was
some kind of illumination for me

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:30.070
to appreciate and to
believe in my knowledge

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.860
and my roots even more
because I know that's something

00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:35.780
that he's interested about
and that's the same thing

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.080
that I'm interested about him.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:38.380
He's interested to
learn from me.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.680
I'm interested to
learn from him.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.010
And that's how we both
keep growing, right.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.250
So that was an experience.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:46.550
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Cisnero: Great.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:48.720
Thank you.

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.360
Talking a lot about Cuban
music and the influence

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.730
of the American music
in Cuba, vice versa.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:31:00.120
I would like to for maybe
people that are not so familiar

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.160
with the Cuban music
roots, if you could explain,

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:09.040
if you're going to dissect
the Cuban musical landscape,

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.950
what is it made out of?

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:12.770
What the foundation of that?

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.180
What we call Cuban music,

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.690
for some people it
could be a stereotype

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:18.010
of the conga line,
or Carmen Miranda.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.310
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Ricky Ricardo.

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.610
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Cisnero:
Ricky Ricardo.

00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:21.910
[ Laughter ]

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:23.540
Exactly. But that the
Cuban music is a lot

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.840
of different things.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.530
And what are the
roots of that music?

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.370
What is the musical
landscapes made of ?

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.850
If you could dissect that?

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.150
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez:
Do you want to start?

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.450
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry:
Do you want to -- ?

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:34.750
You can start.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:36.050
[ Laughter ]

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.350
I guess I'll say
something, yeah.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.650
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Go ahead.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:39.950
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: Go ahead.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.130
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez: Well,
obviously it started

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.190
with the mixing of the
European traditions

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:47.090
and African traditions,
but not only for the sense

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:49.820
of what happened in Cuba, but
the sense that what happened

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.470
in the Caribbean in general.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.050
So what we call the [foreign
language spoken] is something

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.850
that sounds very Haitian to me.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:00.950
Sounds like from Haiti.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:02.250
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: Mm-hmm.

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:05.330
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez: And just
before [inaudible] our musical

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.570
roots is like a rainbow.

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:09.530
We have French influence.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.450
We have Chinese influence.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:15.430
It's not only the Spanish
and the African traditions.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:19.560
There is English even
because the [inaudible]

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:25.180
at one point became for us the
first national kind of dance

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.450
that we're calling the
[foreign language spoken] came

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:30.230
from the country dance that
was something that was danced

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:36.020
in England and then it went
to France, changed name

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.340
to [foreign language
spoken] like the games.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.260
Once was country but it
got lost in translation.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.510
[ Laughter ]

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:47.050
And then I guess in Cuba got
again the translation got

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.350
to [inaudible].

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.290
So we say we feel
so many things.

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.510
But I will Yosvany expand that.

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:58.170
[ Inaudible ]

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:02.370
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Responding
all that is all that plus a lot

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:05.040
of different tradition
from West Africa.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:09.790
It's not just anywhere
in Africa.

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:14.760
We're talking about West Africa.

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.120
We're talking about
[inaudible] tradition.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.420
We're talking about [inaudible].

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:25.030
We're talking about tradition
that came also from the Congo.

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:30.950
So it's a vast area
that accounts for a lot

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:35.360
of different traditions and
how all those traditions,

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.500
at one time they have to
coincide in one place in Cuba

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:43.620
and kind of melt because there's
a lot of things that in Cuba

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.190
and you see that in Africa.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.450
They are separate, you know,
if you are from [inaudible],

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:49.480
you just practice,
you know, [inaudible].

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.580
You are from [inaudible] you
practice just one [inaudible]

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.900
in Cuba.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.510
They all have to coexist
in one place and they have

00:34:01.510 --> 00:34:07.610
to bring all the traditions
together and, you know,

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:15.470
sort of form this big palate
of freedoms, and knowledge,

00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:20.820
and traditions that's
what we have in our music.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.620
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry:
And also I will add

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.370
because most have been said,

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.830
that [inaudible]
Cuba is an island.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:32.670
It's a big island so sometimes
you could be traveling

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:38.460
from the most western side of
Cuba to the most eastern side

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.880
and there [inaudible] that
these people didn't know

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:46.630
from are practiced in the
other side of the island.

00:34:46.630 --> 00:34:48.330
There's a lot of musical
traditions, I mean [inaudible]

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.240
that are different
than the one practiced

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:53.990
in my province [inaudible]
that has nothing to do

00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:57.820
with what's practiced in
Matanzas and then [inaudible].

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:03.500
But different set of drums
played in different places,

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.800
different [inaudible].

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:08.270
Even from Spain they're like
influences from different side

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.090
of Spain in difference
parts of [inaudible].

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:16.180
Like Eva said, we
cannot just say Spain,

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:21.740
but we have to open it to a
lot of different countries,

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.020
even from the northern,

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:28.020
from Morocco there were
influences in Cuba, too.

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:34.090
So it's like a huge, huge
hybrid that somewhere,

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:40.750
somehow found way to
create an identity

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:44.920
that at the same time
defines Cuba music.

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.520
For us, even for
us it's really hard

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:49.320
to define what Cuban music is.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.930
But and also at the same
time happens something

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:53.710
which is really interesting
and it's

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.770
like the Caribbean being one
of the centers in which a lot

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:01.170
of places, a lot of
countries from the world came.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:08.150
Turned the Caribbean into
like something, for me,

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:12.090
[inaudible] at some point became
like the center of the universe.

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:16.660
And it was interesting when
[inaudible] I will explain why.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:23.410
There was an exhibition
in New York four years ago

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.760
that was about Caribbean art.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.260
And this exhibition that was

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.140
like in different
museums across New York.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:37.580
And the studio museum in
[inaudible], in the museum

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.610
in [inaudible], and there
was another museum in Queens

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.240
and I'm forgetting the name.

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.300
You could go to the
museum and they,

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.890
the curator of the
exhibition were really smart

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:57.180
because they selected pieces
from artists from the 1700's,

00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.900
1800's, 1900's, up
to the present.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:04.580
So when you would visit that
exhibition it was really hard

00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:08.940
to define or to accept that
this is a Caribbean artist.

00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:11.520
It looks like it could
be a French artist.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:15.880
It looks like it could be a
Velasco, it could be a Rubens.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:19.090
It could be any artist.

00:37:19.090 --> 00:37:22.670
So after visit that exhibition
for me it was a big revelation

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:27.130
because even though
we were born in places

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:32.730
that you can [inaudible] history
by just seeing a building

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:36.960
that was built in the
1600's, but at the same time,

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.260
you really understand the
centrality of this geography

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.820
for the culture of the world.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.560
And you really understand
how hard it is

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:51.910
to define what the Caribbean is,
what Cuban is because, I mean,

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.210
the concept of the art,

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:57.400
the concept of the music
defies any given concept

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:00.020
that you could have
of the geography.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:05.270
So it can bring an
artist from the 1700's,

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:08.360
it's could be a European
artist, could be a Chinese art.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.860
It could be an artist from
anywhere in the world.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.570
So as you can see that
nowadays, you can either see

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:15.870
that through the
music, you can see

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:19.440
that through the visual
arts, through the films.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:24.010
You can see through, I
mean, most of the art forms.

00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:28.240
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez: I just
want to add so when we talk

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:33.550
about Cuban music especially
now, there is mixture of purity

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:37.080
and impurity in terms
of African music.

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.380
In many other countries

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.170
where the slaves were
brought [inaudible] us

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.700
on how they managed

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:49.620
to be disguised especially
the religious traditions

00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:51.860
because they were allowed

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:58.140
to [inaudible] do what
they celebrated in Africa

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.410
but using the saints that
the Europeans wanted them

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:04.650
to worship.

00:39:04.650 --> 00:39:08.640
Those [inaudible] with
a great sense of purity.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.520
You can go to all the islands

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:15.160
and you see there is
still a sense of Africa,

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.870
of African traditions
[inaudible] so pure.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:22.490
But I say purity and impurity
because what Terry said

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:25.460
that it got mixed
with that music

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.940
from so many places
and it got mixed.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.490
So it's hard to find
something purely

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:35.410
from the Congo or from Nigeria.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:36.750
It's all mixed.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.500
But not, when you
listen to any music now,

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.520
whether it's a jazz number,
or something for the masses,

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.700
something like to
dance in a party,

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.420
there will always be a section

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.810
that is totally Afroid
[inaudible].

00:39:51.810 --> 00:39:58.030
And if it doesn't have that,
something is lacking in the mix.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.430
So I just wanted
to add that part.

00:40:00.430 --> 00:40:01.820
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Gonzalez:
thank you.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.110
Before we go on to
the next questions

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:06.820
and turn the microphone
to the audience,

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:10.740
I would like to ask you,
make a comment first

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.460
and then the question
will come up from there.

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:16.960
About art as an instrument
of transformation

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.150
because I think the three
of you believe on that.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:23.380
The power of the music as a
instrument of transformation

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.810
on so many different levels
and the power of the music

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:30.610
that goes beyond walls
and different barriers.

00:40:30.610 --> 00:40:35.050
So if you can expand in
that sense and [inaudible]

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:42.250
and a cultural ambassador
because I will say that.

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:46.200
How do you manifest that,
how you work on that?

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:50.150
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: Well,
this is something with,

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:54.130
that is really relevant and
important to artists in general

00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:57.810
and especially given
the nature of music,

00:40:57.810 --> 00:41:00.690
and even when you go back
to the first musicians,

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:06.630
you can see how [inaudible],
how important was [inaudible]

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:12.000
and also was because of
work opportunities they have

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.750
to be moving in between
countries,

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.830
they have to start
traveling [inaudible]

00:41:16.830 --> 00:41:18.860
different geographies.

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:24.060
When they have to learn how to
communicate in different parts

00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:25.600
of the world where they are.

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.400
You can go back to Mozart,
so once he go to Italy,

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.070
he learns the Italian opera.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:34.770
He needs to learn how to write
that opera in the Italian style.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:38.710
But then he goes to France,
he learned how to treat it

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:41.500
as a French, and as German.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.670
But also you can see it here
in cases like Duke Ellington

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:50.150
and Louis Armstrong who
were ambassadors of,

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:52.930
you know, jazz in the world.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:57.140
So I think that was really
important for me growing up.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.050
It was the teaching of my
own father, being a musician,

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:03.590
and also having the opportunity,
especially the opportunity

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:08.700
to play in places where Cuban
didn't even have political

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:10.890
relationship with those
country at the time.

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:15.900
And music was the way in which
Cuba established relationship

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.200
with those country.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:21.950
So he instilled in us, again, at
very early age, the importance

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:26.190
to understand art and music
as an ambassador and also

00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:36.230
to understand the mission that
we have as an artist to erase

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:39.690
and also, not only erase
barriers and barriers

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:44.780
that can make us, can
create differences,

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:49.370
but at the same time to
see ourselves as someone

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.020
that is unmuzzled, that has
to reestablish connections,

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.050
that has to really foster
relationship that's,

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:57.610
we need to foster collaboration.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:01.830
So it's with that idea
that and that, you know,

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:06.920
we grew up in my house because
it was practice from my father

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.230
and actually the house.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.550
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Mm-hmm.

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:12.850
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez: I
haven't had the fortunate

00:43:12.850 --> 00:43:17.680
to enter students to Cuba, but
that's something that will be

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:20.970
so [inaudible] for them to see,

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:23.630
and to [inaudible] I don't
see any reason why should

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.560
that barrier be there.

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.770
So I'm very, I'm not going
to talk a lot about that.

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:32.930
But I'm glad that now there
is this legal opportunity

00:43:32.930 --> 00:43:35.810
for the exchange
between both cultures,

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:38.040
to have them with more freedom.

00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:42.060
I just hope that it remains
that way for a long time.

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:48.730
It's very, it is very limited
for the people to not be able

00:43:48.730 --> 00:43:53.070
to share their traditions
and empower their roots

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:56.360
by learning what is
[inaudible] more similarities

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:01.700
than there are differences
so I'm totally for that.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.000
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Yeah.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.140
I want to add that I've been
[inaudible] we're brothers,

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:08.440
as Yosvany said.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:13.960
One of the reason I wanted
to take music as a profession

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.350
from the beginning was
because all the tales of my dad

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:22.290
of traveling and how he saw
the world through the music.

00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:25.450
He was able to visit
many places in Africa,

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:34.360
in the eastern European places,
the way he went out before.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.120
And I've been able to see,
with the music I've been able

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.070
to see a lot of the world,

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:42.100
and I've been able
to teach also abroad.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:47.090
I was teaching in
India for six weeks

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:49.250
in a university over there.

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:53.740
And it's really enriching to see
how the students over there were

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.230
so eager to learn the music.

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.690
And at the same time I
was learning with them,

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:01.930
trying to learn a little
bit of their culture.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:05.400
And that's information
and that's a way

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.610
of like really getting
to know each other

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:15.740
and what's really important,
not just for itself but also

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.480
for everyone involved
in that change.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.870
I was talking about my culture,

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:23.440
about how who plays certain
things because it's related

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.590
to certain dynamic
in our culture.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:29.300
And they explaining to me,

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.730
[inaudible] to me something
similar how, you know,

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.560
in the music these had to deal

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:38.660
with this other aspect
of the culture.

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:46.760
And also how the music
is loved by many people

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.660
and like the [inaudible]
style, for example, in Africa,

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.930
when you go to Africa playing
[inaudible], I don't know

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:54.680
if you guys heard of [inaudible]
style music with violins,

00:45:54.680 --> 00:46:00.060
and piano, flute, and was
really prevalent 40's,

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:02.170
50's, 30's, 40's, 50's.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:03.890
That's a tradition that it kind

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:06.390
of stay frozen over
there in Africa.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.780
You go to Senegal, you go
to some of those places

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.280
like they revere you
playing their music.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.190
The same with when you
go to Columbia as well.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:20.640
I think it brings down
the barriers as they said,

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:24.810
brings us closer to each other
and it's real important for all

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:29.280
of us to feel that [inaudible],
to have that serious.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.580
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Gonzalez: Okay.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:34.810
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: I also
wanted to give you an anecdote.

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:37.880
Last year I had an opportunity
to take the Harvard Jazz Band

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:42.560
on a trip to Cuba and we
stayed there one week.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.160
And during that week
I organized all

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.220
of the activities for the tour.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:50.120
We visited three
music conservatories

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.850
and we [inaudible] them.

00:46:51.850 --> 00:46:53.150
They played for us.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.450
We played for them.

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:59.360
I arranged to have one of
the important music coach

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.090
to work with the band.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:04.480
I took them mostly to
Matanzas to visit even

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.980
like [inaudible] museums
where they have a lot

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.450
of remnants of the slavery.

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:15.850
They saw [inaudible] one of
the big authorities in some

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:20.630
of the Africa communities
[inaudible].

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:25.010
And we did a concert
with special guests

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:31.160
and professional musicians
from Cuba Casa de las Americas.

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:35.540
And the most amazing part of
the trip it was at the end,

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:40.390
to see the power of
transformation that music

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:43.410
and art has in all the students.

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:47.790
So they went to Cuba, not even

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:49.570
with the concept
of what Cuba was.

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.630
And I made sure before
we went on tour

00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:54.030
to bring different professors of
the university to lecture them

00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:55.780
about where they were going.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.080
They'd talk about politics.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.380
They'd talk about history.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:47:59.680
They talked about everything.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.150
But nothing that they,

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:05.630
I mean none of those lectures
prepared them to the reality

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:07.850
of being [inaudible]
the culture.

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:13.480
And so that was a truly
transformative experience

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.780
for those students.

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.920
I mean they were
changed I believe

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:18.450
for the rest of their life.

00:48:18.450 --> 00:48:24.580
So, again, this is just like
a little anecdote the power

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.750
of transformation that
music and art have.

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:29.050
Yeah.

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.510
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Gonzalez:
Thank you very much.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:32.810
Thank you.

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:35.010
So we're going to take
[inaudible] someone

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.310
from the audience.

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:38.300
Before that, thank
you very much.

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.100
Please join me to -- .

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:46.580
[ Applause ]

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.160
Yes. We'll be able to
take some questions.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.400
&gt;&gt; Yes. So my question
is [inaudible].

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:57.090
The first part of the
question is I know that like

00:48:57.090 --> 00:49:01.530
in Afro-Cuban religions
certain rhythms are sacred.

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:06.280
Can you incorporate those sacred
rhythms into jazz or something

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.580
if you are not a [inaudible]?

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.590
And the second part
of my question is

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.170
in two weeks I'll be in Havana.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:13.470
I'm very excited.

00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:14.770
I've been waiting
five years in Miami

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:17.530
and [inaudible] that Havana.

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:22.100
Is there one place that you
could recommend that I would go

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.510
to hear the best
[inaudible] jazz?

00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:27.610
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.920
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez: Okay.

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.980
There are many sacred things

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:36.770
about the Afro-Cuban
religions but,

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:44.530
not I think the rhythms are
used I think what they pray

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:50.550
[inaudible] but the rhythm
itself we can't be using

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.720
[inaudible] it cannot be used
but we don't [inaudible].

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.050
They permeate everything.

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:58.980
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.280
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: No, no.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:05.920
It's important to understand
that life is not separated

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:09.490
from the daily spirits, meaning

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.050
like the practitioners are also
the musicians that are part

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:16.080
of the popular band and there
also are musicians that went

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:17.840
to the classical
music conservatory,

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.070
or the composers, or everyone.

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:28.090
So it's impossible that if I'm a
practitioner that I'm not going

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:31.240
to use something that for
me has a lot of importance.

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.960
So like, as just
he's commenting,

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:38.280
what Adonis said,
you can't use it.

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:41.840
Of course there is
that it also happens.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:44.850
I'm looking in the other
side of the spectrum.

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:46.400
Appropriation happen also there.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.700
People that aren't
the practitioner

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:51.520
that also use those
musical tradition

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.130
for different purposes,
you know.

00:50:55.130 --> 00:51:00.420
But, yeah, there's no I would
say limitation, and especially

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.290
because when you're, it
all depends on the mission

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:09.350
and what the result of
what you're using it for.

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:14.600
I could give you an example of
there was a CD that I created

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.060
that the name is
"New Throned King"

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:21.770
in which the entire CD is
based on the musical traditions

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:26.800
that came from the [inaudible]
which is now in [inaudible].

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:32.800
Yes, I used everything
from the, that I've learned

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.360
from this type of,
from this culture.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:39.790
But at the same time, to me
it's not a religious record.

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:41.460
It's a cultural record.

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:44.990
So therefore it isn't one that
context that we working with all

00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:47.700
of this, this is this
vast heritage that came

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:51.530
from West Africa, yeah.

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:53.800
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Responding
to that, of course,

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:56.130
you could also find some close
minded people that might say,

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:57.900
"Oh, you shouldn't
really use that."

00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.100
But your using it
out of [inaudible].

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:02.290
You don't use it at
[inaudible], you know,

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:04.650
the religious aspect of it.

00:52:04.650 --> 00:52:12.270
So it would definitely
have completely different

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:16.550
like if you listen to the
recording of [Inaudible]

00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:19.900
when he was [inaudible]
nobody hardly ever [inaudible]

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.200
the society.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.150
But, you know, we're
using a [inaudible]

00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:28.610
that is complete world now
to be able to use [inaudible]

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:30.980
at the time when
he was doing it,

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.860
it was something completely new.

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:35.270
But he was doing it so out
of context, he was doing,

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:37.680
playing with Dizzy, he
was at Carnegie Hall,

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:41.010
was a completely different,
you know, it's one thing to do,

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:45.410
you know, so it's
accepted to use it.

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:47.510
And talking about -- .

00:52:47.510 --> 00:53:00.660
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:08.190
And that would be one of them
to go and see live music.

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:11.410
I will say if you're there with
somebody [inaudible] experience

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:15.230
on the street that is
every, every Sunday

00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:16.920
and it's really the
neighborhood people,

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.740
and the neighborhood playing.

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:22.670
And it's an amazing experience
that I will say something not

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:24.510
to miss if you go there.

00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:28.740
[ Laughter ]

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.510
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Gonzalez: Any other
question from the audience?

00:53:31.510 --> 00:54:03.560
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:06.650
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: I think it's,
we talking about two things

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:08.610
that are really interesting
because music

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:11.420
at one point here
was pop music here.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.720
Jazz was pop.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:18.950
I always made the comparison
like Ella Fitzgerald was

00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:23.840
like Beyonce or something
at the time.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:27.910
You know, was [inaudible] was
on TV was like really popular.

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:29.260
So -- .

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:30.560
&gt;&gt; Nat King Cole.

00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:31.860
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry: Nat King Cole.

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:33.160
Nat King Cole.

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:34.460
One of them two was

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.760
on television all
the time performing

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.060
and influenced many people.

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.420
We don't have that anymore here.

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:40.270
It's different.

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.690
For a certain degree
it's harder to see.

00:54:42.690 --> 00:54:43.990
It's a little more expensive

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:47.180
for the younger [inaudible]
to have access to it.

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:53.380
I think that that makes
it a little more far to,

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:58.830
a little sad, for to find a way
for them to have a opportunity

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:01.590
for they don't see
it closely every day.

00:55:01.590 --> 00:55:07.230
We can talk about
many other things.

00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:14.020
I could say Cuba jazz
still is like anything.

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:17.410
Now we're [inaudible] we've
been here for a few years now.

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:22.290
There's a generation of
people now that it's more

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:25.900
into like whatever is really
popular right now there's people

00:55:25.900 --> 00:55:27.750
doing reggae tune
that for me it's

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:34.980
like completely different
music and maybe I'm not

00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:36.280
into it at the moment.

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:37.580
But maybe.

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:38.880
[Inaudible].

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:41.180
That's what popular over there.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.820
There's so more people doing
it because it's maybe catchy

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:47.620
because a sort of somehow
people make money quick.

00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:49.760
I remember we had the time
when we were over there.

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.630
We were listening to more
jazz because there was groups

00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:54.190
that were included
in their music

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:55.640
and it was more prominent
like [inaudible].

00:55:55.640 --> 00:56:00.410
There were more groups that
were really like the top group

00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:03.290
at the time that were
infusing it more.

00:56:03.290 --> 00:56:07.640
So we grew up in a generation
in Cuba that had more jazz.

00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:09.230
We're like every day seeing it.

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:12.330
And maybe they, like I said,
the kids now, they see it less

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:16.120
because some of the [inaudible]
hit the country so strongly

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:18.910
that they just wanted whatever
is popular at the moment.

00:56:18.910 --> 00:56:20.450
They still, but still
if you go there,

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.570
there's some amazing players
over there, young players.

00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:24.880
I don't think it's died off.

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.180
I think -- .

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:27.480
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Gonzalez:
Different times.

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:28.990
&gt;&gt; Yunior Terry:
Different, just different.

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:30.590
But it's a lot of
the great players.

00:56:30.590 --> 00:56:33.940
When you go over there,
Jazz Festival is in sometime

00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.590
in December, sometime
in January.

00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:38.190
[Inaudible] a lot
of music and a lot

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:40.760
of great players you get to see.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.060
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry:
There's a question.

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.550
&gt;&gt; I have so many questions
for you but I'd dearly love

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:46.410
to hear what you're
talking about.

00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:48.590
So if you could play
something -- .

00:56:48.590 --> 00:56:50.390
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: Right here.

00:56:50.390 --> 00:57:00.380
[ Inaudible ]

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.010
&gt;&gt; Adonis Gonzalez: We're
trying to figure out what.

00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:03.310
[ Laughter ]

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:07.510

[ Inaudible ]

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.220
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: It was
too early to bring to wake

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:26.510
up the saxophone and the bass.

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:29.030
[ Music ]

00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:31.780
So instead I brought
the [inaudible].

00:57:31.780 --> 00:57:34.650
&gt;&gt; Eva Reyes Gonzalez:
Yosvany, could you tell us

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:37.980
about the [inaudible] quickly?

00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:39.280
&gt;&gt; Yosvany Terry: Yeah.

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.630
Yeah. This instrument
is named [inaudible].

00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:47.450
And the tradition that my
father learned it from is come

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:50.880
from the [inaudible]
from Nigeria.

00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:56.170
He learned with his uncle

00:57:56.170 --> 00:58:00.830
but then he developed
his own technique.

00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:07.130
And he's now considered like the
king of this instrument in Cuba.

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:14.190
He's even, he had even traveled
back to Nigeria and went

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:17.020
to different [inaudible].

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.320
And, yeah, [inaudible].

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:25.370
And it's just a gourd that is
pressed with a net of beads

00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:31.100
and outside this and it
make a change depending

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:33.440
on where you get it.

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:40.870
If you, in Africa they sell
it dressed with curry shells.

00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:47.380
In Cuba it's different [foreign
language spoken], a nice red

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:51.250
or black and that's how you
use it, that how you dress it.

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:54.990
And now these [inaudible] are
using beads, plastic beads,

00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:59.140
or even sometimes glass beads.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:06.620
So, as I said, the gourd grows
in many different places.

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:10.130
This gourd is actually from
North Carolina or South Carolina

00:59:10.130 --> 00:59:13.650
because it grows here in
the United States as well.

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:14.950
And [inaudible].

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:20.060
It's like I can give it to you
and [inaudible] it will be hard

00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.490
to get something out of it.

00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:24.510

to it -- .
