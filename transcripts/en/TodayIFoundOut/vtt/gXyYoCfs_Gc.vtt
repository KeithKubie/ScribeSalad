00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.969
We British are a famously stoic people and
notable figures from our history are often

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.439
portrayed as being impossibly composed- facing
unthinkable hardship and turmoil with a quiet,

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.560
reserved dignity.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.910
Perhaps no man in history has ever typified
this stereotype better than Henry Paget, a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.040
man who by all accounts reacted to his leg
being blown off and then amputated (without

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.301
the benefit of an anaesthetic) like he was
patiently waiting for water to boil so he

00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:39.450
could pour a good cuppa.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.249
Known variously as the 1st Marquess of Anglesey,
the Earl of Uxbridge or more simply, Lord

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:50.940
Paget, Henry Paget is an almost mythical figure
in British military history, famed for his

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.809
unflappable demeanour and fearlessness in
battle during the Napoleonic Wars.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:01.309
Prior to the war, he famously courted (and
eloped and subsequently had ten children with)

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:08.340
the wife of the Duke of Wellington’s brother
while the pair were both still married, infuriating

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.430
the Iron Duke.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.070
This ultimately led to a duel with the lady
in question’s brother, Colonel Henry Cadogan.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.189
During the duel, Cadogan fired at Paget but
missed.

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.159
Rather than take careful aim and fire back,
as was his right, Paget refused to shoot and

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.060
the duel ended.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.950
Six years later, Paget was assigned as the
Duke of Wellington’s second in command before

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.979
the battle of Waterloo, much to the Duke’s
chagrin.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.500
Nevertheless, during the battle, Paget’s
performance was nothing short of heroic, reportedly

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.450
having eight horses shot from under him, each
time calling for another and soldiering on.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.280
Speaking of horses shot out from under him,
very near the end of the battle, Paget was

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.920
riding alongside Wellington, discussing the
battle with the Duke, when out of nowhere

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.070
case shot ripped through both Paget’s horse
and the lower region of his right leg, sending

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.500
him crashing to the ground.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.289
Supposedly completely unperturbed by the injury,
it is widely reportedly that Paget turned

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.390
to Wellington and simply exclaimed: “By
God, sir, I’ve lost my leg!”

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.630
Prompting Wellington to respond: “By God,
sir, so you have!”

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.590
Unfortunately (because it’s hilarious and
quite possibly the most stereotypicaly British

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:21.110
way to note that one has suddenly unexpectedly
lost a leg), we could find no direct evidence

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.120
that this exchange occurred this way.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.870
It’s just something that is widely repeated,
even by extremely reputable sources.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.290
And while it certainly is in-line with Paget’s
legendary stoicism (better documented examples

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.230
of which, you’ll soon read), it seems unlikely
Paget actually said this as he had not lost

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.310
his leg at all at this point; it was still
very much attached and it wasn’t clear at

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.090
this stage whether it would need amputated.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.040
The only evidence of what Paget may have actually
said after getting his leg punched full of

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.250
holes comes from the diary of one J.W.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.200
Croker, written a little over three years
later on December 8, 1818.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.080
Croker wrote that Horace Seymour, who was
present when Paget was shot and helped carry

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.460
him off the field, told him that Paget exclaimed
directly after being hit, “I have got it

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.460
at last!”

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.540
And the Duke replied, “No?

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.650
Have you, by God?”

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.620
Of course, this is somewhat tenuous evidence,
but at least has a contemporary source to

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.940
back it up, unlike the “By God, sir, I’ve
lost my leg!” exclamation.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.820
Whatever the case, those attending to Paget
immediately after his injury noted that he

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.370
was remarkably reserved in spite of the crippling
pain he was undoubtedly feeling.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.370
For example, shortly after the incident, one
Thomas Wildman noted that Paget smiled and

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.370
stated, “I have had a pretty long run.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.370
I have been a beau these 47 years and it would
not be fair to cut the young men out any longer.”

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.190
Paget was similarly nonplussed while being
examined by the doctor.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.790
Deputy Inspector of Medical Staff John Robert
Hume would later state:

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.090
His lordship was perfectly cool, his pulse
was calm and regular, as if he had just risen

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.980
from his bed in the morning, and he displayed
no expression of uneasiness though his suffering

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.710
must have been extreme…

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.860
After being informed by Hume that his leg
needed to be amputated, Paget simply replied,

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.120
“Very well, I am ready”.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.700
Once Hume then told him he was about to begin,
he stated Paget replied, “Whenever you please”.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:03.430
Throughout the amputation, which was conducted
without any anaesthetic, Paget lay calmly

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.290
and, according to Hume, he “neither uttered
groan or complaint nor gave any sign of impatience

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.070
or uneasiness.”

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.460
After the amputation was finished and the
wound sealed, Hume took measurements of Paget’s

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.799
vitals and was astounded to find that his
pulse was still a calm and collected 66 BPM

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.820
and his skin was “perfectly cool”.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.440
This lead Hume to later recall, “So far
was he from exhibiting any symptoms of what

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.420
he had undergone in his countenance that I
am quite certain, had anyone entered the room,

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.680
they would have inquired of him where the
wounded man was.”

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.760
Indeed, according to Lieutenant General Richard
Hussey Vivian, who commanded the 6th Brigade

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.390
of Paget’s Cavalry Division, very shortly
after the leg was removed, Vivian entered

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.310
to find Paget quite collected.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.930
Paget, upon seeing his officer, exclaimed
to him,

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.930
Ah, Vivian!

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.930
I want you to do me a favour.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.660
Some of my friends here seem to think I might
have kept that leg on.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.600
Just go and cast your eye upon it, and tell
me what you think.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.180
Vivian later recalled, “I went, accordingly
and, taking up the lacerated limb, carefully

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.840
examined it, and so far as I could tell, it
was completely spoiled for work.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.380
A rusty grape-shot had gone through and shattered
the bones all to pieces.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.680
I therefore returned to the Marquis and told
him he could set his mind quite at rest, as

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.190
his leg, in my opinion, was better off than
on.”

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.800
Following his recovery, Paget refused to acknowledge
that he’d done anything other than his duty,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.610
turning down a large (for the time) £1,200
annual pension (by purchasing power today

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.720
this would be about half a million pounds
per year) to compensate him for the loss of

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.720
his limb.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.230
He then went on to live a long, full life,
dying at the ripe old age of 85.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.120
But this isn’t the end of the story, because
we still have to talk about what Paget’s

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.390
leg did after the war.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.900
You see, after Paget’s leg was amputated,
the owner of the house he had it amputated

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.840
in, Joseph-Marie Paris, asked the lord if
he could bury it in his garden.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.020
Paget, seeing no use for the ruined limb anymore,
gave Paris permission to do as he wished with

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.020
the appendage.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.760
Paris, true to his word, buried it in his
garden, making its final resting place with

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.330
a large tombstone bearing a flowery epitaph
that read:

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.800
Here lies the Leg of the illustrious and valiant
Earl Uxbridge, Lieutenant-General of His Britannic

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.300
Majesty, Commander in Chief of the English,
Belgian and Dutch cavalry, wounded on the

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.560
18 June 1815 at the memorable battle of Waterloo,
who, by his heroism, assisted in the triumph

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.680
of the cause of mankind, gloriously decided
by the resounding victory of the said day.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.270
The grave eventually became something of a
tourist attraction, the profile of which was

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.230
raised considerably when notable figures like
the Prince of Orange and the King of Prussia

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.230
visited it.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:40.240
After a storm tore up a large portion of Paris’
garden in the late 19th century, exposing

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.830
the bones of the leg to the elements, Paris’
descendants put the remains on display and

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.590
began charging people to see them as part
of a museum.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.151
Upon discovering that the bones were now on
display in 1878, Paget’s son demanded that

00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:54.151
the remains be returned to England.

00:06:54.151 --> 00:06:59.230
The Paris family agreed… if the Paget family
paid them to compensate for the loss of the

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.810
attraction.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.550
The Paget family refused.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.610
They then used the full might of their family
influence to get their way, at one point convincing

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.330
the British government to threaten to cut
off all trade with Belgium if the remains

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.990
of the leg weren’t returned.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.800
Eventually, the Belgian Minister of Justice
intervened, citing an ordinance that stated

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.760
all human remains must be interred in a cemetery.

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.570
He then ordered the bones be buried in such
a place.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.630
What happened after isn’t fully clear and,
unfortunately, documented evidence is once

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.650
again scant despite the events after often
widely being reported as definitive.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.140
In truth, there are two accounts- one that
the bones were indeed buried in a cemetery

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.140
as ordered.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:36.260
Alternatively, it is widely stated that the
curator of the museum took the bones and hid

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:37.270
them in his attic.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:41.400
In 1934, his widow supposedly found them and,
remembering the threats issued against her

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:59.080
family last time they were uncovered, ordered
a maid to dispose of them in the furnace.
