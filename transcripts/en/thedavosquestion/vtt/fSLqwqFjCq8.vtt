00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
&gt;&gt; We're recording by the way.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.530
&gt;&gt; Oh, hi, hi.
I'm Barbara Kiviat of TIME magazine.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.620
This is Michael Arrington of TechCrunch.
You have a question?

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.070
&gt;&gt; What do you think is the most exciting
innovation, development over

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.550
the next decade that will help improve the
state of the world?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.119
&gt;&gt; Michael?

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.499
&gt;&gt; The cure for cancer.

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:21.460
&gt;&gt; In the next decade?
I like that about you, you think big.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.379
&gt;&gt; Oh, we're to assume that they're going
to do whatever we're saying?

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:26.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not what's nice.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.140
&gt;&gt; You got YouTube HD now, right?
And she's tracking a story, that's why she's

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.140
half-here.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.140
&gt;&gt; I think --

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.800
&gt;&gt; After YouTube HD, it's got to be a cure
for cancer.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.130
&gt;&gt; I think it's going to be something to do
with water purification.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.980
&gt;&gt; See?
That's a good answer.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:52.310
&gt;&gt; Anything in particular that you've seen
that is really going to make

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.310
a difference?

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.950
&gt;&gt; Oh, I didn't realize that would be a follow-up
question.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.710
&gt;&gt; It's a good answer.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.710
&gt;&gt; Something with filtration.
We already have those tubes you know, you

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.670
just feel that like that's --
clean drinking water is sort of a very -- something

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.860
with
infrastructure, something very unsexy but

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.961
of incredible importance,
too.

00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:09.490
&gt;&gt; More corn by-products would be good to
feed more people would be

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.790
good.
We need to grow more corn.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.380
&gt;&gt; You know, I wish corn were in more of our
food.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.549
&gt;&gt; We should maybe grow it in our own backyards.

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.829
&gt;&gt; But how can you top the straw water purification
thing?

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.259
&gt;&gt; That already exists.
But something a little more --

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.681
&gt;&gt; But what about you?

00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:28.310
&gt;&gt; A cure for cancer.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.850
&gt;&gt; What one in particular?

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:39.429
&gt;&gt; Some of the clean energy companies are
starting to actually make

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:42.890
energy cheaply without government paying for
it so we'll see if some of

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.930
the tech pioneers here, especially the solar
stuff.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.240
&gt;&gt; I talked to a guy earlier today --

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.139
&gt;&gt; E-solar or something like that, doing some
really interesting

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:53.899
things, mirrors making water hot.

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.899
&gt;&gt; Because, I mean, solar's always been really
expensive to produce.

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.939
&gt;&gt; There's this guy in India, whose name I
don't remember, which is

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:05.079
unfortunate, but his company basically -- Sealco
or something like

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:10.560
that -- basically helps finance, you know,
street venders, folks like

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.480
that, resources in India in order to buy solar
panels and then use that

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.270
to either their, you know, light their cart
or their businesses or

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.360
their homes.
But the insight is that they partner with

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.990
local financial institutions
in order to do the sort of --

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.110
&gt;&gt; Where do you think ultimately the innovation
is going to come from?

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.360
I mean you mentioned -- is it going come out
of places like traditional

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:45.420
capitals, like Silicon Valley, or is
it going to come out of places

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.770
where you don't expect to see innovation like
India, China, et cetera?

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.400
&gt;&gt; Well, a lot of the panel yesterday and
The Carlyle Group was sort of

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.030
talking about how, you know, private investors
how Silicon Valley this

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.060
[INAUDIBLE] to China, India for tomorrow's
technology.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.190
&gt;&gt; All right. Cool.
Thanks, guys, come by again.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.190
&gt;&gt;Thanks.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.370
&gt;&gt; It's awesome what you're doing here.
