00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.810
What you’re looking at is a hermetically
sealed glass laboratory.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.250
Scientists here are engineering special chips
that could power the next computing revolution:

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.990
a universal quantum computer.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.820
Chances are you’ve heard of quantum computer
and that they’re going to change everything.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.100
“So quantum computers have the potential
to completely change how we use technology

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.100
in the future.”

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.100
“The computational power is off the charts.”

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.750
“What’s about to happen with quantum computing
is about to make the past look incredibly

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.370
slow.”

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.320
Quantum computer are new kinds of machines
that promise an exponential growth spurt in

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.970
processing power, capable of tackling problems
our computers today can’t solve.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.320
While an encryption busting/global problem
solving quantum computer doesn’t exist yet,

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.630
the field has gained some serious momentum.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.719
“We've reached a point where it's pretty
clear that those performance numbers are good

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.520
enough now you could build a real product,
a real piece of technology out of this idea.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420
When that threshold got crossed, people started
to place their bets.”

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.979
Tech giants like IBM and Google, and startups
like Rigetti Computing are all in something

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.630
of a scientific race to building the first
universal quantum computer.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.090
But to understand what makes a quantum computer
so uniquely powerful, you’ll need to know

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.210
a bit about quantum mechanics.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.009
“Quantum mechanics is the field that describes
the simplest things around us, individual

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.779
electrons or atoms, or particles of light
like photons.

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:33.630
The fascinating thing is, when you look at
these very simple systems, they don’t really

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.689
obey the same rules that the world around
us does.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.420
We use sort of two very important properties
of quantum mechanics.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.749
One of them is superposition of states and
the other one is entanglement.”

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:47.829
“When we talk about classical computing,
we often hear the word ‘bit’ and bit can

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.159
refer to 0 or 1.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.810
You can also think it as a binary state.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.069
You have a switch, it can be on or it can
be off.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.509
For instance, when you’re physically typing
commands into your computer to write an email,

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.459
each letter you strike on the keyboard is
translated to a unique string of 0s and 1s

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:08.220
that are being switched on and off to digitally
represent your words.”

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.060
But with superposition, quantum computer can
do things differently.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.520
“Instead of using these bits, these zeros
or ones, we use what’s called qubits, which

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.360
are quantum bits and these bits instead of
being a zero or a one, can either be any combination

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.640
of a zero and a one…

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.140
This is something that arises because of quantum
mechanics and allows us to do more tricks.”

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.220
“Now, there’s a very special form of superposition
known as entanglement, which is even more

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.220
interesting.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.830
What you have is the ability to have two qubits
in superposition states.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.680
Essentially, they can only be understood with
a collective element of both quits.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.620
“In the quantum computer you can use that
lingering interaction to do all sorts of really

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.840
interesting types of calculations where different
qubits have this persistent ghostly connection

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.680
with each other and if you flip this qubit
around, this one over here will feel it.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.950
If you do that in a controlled way, you can
move lots and lots of information around within

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.520
your quantum mechanical system really efficiently.”

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.660
But controlling qubits and constructing the
right quantum architecture are today’s major

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.700
engineering challenges which is why quantum
computers and the labs that house them today,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.700
look like this.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.830
“It's right where computers were in the
'50s or '40s….where you had technicians

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.060
plugging and unplugging things all over the
place on some wall of electronics.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.930
You want things when you're first building
them to be really modular and reconfigurable.”

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.620
To build a quantum computer, you need to start
with a quantum chip and Rigetti, IBM, and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.690
other tech companies are investing in something
called superconducting qubits.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.660
“A superconducting qubit is just metal on
a silicon chip.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.860
That metal is arranged in such a way that
when you cool it down to a low enough temperature,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.760
the metal becomes superconducting.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.180
All the electrons can flow without electrical
resistance, they can actually take on individual

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:06.569
quantum states.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.190
They're six inches in size, so it's about
this big.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.860
There's typically anywhere between a few dozen
to a few hundred chips on this wafer.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.500
They get packaged into a circuit board that
lets us make connections onto that chip.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.079
When you're making circuits on silicon, you
have to have the environment be really free

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.770
of dust and contaminants, because we have
very small features on these chips, and a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.240
piece of dust can screw them up.”

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.889
“In order to cool them down, you need an
entire infrastructure of refrigeration, and

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.879
for that we rely on something called dilution
refrigerators.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:41.349
we cool these chips down to around 10-15 milikelvin.

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:46.710
The most noticeable sound you hear is the
cryocoolers.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.560
They work by pulsing helium gas into and out
of this refrigerator system in such a way

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.879
that it's just continuously drawing heat out
of the interior of the fridge.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:02.090
Besides the refrigerator there's an entire
suite of hardware components... coaxual cables,

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.860
attenuators, microwave amplifiers, circulators,
a whole bevvy of components that all need

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.409
to function at low temperatures.”

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:16.559
“In order to sort of control the qubits
we have a lot of hardware that sends pulses

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:18.159
and signals to the qubits.

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:26.499
We use this thing which we call a resonator
which is sort of sensitive to the state of

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:27.499
the qubit.

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:31.389
We like to say it's like a middleman and its
state will change depending on the state of

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.650
the qubit and we can read it and talk to it
more easily than we can talk to the qubit.”

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.819
Though the teams have different approaches,
they’re respectively finessing their techniques:

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.419
tweaking the intensity of microwave pulses,
the temperature, the manufacturing of the

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.909
superconducting qubits and testing new quantum
algorithms.

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.720
There’s a lot of work to do because at this
stage, the amount of time a quit can retain

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.550
its quantumness is still pretty short.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.430
“The single biggest challenge all the time
is always how do you make these qubits last

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:01.749
as long as possible?

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:07.099
Coherence times is how long quantum information
lasts inside of a qubit.

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:13.120
If you put a qubit from the zero-state to
the one-state, and you just wait 100 microseconds,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.030
200 microseconds, at some point that extra
little bit of energy will decay out of the

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.030
qubit.”

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.909
“All of the noise that we actually have
in physical systems results in error rates

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:28.860
that are still not quite good enough to perform
these proven quantum algorithms.”

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.780
In a head to head match between quantum computers
and classical computers today, our laptops

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.229
still dominate, at least for now.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:40.340
“Today's quantum computers aren't big enough
or high-performing enough to actually do something

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.069
better than a classical computer.

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.499
That's going to change pretty soon.

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:49.120
An example of this is, it is impossible for
a computer to anticipate what a molecule would

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.120
do in the human body, right?

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.419
This is something that the drug development
industry has to spend billions of dollars

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.910
figuring out by just guessing and checking.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.870
Nature doesn't store information in zeros
and ones.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.000
The operating system of nature is quantum
mechanics.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.400
If you want to simulate a quantum system,
you need something that can do it quantum

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400
mechanically.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.169
That's the kind of problem that a quantum
computer can solve.

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:15.169
“

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.509
Because quantum computers can analyze large
quantities of data &amp; spot patterns quickly,

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:23.470
they could tackle optimization problems for
transportation and industry, advance climate

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.830
modeling, and boost artificial intelligence
research one day.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.589
But for those wondering when they’ll be
able to pick up a quantum laptop…

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:35.130
“You won't have a personal laptop that is
a quantum computer.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.909
A quantum computer will be a little bit more
behind the scenes.”

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:42.619
Quantum computers are still in the experimental
stage, but their raw potential and imminent

00:07:42.619 --> 00:07:47.310
arrival are sure to cause a paradigm shift
in computing physics, and potentially our

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.479
understanding of the world we live in today.

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:53.749
“You're working on an extremely challenging
and hard problem where every day you're thinking

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:59.050
about really hard physics, debugging experiments,
working with hardware, writing a lot of code,

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.050
collaborating.”

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:05.840
“Much like the development of classical
computers, where no one would have probably

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:13.500
predicted where we are today with the technologies that emerged from classical computers such as with our mobile phones, laptops.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.340
That it’s really
hard for us to even predict what are going to be the off shoot technologies. Where is quantum computing

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:20.140
actually going to bring us into the future?”
