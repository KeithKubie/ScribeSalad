thanks for being here and today we're
 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.050
thanks for being here and today we're
going to talk about all games which in

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060
going to talk about all games which in
 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.450
going to talk about all games which in
some cases and some instances might be

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
some cases and some instances might be
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.230
some cases and some instances might be
your first success and we are going to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240
your first success and we are going to
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.540
your first success and we are going to
understand whether these they aged

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550
understand whether these they aged
 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.640
understand whether these they aged
better or worse and the goal of this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
better or worse and the goal of this
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.220
better or worse and the goal of this
session is basically well that was that

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230
session is basically well that was that
 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.930
session is basically well that was that
was a stronger introduction so the goal

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940
was a stronger introduction so the goal
 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940
was a stronger introduction so the goal
of this session is essentially to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
of this session is essentially to
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.290
of this session is essentially to
understand what are the different

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300
understand what are the different
 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030
understand what are the different
strategies so if these games are

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
strategies so if these games are
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.010
strategies so if these games are
becoming a burden or a technology debt

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
becoming a burden or a technology debt
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.350
becoming a burden or a technology debt
or if these are actually the new

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
or if these are actually the new
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.910
or if these are actually the new
opportunity that you can actually follow

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920
opportunity that you can actually follow
 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010
opportunity that you can actually follow
and to do that i will have on stage two

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
and to do that i will have on stage two
 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.560
and to do that i will have on stage two

dreams and as well a net vp of business
and marketing from dirty bit so i wanted

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
and marketing from dirty bit so i wanted
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.270
and marketing from dirty bit so i wanted
to start with a very easy example

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
to start with a very easy example
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.310
to start with a very easy example
because we were thinking about all games

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
because we were thinking about all games
 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.740
because we were thinking about all games
then i thought all right let's look at

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
then i thought all right let's look at
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.529
then i thought all right let's look at
all games and how how they look like

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
all games and how how they look like
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.020
all games and how how they look like
today so we have two games here both of

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030
today so we have two games here both of
 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.850
today so we have two games here both of
them by the rational developer games

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
them by the rational developer games
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.039
them by the rational developer games
inside i don't know if you're familiar

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049
inside i don't know if you're familiar
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.990
inside i don't know if you're familiar
with them but tribe's was published at

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
with them but tribe's was published at
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.530
with them but tribe's was published at
six years ago in 2012 and we have as

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
six years ago in 2012 and we have as
 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.469
six years ago in 2012 and we have as
well transfer empire published in 2014

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
well transfer empire published in 2014
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.539
well transfer empire published in 2014
four years ago and there's a big

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
four years ago and there's a big
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.280
four years ago and there's a big
difference among these developers i

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290
difference among these developers i
 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.899
difference among these developers i
don't know if you maybe you can guess if

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
don't know if you maybe you can guess if
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.429
don't know if you maybe you can guess if
you are obviously working for games in

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
you are obviously working for games in
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.580
you are obviously working for games in
sides you would know okay so I'm just

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
sides you would know okay so I'm just
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.580
sides you would know okay so I'm just
gonna so essentially what happens with

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
gonna so essentially what happens with
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440
gonna so essentially what happens with
these games is that one of these games

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450
these games is that one of these games
 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.929
these games is that one of these games
is actually a priority today still it

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
is actually a priority today still it
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.359
is actually a priority today still it
represents a big part of the revenues so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
represents a big part of the revenues so
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.490
represents a big part of the revenues so
when were I was I was looking at old

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500
when were I was I was looking at old
 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.730
when were I was I was looking at old
games we basically identified that some

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
games we basically identified that some
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.620
games we basically identified that some
of these old games they became an

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630
of these old games they became an
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.690
of these old games they became an
evergreen title and even though it's

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
evergreen title and even though it's
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.280
evergreen title and even though it's
been a long time since they were

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290
been a long time since they were
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.740
been a long time since they were
published they still represent a very

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750
published they still represent a very
 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.389
published they still represent a very
important source of revenues for the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399
important source of revenues for the
 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.730
important source of revenues for the
developer and as well these translates

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740
developer and as well these translates
 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.219
developer and as well these translates
into having these resources into the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
into having these resources into the
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.469
into having these resources into the
game and transfer Empire would be part

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
game and transfer Empire would be part
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.330
game and transfer Empire would be part
of that back catalogue so the first

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
of that back catalogue so the first
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700
of that back catalogue so the first
things you can see there is this one if

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
things you can see there is this one if
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.590
things you can see there is this one if
we look at another two examples here

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
we look at another two examples here
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.930
we look at another two examples here
both of them in these case our top

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
both of them in these case our top
 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.170
both of them in these case our top
priorities for both developers however

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
priorities for both developers however
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.330
priorities for both developers however
if you look at the right side

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340
if you look at the right side
 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.400
if you look at the right side
we might think that this game is it

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410
we might think that this game is it
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.979
we might think that this game is it
looks classier or at least slightly

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989
looks classier or at least slightly
 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.290
looks classier or at least slightly
older and in fact old school by room

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300
older and in fact old school by room
 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.720
older and in fact old school by room
skated runescape old school by Jagex was

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730
skated runescape old school by Jagex was
 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.330
skated runescape old school by Jagex was
published in PC for the first time 17

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
published in PC for the first time 17
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.280
published in PC for the first time 17
years ago so it makes sense while

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290
years ago so it makes sense while
 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.759
years ago so it makes sense while
responding was the legends was published

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769
responding was the legends was published
 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.520
responding was the legends was published
five years ago only however if you are a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
five years ago only however if you are a
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.710
five years ago only however if you are a
fan of runescape old-school you would

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720
fan of runescape old-school you would
 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.990
fan of runescape old-school you would
know that the game hasn't been laund

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000
know that the game hasn't been laund
 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.300
know that the game hasn't been laund
yet in mobile is in fact mounting in two

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
yet in mobile is in fact mounting in two
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.580
yet in mobile is in fact mounting in two
weeks the second of November so when we

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590
weeks the second of November so when we
 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.970
weeks the second of November so when we
are talking about like why isn't a game

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
are talking about like why isn't a game
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.550
are talking about like why isn't a game
old or how is an old game how do we

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560
old or how is an old game how do we
 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.350
old or how is an old game how do we
define these is it like by the launch

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
define these is it like by the launch
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.690
define these is it like by the launch
date by when the game was released in PC

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700
date by when the game was released in PC
 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.940
date by when the game was released in PC
in the case of runescape or maybe it's

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950
in the case of runescape or maybe it's
 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.630
in the case of runescape or maybe it's
just one year five years or two years so

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640
just one year five years or two years so
 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.220
just one year five years or two years so
this is two things that we need to have

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
this is two things that we need to have
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.990
this is two things that we need to have
in mind and then we were trying to

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000
in mind and then we were trying to
 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.880
in mind and then we were trying to
figure out how these games are

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890
figure out how these games are
 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.430
figure out how these games are
performing nowadays in play and we had

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440
performing nowadays in play and we had
 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.440
performing nowadays in play and we had
to take two assumptions which are very

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450
to take two assumptions which are very
 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.990
to take two assumptions which are very
peak assumptions in the first case was

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000
peak assumptions in the first case was
 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.360
peak assumptions in the first case was
when the game was published and so we

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370
when the game was published and so we
 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.650
when the game was published and so we
are going to look at games that they

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660
are going to look at games that they
 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.839
are going to look at games that they
were published four years or older and

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849
were published four years or older and
 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.539
were published four years or older and
then also if this game represents a top

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549
then also if this game represents a top
 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.520
then also if this game represents a top
priority for the company if the games is

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530
priority for the company if the games is
 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.410
priority for the company if the games is
driving most of the revenues then in

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420
driving most of the revenues then in
 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.000
driving most of the revenues then in
this case we would consider an outlier

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010
this case we would consider an outlier
 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.800
this case we would consider an outlier
so we're making the assumption of like

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810
so we're making the assumption of like
 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.870
so we're making the assumption of like
less than fifty percent of the overall

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880
less than fifty percent of the overall
 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.479
less than fifty percent of the overall
portfolio of the developer so if we look

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489
portfolio of the developer so if we look
 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.789
portfolio of the developer so if we look
at these and we take this into into

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799
at these and we take this into into
 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.039
at these and we take this into into
account and we look at the top games by

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049
account and we look at the top games by
 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.840
account and we look at the top games by
revenue and downloads in the Play Store

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850
revenue and downloads in the Play Store
 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.319
revenue and downloads in the Play Store
we will see that in fact all games are

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329
we will see that in fact all games are
 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.870
we will see that in fact all games are
very much alive and kicking and what it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880
very much alive and kicking and what it
 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.690
very much alive and kicking and what it
means is that so first of all all games

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700
means is that so first of all all games
 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.360
means is that so first of all all games
these games with this four years old and

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370
these games with this four years old and
 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.099
these games with this four years old and
as well less than 50% they represent 17%

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109
as well less than 50% they represent 17%
 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.590
as well less than 50% they represent 17%
of those top revenue games in the Play

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600
of those top revenue games in the Play
 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.620
of those top revenue games in the Play
Store and as well they receive new users

titles from an engagement perspective
 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.660
titles from an engagement perspective
it's something similar we see that these

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670
it's something similar we see that these
 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.789
it's something similar we see that these
old games they seem to have very engaged

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799
old games they seem to have very engaged
 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.920

on the other hand the design of the

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190
on the other hand the design of the
 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.550
on the other hand the design of the
games is seems to be short shorter terms

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560
games is seems to be short shorter terms
 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.800
games is seems to be short shorter terms
so shorter times and we see that on

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810
so shorter times and we see that on
 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:28.280

everything all in this life it tends to
have some issues and we see that also

of a significant revenue although might

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430
of a significant revenue although might
 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.910
of a significant revenue although might
be slightly lower and they have some

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920
be slightly lower and they have some

example vitals and crash rates and ANR's

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320
example vitals and crash rates and ANR's
 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.620
example vitals and crash rates and ANR's
and the question here is is these a

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630
and the question here is is these a
 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.080
and the question here is is these a
burden do we consider these games as

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090
burden do we consider these games as
 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.330
burden do we consider these games as
technology debt or do we consider an

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340
technology debt or do we consider an
 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.700
technology debt or do we consider an
opportunity and so there is two very

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710
opportunity and so there is two very
 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.450
opportunity and so there is two very
clear ways but there is three routes so

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460
clear ways but there is three routes so
 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:33.770
clear ways but there is three routes so
there's three common ways that

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780
there's three common ways that
 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.140
there's three common ways that
developers are following so if you go to

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150
developers are following so if you go to
 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.870
developers are following so if you go to
the the the very much I can see that

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880
the the the very much I can see that
 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.810
the the the very much I can see that
this is a burden the ultimate case is to

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820
this is a burden the ultimate case is to
 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.670
this is a burden the ultimate case is to
unpublish the game and this is the case

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680
unpublish the game and this is the case
 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.200
unpublish the game and this is the case
that we will hear from dirty bit later

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210
that we will hear from dirty bit later
 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.390
that we will hear from dirty bit later
on if you go on the other hand I can see

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400
on if you go on the other hand I can see
 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.490
on if you go on the other hand I can see
that this is my biggest opportunity then

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500
that this is my biggest opportunity then
 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.040
that this is my biggest opportunity then
why not I put more resources into this

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050
why not I put more resources into this
 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.320
why not I put more resources into this
game and try to revamp it and become

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330
game and try to revamp it and become

sauna party by one of our employees so
he was having some beers with his

00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:47.659
he was having some beers with his
 

00:19:47.659 --> 00:19:50.169
he was having some beers with his
friends and and they came up with this

00:19:50.169 --> 00:19:50.179
friends and and they came up with this
 

00:19:50.179 --> 00:19:52.029
friends and and they came up with this
idea that hey what would it look like if

00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039
idea that hey what would it look like if
 

00:19:52.039 --> 00:19:54.970
idea that hey what would it look like if
a tank would be battling a lorry truck

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:54.980
a tank would be battling a lorry truck
 

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.220
a tank would be battling a lorry truck
and let's put a garbage truck there and

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:57.230
and let's put a garbage truck there and
 

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.980
and let's put a garbage truck there and
against the go-kart or something like

00:19:59.980 --> 00:19:59.990
against the go-kart or something like
 

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:02.680
against the go-kart or something like
that so even today the game looks pretty

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:02.690
that so even today the game looks pretty
 

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.840
that so even today the game looks pretty
the same and the core gameplay of course

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:04.850
the same and the core gameplay of course
 

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.520
the same and the core gameplay of course
we brought a lot of other stuff to it so

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:09.530
we brought a lot of other stuff to it so
 

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:12.100
we brought a lot of other stuff to it so
that the first game went live in 2015

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:12.110
that the first game went live in 2015
 

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.700
that the first game went live in 2015
and in 2016 we decided that let's have a

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:15.710
and in 2016 we decided that let's have a
 

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.820
and in 2016 we decided that let's have a
portfolio strategy business logic there

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:18.830
portfolio strategy business logic there
 

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.730
portfolio strategy business logic there
is that we'll do a cross-promotion we're

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:21.740
is that we'll do a cross-promotion we're
 

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.440
is that we'll do a cross-promotion we're
gonna get the higher number of daily

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:23.450
gonna get the higher number of daily
 

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:25.060
gonna get the higher number of daily
active users and then we're gonna make

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:25.070
active users and then we're gonna make
 

00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:29.380
active users and then we're gonna make
more money and and then also we had

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:29.390
more money and and then also we had
 

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:32.200
more money and and then also we had
realized that when we made the first

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:32.210
realized that when we made the first
 

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:35.080
realized that when we made the first
game maybe we weren't so experienced or

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.090
game maybe we weren't so experienced or
 

00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:37.480
game maybe we weren't so experienced or
we made some mistake so you know instead

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:37.490
we made some mistake so you know instead
 

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:39.670
we made some mistake so you know instead
of going through the trouble of updating

00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:39.680
of going through the trouble of updating
 

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.110
of going through the trouble of updating
in the first game let's just fix

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120
in the first game let's just fix
 

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.540
in the first game let's just fix
everything that we did wrong at one go

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:43.550
everything that we did wrong at one go
 

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:48.160
everything that we did wrong at one go
and we were quite experimental with it

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.170
and we were quite experimental with it
 

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.110
and we were quite experimental with it
so we decided that instead of just

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120
so we decided that instead of just
 

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.750
so we decided that instead of just
making the first this is the second game

00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760
making the first this is the second game
 

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.390
making the first this is the second game
let's experiment a little bit so we had

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400
let's experiment a little bit so we had
 

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.270
let's experiment a little bit so we had
an idea for drive ahead sports so you

00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280
an idea for drive ahead sports so you
 

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.010
an idea for drive ahead sports so you
can play soccer and other sports with

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:00.020
can play soccer and other sports with
 

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.920
can play soccer and other sports with
cars so we made it first an event in the

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:02.930
cars so we made it first an event in the
 

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.890
cars so we made it first an event in the
original game and when we told fans that

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:05.900
original game and when we told fans that
 

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.950
original game and when we told fans that
summer is over soccer is going away

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960
summer is over soccer is going away
 

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.840
summer is over soccer is going away
then they started begging us to bring it

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:10.850
then they started begging us to bring it
 

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.180
then they started begging us to bring it
back and we said well you can play it

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:13.190
back and we said well you can play it
 

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:15.370
back and we said well you can play it
but it's going to be it's a standalone

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:15.380
but it's going to be it's a standalone
 

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.850
but it's going to be it's a standalone
game and in 2016 actually actually it

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:18.860
game and in 2016 actually actually it
 

00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.460
game and in 2016 actually actually it
had significant contribution to the

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:21.470
had significant contribution to the
 

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:27.660
had significant contribution to the
studio revenue in 2017 we realized that

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:27.670
studio revenue in 2017 we realized that
 

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.570
studio revenue in 2017 we realized that
this portfolio approach isn't working

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:31.580
this portfolio approach isn't working
 

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:35.620
this portfolio approach isn't working
perfectly for us so drive head sports

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:35.630
perfectly for us so drive head sports
 

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:38.440
perfectly for us so drive head sports
turned out to be even more skilled game

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:38.450
turned out to be even more skilled game
 

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:42.180
turned out to be even more skilled game
than the original game so it's it's

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:42.190
than the original game so it's it's
 

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:46.150
than the original game so it's it's
reaching a more niche audience we were

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:46.160
reaching a more niche audience we were
 

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.270
reaching a more niche audience we were
able to be better in the free-to-play

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280
able to be better in the free-to-play
 

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.610
able to be better in the free-to-play
design of the game so for example our

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:51.620
design of the game so for example our
 

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:55.480
design of the game so for example our
Tao is 2.5 times higher but that doesn't

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:55.490
Tao is 2.5 times higher but that doesn't
 

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:56.830
Tao is 2.5 times higher but that doesn't
really help when you're reaching only

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840
really help when you're reaching only
 

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.410
really help when you're reaching only
20% of the players from the original

00:21:59.410 --> 00:21:59.420
20% of the players from the original
 

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:03.100
20% of the players from the original
title and the really ugly thing we did

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:03.110
title and the really ugly thing we did
 

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:06.280
title and the really ugly thing we did
in 2017 was that we tried to fix

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:06.290
in 2017 was that we tried to fix
 

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.970
in 2017 was that we tried to fix
everything once again at the one go so

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:09.980
everything once again at the one go so
 

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.280
everything once again at the one go so
we made a major change where you know

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:12.290
we made a major change where you know
 

00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:15.340
we made a major change where you know
change the UI UX added a saga map and

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:15.350
change the UI UX added a saga map and
 

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:18.220
change the UI UX added a saga map and
tons of other thing and everybody hated

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:18.230
tons of other thing and everybody hated
 

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:20.950
tons of other thing and everybody hated
it so we lost half of the players and

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960
it so we lost half of the players and
 

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.560
it so we lost half of the players and
revenue and returns and was was almost

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:23.570
revenue and returns and was was almost
 

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.720
revenue and returns and was was almost
destroyed and nearly killed the game and

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:25.730
destroyed and nearly killed the game and
 

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:30.610
destroyed and nearly killed the game and
then we also went all-in with AR so we

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:30.620
then we also went all-in with AR so we
 

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:32.560
then we also went all-in with AR so we
made a game called drive ahead mini golf

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:32.570
made a game called drive ahead mini golf
 

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.590
made a game called drive ahead mini golf
so if we have car gladiators this is

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600
so if we have car gladiators this is
 

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:37.500
so if we have car gladiators this is
what they do in their free time and

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:37.510
what they do in their free time and
 

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.910
what they do in their free time and
turned out that we were there a little

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:39.920
turned out that we were there a little
 

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:42.280
turned out that we were there a little
bit too early and we're doing fancy

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:42.290
bit too early and we're doing fancy
 

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:45.400
bit too early and we're doing fancy
motion controls with the device people

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:45.410
motion controls with the device people
 

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.280
motion controls with the device people
were playing mini golf like this and it

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:48.290
were playing mini golf like this and it
 

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:50.740
were playing mini golf like this and it
didn't work out either so we discovered

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:50.750
didn't work out either so we discovered
 

00:22:50.750 --> 00:22:53.410
didn't work out either so we discovered
that you know this is a bit risky as an

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:53.420
that you know this is a bit risky as an
 

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:57.040
that you know this is a bit risky as an
approach so the decision was that let's

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.050
approach so the decision was that let's
 

00:22:57.050 --> 00:22:59.530
approach so the decision was that let's
focus on the original title is getting

00:22:59.530 --> 00:22:59.540
focus on the original title is getting
 

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.160
focus on the original title is getting
that 100,000 new players a day good

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:03.170
that 100,000 new players a day good
 

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:04.930
that 100,000 new players a day good
things are that there's high engagement

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:04.940
things are that there's high engagement
 

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.290
things are that there's high engagement
and virality through the community we

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:08.300
and virality through the community we
 

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.340
and virality through the community we
realized that you know we're only we've

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:12.350
realized that you know we're only we've
 

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.440
realized that you know we're only we've
only scratched the service surface with

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:14.450
only scratched the service surface with
 

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.110
only scratched the service surface with
monetization potential there so that's a

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120
monetization potential there so that's a
 

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.330
monetization potential there so that's a
picture of our team there with our head

00:23:19.330 --> 00:23:19.340
picture of our team there with our head
 

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.520
picture of our team there with our head
of studio talking to them and this is

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:21.530
of studio talking to them and this is
 

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.430
of studio talking to them and this is
the group that was given the task to to

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440
the group that was given the task to to
 

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:27.820
the group that was given the task to to
revamp the game we our approach was the

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:27.830
revamp the game we our approach was the
 

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.670
revamp the game we our approach was the
following we realized that it's too much

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:30.680
following we realized that it's too much
 

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.760
following we realized that it's too much
risk changing things in the game like

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:33.770
risk changing things in the game like
 

00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.920
risk changing things in the game like
making two big changes but we had

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:35.930
making two big changes but we had
 

00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:38.320
making two big changes but we had
started doing live ops which is a really

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:38.330
started doing live ops which is a really
 

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.210
started doing live ops which is a really
great place to change the rules of the

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:40.220
great place to change the rules of the
 

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:44.980
great place to change the rules of the
game and and we see what works there and

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:44.990
game and and we see what works there and
 

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.600
game and and we see what works there and
then bring it into the actual game and

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:48.610
then bring it into the actual game and
 

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:51.430
then bring it into the actual game and
so what happened next was that we

00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440
so what happened next was that we
 

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.620
so what happened next was that we
started doing these iterations so first

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:53.630
started doing these iterations so first
 

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.800
started doing these iterations so first
we redid the first time user experience

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:56.810
we redid the first time user experience
 

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.280
we redid the first time user experience
