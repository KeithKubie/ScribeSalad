00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.580
In the fragment detailed layout, 
a text view is already defined.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.430
We have to assign it an ID
so that within the detail fragment

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.150
of detail activity we can use 
view by ID to find the text view.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.330
To determine the forecast info
that the text view should display,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.190
we can access the intent 
that the detail activity was launched by.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.294
We're going to use 
this inside of onCreateView.

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:27.708
(clicking, pressing key)

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:31.683
Since we added an intent extra 
with the forecast data there,

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:35.141
we can read that intent extra 
back to display in the text view.

00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:38.249
As you can see, we pulled
the forecast string

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:42.620
from the intent, find our rootView,
and then set the text

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.050
to that forecast string.
