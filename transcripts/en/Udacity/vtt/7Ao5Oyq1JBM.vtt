00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The answer is 0.00002,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the reason for that is the sum of all the probabilities of all the events

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
in the probability space must be 1.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're certain that we get 1 of these events everytime we draw from the probability space.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'm not going to try flipping the coin enough times to see if I can actually make it

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
land on its edge.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The actual probability of landing on the edge is probably much lower than that.
