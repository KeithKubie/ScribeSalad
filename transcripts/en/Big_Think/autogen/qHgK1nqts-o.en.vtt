00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.200
well a number of years ago I published

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210
well a number of years ago I published
 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.180
well a number of years ago I published
this very big book called a new kind of

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:07.190
this very big book called a new kind of
 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.510
this very big book called a new kind of
science so what is this book about well

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520
science so what is this book about well
 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.359
science so what is this book about well
it's it's really about a new direction a

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369
it's it's really about a new direction a
 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.250
it's it's really about a new direction a
new kind of science as the book title

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260
new kind of science as the book title
 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.440
new kind of science as the book title
says and the the premise of the book is

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450
says and the the premise of the book is
 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.820
says and the the premise of the book is
if we look back at sort of the history

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830
if we look back at sort of the history
 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.250
if we look back at sort of the history
of science about 300 years ago there was

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260
of science about 300 years ago there was
 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.010
of science about 300 years ago there was
the sort of big idea which was we can

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020
the sort of big idea which was we can
 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.210
the sort of big idea which was we can
take these things that we see in the

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220
take these things that we see in the
 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.490
take these things that we see in the
natural world and we can start to

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500
natural world and we can start to
 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.409
natural world and we can start to
describe them not just in terms of sort

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419
describe them not just in terms of sort
 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.600
describe them not just in terms of sort
of philosophy and logic but by using

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610
of philosophy and logic but by using
 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.550
of philosophy and logic but by using
mathematics we have this kind of

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560
mathematics we have this kind of
 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.830
mathematics we have this kind of
language and methodology for thinking

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840
language and methodology for thinking
 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.930
language and methodology for thinking
about nature which is mathematics and

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940
about nature which is mathematics and
 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.580
about nature which is mathematics and
mathematical equations and so on and

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590
mathematical equations and so on and
 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.380
mathematical equations and so on and
that's been a very successful idea

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390
that's been a very successful idea
 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.889
that's been a very successful idea
that's led to sort of physics a lot of

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899
that's led to sort of physics a lot of
 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.229
that's led to sort of physics a lot of
modern physics and sort of spread out

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239
modern physics and sort of spread out
 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.660
modern physics and sort of spread out
into a bunch of different areas of the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670
into a bunch of different areas of the
 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.380
into a bunch of different areas of the
exact sciences so maybe 25 years ago now

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390
exact sciences so maybe 25 years ago now
 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.810
exact sciences so maybe 25 years ago now
I got very involved more than that 30

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820
I got very involved more than that 30
 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.240
I got very involved more than that 30
years ago now I got very involved in

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250
years ago now I got very involved in
 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.729
years ago now I got very involved in
kind of thinking about is that really

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739
kind of thinking about is that really
 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.889
kind of thinking about is that really
enough is the sort of mathematical

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899
enough is the sort of mathematical
 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.260
enough is the sort of mathematical
paradigm that we've developed enough to

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270
paradigm that we've developed enough to
 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.879
paradigm that we've developed enough to
explain all the things that were

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:09.889
explain all the things that were
 

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:13.209
explain all the things that were
interested in the natural world and what

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219
interested in the natural world and what
 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.039
interested in the natural world and what
I realized is that if we're going to be

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049
I realized is that if we're going to be
 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.779
I realized is that if we're going to be
able to have a theory about what happens

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789
able to have a theory about what happens
 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.819
able to have a theory about what happens
in for example nature there has to

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829
in for example nature there has to
 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:20.739
in for example nature there has to
ultimately be some rule by which nature

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749
ultimately be some rule by which nature
 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:23.379
ultimately be some rule by which nature
operates but the issue is does that rule

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:23.389
operates but the issue is does that rule
 

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:25.749
operates but the issue is does that rule
have to correspond to something like a

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759
have to correspond to something like a
 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.429
have to correspond to something like a
mathematical equation something that we

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439
mathematical equation something that we
 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.499
mathematical equation something that we
have sort of created in our human

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509
have sort of created in our human
 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.449
have sort of created in our human
mathematics or is there some more

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:31.459
mathematics or is there some more
 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:33.489
mathematics or is there some more
general sort of source of possible rules

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:33.499
general sort of source of possible rules
 

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.800
general sort of source of possible rules
by which nature can operate and what I

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810
by which nature can operate and what I
 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.539
by which nature can operate and what I
realized is that now with our

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549
realized is that now with our
 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.669
realized is that now with our
understanding of computation computer

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679
understanding of computation computer
 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.230
understanding of computation computer
programs and so on there's actually a

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240
programs and so on there's actually a
 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.089
programs and so on there's actually a
much bigger universe of possible rules

00:01:43.089 --> 00:01:43.099
much bigger universe of possible rules
 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:44.949
much bigger universe of possible rules
to describe the natural world than just

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959
to describe the natural world than just
 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.539
to describe the natural world than just
these mathematical equation kinds of

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549
these mathematical equation kinds of
 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.580
these mathematical equation kinds of
things and we can think about them in

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590
things and we can think about them in
 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.109
things and we can think about them in
terms of computer programs we can say

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119
terms of computer programs we can say
 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.469
terms of computer programs we can say
just imagine that nature was described

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479
just imagine that nature was described
 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.089
just imagine that nature was described
by rules that correspond to computer

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099
by rules that correspond to computer
 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.919
by rules that correspond to computer
programs what what are the possibilities

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929
programs what what are the possibilities
 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.260
programs what what are the possibilities
for those rules they're normally when we

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270
for those rules they're normally when we
 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.969
for those rules they're normally when we
set up computer programs we build

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979
set up computer programs we build
 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.649
set up computer programs we build
programs for very particular purposes

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659
programs for very particular purposes
 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.839
programs for very particular purposes
you know we've we're constructing a

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849
you know we've we're constructing a
 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.940
you know we've we're constructing a
program to perform a particular task we

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950
program to perform a particular task we
 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.949
program to perform a particular task we
write this big complicated program with

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959
write this big complicated program with
 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.630
write this big complicated program with
thousands maybe millions of lines of

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640
thousands maybe millions of lines of
 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.660
thousands maybe millions of lines of
code to perform a particular task but

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670
code to perform a particular task but
 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.060
code to perform a particular task but
there's kind of a basic science question

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070
there's kind of a basic science question
 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.630
there's kind of a basic science question
which is

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640
which is
 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.580
which is
if we just look at the possible programs

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590
if we just look at the possible programs
 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.320
if we just look at the possible programs
that we could construct just imagine

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330
that we could construct just imagine
 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.840
that we could construct just imagine
that we start off and we let's say pick

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850
that we start off and we let's say pick
 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.150
that we start off and we let's say pick
at random a few little instructions to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160
at random a few little instructions to
 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.550
at random a few little instructions to
put into our program what do all these

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560
put into our program what do all these
 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.230
put into our program what do all these
possible programs what do they do what

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240
possible programs what do they do what
 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.850
possible programs what do they do what
does this sort of computational universe

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860
does this sort of computational universe
 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.100
does this sort of computational universe
of possible programs look like so I

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110
of possible programs look like so I
 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.660
of possible programs look like so I
started exploring this many years ago

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670
started exploring this many years ago
 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.910
started exploring this many years ago
and the thing that I discovered was

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920
and the thing that I discovered was
 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.350
and the thing that I discovered was
something that really surprised me a lot

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360
something that really surprised me a lot
 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.030
something that really surprised me a lot
when you look at this sort of

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040
when you look at this sort of
 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.440
when you look at this sort of
computational universe of possible

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450
computational universe of possible
 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.050
computational universe of possible
programs what you find is that even very

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060
programs what you find is that even very
 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.670
programs what you find is that even very
very simple programs sometimes they're

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680
very simple programs sometimes they're
 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.900
very simple programs sometimes they're
very simple programs do very simple

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910
very simple programs do very simple
 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.790
very simple programs do very simple
things but there are very simple

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800
things but there are very simple
 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.650
things but there are very simple
programs that do immensely complicated

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660
programs that do immensely complicated
 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.290
programs that do immensely complicated
kinds of things it's a big surprise from

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300
kinds of things it's a big surprise from
 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.610
kinds of things it's a big surprise from
our usual sort of intuition of

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620
our usual sort of intuition of
 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.320
our usual sort of intuition of
engineering because usually when we

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330
engineering because usually when we
 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.180
engineering because usually when we
think about making something complicated

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190
think about making something complicated
 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.650
think about making something complicated
and engineering we think we have to go

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660
and engineering we think we have to go
 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.180
and engineering we think we have to go
to a lot of effort to do that we have to

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190
to a lot of effort to do that we have to
 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.610
to a lot of effort to do that we have to
sort of set up complicated rules go to

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620
sort of set up complicated rules go to
 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.430
sort of set up complicated rules go to
lots of put in all these different steps

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440
lots of put in all these different steps
 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.710
lots of put in all these different steps
and so on to build our our complicated

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720
and so on to build our our complicated
 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.229
and so on to build our our complicated
thing but what one discovers is in this

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239
thing but what one discovers is in this
 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.699
thing but what one discovers is in this
computational universe of possible

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709
computational universe of possible
 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.250
computational universe of possible
programs it's really easy to find simple

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260
programs it's really easy to find simple
 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.930
programs it's really easy to find simple
programs that kind of effortlessly

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940
programs that kind of effortlessly
 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.000
programs that kind of effortlessly
produce immense complexity in their

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010
behavior so I first noticed my favorite
 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.350

30 cellular automaton in 1984 and this

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140
30 cellular automaton in 1984 and this
 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.410
30 cellular automaton in 1984 and this
kind of for me was sort of the a

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420
kind of for me was sort of the a
 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.319
kind of for me was sort of the a
critical moment in in my development of

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329
critical moment in in my development of
 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.750
critical moment in in my development of
my sort of scientific thinking I kind of

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760
my sort of scientific thinking I kind of
 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.370
my sort of scientific thinking I kind of
view it a little bit like I sort of had

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380
view it a little bit like I sort of had
 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.250

time able to sort of see what was out

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530
time able to sort of see what was out
 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.930

there in this computational universe a

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940
there in this computational universe a
 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.759
there in this computational universe a
little bit like what you know what

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769
little bit like what you know what

Galileo got to do 400 years ago when he

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230
Galileo got to do 400 years ago when he
 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.810
Galileo got to do 400 years ago when he
took a telescope and pointed at the sky

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820
took a telescope and pointed at the sky
 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.120
took a telescope and pointed at the sky
and it was pretty easy to see that there

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130
and it was pretty easy to see that there
 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.710
and it was pretty easy to see that there
were mountains on the moon and then you

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720
were mountains on the moon and then you
 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.120
were mountains on the moon and then you
know moons of Jupiter and things like

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130
know moons of Jupiter and things like
 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.789
know moons of Jupiter and things like
that so sort of pointing a computer out

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799
that so sort of pointing a computer out
 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.830

into this computational universe it was

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840
into this computational universe it was
 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.870
into this computational universe it was
in a sense pretty easy to see that there

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880
in a sense pretty easy to see that there
 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.190
in a sense pretty easy to see that there
were these very simple programs that

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200
were these very simple programs that
 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.430
were these very simple programs that
these immensely complex things and so I

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440
these immensely complex things and so I
 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.220
these immensely complex things and so I
then sort of got to explore so what does

this mean what what what is this what
happens when you sort of look at this

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100
happens when you sort of look at this
 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.680
happens when you sort of look at this
new paradigm that's created from

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690
new paradigm that's created from
 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.630
new paradigm that's created from
realizing that in this computational

use it to understand sort of things
 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.129
use it to understand sort of things
about the foundations of mathematics

lots of different applications in the

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490
lots of different applications in the
 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.029
lots of different applications in the
Natural Sciences but then one could sort

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039
Natural Sciences but then one could sort
 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:38.559
Natural Sciences but then one could sort
of say well what else can one do given

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:38.569
of say well what else can one do given
 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.110
of say well what else can one do given
the sort of paradigm of finding these

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120
the sort of paradigm of finding these
 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.580
the sort of paradigm of finding these
simple programs in the computational

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590
simple programs in the computational
 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.409
simple programs in the computational
universe that do such such sophisticated

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419
universe that do such such sophisticated
 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.990
universe that do such such sophisticated
things and one of the directions of

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000
things and one of the directions of
 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.390
things and one of the directions of
applications and technology see in a

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400
applications and technology see in a
 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.399
applications and technology see in a
sense what is technology technology is

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409
sense what is technology technology is
 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:53.620
sense what is technology technology is
in a sense finding things that exist in

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630
in a sense finding things that exist in
 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.469
in a sense finding things that exist in
the world and applying them somehow for

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479
the world and applying them somehow for
 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.480
the world and applying them somehow for
human purposes to achieve some human

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490
human purposes to achieve some human
 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.939
human purposes to achieve some human
objective and so we do that with you

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949
objective and so we do that with you
 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.409
objective and so we do that with you
know materials that we find in the

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419
know materials that we find in the
 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:03.459
know materials that we find in the
natural world whether it's you know

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469
natural world whether it's you know
 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.920

magnets or liquid crystals or whatever

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930
magnets or liquid crystals or whatever
 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.990
magnets or liquid crystals or whatever
else we find these materials and then we

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000
else we find these materials and then we
 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.120
else we find these materials and then we
realize how to apply them to create

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130
realize how to apply them to create
 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.430
realize how to apply them to create
things that are useful to us as humans

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440
things that are useful to us as humans
 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.279
things that are useful to us as humans
so what one realizes is that in this

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289
so what one realizes is that in this
 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:16.779
so what one realizes is that in this
computational universe it's kind of the

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789
computational universe it's kind of the
 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.790
computational universe it's kind of the
same story out in the computational

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800
same story out in the computational
 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.110
same story out in the computational
universe there are all these programs

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120
universe there are all these programs
 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.580
universe there are all these programs
that effectively perform algorithms that

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590
that effectively perform algorithms that
 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.700
that effectively perform algorithms that
are rich and complex and then the

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710
are rich and complex and then the
 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.140
are rich and complex and then the
question is are they useful for human

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150
question is are they useful for human
 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.879
question is are they useful for human
purposes so one of the things that's

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889
purposes so one of the things that's
 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.649
purposes so one of the things that's
happened over the last decade or so is

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:32.659
happened over the last decade or so is
 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.409
happened over the last decade or so is
that increasingly we've been able to

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419
that increasingly we've been able to
 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.600
that increasingly we've been able to
make use of these kinds of programs of

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610
make use of these kinds of programs of
 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.610
