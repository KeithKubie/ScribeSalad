teams research shows that if you ask a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790
teams research shows that if you ask a
 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.240
teams research shows that if you ask a
team who's doing what they will come up

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250
team who's doing what they will come up
 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.010

with far more than a hundred percent

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020
with far more than a hundred percent
 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.110

because everybody sees what they are

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120
because everybody sees what they are
 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.479
because everybody sees what they are
doing but they're not as aware of what

doing but they're not as aware of what
 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.010
doing but they're not as aware of what
other people are doing so that makes

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020
other people are doing so that makes
 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.069
other people are doing so that makes
sense also people tend to do the things

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079
sense also people tend to do the things

that they value more that they think are
 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.969
that they value more that they think are
more important so they think their

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979
more important so they think their
 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.669
more important so they think their
contribution is very significant but to

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679
contribution is very significant but to
 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:10.410
contribution is very significant but to
other people well they might think

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420
other people well they might think
 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.239
other people well they might think
something else is more important so for

00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:12.249

air conditioning repair he thinks that's
really important so if we're both

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090
really important so if we're both
 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.910
really important so if we're both

kind of our team as a household we come
up with more than a hundred percent so

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209
up with more than a hundred percent so
 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.090
