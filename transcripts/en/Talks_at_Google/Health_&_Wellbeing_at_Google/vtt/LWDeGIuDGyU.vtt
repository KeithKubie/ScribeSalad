SANDRO GALEA: Well,
thank you very much.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.510
Thank you, everybody
for being here,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.090
and thank you for joining both
in person and on the sites

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.240
all over the world.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.692
So let me just talk a
little bit about myself

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:20.650
by way of introduction.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.560
Then I'll talk about the book.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.070
I'm a physician by training.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.550
And then I did academic public
health training as well as

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.360
Chris mentioned.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.200
And it was-- sometimes
I'm asked how long it

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.098
took me to write this book,
and the answer is 20 years.

00:00:35.098 --> 00:00:37.140
It didn't actually take
20 years to write a book.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.182
It took about six months.

00:00:38.182 --> 00:00:41.140
But it builds on about 20
years worth of thoughts

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.700
and experience in the field.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.110
And really, the earliest
motivation for this book

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.630
came from when I was
working in Somalia,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.010
which Chris
mentioned I was doing

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.360
with Doctors Without Borders.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.430
And I was very much doing
sort of hands-on clinical work

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.400
day to day and helping
people and helping people

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.220
and helping people.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.110
And while I was
there, I couldn't

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.132
help but feel like I was the
proverbial guy on the side

00:01:07.132 --> 00:01:09.090
of the river, pulling
somebody out of the river

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.490
as she's drowning, and then
jumping in and pulling out

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.720
somebody else because
he's drowning,

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.390
then jumping and pulling
somebody else out of the river

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.280
because she's drowning, but
never stopping for a second

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.490
and saying, who is throwing
them in the river to begin with?

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.480
And recognizing that, I think I
started my path down this road

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.540
over the past 20 years trying
to better understand what

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.460
is it that really causes health.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.190
How is it that I can go
upstream and understand

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.950
what drives health so that we
can keep people healthy for as

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.310
long as possible?

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.250
And what this book
tries to do is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.040
it tries to say
what causes health

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.410
and how do we change the
conversation on health

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.930
so that we can actually
create a healthier world?

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.190
Because at the end of today--

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.232
I talk to audiences all
the time, blue audiences,

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:52.260
red audiences, purple
audiences, and it's very clear

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.180
that we all care about health.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.280
We may disagree on any number of
values, but all over the world,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.240
everybody would like to
be healthy as possible,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.080
would like their children to
be as healthy as possible,

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.913
and would like to see
their children grow up

00:02:02.913 --> 00:02:05.152
and get married and them
being healthy as possible.

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:06.360
So the book is called "Well--

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.610
What We Need to Talk About
When We Talk About Health,"

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.440
because I've become convinced
that at the end of the day,

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.260
we need a different
conversation on health,

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.930
and we need to talk about
health differently in such a way

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.030
that it changes how
we approach health.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.690
I'm going to show you a couple
of data slides that frames

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.470
the issue starting from the
point of why our health is not

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.470
as good as it should be.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.100
Now I'm going to make this
a US-centric presentation,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.730
the first part of
it, just because I'm

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.730
focusing on US data, but
I'm happy to talk about

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.430
in the global
context afterwards.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.910
But let me then move on to this
first question, which is really

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.260
what is wrong with our health.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.760
Like if I'm here
telling you that we

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.440
need to talk about our
health differently,

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.080
it's reasonable to ask me, well,
there must be something wrong

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.538
with our health,
otherwise, the way

00:02:47.538 --> 00:02:49.750
we're talking about our
health is just fine.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.960
So let me show you
one simple slide that

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.220
captures that, which is this.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.880
So this is death from
non-communicable diseases,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.165
which is things like
cancer and heart disease.

00:02:59.165 --> 00:03:00.540
And what you see
here is a number

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.582
of high income countries.

00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:04.500
You have Japan, Spain, Italy,
Norway, Sweden, and the United

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.250
States is in red.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.023
Now this is one
slide, one data slide.

00:03:08.023 --> 00:03:08.940
But I could show you--

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.890
I could spend the
next half an hour

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.170
showing you data slide
after data slide that

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.060
makes this exact same
point, essentially

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.552
that health indicators
in the United States

00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:21.010
are worse than they are in all
other high income countries.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.800
It's consistent on
life expectancy,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.600
consistent on mortality
rate, and it's

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.990
consistent across
all age groups,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.790
just to make that point.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.730
So what this graph is is looking
at age groups on the x-axis.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.460
So you see, you go
from left to right,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.168
you're starting with
newborns and infants

00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:40.750
and children, young
adolescents, older adolescents,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.390
young adults, older adults.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.990
And you see two
things on this graph.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.390
So first of all, you
see a U-shaped curve.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.340
And this is mortality.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.470
So the U-shaped
curve makes sense,

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.890
because the healthiest years
of life are young adulthood.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.390
So late adolescence,
young adulthood

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.650
is when people die the least.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.800
So that makes sense.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.730
But then I want you to look at
the blue bar and the red bar.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.000
The blue bar is our
mortality in the US,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.770
and the red bar is all
other high income countries.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.380
And what you see is
that the blue bar

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.790
is higher than the red
bar at every age group.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.860
So in the US context, we
are consistent in that we

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.120
kill more newborns, infants,
children, young children,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.700
early adolescents, late
adolescents, young adults,

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.540
middle age adults
at every age group.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.320
So in some respects, the US
is consistent that way in that

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.820
it has worse health than all
its peer countries consistently.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.570
Now, I find that well-informed,
educated audiences

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.810
tend to know this, that
there is a bit of a sense

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.910
that American health is not
all it's cracked up to be.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.260
And in audiences like this one,
which is a worldwide audiences,

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.252
you typically tend to
have a sense of well,

00:04:45.252 --> 00:04:46.710
we understand that
this is actually

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.530
becoming a challenge in
all high income countries.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.520
And this is a problem.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.230
And we tend to approach this
problem a bit of a shrug,

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.940
I find.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.810
Like we're just not
so good at health.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.170
But I think that
approach is incorrect.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.635
And we need to be
cognizant of something that

00:05:00.635 --> 00:05:02.010
is sort of quite
important, which

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.890
is it was not always
like this, that actually

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.790
this decrement in health is a
relatively recent phenomenon.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.890
So this is a graph going back
to past almost 40 years now

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.530
from 1980 on.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.870
And this is life expectancies.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.080
This is how long people
can expect to live.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.880
And what you see is
the red dot is the US,

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.100
and the gray dots are other
high income countries.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.300
So as recently as 1980,
which is 35 to 40 years ago,

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.240
the US life expectancy
was actually

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.620
in the top half of all
high income countries.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.710
And you see that over
the past 35 years,

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.090
it has drifted to the bottom.

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.660
So what we have come to accept
with a bit of a shrug, which

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.380
is that our health is worse than
other high income countries,

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.190
that our health is
not what it should be,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.340
wasn't always like that.

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.913
And in fact, it is
a set of conditions

00:05:52.913 --> 00:05:54.830
that we have created
that has brought it here,

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.440
because I would ask you this,
what has changed in the past 40

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.940
years?

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.820
Certainly, our genetics
have not changed.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.840
So it must be the rest of the
set of conditions around us

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.700
that ultimately
are driving what's

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.158
making our health worse than
it was as recently as 35,

00:06:08.158 --> 00:06:08.700
40 years ago.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.363
Now, to be optimistic, from a
glass half full point of view,

00:06:12.363 --> 00:06:14.280
if we've made our health
worse in the past 35,

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.340
40 years, we can
certainly make it better

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.800
if we understand what makes our
health worse and reverse it.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.750
As this has happened,
as the US life

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.150
expectancy has sort
of trundled along,

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.420
many countries have passed us.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.290
So this shows Japan and
Singapore and Chile and Costa

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.730
Rica have passed the
US in life expectancy.

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.940
It's, for example, not
well understood in the US

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.880
that Slovenian life expectancy
is higher than it is in the US.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:40.060
Not just that, life
expectancy in Slovenia

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.177
is actually higher than
the life expectancy

00:06:42.177 --> 00:06:44.510
of the state in the US with
the highest life expectancy,

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.790
which is, by the way, Hawaii.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.080
So Hawaii is the
place you want to be

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.247
if you want to live longest.

00:06:48.247 --> 00:06:51.550
I don't know if people are in
Hawaii watching this digitally.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.450
But even Hawaii
has life expectancy

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.200
that is less than Slovenia,
not to mention the states that

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.820
are down in the lower half.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.560
So we have, as a country,
created worse health

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.250
than all other countries.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.060
Now, you might say, well, maybe
we don't care about health.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.560
I started at the
beginning by saying

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.900
that health is a universal
value, that we care

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.490
about health, and it's
reasonable for you to say,

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.550
well, maybe we don't care
so much about health.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:16.270
Maybe it's OK.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.620
Maybe it's OK that American
health is doing worse,

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.470
and people are willing
to accept that.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:21.928
But I would argue
that the evidence

00:07:21.928 --> 00:07:23.810
suggests that's not true.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.530
We actually were not
willing to accept that,

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.770
because we are more and more
beginning to recognize this.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.510
This is our life expectancy
compared to other countries.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.170
And what you see is the
blue bar is when we were

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:36.520
gaining in life expectancy.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.140
You see that until
the late '80s.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.270
And the red bars are we've
been losing a life expectancy.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.340
So we were gaining, and now
we've been consistently losing.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.000
And you say, well,
OK, that's fine.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.500
That's fine.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.125
It's how it is.

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:50.020
And there are other things.

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.180
We have other priorities.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.430
But that's not what
the data suggests.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.720
This is the money that
we throw at the problem.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.100
So the green bar is
our spending on health.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.800
The other gray lines that are
very faint are other countries,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.070
and the blue line is the average
of other high income countries.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.910
So what you see
is we are spending

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.090
40% more on the next closest
competitor on health,

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.240
and the slope of change is
steeper than other countries.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.860
So right now, the US health
economy is $3.3 trillion.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.080
1 in 8 Americans
work in health, which

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.790
is a higher ratio than any
of these other countries.

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.520
So we are spending far more
money than all other countries,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.642
and we are getting
much less out of it.

00:08:32.642 --> 00:08:34.059
And sometimes the
challenge I pose

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:35.890
audiences, which I'll
pose to the audience

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:39.010
both here in person
and digitally,

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.980
name one other
sector where we spend

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.610
40% more than our next
closest competitor

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.282
and where our
indicators are worse.

00:08:48.282 --> 00:08:49.490
Let me ask you this question.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:54.640
Would any of you own a US made
smartphone if it cost 40% more

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.770
and it performed 40% less?

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:57.700
Well, you wouldn't.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.080
Would you own a car?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.210
Would you own a house?

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.700
Like, we actually would not
accept that kind of transaction

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.220
in anything else, but somehow,
we accept it on health.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.180
So the argument is we
shouldn't accept this.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:10.870
This is wrong.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:14.030
This is simply wrong, and
it should be unacceptable.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.300
And the reason it's
not unacceptable,

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.740
which is the
premise of the book,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.050
is that we have not
wrapped our brain

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.070
around thinking about
health properly,

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.800
that to make this
unacceptable, we

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.488
need to start thinking about
health in the right way.

00:09:28.488 --> 00:09:30.530
This is one last slide,
talking about the problem

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:33.120
and comparing the US to
other high income countries.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.270
And this slide is perhaps
my favorite slide.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.240
If you were to take anything
from this presentation,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.670
and you want to take one
slide and take it to a bar

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.128
when you're talking
to your friends

00:09:42.128 --> 00:09:44.160
to sort of start arguments,
it's this one slide.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.740
And there are two axes.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.490
On the x-axis, you
have life expectancy.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:48.990
I apologize.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:49.970
You have spending.

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.780
On the y-axis, you
have life expectancy.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.130
So what you see with all
the gray bars is that as we

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.800
spend more, you get more.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.580
You spend more, higher
life expectancy.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.770
All the other countries
follow that path.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.860
But look at the US.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.950
US falls off the curve,
because we spend more,

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.050
and we get less out of it.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.543
So I feel like this
one picture ultimately

00:10:08.543 --> 00:10:10.460
tells you what you need
to know is that we are

00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:13.190
spending more and getting less.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.380
And we're doing
that in a way that

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.080
is in contrast with everything
else, every other sector

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.900
in our economy, and
we seem to be doing it

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.430
in the sector of
our economy which

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.190
matters the most, at least from
a sheer volume point of view--

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.780
$3.3 trillion a year.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.590
1 in 8 Americans work in this
business that delivers less

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.330
and costs us more.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:36.950
So having said that and having
made the argument that we

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.470
should be talking about
health differently in order

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:41.840
to deal with this problem,
the thesis of the book

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.282
is what we need to talk about
when we talk about health.

00:10:44.282 --> 00:10:45.740
And the book has
20 chapters in it.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.470
They're all brief,
digestible chapters.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.970
And what I want to do here is
just talk about three of them.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.980
I'm just going to tell you
about three of the chapters

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.690
and three of the
things that we need

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.810
to talk about when we talk about
health that I think can remedy

00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:00.430
this sorry state of affairs.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.240
Number one.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.300
Number one is perhaps
the most important one,

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.870
which is we need to be
talking about health

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.820
and not talking
about health care.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:13.230
Now, I suspect it's
one of those statements

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.360
that I'm making that
everybody watching is

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.580
nodding and thinking to
themselves, yeah, OK, I get it.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.980
But before I even tell
you how to talk about it,

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.910
I'm going to pose a
challenge to you all.

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.410
Next time you have
a dinner party,

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.520
or you're at a bar with
friends, start a conversation

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.092
about health.

00:11:31.092 --> 00:11:32.300
You can do anything you want.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.467
You can say, I went to a
talk, and I heard something

00:11:34.467 --> 00:11:35.330
about health.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.270
And as you do that,
take out your watch,

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.030
so you can look at the time.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:41.250
And see how long
it takes anybody

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.760
in the conversation to
use the words health

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.210
care instead of health.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:49.380
And I promise you it will
take less than five minutes.

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.640
Always happens.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.010
Within five minutes,
somebody will say health care

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.660
when instead they mean health.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:57.720
And I'm giving
you that challenge

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.640
to illustrate how
much we conflate it,

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.070
how much we conflate
health and health care.

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:05.490
Now, let me explain why
this matters so much.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:06.480
I'll start with this.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.300
This is a story of a blues man.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:12.150
For any of you who are
watching or in the audience who

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.400
like the blues, you'll
recognize Blind Willie Johnson.

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.817
Blind Willie Johnson
is recognized

00:12:15.817 --> 00:12:17.250
as one of the blues greats.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.583
We don't have many of his songs.

00:12:18.583 --> 00:12:21.120
Only about 36 of his
songs are recorded.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.630
He was born in Texas at the
turn of the 20th century, which

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.250
was 1900s.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.070
And he was born sighted.

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:31.560
And the story is that
when he was seven,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.230
his stepmother threw
lye in his face

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.650
in a domestic violence incident,
and he became blind, hence

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:39.600
Blind Willie Johnson.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.413
He grew up poor,
black, blind, in Texas.

00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:43.830
He learned how to
play the guitar,

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.560
and he made a living busking
on street corners, which

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.050
as you can imagine is not
a particularly good living.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:51.120
He got married.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.070
Him and his wife were
living in a house.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.597
The house burned down, and
they didn't have any money,

00:12:55.597 --> 00:12:57.930
so they actually-- when the
fire settled, they went back

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:01.340
and they lived in the husk
of the burnt out house.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.520
When he was 40, he developed
malaria, which now we're

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.900
dealing with in 1940s Texas.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.220
Malaria was not uncommon.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.820
He developed malaria, and his
wife took him to hospital.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:15.652
And he was turned away from
hospital, and then he died.

00:13:15.652 --> 00:13:17.985
It's not clear if he was
turned away because he was poor

00:13:17.985 --> 00:13:21.250
or because he was blind
or because he was black.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.720
Now, I tell you
this story to ask

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.170
a very simple question, which
is, what killed Blind Willie

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.660
Johnson?

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:30.726
Well, what killed
him was malaria.

00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:33.710
He went to hospital, he had
malaria, did not get treated,

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:34.760
then he died.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.530
So what killed him was malaria.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:38.490
Had he received treatment
for his malaria,

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:39.470
he would have lived.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:41.930
Had he receive chloroquine,
he would have lived.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:44.440
But the reason I tell the
story-- it's an extreme story

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.118
intentionally-- is
because it's pretty clear

00:13:47.118 --> 00:13:49.660
that it wasn't just malaria that
killed Blind Willie Johnson.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.020
It was also homelessness and
poverty and racism and access

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.462
to care and domestic violence.

00:13:54.462 --> 00:13:56.670
All of these forces also
killed Blind Willie Johnson.

00:13:56.670 --> 00:13:58.750
And it's hard to
avoid them when you're

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.030
faced with a story like that.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.140
So the difference between
health and health care

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.770
is health care is what we
do when we get malaria--

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:08.940
it's treating our malaria.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.760
And I want to be very clear,
this is not an anti health care

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.670
argument, not at all.

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:13.740
There's not an anti
medicine argument.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.978
When I have malaria, I want
to be treated properly.

00:14:15.978 --> 00:14:18.270
When you have malaria, you
want to be treated properly.

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:22.380
This simply says that health
care, treating malaria,

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:24.810
is different than
what causes health.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.960
And what causes health
is everything else.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:28.710
It's housing.

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.210
It's economic opportunity.

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:31.410
It's education.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.960
It is domestic violence
or lack thereof of.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.550
It is access to care.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:37.530
It is racism, social supports.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.250
That's ultimately
what causes health.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:43.320
And that's the difference
between health and health care.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:47.460
The fundamental reason why
our health is terrible,

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.020
despite our investment,
is because as I said,

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.940
we spend $3.3 trillion,
and we're spending that all

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.340
on malaria, not malaria per se.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.900
I'm using malaria as a metaphor.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.690
We're spending it all on
treating people who are already

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.840
sick, rather than
spending enough of it

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.767
on the other pillars
that generate health.

00:15:06.767 --> 00:15:08.850
So the number one thing
that we need to talk about

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.370
is health, not health care.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.300
We need to talk about how it
is that we generate health

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.550
so that we can collectively
invest in what generates

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:22.800
health, not just in health care,
not just in what cures disease.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.310
This is just a simple way, now,
of showing this graphically,

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.810
just with data.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:31.860
The bar on the left shows
roughly what causes health.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.130
The bar on the right shows
what we spend our money on.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.940
So if you look at the bar on
the left, the green bar, which

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.850
is access to
care/medicine, most experts

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.940
suggest that that causes
about 5% to 10% of our whole;

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:48.350
genetics maybe 20%; our
environments, where we live,

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:52.310
our social interactions, our
physical environments 20, 25%;

00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.910
our behaviors, our eating,
our drinking, our sleeping,

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.860
our smoking, 30% to 40%.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.740
And the orange is sort of
a bit of everything else.

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:05.750
But the key here is the mismatch
between the bar on the left

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:07.400
and the bar on the right.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.460
All our spending is
on the green, which

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.440
is medicine and health care.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.500
But the green causes
5% to 10% of health.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.900
So health care versus health
is the fundamental tension

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.290
that ultimately underlies
why our health is not

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:25.640
as good as it should be.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.027
And it is at core if
I were to be asked--

00:16:28.027 --> 00:16:30.110
I'm often asked what's the
one thing you would do.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:31.818
It is to change our
national conversation

00:16:31.818 --> 00:16:34.120
so that we understand
that malaria matters.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.860
But if we only treat
malaria, Blind Willie Johnson

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.990
is still going to
die, because he

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:40.890
may be saved from
his malaria today,

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:43.970
but tomorrow he's going to
have pneumonia, or the day

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.500
after, he's going
to die from sepsis.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.780
So treating the malaria
alone doesn't do it.

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.610
Second argument.

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.457
We choose to be healthy
much less than we think.

00:16:55.457 --> 00:16:58.040
Now one of the counter arguments
I get to the first one is OK,

00:16:58.040 --> 00:16:59.550
health, not health care, fine.

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.050
I get it.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:02.930
I get that housing and
economic opportunity

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.420
and poverty and employment,
I get those things matter

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.290
for health.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.710
But at the end of the
day, I may be charitable,

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:10.960
and I might not care for
people who are disadvantaged.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.502
Blind Willie Johnson
had a hard life.

00:17:12.502 --> 00:17:16.162
But you know what, I can
choose to live a good life.

00:17:16.162 --> 00:17:17.829
I've pulled myself
up by the bootstraps.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:19.480
I can choose to be healthy.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.160
And as long as I
choose to be healthy,

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.880
surely I'm going to be OK.

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.089
And this is a mistake
that we make all the time.

00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:29.222
And in fact, if you go
to a physical bookstore--

00:17:29.222 --> 00:17:30.680
I know people here
at Google, which

00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.888
means that the physical
world is a thing of the past.

00:17:32.888 --> 00:17:34.595
But you can go to a
digital bookstore.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:35.720
You'll find the same thing.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.050
There are two kinds
of books about health.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.090
There are shelves
and shelves of books

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.365
that tell you about how you
can choose to be healthy,

00:17:43.365 --> 00:17:45.490
how you can choose to eat
better, to exercise more,

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:46.118
to sleep more.

00:17:46.118 --> 00:17:47.660
And then you have
shelves and shelves

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.530
of books that tell you,
well, if that doesn't work,

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.010
here's a pill for you.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.718
Those are roughly the
two kinds of books.

00:17:54.718 --> 00:17:56.540
One is how you can
choose to be healthy

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:57.320
and the other one
is well, if that

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.778
doesn't work, let's give you
a pill, let's give you a drug,

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:01.920
let's treat your malaria.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.370
That paradigm
suggests that we think

00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.710
that we can choose
to be healthy,

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.490
and that ultimately, our choice
of health is within our hands.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.160
Now, I know you're thinking,
well, but isn't it?

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.460
So let me just use a metaphor
to illustrate how it's not.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:20.550
And I'll go to sort
of a well-known health

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:22.352
movie, "The Devil Wears Prada."

00:18:22.352 --> 00:18:24.560
So "Devil Wears Prada," for
those of you who have not

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.460
seen it, is a movie about a
fearsome fashion editor who's

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.910
played in the movie by
Meryl Streep, and the intern

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:33.510
was played by Anne Hathaway.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:38.003
And it's a lovely
story of an odd couple

00:18:38.003 --> 00:18:40.170
who eventually come to
understand each other and all

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:40.950
that.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.630
But there's a great
scene, which is

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:46.520
the scene which is on the
right, which is where Andy.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.210
the intern, is wearing a
sweater, this sweater here.

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.740
And the scene is where there
is a conversation between her

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.180
and the editor around--

00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.280
where the editor is trying
to choose one of two belts.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:06.030
And Andy, the intern, who
thinks she's bigger than that,

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.880
laughs at the absurdity
of the choice,

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.350
saying, well, the two belts
look exactly the same.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.990
And the editor, Miranda, decides
to take her down one notch

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.870
and says, well, look at
the sweater you're wearing.

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.060
You think you chose that
sweater, didn't you?

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:21.510
But what you don't know is that
that sweater is not turquoise.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.320
It's not blue.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:22.980
It's not lapis.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.480
It's cerulean.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.850
And the reason you're
wearing a cerulean sweater

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.770
is because in 2002 Oscar
de La Renta showed cerulean

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:33.520
on the runway.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.500
A few years later,
Yves Saint Lauren

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.800
showed cerulean military
jackets, and the five years

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.190
after multiple designers
that were using cerulean,

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.970
and then that eventually
filtered down into the sweaters

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.010
from which you chose.

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.500
And the value of that scene--
and I would encourage anybody

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.090
to go on YouTube and watch it--

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.180
is it makes it very
clear that something

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.220
that we tend to
think of as personal,

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.430
as much as what you're wearing,
you choose what you're wearing,

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.370
is ultimately shaped by the
world around that, that Andy's

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.965
choice of a cerulean sweater--

00:20:05.965 --> 00:20:07.840
yes, it was her choice,
but it was her choice

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.240
from a very
constrained choice set

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.840
that was created for her
by the world around her.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.340
And this is the
world that now we're

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.507
beginning to [INAUDIBLE] to.

00:20:16.507 --> 00:20:18.430
It's a world of physical
choices made for us,

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.260
algorithmic choices made for us.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.395
And the world's
always been like that,

00:20:22.395 --> 00:20:24.270
and the world's always
going to be like that,

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:25.978
and this is not an
argument against that.

00:20:25.978 --> 00:20:27.490
It's simply an
argument that says,

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:30.610
once we recognize
that, then we should

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.420
make sure that our
choices privilege health,

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.340
that our choice set
privileges health.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.020
And unless we do that,
we are bound for failure.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:40.820
So the positive is once
you recognize this,

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.950
let's create choice sets
that privilege health.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.595
And if we do not do
that, we are going

00:20:44.595 --> 00:20:45.970
to have the kind
of conditions we

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:47.650
have in the United States today.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.140
Now, we have done
this before, and there

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:52.050
are good examples of success.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.580
Perhaps the biggest
example of success

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.560
is one of the biggest
health triumphs

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.080
in this country in the
past century, which

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.350
is our decline in
motor vehicle deaths.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:05.930
So the blue line going down
is deaths from car accidents.

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:08.110
The green line is
how much we drive.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.420
We drive much more, we die less.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.710
Per vehicle mile driven,
we die about 200 times less

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:16.430
for every vehicle mile driven.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:20.110
We have earned for ourselves the
freedom from dying unexpectedly

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.640
in our cars.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.720
Now, how do we do that?

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.050
Well, if choosing people to
be healthy was the approach,

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:30.880
we would have done
not by choosing

00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.155
to create healthier drivers.

00:21:33.155 --> 00:21:34.030
Now, I'm from Boston.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:35.860
I'm not from out here
on the West Coast.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.330
So I'm not sure what drivers
are like in West Coast.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.038
But I can tell you
that in Boston, people

00:21:39.038 --> 00:21:42.400
are not better drivers than
they were 100 years ago.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:42.900
No.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.730
But everybody knows
how we've done this.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:47.840
We've done this through agreeing
on seat belts and airbags

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.240
and shatter proof
glass and incentives

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.218
against the driving while
under the influence of alcohol.

00:21:53.218 --> 00:21:54.260
That's how we've done it.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:57.530
So we have created a
world where the choice

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:03.110
set of healthy driving is now
constrained in the direction

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:04.988
of not hurting each other.

00:22:04.988 --> 00:22:06.030
That's how we've done it.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.710
And that really has to be
the metaphor for how we

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:13.570
create health in all aspects.

00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.280
Point three.

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.250
If you really buy this argument,
and perhaps the comment

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:22.010
that I'm faced most often since
I've done this book when I talk

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.980
to different audiences is well,
this argument you're making

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:25.820
is kind of obvious.

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.890
And I actually really
enjoyed this comment,

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:29.510
because I feel like
the arguments are

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.343
obvious it means it's
intuitive, which means

00:22:31.343 --> 00:22:33.390
we can actually act on it.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:38.060
We need to understand that
it's the world around us that

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:38.960
generates health.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.170
And in order for
us to be healthy,

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:42.253
we need to actually invest
in the world around us.

00:22:42.253 --> 00:22:45.620
And I want to tell you
a story to explain that.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.627
And this is a picture of
what a couple of years

00:22:48.627 --> 00:22:50.960
ago was the best soccer team
in the United States, which

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.335
is the US women's
national soccer

00:22:52.335 --> 00:22:53.990
team that won the World Cup.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.490
Now, soccer is the only
sport I care about.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.300
So this is a very
personal story.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.522
But I understand that
people in the audience

00:23:01.522 --> 00:23:03.230
may or may not know
this and other people

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:04.605
from outside the
US would call it

00:23:04.605 --> 00:23:06.120
football, which
is its real name,

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.060
but for those who don't know
the sport, it's very simple.

00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.740
You have 11 people on one
side, 11 on the other side,

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.540
and they sort of kick the
ball with their feet, hence

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.250
it's football, and try to get
the ball to the other net.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:15.430
That's how the game works.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:16.805
It's a very simple
game, which is

00:23:16.805 --> 00:23:18.900
why it's the most popular
game in the world.

00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.780
Now, if you don't
know the game, just

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.372
understand the 10
players in blue,

00:23:22.372 --> 00:23:23.580
they can only use their feet.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:25.250
The one player in
red, she can use

00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:28.700
all parts of her body to stop
the ball from going to the net.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.430
So if you don't play soccer,
sometimes the mistake

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.040
that we make is to say, well,
if you have the world's best

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.840
goalie, you're
always going to win,

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:39.280
because she can stop any
ball from going to the net.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.740
But if you watch a
professional soccer game,

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.520
what you'll see, what we would
see here with Hope Solo--

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.050
she's now retired.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.110
The goalie prowls her
area for the entire game,

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.080
and she's yelling at
the other players.

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.830
You know what she's
yelling at them to do?

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:56.080
She's saying keep the
ball away from me,

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.400
because the good goalie
knows that the net is big.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.370
It doesn't matter
how good she is.

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:05.610
A fastball coming at the
net is going to go in.

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:07.380
Now, why am I telling you this?

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.760
I'm telling you this, because
you want a good goalie.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.100
But a good goalie by herself
does not win the game.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.600
The goalie is medicine.

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.010
The goalie is health care.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:20.845
The goalie is what we have to
look after us if we get sick.

00:24:20.845 --> 00:24:22.220
And we want a good
goalie, right?

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:23.630
As I said at the
beginning, I want

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:24.838
to be treated for my malaria.

00:24:24.838 --> 00:24:26.550
I want to be treated
for my heart attack.

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.168
But the goalie by herself is
not going to win the game.

00:24:29.168 --> 00:24:31.460
You need the other 10 players,
and the other 10 players

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:34.490
are the places we live, the air
we breathe, the water we drink,

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.000
the food we eat.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.880
They are whether the
environment around us

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.090
encourage us to smoke, use
substances, the houses we live

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:43.520
in, the parks that we
have for recreation,

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.687
the education that we
have that teaches us

00:24:45.687 --> 00:24:47.270
and put us on a path
towards healthier

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.608
living, the economic
opportunities we have,

00:24:49.608 --> 00:24:51.900
whether or not there is
violence that we're exposed to,

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:53.858
whether or not there is
equity between genders.

00:24:53.858 --> 00:24:56.503
Those are the pillars that
ultimately generate health.

00:24:56.503 --> 00:24:57.920
And that's what
creates the soccer

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.345
team that wins at health.

00:25:01.345 --> 00:25:02.470
And what are those pillars?

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.590
Here's examples, early
childhood education.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:05.960
We can spend $5.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.360
We know that we save $5
for every dollar we spend

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.568
on early childhood education.

00:25:09.568 --> 00:25:12.120
We reduce crime, child
maltreatment, teen pregnancy.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.940
We know this.

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:14.970
Public transportation.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.150
We know that in the city
of a million people,

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:18.968
a 40% expansion
of public transit

00:25:18.968 --> 00:25:21.260
has an annual health benefit
of more than $200 million.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:26.780
And incomes, we know that
things like earned tax credits,

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:30.710
increasing earned income tax
credits for low families by 10%

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.170
reduces infant mortality
by 23 per 100,000,

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:38.390
or put another way it saves 23
infant deaths for every 100,000

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:39.343
infants born.

00:25:39.343 --> 00:25:40.010
So we know this.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.200
I'm just showing you
three concrete examples.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.132
And these are data you
can find on the web.

00:25:44.132 --> 00:25:45.590
You can actually
go on CDC website,

00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:46.548
you'll find these data.

00:25:46.548 --> 00:25:48.590
These are all from
the CDC itself.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:53.960
And we know that investment
in these other 10 pillars

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.970
ultimately generate health.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.662
And what we keep forgetting
is that investing

00:25:58.662 --> 00:26:00.620
in these other 10 pillars
is non-discretionary.

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.320
We actually have no choice
but to invest in them

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.360
if we want to generate
health, as is perhaps

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.000
evidenced by the abysmal state
of health in this country,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.270
despite the extraordinary
investment that we make,

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.770
because all that
investment is going

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:16.593
on just one of the
players, namely the goalie.

00:26:16.593 --> 00:26:18.510
So the bottom line, so
here's the bottom line.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:20.550
Here is the takeaway
from this presentation

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.970
and really the
takeaway from the book.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:28.813
I would urge us all to
remember three things.

00:26:28.813 --> 00:26:29.980
Three things are as follows.

00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.720
Number one.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.790
What killed Blind
Willie Johnson?

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:34.650
What choices we
are really making?

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.740
And why we need to invest
in more than the goalie?

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.380
What killed Blind
Willie Johnson was

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.780
the combination of
circumstances in his life

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:43.910
that generated health.

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:48.690
It was housing, poverty, racism,
domestic violence, poor access

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:49.870
to care.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.540
The choices we
are really making,

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.590
we think that we are choosing
our healthy behaviors.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.950
But in fact, our
behaviors are constrained

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.000
by that same world
around us that ultimately

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.680
killed Blind Willie Johnson.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.077
And number three, if we
want to create health,

00:27:04.077 --> 00:27:05.910
we need to invest in
much more than malaria,

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:08.140
much more than the goalie.

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.070
Once we understand that,
I think it fundamentally

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.660
changes how we
talk about health,

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:15.872
and it puts us on a path
towards a much healthier world.

00:27:15.872 --> 00:27:17.580
And I will stop with
just one last slide,

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.650
and then I'll take questions.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:22.630
This is what the book's
trying to get at,

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:25.260
and really, the
point of the book

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.515
is the subtitle, which is
"What We Need to Talk About

00:27:27.515 --> 00:27:29.640
When We Talk About Health,"
because what I'm trying

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.230
to do with the book is I am
trying to say we need to change

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:35.360
our conversation on health.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.110
Once we change the
conversation on health,

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.780
a lot of other things follow
and our fundamental problem

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:41.732
right now is that
we do not understand

00:27:41.732 --> 00:27:42.940
Blind Willie Johnson's story.

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:44.800
We do not understand
"Devil Wears Prada."

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.890
We do not understand
how soccer is played

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.370
and how soccer can actually
help us win at health.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.870
That's it.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:50.657
I'll stop there.

00:27:50.657 --> 00:27:51.990
I will take questions, comments.

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.020
Thank you very much.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.840
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much, Dr. Galea.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.030
I think in your book,
you also touched

00:27:59.030 --> 00:28:05.330
on how unique the American
culture is around individualism

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.750
and about individual choice, and
you just touched on it as well

00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:12.640
during your presentation.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:18.070
Is health and this fixation
on the individual choice

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:22.070
and individualism
fundamentally contradictory,

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.420
because I think it
seems like there

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:28.940
is some kind of
fundamental assessment

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.685
that we have to do
amongst ourselves?

00:28:31.685 --> 00:28:33.560
SANDRO GALEA: Yeah, it's
a terrific question.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.560
The answer is I don't
think they are at all.

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.290
I don't think Americans are
any different than the Irish,

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:41.210
the Italians, the
Swedish, the Zambians.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:43.970
I think at core, Americans
want to be healthy.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:48.200
I think we make a mistake
in the American conversation

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:50.550
in this notion of
we want freedom.

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:52.550
It's part of the national
conversation, freedom.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.890
Freedom is a core part of
what it is to be American.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.270
But when you look carefully
at the canonical texts,

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:00.790
at what started
the country, there

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.630
are different kinds of freedoms.

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:05.110
There's freedom to do
things, and there's

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.000
freedom from things.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.120
And in the past 30, 40 years,
we have privileged freedom

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.640
to over freedom from.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.900
You want freedom from
dying unexpectedly

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:18.490
when you leave this building.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:19.750
That is a freedom.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.533
You want freedom
from getting obese

00:29:22.533 --> 00:29:24.700
without thinking about it,
because you're constantly

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.910
eating calorie dense,
nutrient poor foods that

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.300
are there because of
subsidies for products

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:32.490
that are unhealthy.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:33.803
And that is also freedom.

00:29:33.803 --> 00:29:35.470
So I do not think
it's in contradiction.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.980
I actually think that we
have allowed ourselves

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.740
to get into a place where we
privilege one type of freedom

00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.420
over another, and
I think it's simply

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:46.800
a mistake in our
national conversation.

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.390
AUDIENCE: I am curious to
hear your views on drug

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.910
decriminalization
in light of what

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:56.780
you said about choice sets and
things to motivate behavior.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.870
SANDRO GALEA: Yeah.

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.090
I think the moves towards
drug decriminalization

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:04.700
are enormously long overdue.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.260
The criminalization of
drugs in this country

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.870
has had such a
disproportionate effect

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.740
on people of color,
particularly young black men,

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:20.020
that it has created a whole wave
of incarceration and downstream

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:24.130
consequences, that I actually
think that still haven't fully

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:28.930
come to grips with the
full scale of the physical

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.300
and mental health consequences
of incarceration, which

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.580
is directly linked to
criminalization of drugs.

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:37.310
So I think decriminalization
is long overdue.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:39.340
I also think that
decriminalization,

00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:43.390
leaving aside now the
burden that criminalization

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.080
has imposed upon a
particular group,

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:50.920
decriminalization creates an
opportunity for regulation.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.470
It creates an
opportunity for drugs

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:58.630
to be purchased and sold in
a way that controls them.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:03.047
It creates an opportunity
for us to create a system

00:31:03.047 --> 00:31:05.380
where the ingestion of those
drugs happens in such a way

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.093
that people are not
hurting themselves.

00:31:07.093 --> 00:31:09.010
And that, of course, is
something we can never

00:31:09.010 --> 00:31:10.960
do if drugs are criminalized.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.600
Now, the argument often about
decriminalization is well,

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.220
people can still
buy drugs illegally.

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.140
That's true.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.420
But there's ample
historical precedent

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.655
to show that most
people most of the time

00:31:21.655 --> 00:31:23.530
would rather do things
that are legal than do

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:24.370
things that are illegal.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:26.020
Once you decriminalize
drugs, people

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.448
will be buying those
substances through legal means.

00:31:30.448 --> 00:31:30.990
So thank you.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:31.865
It's a good question.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.940
AUDIENCE: I'm going to
paraphrase a virtual Dory

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.440
question.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.900
So this person is saying
that a similar approach needs

00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:46.890
to be used regarding our justice
system in mass incarceration,

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.140
also contributor to
mortality health,

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.170
we focus on eradicating
crime, AKA, disease,

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:56.280
rather than creating strong
safe communities, AKA, health.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.290
So I guess I wanted
to kind of phrase

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:02.210
them more in a question
of what role does--

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:04.950
should community
take a broader role,

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:10.500
or do you think it's really just
like shaping the conversation,

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.750
shaping the national rhetoric?

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:16.080
SANDRO GALEA: It's an
excellent question.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.630
I think the answer
I should give is

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.370
to say that community
should take a role,

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:22.078
but I want to be
careful when I say that.

00:32:22.078 --> 00:32:23.890
I think it's just
too easy an answer.

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:28.710
To paraphrase Margaret
Thatcher, of all people, it's--

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:31.580
Margaret Thatcher said-- she
meant it differently obviously,

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.790
but she said, "There's no
such thing as community.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:34.050
There are only people."

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:38.340
And I actually think that there
is some cynical wisdom to that,

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:40.890
because community is us.

00:32:40.890 --> 00:32:42.690
Community populations
are collections

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:44.858
of people that have their
own emergent properties

00:32:44.858 --> 00:32:46.650
and behave differently
than individuals do.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:49.150
But they do remain
collections of people.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:52.800
So I do think that
communities behave in a way

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.800
that its constituent
citizens, us, push

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.150
the conversation forward.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:01.030
You know, there is a
recent set of papers

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:05.320
that talk about what percent
of people in a given country

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.460
do you need to
create real change,

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:10.840
and the science seems
to be [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.300
If you have more
than 3.5% of people

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.840
who would demand real change,
change always happens.

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:19.090
3.5% the US is 10
million people.

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.660
It's not that many people.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:25.600
So I do think that this rests
on a national conversation

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.423
shift and a global
conversation shift.

00:33:27.423 --> 00:33:28.840
For those of you
who are following

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.600
from other countries who
are feeling smug about it,

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.600
it's probably not so wise,
because unfortunately, there

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.450
are abundant examples, national
examples out of countries that

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:41.490
are following along the path
that the US has paved on this.

00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:44.080
And the US path is
definitely not enviable.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.720
So I do think that it
comes down to people.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.870
It comes down to citizens.

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:50.350
It comes down to citizens
demanding health and citizens

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:53.050
understanding health
and demanding health

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.958
by demanding that we build the
structures to generate health.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.440
AUDIENCE: A lot of people
sometimes are skeptical

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.290
of experts like
you, because there

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:09.480
has been a lot of distrust
of experts and of facts,

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.909
and because I think a lot of
people presently in poor health

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:16.750
and in poor situations
can only help

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:20.850
but view that essentially people
who are in positions of power

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:21.690
failed us.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:28.889
And I fail to trust people who
spout knowledge and expertise.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:30.659
I'm sure that's part
of the reason why

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:32.159
there are many
parents who refuse

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:35.590
to vaccinate their children.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.469
Is this potentially related?

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:38.699
Could you speak on this?

00:34:38.699 --> 00:34:41.620
Because I think there would be
a lot of people who would say,

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.998
well, they're just trying to
tell me how to live my life.

00:34:43.998 --> 00:34:44.790
SANDRO GALEA: Yeah.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:51.040
So I think it seems to me
appropriate to be a suitably

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.000
skeptical of experts.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:52.900
That's fine.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:56.420
That seems reasonable.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.610
I think, taking the
American lens for a second,

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:04.810
the American woeful
underperformance on health

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:08.410
has had deep and
devastating consequences

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:11.290
for the national
political scene.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.660
And by that, I don't mean
as a partisan comment.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.540
I mean it in terms of fracturing
the national political

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.750
conversation.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:21.550
So I could show you data,
which I have on my laptop--

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.410
I'm not showing it here--

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:27.370
that looks at the
counties in the US

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:31.840
that lost life
expectancy up to 2016.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.060
And you could
correlate those data

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.430
with the counties in the US
that were likeliest to vote

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.080
for Donald Trump.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.350
And it is a dose response
is a straight line.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:43.350
The counties that
lost life expectancy

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.100
were more likely to
vote for Donald Trump.

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:48.160
Now, if you think about it--
and I hope this is not taken

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.750
as a partisan comment--

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:52.900
you had two candidates running
in the last US election.

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.440
One candidate, who was the
party of the incumbent, who

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.760
essentially said,
we're doing well.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.690
And we're going to do better.

00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:04.575
And the our candidate, who
said, I'm not a politician.

00:36:04.575 --> 00:36:06.200
I don't like anything
that's happening.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:08.770
I'm going to change all that
and throw everything out.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.425
Now leaving aside how you
feel about both candidates,

00:36:11.425 --> 00:36:13.300
leaving aside their
personal characteristics,

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.140
it seems to me that if
you are living in a county

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.730
where you've seen your
life expectancy go down,

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:23.250
it is not unreasonable to
vote for the candidate who

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.890
says everything is going
to hell in a handbasket,

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:28.057
I'm going to change all of
that, whether you believe

00:36:28.057 --> 00:36:30.390
that he can actually do it,
whether or not he's actually

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:31.690
done it is irrelevant.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:35.970
So the point I'm making is that
our health underperformance

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:40.050
has had seismic impact
on the American political

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:41.800
conversation, and
in many respects,

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.133
this trickled down to the
global political conversation.

00:36:44.133 --> 00:36:46.710
So I do think that there
is hell to pay for the fact

00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:51.450
that we have let
this sneak up on us.

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:55.080
And we are, I should
be clear, today

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.670
in a worse position
than we're in when

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:57.878
I started to write this book.

00:36:57.878 --> 00:37:00.990
So I'm not sure how many
viewers will know this,

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:06.570
but in 2018, 2017, 2016,
there was a decrease

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:08.330
in life expectancy in the US.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:10.500
That was the first time
we had a year on year,

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.450
three-year decrease
in life expectancy

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.500
since the 1918 flu pandemic.

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.403
So for 100 years, we have not
had the poor health indicators

00:37:18.403 --> 00:37:19.320
that we're having now.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.550
So it is reasonable-- it is
very reasonable for people

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.870
to say I don't trust experts.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.090
This is where they got us to.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:30.085
We are in not a good
place on health.

00:37:30.085 --> 00:37:32.210
Having said that, the reason
we're not a good place

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:33.995
is because we collectively
are not talking

00:37:33.995 --> 00:37:35.120
about health the right way.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
coming to speak, Dr. Galea.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.560
I had a question regarding
the bar charts that you

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.320
had comparing the contributing
factors to our health outcomes

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.122
and the amount of spending
that we have on health care.

00:37:54.122 --> 00:37:55.830
I believe the largest
contributing factor

00:37:55.830 --> 00:37:59.543
was personal health choices
in terms of health outcomes.

00:37:59.543 --> 00:38:00.960
My question for
you there is, one,

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.918
how did you determine
that that was the largest

00:38:02.918 --> 00:38:06.510
contributing factor, or
that overall chart overall.

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.150
And secondly, what do you
think are the obstacles

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:11.022
or what is hindering
people in terms

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:13.230
of finding the information
they need to make a better

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.250
personal health choices?

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:16.320
SANDRO GALEA: Yeah,
so the calculation

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:18.237
of those percentages is
always very difficult.

00:38:18.237 --> 00:38:21.960
It's a [? trivial ?]
fraction calculation.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.740
It ultimately blurs the fact
that these are multiple causes

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.603
that all occur and all
contribute at the same time.

00:38:28.603 --> 00:38:30.270
So we have to be
careful about being too

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.720
rigid in saying it's 30%, 32%.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.310
I would think of
it more as a way

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:37.230
to organize our
thinking about what

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:41.112
the major contributors to
health are because ultimately,

00:38:41.112 --> 00:38:42.570
personal choice,
as I've indicated,

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.510
are nested within the
environments, which we are in.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:49.470
So saying that you choose
to eat healthy food

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:51.355
is ultimately directly
driven by the fact

00:38:51.355 --> 00:38:52.980
that you're surrounded
by healthy food,

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.780
so the two are not separate.

00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.710
The information I think
is critical in terms

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:04.180
of health behavior,
but it is necessary,

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.673
but nowhere near sufficient.

00:39:05.673 --> 00:39:07.090
And I think one
of the mistakes we

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:12.238
make in our digital conversation
and in our being enraptured

00:39:12.238 --> 00:39:14.530
by all things digital is that
we think that information

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:15.903
by itself is sufficient.

00:39:15.903 --> 00:39:16.570
It's simply not.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:17.680
And there is abundant
data on that.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.330
I can show you,
for example, data

00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:22.570
that there's been a wave of
personal genetic testing.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:24.450
And one of the premises
of it is that, well,

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:26.793
if I know what's on
what my genotype is

00:39:26.793 --> 00:39:28.210
and what are more
at risk for, I'm

00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:29.725
going to change my
health behavior.

00:39:29.725 --> 00:39:31.600
The data are pretty
clear, it doesn't happen.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.530
Actually, I do not change
my health behavior.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:36.740
So information is necessary,
but nowhere near sufficient.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:39.352
So this is, again, it's
a bit of an and argument.

00:39:39.352 --> 00:39:41.060
It's not an argument
against information.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.830
It's not an argument that
says we need structures that

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:49.210
create stable healthy behavior
sets, versus information,

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:49.990
not at all.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.948
I think we need both,
but information by itself

00:39:51.948 --> 00:39:53.365
is not enough.

00:39:53.365 --> 00:39:55.428
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:39:55.428 --> 00:39:57.178
SANDRO GALEA: Just to
your right, I think.

00:40:00.213 --> 00:40:01.880
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
the wonderful talk.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.260
I had two questions.

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.680
One is I was curious how
the bar charts might appear

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.720
in other countries
that are doing

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:13.630
sort of better on a smaller
portion of their expenses?

00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:16.010
SANDRO GALEA: Yeah, the
contributing factors to health

00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:17.820
don't change.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.520
They're human universal.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.040
What does changes is what
countries spend their money on.

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.970
So I've said in this talk
consistently that we spend more

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:27.930
on health than other countries.

00:40:27.930 --> 00:40:30.645
It would be reasonable for
you to say that that's wrong.

00:40:30.645 --> 00:40:32.270
We actually don't
spend more on health.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:33.830
We spend more on health care.

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.020
When you look at our spending
on these other pillars

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.630
that I'm talking about, which
is the housing, the education,

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:41.088
the economic opportunities,
when you look at that spending,

00:40:41.088 --> 00:40:43.140
we far underspend our peers.

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:45.760
So when you add those two, if
you take my soccer metaphor,

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.290
and you say what are we
spending on the whole team,

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.828
we are spending substantially
less on the whole team

00:40:51.828 --> 00:40:53.870
compared to countries that
do much better than we

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:54.480
do on health.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.990
So in some respects, the
spending and the outcome

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:58.420
is well matched.

00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:01.850
AUDIENCE: So on the left side,
that would have been unchanged,

00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:03.680
relative to other countries.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.220
The right side, they
would have had more than--

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.353
instead of just 5% on the
bottom on other factors,

00:41:09.353 --> 00:41:10.520
that would have been higher.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.400
SANDRO GALEA: Correct.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.025
AUDIENCE: My second thing I was
curious about is to what extent

00:41:14.025 --> 00:41:17.150
do you find it useful and
informative to break down

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:21.170
the US into different, say,
socioeconomic categories

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:26.450
or something and how do the
curves look if you do that?

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:27.290
Is that a useful--

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:30.070
SANDRO GALEA: Yeah, it
doesn't change very much.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:32.598
Now, there are many different
socioeconomic patterns

00:41:32.598 --> 00:41:33.390
across the country.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.430
And in fact, there's
been some papers

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.710
that have been done dividing
up the US into eight

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.515
different groupings of states.

00:41:38.515 --> 00:41:39.890
There's many
different ways which

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:41.240
we can divide up the country.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.240
But the things that don't
change are as follows.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:46.640
Number one is in terms of those
two bars you're referring to,

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.730
what causes health
doesn't change,

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.340
and what we spend on
health does not change.

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.360
I live in Boston
in Massachusetts,

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.210
and Boston is the city in the
country which has the highest

00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:57.720
doctor population ratio.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:01.350
It is a city where health
is the primary employer.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:04.122
So sometimes, I give a
talk like this in Boston,

00:42:04.122 --> 00:42:05.330
and I get challenged on that.

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:07.330
Well, surely Boston
is different.

00:42:07.330 --> 00:42:09.380
And I can show data
in Massachusetts

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:12.680
that shows in the past 15 years,
we have increased our spending

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.890
on medical care by about 80%,
and we have kept the same

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:18.077
or decreased our spending
on parks and recreation,

00:42:18.077 --> 00:42:19.910
on mental health, and
public health efforts,

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.568
on criminal justice,
domestic violence.

00:42:21.568 --> 00:42:23.360
All of that's gone down
or stayed the same.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.290
So even in Massachusetts,
which by the way,

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.110
I mentioned Hawaii is
the healthiest state.

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:29.070
Massachusetts the
second healthiest state.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.950
So even in Massachusetts, we
are underperforming this set

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:36.370
of factors, which explains why,
even Hawaii and Massachusetts

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:40.150
have worse health indicators
than, say, Slovenia and all

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.195
the countries above Slovenia.

00:42:42.195 --> 00:42:43.320
AUDIENCE: Thanks very much.

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:45.880
SANDRO GALEA: Thank you.

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:49.420
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about for each individual.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:53.320
Should we try out all the
trending diets and health

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.280
advice flowing around in the
internet such as the Keto diet,

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.400
or should we just stick
to the most basic,

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.160
less is more concept,
just being stable?

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.690
SANDRO GALEA: I think you
should stick to the most basic,

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:12.410
because the truth about all
these diets is some will work,

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.920
some won't.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.450
Some will make a difference.

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:14.950
Some won't.

00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:16.620
But the difference
is around the edges.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.980
What really matters,
what really matters

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:22.370
is ultimately the choice
set and the individual

00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:26.070
doing eating healthy
consistently over a lifetime.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.810
So going to Keto diet or
the Atkins diet or whatever,

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:31.020
it's sort of irrelevant.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:34.350
What really matters is that
you eat a variety of things,

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:37.105
you get enough nutrients,
you eat in moderation,

00:43:37.105 --> 00:43:39.230
and you do that consistently
throughout a lifetime.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:42.260
And most humans have
a really hard time

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.420
doing that, in large
part, because we do not

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:47.590
surround them with healthy foods
consistently over a lifetime.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:49.640
So I would say, ignore all that.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.780
Eat reasonably.

00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:53.070
Eat broadly over a lifetime.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:56.010
That's what you need to do.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:58.380
AUDIENCE: And then just kind
of bring the question home

00:43:58.380 --> 00:43:59.310
here at Google.

00:43:59.310 --> 00:44:00.720
So in your research,
how have you

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:05.270
found technological advances
playing a part as your bar

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:09.047
charts increase or decrease,
how have you seen that?

00:44:09.047 --> 00:44:10.380
SANDRO GALEA: I like technology.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:14.400
I think technology has
brought some wonderful things

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.490
to changing our life, although
it never changes our life as

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:18.750
quickly as we think it does.

00:44:18.750 --> 00:44:22.380
Otherwise, we'd be driving
around in flying cars today.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:24.480
I think the mistake
that we make is

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:28.890
into thinking that
technology is a solution

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:29.970
for fundamental problems.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:31.110
And this goes a little
bit to my answer

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:33.940
I gave about information being
necessary, but not sufficient.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:39.210
I think technology is a
terrific adjunct to improving

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.730
our quality of life, towards
creating opportunities for us

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.790
to live healthy for
as long as possible.

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:48.340
But by itself, it
is not sufficient.

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.690
And the mistake that we make is
if we think that technology is

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.600
going to be the only solution.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.930
And there's plenty of people
who've written about this.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:59.430
And I think it requires humility
on the part of all of us

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:02.975
that technology is simply
part of the solution.

00:45:02.975 --> 00:45:04.350
At the end of the
day, technology

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:05.690
doesn't know what to do
with domestic violence.

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:07.398
It doesn't know how
to deal with housing.

00:45:07.398 --> 00:45:09.523
It's not going to deal with
economic opportunities.

00:45:09.523 --> 00:45:11.273
It's not going to deal
with gender equity.

00:45:11.273 --> 00:45:13.523
It's not going to deal with
early childhood education.

00:45:13.523 --> 00:45:14.870
It's an adjunct to all of those.

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:16.162
But by itself, it's not enough.

00:45:16.162 --> 00:45:17.970
So I do think that to
we need to make sure

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:21.330
that we see technology
in its place,

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.250
and to go back to
my soccer metaphor,

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.910
I think technological
advances and developments that

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:29.220
create opportunities for--

00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.340
let's call it a more
sophisticated form of living

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:33.810
that allows us to do more--

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.100
is one of the players
on the soccer team,

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:36.010
and I'm OK with that.

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:37.710
And I think it's important
that whenever there is a soccer

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.877
team, as long as we don't
make the mistake, thinking

00:45:39.877 --> 00:45:42.078
that if we invest everything
in player number seven,

00:45:42.078 --> 00:45:43.620
player number seven
being technology,

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.630
we're going to win the
game, because we're not.

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:48.297
AUDIENCE: So you believe more in
technological aids, rather than

00:45:48.297 --> 00:45:49.440
solutions?

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:50.238
SANDRO GALEA: I think
that-- it depends

00:45:50.238 --> 00:45:51.488
on what you mean by solutions.

00:45:51.488 --> 00:45:53.083
If by solutions--
my argument is not

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:54.750
whether technology
is a solution or not.

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:57.960
My argument is whether it
is a sufficient solution.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.150
So I'll stick with
my soccer metaphor.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.940
I think player seven
can score, but she's not

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:03.963
going to win by herself.

00:46:03.963 --> 00:46:05.880
She needs the other 10
players, and technology

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.076
is one of the 10 players.

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:13.170
AUDIENCE: I guess to ask
one final question, which

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:16.440
is kind of a good
final question,

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:20.142
this person wants to know what
we at the individual level

00:46:20.142 --> 00:46:22.350
can do to help change the
system and the environment.

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:26.455
Is it next time we go to a bar,
like start the conversation?

00:46:26.455 --> 00:46:27.205
SANDRO GALEA: Yes.

00:46:27.205 --> 00:46:29.600
That's great.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.570
I will give three things.

00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:33.890
Number one, yes.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:34.700
Go to a bar.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.810
Go to dinner.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:38.205
And tell 10 people
about this talk.

00:46:38.205 --> 00:46:41.095
If everybody tells 10 people
and tell them to tell 10 people,

00:46:41.095 --> 00:46:42.970
that will get us to the
10 million people who

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:43.670
understand the conversation.

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:44.780
That's number one.

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:52.900
Number two, number two, vote for
candidates who understand this.

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.510
Vote for people for
positions of authority

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:57.910
in the public sector
who understand

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:00.180
what it is that it takes
to generate health.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.140
And that could be
at local level,

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:04.190
at the municipal level,
at the state level,

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:05.560
at the federal level.

00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:11.980
Number three, be a part of
and support and encourage

00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.590
the private sector that
is willing to generate

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:16.720
the conditions that
generate health.

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:17.740
So I think those three.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.360
Change the conversation.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.170
Vote for people for public
office who understand us.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.370
And number three,
create conditions

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:26.400
in the private
sector by supporting

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:29.810
elements of the private sector
to understand this discussion.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:33.193
Thank you to Google for allowing
me to present that message.

00:47:33.193 --> 00:47:34.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for giving

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:36.097
your wonderful lecture.

00:47:36.097 --> 00:47:37.680
SANDRO GALEA: Thank
you for having me.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.730
[APPLAUSE]
