00:00:00.074 --> 00:00:01.242
- [Voiceover] Let's say
you want to figure out

00:00:01.242 --> 00:00:04.039
what 5,600 divided by 8 is.

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:06.721
Now, you might be tempted to
do some type of long division

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.681
8 into 5,600,

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:11.978
and you could do it this
way, and you using paper.

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:14.159
What I want to show you
is that you could maybe

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:15.367
do this in your head,

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:17.561
or maybe even just use
less paper to do it.

00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:19.591
The key realization here is like look

00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:21.751
if you got these two zeros here,

00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:23.852
this is really the same thing as

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:28.852
56 times 100 divided 8.

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.550
56 times 100 is 5,600.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.350
You got the two zeros here,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.789
you got the two zeros here.

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:38.986
Let me make it very clear.

00:00:38.986 --> 00:00:40.089
Two zeros here,

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:41.969
you got the two zeros here.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.827
In fact, sometimes people
will call this number

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:46.567
56 hundred, 56 hundreds.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:51.567
So, 5,600 is the same
thing as 56 times 100.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.919
When you write it this
way, then you might say hey

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:57.019
instead of doing 56
times 100 divided by 8,

00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:58.598
I can switch the order.

00:00:58.598 --> 00:01:00.235
This is going to be the same thing.

00:01:00.235 --> 00:01:03.356
This is going to be the same thing as

00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:09.668
56 divided by 8

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:16.154
times 100.

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:22.083
Why'd I do this?

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:23.848
Well, it's pretty straight forward

00:01:23.848 --> 00:01:25.926
if you remember your multiplication tables

00:01:25.926 --> 00:01:28.004
what 56 divided by 8 is.

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:30.268
8 times 7 is 56.

00:01:30.944 --> 00:01:33.430
This right over here is going to be 7.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.601
Then, you're just left with figuring out

00:01:35.601 --> 00:01:37.912
what 7 times 100 is.

00:01:37.912 --> 00:01:41.114
7 times 100.

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:43.485
Well, that's going to be 700s.

00:01:44.438 --> 00:01:47.874
700s is just 700.

00:01:48.294 --> 00:01:52.309
700 and you're done.

00:01:52.682 --> 00:01:54.087
Let's do more of these,

00:01:54.087 --> 00:01:57.187
where we might be tempted to
do some type of long division,

00:01:57.187 --> 00:01:59.931
but if we really think about
ways to break up the numbers,

00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:01.788
we might be able to do it with less paper

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.876
or possibly even in our heads.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:06.952
Let's say that you had the number

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.787
800.

00:02:09.787 --> 00:02:11.366
Let me do this in a different color.

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:16.366
Let's say you had the number 800 and 46.

00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:21.661
846 and you want to divide that

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:23.519
by 2.

00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:26.736
Well, the realization here,
or what you might think about

00:02:26.736 --> 00:02:28.361
is let's break this number up.

00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:30.292
Let's break up this 846.

00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:34.051
846 is the same thing ...

00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:35.191
this is going to be ...

00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:36.433
actually, let me do it this way.

00:02:36.433 --> 00:02:39.335
846 is the same thing as

00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:41.513
this is the same thing as

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.170
800 plus 40

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.175
plus 6

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.955
and so 846 is the same
things as 800 plus 40 plus 6.

00:02:57.955 --> 00:02:59.975
We can just divide that by 2.

00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:02.540
We can just divide that by 2.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.703
Divided by 2.

00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:07.060
Notice, I didn't do
anything too fancy here.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.844
This is just the same
thing as this over here.

00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:11.796
I just broke it up.

00:03:11.796 --> 00:03:15.418
You have 800s, four
10s which is 40, and 6,

00:03:15.418 --> 00:03:16.997
and you can divide that by 2.

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:18.530
Well, how does that help us?

00:03:18.883 --> 00:03:21.694
Well, now we can divide each
of these separately by 2.

00:03:21.694 --> 00:03:22.750
one way to think about it is

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.759
we can distribute

00:03:25.297 --> 00:03:26.619
the division by 2.

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:28.721
Where, you might be familiar using the

00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:30.299
distributive property in multiplication,

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.122
but you could also do it with division.

00:03:32.122 --> 00:03:34.781
This thing right over here is
going to be the same thing.

00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.696
This is going to be equal to

00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:39.016
800 divided by 2.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.918
800 divided by 2

00:03:44.322 --> 00:03:46.600
plus 40 divided by 2.

00:03:47.031 --> 00:03:49.647
plus 40 divided by 2.

00:03:49.647 --> 00:03:51.829
I'm going to add parenthesis in a second

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:53.360
to make it a little bit clearer.

00:03:53.385 --> 00:03:55.184
Plus 6 divided by 2.

00:03:55.184 --> 00:03:59.026
Plus 6 divided by 2.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.195
Once again, you have

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.414
800 divided by 2.

00:04:15.414 --> 00:04:16.877
That's that right over there.

00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:20.452
Plus 40 divided by 2.

00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:21.996
40 divided by 2.

00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:23.738
Plus 6 divided by 2.

00:04:23.738 --> 00:04:26.512
Plus 6 divided by 2.

00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:29.194
We distributed the division by 2.

00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:30.738
Well, 800 divided by 2,

00:04:30.738 --> 00:04:32.619
you should do in your head.

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:34.894
This is 800, divided that by 2,

00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:36.223
and you're going to get 4 hundreds.

00:04:37.657 --> 00:04:40.404
4 tens divided by 2 is going to be 2 tens

00:04:42.065 --> 00:04:43.421
or 20.

00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:46.754
800s divided by 2 is 4 hundreds.

00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:48.995
4 tens divided by 2 is 2 tens.

00:04:48.995 --> 00:04:51.723
Then, 6 divided by 2 is 3.

00:04:51.723 --> 00:04:56.668
You are left with 400 plus 20 plus 3,

00:04:56.668 --> 00:05:01.668
which of course is equal to 400 and 23.

00:05:03.982 --> 00:05:08.068
I used a lot of my screen
here to work this out for you.

00:05:08.068 --> 00:05:08.962
You really

00:05:09.915 --> 00:05:11.482
digest what's going on here,

00:05:11.482 --> 00:05:12.944
but once you get good at it,

00:05:12.944 --> 00:05:14.070
you could say okay look

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.294
8 divided by 2,

00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:18.210
800s divided by 2 is 400s.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.232
Actually I could do it right over here.

00:05:19.232 --> 00:05:21.426
8 hundreds divided by 2 is 400s.

00:05:21.426 --> 00:05:25.245
4 tens divided by 2 is 2 tens.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:29.389
6 ones divided by 2 is 3 ones.

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:30.078
You could say hey look

00:05:30.078 --> 00:05:31.982
if I just divided each
of these numbers by 2

00:05:31.982 --> 00:05:34.603
I get 423.

00:05:34.655 --> 00:05:36.118
This is what you are really doing,

00:05:36.118 --> 00:05:38.219
you are separating it out by place value.

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.017
You are dividing each of those places

00:05:41.017 --> 00:05:44.558
the hundreds, the tens, and the ones by 2.

00:05:44.558 --> 00:05:46.357
Then, you got 423.

00:05:46.357 --> 00:05:48.214
By the way, that's
exactly what you would do

00:05:48.214 --> 00:05:50.316
if you actually did it
through long division.

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:54.042
You are actually dividing
2 into each of the places.

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.367
Let's do one more just to really make sure

00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:59.270
that we are fully enjoying this.

00:05:59.608 --> 00:06:01.796
Let's say that I have

00:06:04.672 --> 00:06:07.144
963

00:06:09.421 --> 00:06:14.055
and I want to divide that by 9.

00:06:14.525 --> 00:06:15.833
Well, over here,

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:17.217
you might make the realization

00:06:17.217 --> 00:06:20.361
well I can see parts of this
that I know how to divide by 9.

00:06:20.361 --> 00:06:23.695
I could say this is the same thing as 900,

00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:25.515
and I'm breaking out the 900,

00:06:25.515 --> 00:06:28.290
because I know how to
divide 900 divided by 9.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.590
That's 900.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.957
I know that 63 is a multiple of 9.

00:06:32.957 --> 00:06:35.209
Why don't I break out 63 separately.

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:36.052
I don't even have to break out the

00:06:36.052 --> 00:06:37.387
tens and the ones separately.

00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:38.665
I could say this is the same thing as

00:06:38.665 --> 00:06:40.952
900 plus 63

00:06:40.952 --> 00:06:45.952
and all of that divided by 9.

00:06:45.967 --> 00:06:48.161
Well, this is going to
be the same thing as

00:06:48.161 --> 00:06:49.809
900 divided by 9.

00:06:50.547 --> 00:06:52.332
Let me do that in the brown color.

00:06:52.932 --> 00:06:57.932
900 divided by 9 plus 63 divided by 9.

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:05.059
I just distributed the division by 9.

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:07.565
Let me put some parenthesis around this.

00:07:07.764 --> 00:07:09.556
What is this going to be equal to?

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.450
Well, 900 divided by 9 is 100.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.815
This is going to be 100,

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:19.054
and 63 divided by 9 is 7.

00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:23.130
This is going to be 100 plus 7,

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.973
or

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.028
100 and 7.

00:07:30.028 --> 00:07:32.188
Once again, I wrote it all out like this.

00:07:32.188 --> 00:07:33.593
Once you get some practice,

00:07:33.593 --> 00:07:37.993
you'll say hey look 9 goes
into 900 a hundred times.

00:07:37.993 --> 00:07:39.872
9 goes into 63 seven times.

00:07:39.872 --> 00:07:43.704
So, 9 goes into 963 one
hundred and 7 times.

00:07:43.704 --> 00:07:45.272
Hopefully you found that fun.

00:07:45.272 --> 00:07:47.186
This is useful stuff.

00:07:47.186 --> 00:07:48.844
One of the most important things you're

00:07:48.844 --> 00:07:49.821
going to have to find is that

00:07:49.821 --> 00:07:51.143
all the time you're going
to find these numbers

00:07:51.143 --> 00:07:52.964
while you're doing, you
know, your finances,

00:07:52.964 --> 00:07:55.624
or you're trying to calculate
the check at a restaurant.

00:07:55.624 --> 00:07:57.133
You're going to find it really valuable

00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:59.326
to be able to do this type of division.

00:07:59.326 --> 00:08:01.902
With some practice, even without paper.
