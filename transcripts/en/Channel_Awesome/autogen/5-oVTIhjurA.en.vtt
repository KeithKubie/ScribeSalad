sounds bizarre but like his hands

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:17.690
sounds bizarre but like his hands
 

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.930
sounds bizarre but like his hands
because you had what looked like his

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:19.940
because you had what looked like his
 

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.940
because you had what looked like his
normal hands which are the little the

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:21.950
normal hands which are the little the
 

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.130
normal hands which are the little the
orange fire but then you've had his

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:24.140
orange fire but then you've had his
 

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.880
orange fire but then you've had his
actual hand outside of that which is the

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:26.890
actual hand outside of that which is the
 

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:31.030
actual hand outside of that which is the
flame or whatever around the actual fire

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040
flame or whatever around the actual fire
