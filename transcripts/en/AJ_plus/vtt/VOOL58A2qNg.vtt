00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.240
The mobilized students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.100
have inspired the entire country.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.860
And while we wait on legislators

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.560
to pass meaningful gun control,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.840
*crickets*

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.620
*barn owl*

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.080
why not try to pass something else in the meantime

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.960
to show these students we care about them and their concerns?

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.560
Like lowering the voting age.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.260
Here’s why 16-year-olds voting could be good for democracy.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.300
Ever since a gunman killed 17 students with an AR-15 in Parkland, Florida,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.360
survivors have done a whole lot more

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.320
than think and pray.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.320
They have gone on national TV

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.960
and mobilized people around the country to protest

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.520
walk out, do sit-ins and die-ins,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.360
and even had the guts to confront their pro-gun Senator face to face:

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.580
“Senator Rubio,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.960
can you tell me right now

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.100
that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA in the future?”

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.740
*cheers*

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.720
He couldn’t.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.520
Unlike pretty much every other mass shooting,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.020
where Americans get shamed for talking about gun control

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.820
Until we forget it ever happened,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.340
these students are making sure the country does not forget about them.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.440
“How long do you think you will keep doing this?”

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.480
“We’re millennials and we love complaining more than any other generation.”

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.420
“This generation is used to getting answers right away.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.620
You think they’re gonna wait

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.640
for six months or a year

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.220
for anybody— congress or anybody

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.880
that needs to make the right call?”

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.820
Yea.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.020
In a way,

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020
youth impatience and entitlement

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.540
is paying off brilliantly.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.460
Think about it.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.760
These teens have never had to wait for an answer

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.920
they couldn’t immediately get from Google

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.060
while ordering a pizza from an app

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.460
and facetiming a crush in Oregon they made out with one time at summer camp.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.160
You think they have time to wait to get weapons of war out of their schools?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.940
Uh uh.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.940
To them, gun control should be

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.420
as easy as the Dominoes app.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.740
Hold the bump stocks,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.060
side of registries,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.700
hey you guys want extra background checks?

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.300
But because they’re just a bunch of kids with no political clout

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.300
some are wondering why they should be taken into consideration at all.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.000
Just listen to Florida lawmaker Elizabeth Porter

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.500
as she argued against the Parkland students’ demands for gun reform.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.100
“We’ve been told we need to listen to the children

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.760
and do what the children ask.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.860
Are there any children on this floor?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.040
Are there any children making laws?

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.700
Do we allow the children to tell us that we should pass a law that says ‘no homework’?

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.300
The adults make the laws

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.720
because we have the age,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.180
we has the wisdom,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.180
and we have the experience.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.040
Wait wait wait

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.000
We has the wisdom?!

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.740
Way to instill confidence.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.080
Trust us,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.080
we has wrotten the laws before

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.020
cause we

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.340
is the law-yers

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.880
and we are gonna brang you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.580
lawgislation

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.040
And the idea that teens can’t vote so who cares about them was echoed by

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.800
guy who was just told he can’t eat crayons anymore, Tucker Carlson.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.520
“So if they’re too young to buy guns why should they be making my gun laws?”

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.940
“They’re not making your gun laws--”

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.940
“They’re not citizens, they’re children.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.960
They’re not 18.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.140
They're Americans,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.220
but they don't have the full rights of citizenship because they’re not adults.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.180
They can’t drink alcohol, a lot of them can’t drive cars,

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.440
you don’t want them to buy guns and they can’t vote.”

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.800
Plus, everyone knows that bullets

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.740
can only hurt you when you turn 18 ...

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.880
You know, it’s amazing, where his empathy ends

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.880
is just where his stupidity begins.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.180
He truly is

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.740
a douchebag carousel.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.800
And yet he and Elizabeth-has-the-wisdom-Porter manage to bring up an interesting point.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.400
Most teens can’t vote.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.840
But they are old enough to be shot at and die,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.580
not to mention own rifles and shotguns in 30 states.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.560
So maybe the question is:

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.220
Should teens be able to vote?

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.740
Why not lower the voting age to 16?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.980
In most national elections around the world,

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.180
like in the U.S., you have to be 18 to vote.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.180
But in some countries, it is 16,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.180
including Austria, Brazil and Argentina.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.780
And in 2014 beginning with their vote on independence,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.860
Scotland began allowing 16-year-olds to vote

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.160
for the simple reason stated by this lawmaker:

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.380
“If we’re prepared to send people, young people, to the front line,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.120
and indeed to take their taxes,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.060
why should they not indeed have a say in what is basically about their future?”

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.640
And that makes sense.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.640
A lot of teens work and pay taxes.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.300
And the injustice of being able to fight in a war that you don't have a say in

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.700
is exactly why President Nixon signed the 26th amendment into law,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.640
which lowered the voting age from 21 to 18.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.920
And the sick reality is that today with the amount of school shootings,

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.360
it’s almost as if wars have come home.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.900
At least the weapons have.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.440
So why not lower the voting age again?

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.480
Three towns in Maryland have already allowed 16-year-olds to vote in local elections.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.480
And yet every time the debate crops up,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.720
you always hear the same arguments.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.220
“I know kids in this age group and they are dumb as dirt when it comes to politics.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.540
I wouldn’t put them in charge of their allowance.”

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.800
“I remember how I was at 16,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.960
I couldn't have voted for a dog catcher,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.780
I was so

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.580
naive.”

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.260
“Young people are stupid. Have you ever spoken to them?

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.940
If we let them vote,

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.420
they’re gonna vote for the party guy in the Hawaiian shirt.”

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.580
Sure,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.180
and when we let adults vote,

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.660
they vote for the guy in the baseball hat

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.060
who needs a cheat sheet to show sympathy.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.320
Remember, this is the generation that had to sit on the sidelines

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.580
as the country elected a corrupt reality TV star with no political experience.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.920
And if their parents couldn’t protect them from that,

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.760
why should they trust them to take care of them at all?

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.060
For all kids know,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.800
there *is* a monster living under their beds

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.880
and masturbating actually *improves* eyesight.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.780
Maybe part of the reason teens are seen as not caring about things that affect them

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.580
is that adults keep telling them they’re too stupid and too young to care about things that affect them.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.940
When the reality is, they do care.

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.100
Just ask this 17-year-old who campaigned to lower the voting age in San Francisco.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.540
“It really matters to me when funding for parks gets changed.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.160
It really matters to me when the minimum wage gets changed and that affects my community.”

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.720
Our country has a history of smart, politically active teens.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.460
Like in the 60s when teenagers and children marched in Birmingham to protest segregation.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.560
Or the 15-year-old who recently developed a system to detect early stages of pancreatic cancer.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.540
He explains why teens are ready to make change.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.080
“Teenagers we're at this epitome of creativity

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.840
where we can dream up wild ideas

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.400
but we have enough knowledge to make our ideas a reality.”

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.700
Yes, not to mention the knowledge

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.980
to make exquisite dishes every week on Master Chef Jr.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.820
“On top you will see the puff pastry,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.120
and then under that you’ll see the crepe,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.840
and then you’ll see the mushroom duxelle,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200
the prosciutto,

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.280
and then the meat.”

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.100
OK,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.100
but I make a mean

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.340
bag of Trader Joe’s Gyoza...

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.720
I cook

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.440
By the way

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:09.760
not only is the discussion about lowering the voting age patronizing and stacked against teens,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.480
but those who vote on whether or not to lower the voting age

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.480
are already of voting age.

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.960
Which is a cruel Catch 22.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.780
And also makes you wonder who in these 30 states

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.480
voted for the age of consent to be 16?

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.020
I’m gonna go out on a limb and guess not 16 year olds.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.400
And having teens vote might mean good things for democracy.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.640
Studies show voter turnout is habitual,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.440
so perhaps the earlier you get someone to vote, the more likely they will later on.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.800
One study even showed that when young people vote, their parents are more likely to vote too.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.060
In some ways, teens might be more equipped to vote than adults.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.960
Think about it:

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.720
they just went through the unit on how a bill becomes a law

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.440
whereas their Gam Gam just went through a red light.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.140
It makes sense that entrenched political power would be afraid of the youth vote.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.860
Because young people tend to be open-minded and vote liberal.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:57.540
It’s that crazy thing they have …

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:58.140
what’s it called?

00:07:58.720 --> 00:07:59.320
Hope.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.880
Polling and voting trends suggest that if 16-year-olds in the UK had been allowed to vote

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.560
whether to exit the EU,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.600
Brexit wouldn’t have happened.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And in the 2016 U.S. primary election,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.440
more than 2 million voters under 30 voted for Bernie Sanders.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.680
That’s more youth votes in the primary than Clinton and Trump received combined.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.300
Bernie woulda won

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.540
Yet we shouldn’t assume that all young people are necessarily liberal.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.000
In Kansas six teenagers are running for governor,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.620
because they were smart enough to figure out that the dumb adults who wrote the laws

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.060
didn’t write in an age minimum to run.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.440
And only one is running as a democrat.

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.240
The deep-state globalist shill.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.700
No matter what side of the political spectrum they’re on,

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.500
the one thing all teens have

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.440
— that adults lack —

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.220
is the ability to not give a f*ck about authority.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.640
“One of the best things about our generation,

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.280
sure, people think we’re lazy and on our phones all the time.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.720
We don’t respect you just ‘cause you have Senator in front of your name.”

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.900
And that’s really helpful in pointing out the bullsh*t around things like gun laws.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.440
“What do you think about this idea of arming teachers?”

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.700
“It’s stupid.”

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.680
“Why?”

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.220
“Douglas ran out of paper for like two weeks in the school year,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.400
and now all of a sudden they have $400 million

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:11.500
to pay for teachers to get trained to arm themselves?

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.580
Really?”

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:14.780
Really.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.540
Teens are the realest.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.540
And considering the world they've been handed —

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.620
with massive inequality,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.800
rising sea levels,

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.020
and a president who the NRA spent $30 million to elect,

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:28.860
perhaps we should make it easier for them to have a say in the world they’re supposed to inherit.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.180
“To all of the generations before us,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:33.180
we sincerely accept your apology,

00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.700
and we appreciate that you’re willing to let us rebuild

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.260
the world that you f*cked up.”

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.260
Mm.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:44.440
So if conservatives are so upset by teens in the streets demanding their rights,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.700
give them the right to vote.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.060
And if they manage to pass laws banning AR-15s

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.220
or banning homework, more power to them.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.780
Cause it will have meant that in a way,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.300
they did their homework.
