00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.470
I'm really, really happy to
be here with you guys today.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.380
It's really exciting.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.850
We have a lot of fantastic
material for you,

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.390
all focused on what
we're doing with Chrome

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.230
and what we can do to try
to make the web much better,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.309
especially on mobile.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.240
Let's get right to it.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.930
So at I/O earlier
this year, we got

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.495
to announce that we have 300
million Chrome on mobile users.

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:24.245
This is fantastic.

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:28.180
It actually represents a 10x
growth over a year earlier.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.246
I think Chrome is actually
relatively new on mobile.

00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:34.120
Today, I'm really, really
pleased to announce

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.860
that we have 400 million
users of Chrome on mobile.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.740
This is fantastic.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.160
Just in the last
four months we've

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.580
seen this kind of
spectacular growth.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.190
I think this is really, really
fantastic, not just because I'm

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.564
working on Chrome
and want to see

00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:49.270
it be successful, but also what
it means for the mobile web.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.060
I think a lot of times
developers struggle

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.120
with trying to reach users
through browsers that are old,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.100
not updating-- and
there's just a lot

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.120
of disparity across
the mobile web,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.975
and across the mobile ecosystem
of the types of browsers

00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:03.060
that are out there.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.030
So as we get Chrome
out there more,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.650
developers can start to count
on a more consistent web

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.040
platform, a more modern
web platform, one that's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.590
auto updating, one that's fast
and it's getting improved.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.490
I think this is
fantastic for what

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.410
it means to web
developers trying

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.315
to reach users through browsers.

00:01:27.416 --> 00:01:29.630
Anyway, so in addition
to just trying

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.420
to reach users through browsers,
a lot of web developers

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.520
are looking at trying to reach
users through native apps,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.410
obviously, and using
web tech in native apps.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.900
And for a long time, they
struggled with the fact

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.500
that the WebViews are old.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.510
And as of Lollipop,
I'm really, really

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.690
pleased to announce
that we have support

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.120
for auto updating WebView.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.030
This is fantastic.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.184
It means that for
the first time--

00:01:52.184 --> 00:01:56.360
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.290
This was a long time
coming to be honest.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.970
I think it was
two I/Os ago where

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.975
we were talking about how badly
we wanted to get this done.

00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:06.100
Getting it to a place where,
when we update Chrome,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.002
we can also update
WebView, is fantastic.

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:09.710
I think you all
understand this, but just

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.168
having a consistent
modern platform

00:02:11.168 --> 00:02:13.280
that you can take
advantage of, both

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.880
when deploying over the web,
as well as through native apps,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.510
is huge.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.040
I think that a lot
of times people

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.000
take for granted that they
have a modern web platform.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.916
That's sort of
the mindset people

00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:28.540
are in when they're
focused on desktop,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.123
but it hasn't been
the case on mobile.

00:02:30.123 --> 00:02:33.620
So getting to a place where it
is, it's a huge accomplishment.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.030
Now we have been very
busy over the past year.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.180
This is a set of
features that we've

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.680
been working on that have
all land in the last year,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.390
and a whole lot
of different work

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.470
that's gone in to make Chrome
and the web platform better.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.940
We've been working with
other browser vendors

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.580
to bring a lot of
new features-- things

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.705
that improve the capabilities
that you get access to,

00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:52.330
things that allow
you to take advantage

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
of mobile, simple
things like Screen

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.490
Orientation and
the ability to lock

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.434
the orientation of the screen
to portrait or landscape.

00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:01.850
These things go a
long way to help

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.530
you deliver a great
experience to the web.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.890
But also features that allow
you to have a much better time

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.420
creating a good user experience,
a good performant user

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.210
experience-- simple things like
the will-change attribute that

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.370
lets you inform the
engine that, hey, this

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.490
is the kind of animation
I'll be making,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.140
allows the engine to make a
lot of optimizations for you.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.890
But that's not it.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.348
There's a lot of
other things here.

00:03:24.348 --> 00:03:26.860
Features like Web Animations
that give developers a lot more

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.780
control over the
animation system,

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.140
rather than forcing you to
cobble together CSS strings

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.706
to generate the kind
of animations you want.

00:03:35.706 --> 00:03:38.950
We've also put a lot
of work over many years

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.980
to build up a set of features
that powers web components--

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.450
things like Custom Elements,
HTML Imports, and Shadow DOM.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.410
And all these things are
now shipping natively

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.290
in Chrome, which is just
fantastic because it means

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.410
as you're using
toolkits like Polymer,

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.817
or just other toolkits that
leverage web components,

00:03:54.817 --> 00:03:56.400
you're getting a
native implementation

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.569
of those features.

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.110
It's too many things
to mention here.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.850
I'll just say, in
addition to features,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.950
we've been very
focused on performance.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.730
Optimizing the engine,
improving performance

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.400
reducing CPU load,
et cetera-- these

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.650
are things that are just
very important for developers

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.760
who are trying to create
a great experience.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.329
One feature I really
want to call attention to

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.000
is something that we actually
removed from the platform

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.010
a little under year ago.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.290
It used to be that when the
user would tap on the browser,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.010
there would be a 300 millisecond
delay, while the browser was

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.110
trying to figure out-- did the
user mean to click on a link,

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.960
or are they trying to
zoom, et cetera-- removing

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.450
this allowed
developers to have much

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.930
more control over
animations to be

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.870
able to provide much
smoother experiences.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.046
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:45.046 --> 00:04:46.980
Yes, this one deserves
a round of applause.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.910
It was actually a heroic
effort to get there,

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.086
but it's fantastic that we
can now take for granted

00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:54.120
that you don't have it.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.734
So with all this great
work that's happening,

00:04:56.734 --> 00:04:58.400
it seems like the
mobile web is awesome.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.899
Right?

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:02.370
Well, well, you
commonly hear this meme.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.300
The stories are rolling
out all the time about,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.954
native apps killing
the mobile web,

00:05:06.954 --> 00:05:08.370
the demise of the
mobile web seems

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.314
imminent-- shouldn't we all
just be writing native apps?

00:05:12.314 --> 00:05:13.730
Well I think the
story is actually

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.270
a bit more nuanced than
that-- a bit more interesting,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.090
if you dig down.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.040
And we think there's actually a
lot of value to the mobile web,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.300
if you start to
explore it further.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.030
There were some studies
earlier in the year by Flurry

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.650
that showed that
time spent on mobile

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.640
is actually heavily biased
towards native apps,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.659
and very little
time spent on sites.

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:39.700
But you have to sort of
explore this a little bit

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.870
further to see what's
really going on.

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.870
In fact, the time
spent in native apps

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.030
is dominated by activities
like gaming, entertainment,

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.430
and social.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.270
And time spent with
other activities-- well,

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.020
it's much smaller.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.470
So that's only part
of the picture.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.330
And indeed, if you look
further at the time spent

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.895
on the mobile, actually that
vast majority of time that

00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:06.560
was spent in native
apps, it's really

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.110
dominated by just
a few native apps.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.991
And as a developer
trying to reach users,

00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:14.240
writing a native app doesn't
mean that suddenly you're

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.080
getting a lot more attention.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.030
In fact I'd argue
that, in many ways,

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.857
it's easier to get
attention if you're

00:06:19.857 --> 00:06:20.940
deploying through the web.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.780
In fact, if you're
specifically going

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.000
after commercial activity,
and you talk to users,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.270
and you say, how do they use
their mobile devices when

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.330
they're interested in shopping,
or e-commerce type activities--

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.540
users resoundingly talk
about how they use the web.

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:42.780
And this kind of makes sense.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.350
You think about it--
how many store apps

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.840
do you actually install?

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.630
Well you might have installed,
say, the Amazon app,

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.527
but actually when
you're going shopping,

00:06:51.527 --> 00:06:53.360
you want to do a lot
of comparison shopping.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.590
You're going to do
searches, and so on, and be

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:58.030
looking for best prices,
or doing comparison

00:06:58.030 --> 00:06:59.960
shopping across different sites.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.072
And actually, the web
is really good at this.

00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:05.030
And indeed it's actually
really good at helping

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.880
users find interesting things.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.790
And as a developer
trying to reach users

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.140
and-- there's just
a lot of power here.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.742
So what makes the web
ideal for success?

00:07:18.742 --> 00:07:20.200
There's a lot of
things, and I want

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.200
to get into that a
little bit further.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.120
I think one of the
biggest things--

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.390
this is very obvious, really.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.080
It's just that when you
put things on the web,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.580
there's a lot of
tools that help you

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.079
make your content, your
apps, discoverable.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:37.120
There's a lot of great
tools-- obviously, Search.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.040
You work at Google.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.640
Search engine is a
very powerful tool

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.450
that can drive
traffic to websites.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.980
Ads can drive
traffic to websites,

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.020
social media can drive
traffic to websites.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.440
A lot of this is powered by
URLs, and the indexability

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.530
of content, and all
of the great tools

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.360
that are available
for SEO, and so on.

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.140
These things enable users
to easily find things.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.190
They can also
easily share things.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.120
And it's not just your
application or the entry point

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.720
to your website, but it's deep
linking into your websites.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.090
Particular pieces of
content or particular states

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:14.210
of applications-- developers
have an easy time presenting

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.390
these things as URLs, and
users have an easy time

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:18.410
sharing them and
discovering them.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.090
This is actually a very powerful
feature of the web platform.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:24.860
It's a fantastic way to
deploy stuff, and get it

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.524
in front of users.

00:08:27.524 --> 00:08:28.940
When the web
platform, in addition

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.840
to having that discoverability
and that reach,

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.590
it's actually a very,
very comforting to a user

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.409
if they're given a URL.

00:08:37.409 --> 00:08:40.970
Clicking on a URL feels
like a very safe action.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.280
It's not scary to someone.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:46.290
Whereas installing a native
app, it's a bit scary.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.040
It can be.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.390
You're not sure-- what
are you giving up?

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.140
You're accepting a
battery of permissions,

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.090
and so you can
imagine a lot of users

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.130
feel a little bit
unsure about that.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:58.840
But with the URL to a site,
it's actually very safe.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.840
It feels safe.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.340
There's a history of
browsers doing a good job

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.210
protecting users.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:07.890
But all of this really
leads up to the big benefit

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.820
of the web, which I think
is that it's a fantastically

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:13.620
low friction way for users
to connect with developers,

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.890
for developers to get
user experiences in front

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:19.530
of customers.

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.500
The web is this
ephemeral platform.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.420
There's no install prompts.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.830
It's very easy for folks to
find things through search,

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:30.660
through ads, through tweets,
and social media and such,

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.810
and end up right
there on a site,

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:35.650
on a page, where they
could buy something,

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.250
or where they can
complete some transaction,

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.816
or they can do something that
they're interested in doing.

00:09:40.816 --> 00:09:42.940
So there's a lot of upside
if we can get to a place

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:46.200
where you can create great
experiences on the web

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.570
because there's all this
fantastic environment that

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:52.970
can maximize what you
can get out of it.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.500
So that's all very exciting.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.950
Like I said, there's
a lot more that we

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.170
need to do because in this
day and age people are

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.540
very excited about native apps.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.460
The web itself has
been this platform

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.990
that hasn't worked
great on mobile.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.590
Everybody's pretty
aware of these problems.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:14.180
There's a variety of problems,
from performance problems,

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.160
to hard to take advantage
of mobile devices and create

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.186
great experiences, to frustrated
with buggy browsers and such.

00:10:23.186 --> 00:10:24.560
So there's a lot
of work that has

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.712
to be done to make the
environment better,

00:10:26.712 --> 00:10:29.170
but we're getting there, and
there's a lot that were doing.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.045
So I want to talk about
some of those things.

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.470
But first off, this
summit's mostly about Chrome

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.440
and what the Chrome
team 's doing.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.410
Google Search, just
yesterday, rolled out

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.270
a really exciting
feature, which is

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.410
they are starting
to badge websites,

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.330
in search results, that
are mobile friendly.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.590
This is all something that
you can explore further

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.750
through Webmaster Tools.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:54.521
You can see the
validation tool that

00:10:54.521 --> 00:10:57.020
helps you understand if your
site is mobile-friendly, and so

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:57.610
on.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:59.750
But this is all about
helping users understand

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.860
that if they're going to
follow a search result,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.595
they're going to end up on
a site that actually works

00:11:04.595 --> 00:11:06.470
or should work on their
mobile device, that's

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:07.380
not going to flash.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.200
It's not going to be
a desktop, or InSight.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.320
It's not going to have
very small text, et cetera.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.830
I think this is a very useful
tool for both developers

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:16.940
and users.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.740
And so I'm really
excited about it.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.790
On Chrome's side,
our goal is really

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.120
about helping developers
be more productive.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:30.200
And to do that, we have a long
history of, for example, making

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.920
better developer tools.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.877
The DevTools has been
a fantastic project.

00:11:34.877 --> 00:11:36.460
You're going to get
to hear a lot more

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.590
about that later today.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.970
We have done a lot
of work to help

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:45.590
you use DevTools on desktop
to explore how your site works

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.990
on mobile devices,
which is very useful.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.350
And a lot of work's gone
into helping you understand

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.960
animation performance,
and so on.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.460
You can learn a lot more
about that later today.

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.060
We've also been
doing a lot of work

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:02.540
on toolkits, and things
like web fundamentals

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.720
to help folks get started,
and orient themselves,

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.530
and understand how to
optimize for mobile.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.780
I'm very excited about Polymer
as a great reference toolkit

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:15.340
for how to build
fantastic websites that

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.160
run well on mobile.

00:12:18.895 --> 00:12:21.020
You'll hear more about
Polymer if you don't already

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:23.410
know about it, but
it's our expression

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:27.530
of what we think a
great framework can be.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:29.060
In addition to
productivity, we're

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:30.930
working a lot to make
the engines faster,

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.687
and to help developers create
more performant websites.

00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:36.020
We know that this is the thing
that folks struggle with.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.340
The engines haven't always
been tuned for mobile.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.670
They weren't designed
for mobile originally.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.310
And so we've spent a
lot of time just working

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.940
on core rendering performance.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:48.780
A lot of this is about
optimizing existing code pass,

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.390
but moving workloads to GPUs.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:55.180
So we're rolling out
GPU rasterization, which

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:58.715
is really fantastic--
allows for web developers

00:12:58.715 --> 00:13:01.660
to take full advantage
of the more capable GPUs

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.840
that you find on mobile devices,
and relieve the CPUs of all

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.435
the burden, and in doing so,
reduce power consumption,

00:13:07.435 --> 00:13:08.130
and so on.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.980
So there's a lot that
can be done there.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.813
Ryan's going to talk
more about performance.

00:13:11.813 --> 00:13:14.544
A lot of work going
into V8, et cetera.

00:13:14.544 --> 00:13:16.460
But in addition to just
optimizing the engine,

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:19.400
we also want to do feature
work that allows developers

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.800
to have a lot more control over
the platform, and, in doing so,

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.840
be able to have more
control over where

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:27.910
the expensive things
happen, and when they happen

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:34.900
and-- for example, when it comes
to network resource loading,

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:36.750
developers often
struggle with the fact

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:40.740
that the browser sort of feels
like it's out of your control.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.050
If there's a network
error, suddenly the user

00:13:43.050 --> 00:13:44.680
sees a browser error page.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.290
It's not a great experience.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:47.790
With a service
worker API that we're

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:50.274
going to talk a lot more
about, among other things,

00:13:50.274 --> 00:13:52.690
you actually do get the control
over the network fetching,

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.398
and network resource
loading and caching.

00:13:54.398 --> 00:13:58.430
It allows for developers to
cope better with poor network

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.440
conditions, and so
on, but also allows

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.430
them to guarantee that when
your application starts up,

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:06.010
it actually loads quickly
and reliably fast,

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.460
assuming you've had a chance
to populate your caches,

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:09.810
which is great.

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:12.630
I'm very excited about
that because it really

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.070
is one of these things
that often developers

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:18.230
suffer when they're thinking
about deploying over the web

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.160
and over potentially
poor network connections

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.060
that people often have
to deal with with mobile.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:26.440
So anyways, in addition
to all of that,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.970
we're trying to help
developers provide

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.340
a much more engaging
experience on mobile.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.650
And here's where we're doing
some really exciting things,

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.050
exploring how to,
for example, allow

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.060
you to integrate the web
experience deeper into Android

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.886
and allow it to feel like a more
first class part of the system.

00:14:43.886 --> 00:14:47.670
And a while back, we rolled out
support for Add To Home Screen.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.360
But we're working
on exploring how

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.920
to elevate Add To Home Screen
so that users discover it

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.176
more readily, under
the right conditions.

00:14:56.176 --> 00:14:57.800
I think this is a
very important thing.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.520
I think a lot of developers are
interested in the re engagement

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.645
that happens when you have
a home screen placement.

00:15:02.645 --> 00:15:04.420
And this is
something that's been

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.660
difficult to achieve on the
web, unless users really

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:09.950
knew what they were doing
and went looking for it.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.970
In Lollipop, we
rolled out support

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.890
for exploding and
moving the tabs

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:17.020
of the browser out
into the Recents view,

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.670
so that web content
rendered through Chrome

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.820
would actually appear as a
peer to native applications.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:26.430
This is huge because it
allows a web developer to feel

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.680
like their experience is not
trapped within a browser,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:33.840
but rather it's a first
class experience on Android.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.610
And though these screenshots
don't really show it,

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.490
the one on the right
emphasizes that you actually

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.464
get a lot more control
over the theming.

00:15:41.464 --> 00:15:43.130
And in addition to
theming, you actually

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.120
get a lot more control
over the iconography.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.610
One of our goals with
this whole user experience

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:50.000
here was to try to put
Chrome in the background,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.550
and let the content
take the stage.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:58.540
It's really important
that-- we feel that users,

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.430
they think deeply about
interacting with sites--

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:02.459
not Chrome.

00:16:02.459 --> 00:16:04.000
It's important for
them to understand

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.280
that they're working with
food.com-- not Chrome.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:11.460
And so we've done a lot with
the system UI, and Chrome's UI,

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.970
to try to help put
the content first,

00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:15.740
help put the web
applications first.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.610
And so a lot of this
work that you see here

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.920
is an effort towards that.

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.390
In addition, there's also
a lot of work going on

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.750
with capabilities.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.840
And I already mentioned
service worker,

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.060
and how it can help
solve for offline,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.150
and solve for poor
network connections.

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.159
That's just a
fundamental thing that's

00:16:34.159 --> 00:16:35.450
been missing from the platform.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:38.220
We've had app cache, but it's
so limited and hard to use.

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.486
Service worker is
much easier to use.

00:16:40.486 --> 00:16:41.860
On the back of
service worker, we

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.360
can do a lot of
fantastic things though.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.020
We can solve finally for
background processing.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.430
We can enable developers to
update their caches of content

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.260
and code in the background, so
that when the user interacts

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.310
with the site again,
they're getting not just

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.117
cached content, but they're
getting fresh cached content.

00:17:01.117 --> 00:17:03.200
And you as a developer can
have control over that.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.410
This is something that's
under development.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.819
It's not done yet, but we're
very excited about enabling

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:12.450
background processing on mobile
for web content delivered

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:14.180
through the browser.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.180
Push notifications is
something that we can also

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:19.500
start to build on top
of the ServiceWorker.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:23.770
And it's something that
we're close to launching.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:28.210
And it's very exciting to
enable developers to have access

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.540
to push notifications
because it allows for, again,

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.370
another form of re engagement.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.620
One of the things we're doing
is being very thoughtful

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.240
though about how we keep users
in control of the experience.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.920
I think that's-- as
I mentioned earlier,

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.980
around safety and so on,
users want to feel like

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.730
they're in control
of the experience.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.960
We also want to figure out
how to allow developers

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:47.790
have a lot more power in
terms of the experience they

00:17:47.790 --> 00:17:49.440
can present.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.477
And as a browser,
as a user agent,

00:17:51.477 --> 00:17:53.060
we're actually in a
very good position

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.800
to do something
innovative there.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:01.830
So today's all about you
all connecting with us.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.330
We have a bunch of
Chrome developers

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:05.930
here to talk about the
work they're doing.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:09.380
As you saw, this talk was
very focused on mobile web,

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:11.400
and a lot of the sessions
are all jam-packed,

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.710
focused on mobile web.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.160
There's so much to talk
about and not enough time.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.960
There's plenty of
other material outside

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.740
of this context
and people here who

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.450
can help answer those questions.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:23.829
We will have booths, and
sessions, and panels tomorrow.

00:18:23.829 --> 00:18:26.370
And throughout the day, there's
lots of opportunities for you

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:28.786
to connect with developers--
really want to hear from you,

00:18:28.786 --> 00:18:31.170
hear what you care about.

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:36.020
Because ultimately we want to
help make you all successful.

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.970
So with that, I'm really
excited to see and learn

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.347
what you guys can create
on top of the platform

00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:45.180
that we're building.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.620
So thank you so much
for joining us today.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.560
It's an exciting day.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.050
I think there's so much
to learn and explore.

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:52.820
Thank you.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.394
