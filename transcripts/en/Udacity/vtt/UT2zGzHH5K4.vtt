00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.330
At this point, we've built
an application that got the latitude and

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.730
longitude of your device.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.939
Well done.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.080
Did you notice a difference between
this app and the one we created earlier?

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.030
This app just updated the lat-long once,
and then it left it at those values,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.470
whereas the previous one
updated the data periodically.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.860
Now what did we do
differently this time?

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.540
Take a look at the code and see.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.660
There's an important and distinct
difference between the two samples and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.770
learning what that is will help
you build better location apps.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.190
If you need a hint, take a look
in the unconnected override and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.190
you'll see the difference
between the two apps.
