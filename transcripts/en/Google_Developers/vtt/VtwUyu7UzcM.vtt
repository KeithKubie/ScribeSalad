Hi, I'm Lilli Thompson and I'm a Game Developer
Advocate with the Google Chrome team.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.830
Today, I'd like to talk to you about creating
cross platform games with PlayN.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.360
It's an exciting time to be a game developer.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.190
We have more opportunities to reach fans than
ever before: through smart phones, smart TVs,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.320
social networks, HTML5, and other awesome
new technology.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.360
But here's the challenge: as developers, we
see this opportunity and want to connect with

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.080
all those players, but reaching them is a
huge amount of work.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.620
In order to really get your game out there,
you have to create many different versions.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.499
One build for Android, another for iOS, another
for HTML5, still another for Flash users,

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.730
and so on for whatever platforms you want
to target.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.089
And that costs a huge amount of development
time, it's hard to maintain, and bottom line:

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.019
it's just no fun.

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.719
That's where PlayN comes in.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.460
PlayN is a Google open source project that
allows you take a single body of source code

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.890
and compile it into versions that run natively
as HTML5, Android, Java, or Flash.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.260
How does that work?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.610
You get the PlayN source code and write your
game using a core set of APIs that abstract

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.330
out platform-specific functionality.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.390
Then you take that platform-agnostic source
code, and with the press of a button, PlayN

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.140
can generate native versions for every platform
it supports.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.460
And that's really what PlayN is all about:
one game, one code base, many platforms.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.450
Get your game into the hands of users as efficiently
as possible, and have fun while you're doing

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.450
it.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.100
