Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.890
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Hi everyone.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.190
I hoped you enjoyed the concert.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.490
My name is Nick Brown [applause].

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.510
I didn't do anything
especial, it was all her.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.300
We're so pleased to
have Anne Sofie here

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.040
to spend some time with you all.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.170
Well, just I'll start off
with a couple of questions

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.700
and then we'll open
it up to all of you

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.360
and hopefully our colleagues
will join shortly.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.480
This is a very interesting
program, in terms of the mix

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.580
of contemporary popular
artists as well

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.610
as the earlier Renaissance
and Baroque music.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.240
Is this something new for you,
to mix up the types of music?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.340
Or have you been doing
it for a while?

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.050
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter: I mix
-- I frequently mix the composers

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.800
and the genres in my
concert programs

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.640
because I enjoy it very
much myself, and then I hope

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.620
that the audience does too.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.240
And there are plenty
of other singers

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.430
who put together different
types of more specialized --

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.470
I mean only Schubert or
only the German Romantics.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.680
So this is also always been my --

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.990
it's always given me a
lot of pleasure to mix,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.040
to vary the programs
and [inaudible] only

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.000
in English Renaissance music I
wouldn't even want to do that.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.010
So this is my little cook-up.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.580
And because the musicians
are so fabulous,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.660
they can play these
other types as well.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.270
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Wonderful.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.160
Can you tell us how you three
came to start working together?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.740
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter:
Oh, there they are.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.510
[ Applause ]

[ Inaudible Response ]

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.380
[ Background Conversations ]

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.400
Yes. Well, I have sung
quite a lot in Paris,

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.830
with the different [inaudible]
there, and Thomas lives in Paris.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.220
And so we met each other

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.030
for the first time five
years ago or something.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.950
And I noticed this young man,
how extremely talented he was.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.880
And he also liked to fool around

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.050
and then you know we
would do a pop song.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.350
And so I thought he's the guy.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:49.060
And I tell you that not every
lute player has such freedom

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.480
as you do, as Thomas does.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.740
And then we needed a third person.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.520
And I had never worked
with you before.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.790
But I think you said, and other
people said, to ask Jonathan Cohen.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.990
He's fantastic.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.440
So I did, and it turned out
that these two knew each other

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.740
really well.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.300
They love playing together.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.250
And Jonathan is a conductor,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.540
not only a keyboard
player and a cello player.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.840
He's also a conductor.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.490
That's what you do.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.790
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Cohen:
That's right [laughter].

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.780
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter:
Maybe more than [inaudible].

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.530
So anyway, you knew each other,
and it was the perfect combo.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.260
And I just love these guys.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.560
They are so wonderful.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.580
They're really such musicians
and such freedom and so nice.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.380 position:56%
And I wish we could -- I hope we
can do a lot more concerts together.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.680
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown:
Wonderful [inaudible].

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.700
Has there been a highlight
from this tour,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.840
in terms of a specific performance

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.750
or a specific venue or
a specific audience?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.070
Assuming that this is
the best, of course.

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter: We were
just talking about that [inaudible].

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.440
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Jonathan.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.740
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Cohen: Well, you
know when we go on tours,

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.040
especially as a keyboard player,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.980
you often have sometimes
very different instruments

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.280
in different places.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.230
I have to say tonight I really
enjoyed the fantastic harpsichord

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.530
and organ that we had here.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.720
So that was a real
highlight for me to be able

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.960
to play these instruments.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.980
&gt;&gt; Thomas Dunford Duration:
I loved all of them

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.280
and they were all different.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.580
This one was [inaudible].

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.470
But Philadelphia was fun.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.010
The first one was wow
[inaudible] they were all different

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.360
and there but I love them all.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.720
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Have you
two toured much in the US?

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.310
Separately I know you've
been in here,

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.920
in Washington recently and such.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.220
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Cohen: Yeah.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.370
I come to the US reasonably
regularly in different guises.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.610
I work a lot with the [foreign
accent] in Minnesota and come

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.440
to New York with my ensemble.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.940
[foreign accent] always
love coming to the US.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.810
The audiences are very friendlier.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.000
And I find people enjoy classical
music a lot here in the venues

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.040
that we come to, like
here, for example.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.340
It's great.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.950
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Are there
plans for the three of you

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.370
to tour further in the future?

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.170
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter: In
our heads, yes [laughter].

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.090
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Wonderful.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.770
What for Anne Sofie --
what is an important thing

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.580 position:56%
that you hope US audiences gain
from the Nordic music that you share

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.990
when you perform over here?

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.380
Because I think a lot
of the composers aren't

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.190
so familiar to us over here.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.490
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter: Nordic.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.180
You mean when I do other
recitals with Nordic music?

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.930
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Yeah.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.970
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter:
Well, Nordic music,

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.770
a lot of it is extremely
beautiful and has a certain --

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.330
its own character and
the text and everything.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.750
Of course, Swedish
is my own language,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.750
but the songs are exceptionally
good.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.060
Grieg, the Norwegian
composer, Grieg, Sibelius.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.750
And Sweden doesn't have
a big name like that,

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.820
but we have I don't know five,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.730
10 different fantastic
[inaudible] composers.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.340
So I almost always include
them in my programs,

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.950
and I know that the audience
really take them to heart.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.270
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Wonderful.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.570
Thank you.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.800 position:56%
I think we'll just switch it over
to ask -- you can ask questions now.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.410
If you could just raise your hand
and wait for a microphone to come

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.100
to you that would be great.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.850
You all didn't have a drink before,
did you [inaudible] [laughter]?

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.430
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie, you did an
album with Elvis Costello.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.590
What was that like?

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.300
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter: Well,
Elvis is a really fantastic guy.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.100
He's got so much experience.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:48.340 position:56%
He's really, really clever and is a
very creative person, as you know --

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.910
anyone who knows Elvis Costello.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.170
I mean he does all kinds of
things and plays and sings

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.760
with all different kinds of people.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.030
And he's just written
a fantastic book.

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.230
So it was a great pleasure
to work with him.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:07.100
We had got to know each other
several years before we recorded,

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.000
so I really felt that this
was someone I could trust.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.990 position:56%
And he'd been to many, many concerts

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.370
at different classical
music that I'd sung.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.730
And we started discussing what
kind of pop music I liked and why.

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.930
And why I didn't like other kinds.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.370
So it was sent in cassettes.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.390
This was the day of the cassettes,
so it sent back and forth.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.950
So all in all it was a
very wonderful experience

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:38.950 position:56%
and he really knew what he was
doing, doing this you know he had --

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.890
the putting my voice
in the right context

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:46.030
and choosing the good songs
for the disc together.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.810

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.730
My microphone runner
disappeared but [inaudible] --

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.900
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: So I actually
have a question for all of you.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.690
Is there some decent music
that -- is that better?

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:07.000
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.290
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker: I had
a question for all of you.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:11.590
Is there some piece of music

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.730
that you have really
always wanted to perform?

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:18.440
Or perhaps a role Anne Sofie
that you have always wanted to do

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.450
but it hasn't yet come to fruition?

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.010

done most of the things I wanted to.

And there are few things that I
would like to do but which are not

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:43.390

you know I've had such a wonderful
career doing the kinds amazing roles

conductors, so I can't even say

00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.850
at the time I'm happy
or bitter or anything.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:10.520
I'm doing now contemporary or
[inaudible] I used to because well,

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:20.170
the composers will maybe write
with me in mind, which is nice.

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:27.310
[Inaudible] and I'm doing a Finnish
opera in [inaudible] opera, right?

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:38.510

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:30.340
of early Baroque German music.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.510
I haven't done so much of that
and I think it's fantastic.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:37.840
So lots of things yet
to do for me but --

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.140
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter: You're
both so young [laughter].

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:44.160
I have -- may I ask a question?

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.050
How come you don't chew [phonetic]
all the time during the concert

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.830
because I've done some concerts
with [foreign names] lute before.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:55.910
There's a [making lute sound]
several times during the concert.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.000
It takes a quite a
long time every time.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.340
Now, you have not done this
once, I don't think [laughter].

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.690
And so I wondered is it because
your lute is so well built

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:14.220
that it keeps its tuning?

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:19.490
Or do you play a little -- you know
you change where your finger is

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:23.400
so then -- because you can hear
I need to play a little higher.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.110
How come?

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:26.410
&gt;&gt; Thomas Dunford Duration:
It's technology.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:31.950
No. It's just because 300
years ago we used gut strings.

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.760
And they were very good at making
gut strings, especially for lutes.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.850
And they were specific and
really great and kept the tuning.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.590
But it was an art, so
like Stradivarius' process

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.410
for making wood with violin.

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:48.660
It was very -- a real art
that's been a bit lost.

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.360
And I'm not very satisfied with
the sound of gut strings now

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:54.960
because it's all made
in factories and stuff

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:58.560
so it doesn't sound as,
on the lute, as nice.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.390
So I just used synthetic strings,
which most lute players use

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:06.380
because if you'd go on
tour San Francisco to --

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.950
from LA to Washington and every
day go in different places.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.410
And you guys would spend your
life listening to tuning.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.710
It'd be really boring.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.490
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter: So
it's because of the strings.

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.050
&gt;&gt; Thomas Dunford Duration:
The strings are good.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.500
And when you change
them, it moves a bit.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.500
But then it settles down,
and it doesn't move too much.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:25.800
Yeah.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.100
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter:

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:28.400
I also would like to know how
long can you play on this lute?

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.130
It looks like it's been quite used
a lot, a little wear and tear.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:37.150
And do you use it -- is there a
moment when the lute has had enough

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.860
and you have to throw it away?

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:43.900
Or do you then renovate
it and put on new polish

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:47.220
and change a few things,
and then it's good as new?

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:48.800
&gt;&gt; Thomas Dunford Duration:
Well, I really love this lute.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.060
I had it when I was 14.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.460
And I've been playing it all the
time since -- when I first got it.

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.430
Wow. This thing's got a
resonance and it was amazing.

00:12:58.430 --> 00:13:00.470
It was a young wow.

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:02.960
Now it's an old guy
who's seen the world,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.500
and I really love him,
as he's still great.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.480
Love it. But he's dying.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.640
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter:
Is that a fact?

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.940
&gt;&gt; Thomas Dunford Duration: No.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:17.740
But he -- you know like
the table is really used.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.980 position:56%
That it's been hit, and it doesn't
have the same youth it used to have.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.600
And lutes are -- it's very fragile.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.920
So they tend to -- I
hope he doesn't die soon.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.230
So I'm going to do everything
I can to take care of this,

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.420
but I've been playing
too much all over --

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:34.990
like on beaches and
wrong places [laughter].

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:37.500
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter:
So that's what I mean.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.580
I mean you would never stop
using a cello or a violin.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.140
You would give it to the
whatever it's called,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.070
the shop where they
make good as new, right?

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:47.580
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Cohen: He was
practicing in Central Park

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.990
in New York a couple of days ago.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:51.290
Just under a tree.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:52.590
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Did you
make any money [inaudible]?

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.510
&gt;&gt; Thomas Dunford Duration: No.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:58.710
[ Laughter ]

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:00.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: A question
following up on that for Anne Sofie.

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:05.120
How have you noticed your voice
evolve throughout your career

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.800
and have you done anything
specific to kind of --

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.910
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter: Well, I
work very hard now that I'm older.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:16.450
I've always been quite disciplined
but never as disciplined as now.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.880
I can tell you, if I wouldn't
practice and keep my voice --

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:24.320
work very hard with it -- I
would have to retire immediately

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.380
because at my age the
voice really wants to be

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.680
like the rest of the
body [inaudible].

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:34.850
So you have to hold it up,
up, up, up, up [laughter].

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:36.150
It's true.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.450
I'm not fibbing.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:43.360
This is very -- I mean if I just
let it go, it goes wow, wow, wow.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:49.330
So to be able to sing Baroque
music and straight tones

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:54.610
and [inaudible] it's
just very hard work.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:15:00.710
You have to be very -- you have
to think about what you're doing.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.010
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: How does your
warm-up differ from a program

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.940
like this versus the
Mahler that you performed

00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:08.450
at the Kennedy Center
a few weeks ago?

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.750
Or is it the same?

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.610
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter: Well,
for Mahler Third Symphony,

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:16.550
which I did a week ago with
a wonderful orchestra here

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.040
and Christoph Eschenbach.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.090
It was a huge experience.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:24.240
It was very intense and I loved it.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:30.830
But to prepare for that the
instrument is bigger, so to speak,

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:40.230
and I need to warm up in a bigger
way because I sing differently.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.220
So I still need to warm up.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:46.120
Of course, for this but
then when I go out on stage,

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.900 position:56%
I sing in a much more contained way.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.870
The warming up itself
is not so different.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.140
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Any
other audience questions?

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.940
Yep. One second.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:02.580
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.880
&gt;&gt; Audience Speaker:
I was very pleased

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.180
to hear you mention Eva Cassidy.

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:09.130
And I was just curious to know how
you came to discover her music?

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.660
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter:
Yeah, Eva Cassidy --

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.440
I wonder if her friend didn't say
have you heard of Eva Cassidy?

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.430
I think so.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:24.780
And then I was hunting around
for Simon and Garfunkel songs,

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.240
and on Spotify, her name came up.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.540
And I recognized the name.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.680
And I listened and
then it's so beautiful,

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.710
and I went out to buy a disc.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:40.200
But I, and most of the world,
didn't know who she was

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.640
when she was still alive.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.580
Apparently she really wasn't
famous outside Washington.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:51.500
And then somebody did
put together some songs

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.740
or made a program about her.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:58.830
And then she -- you know people
heard how beautifully she sang.

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:02.490
But she didn't -- she had a --
you know she [inaudible] so much

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:07.340
in a much tougher way, but she
really knew how to use her voice.

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:10.790
It's very sad that
she died so early.

00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.140
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Time
for one more question.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:18:07.370
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.670
&gt;&gt; Anne Sofie von Otter:
Music education

00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.490
in Sweden is terrible [laughter].

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:15.340
It really, really is.

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:21.910
I mean at least, if you're
thinking classical music,

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:27.360
musical education [inaudible]
in a broader sense why this is.

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:31.050
But a lot of people still sing
in choirs, all different kinds

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:40.860 position:56%
of choirs, and so -- but [inaudible]
phenomenon is still is incredible.

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.310
I mean there are so many.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:46.100
It's not just [inaudible]
somebody called the red one,

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:49.350
and my son's trying
to do the same thing.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:56.900
So this is now a kind of -- I
guess we all learn from each other.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.500
But no, unfortunately the
music education, I think,

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.140
in most countries but maybe
not in France or in Germany

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.570
but in most other countries --

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.870
&gt;&gt; Jonathan Cohen: Yeah.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:11.960
Well, in England, there's a big
campaign at the moment to try

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:15.860
to get music much more in
schools for kids and for everyone

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:17.420
when they're young to do it.

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.850
And I think it's so important
because if you have familiarity

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:26.670
with that in your youth,
then that's a real pleasure

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:27.970
to be able to do that your life.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:30.910
Whether you do it professionally
or not and maybe the audience

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:32.690
of the future, you
know it's important.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.300
You know, it's important, I think,
so important that kids [inaudible]

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.450
to music even if they don't want
to do anything after a while.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:41.750
That they should be given
the chance, so important.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:43.050
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: In France?

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.350
&gt;&gt; Thomas Dunford Duration: Yeah.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.650
It was good.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:53.290
But the thing is when you learn
in a conservatory or anything,

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.500
there intends to be something very
rigid about the way of learning

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.040
about -- this is harmony.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:03.280
You have to learn four, four
and three, three, and you forget

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.780
about five, seven,
Indian music, jazz,

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.080
improvisation, and all this stuff.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.830
And they tend to have
this thing of schools.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.130
We are the best school.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.240
You have to stay in
school and study here.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:18.160
But actually music -- the best
experiences is playing with people.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.640
And that's how I learned even more.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.050
It's good for giving a basis,

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.140
but I think schools don't
do everything as well.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.330
It's also experience.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:28.630

&gt;&gt; Thomas Dunford Duration: So --
but I was very lucky in France.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.150
They have good systems for that
where you can go to class half-time

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:34.780
and conservatory half-time.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.930
And you get to meet young
guys who play saxophone

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:40.300
and teach you jazz, and it's great.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.600
