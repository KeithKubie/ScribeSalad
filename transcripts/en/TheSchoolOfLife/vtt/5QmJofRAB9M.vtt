00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
 

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.700
We may not be used to think ourselves in these terms,

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:10.760
but the labels romantic and classical usefully bring into focus some of the central themes of our personalities,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.240
and help us to gain clearer sense of who we and other people are.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.940
These are some of the things that divide romantic from classical personalities:

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.740
Romantics relish things that seem slightly to defy rational explanations.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.540
They're enthusiastic about feelings and wary of the intellect as a guide to life.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.060
They believe one shouldn’t always think too much.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.880
In their eyes, it may be slightly unfair to probe a decision or a mood too hard; they like instinct.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.760
In particular, they think one shouldn’t always attempt to take apart emotions.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.040
Classicists, on the other hand, are wary of intuition.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.900
They've learnt, often through bitter experience, how misguided and deluded their own feelings may be

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.780
and hence look rather skeptically and caustically upon them.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.400
Spontaneity vs Education

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.400
Romantics are wary of teaching and instruction.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.760
They think that things should be spontaneous rather than taught.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.820
The idea that people might need to think rationally and exhaustively about

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.360
what career to choose for themselves, or whom they should marry

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.060
strikes the Romantic as a misguided intrusion of education

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.300
into things which should be spontaneous and natural.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.920
They like the notion of a "calling" and of "love at first sight".

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.520
Part of Romantics’ respect for spontaneity leads them to look with particular interest at children,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.660
who seem to them to have more direct access to the kind of truths and sensibilities that adults have lost.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.780
To the Romantic, it will always be a child who points out that the emperor is wearing no clothes.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.400
Those of a Classical temperament don’t necessarily respect the current education system as we know it,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.800
but the abstract idea of education seems to them very important.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.100
They believe that training is vital if we are to avoid making too many mistakes

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.660
in our emotional or professional lives.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.680
Honesty vs. Politness

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.540
The Romantic person is devoted to saying what they think or feel.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.200
They are allergic to the idea of being fake or of having secrets.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.200
Authenticity is vital.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.620
But the Classical person reveres politeness as a very important lid that suppresses what might destroy us.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.460
They believe deeply in getting on around other people.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.800
They'd much prefer to have civil relations with someone rather than tell them frankly what is on their mind.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.540
They accept an important role for secrets and white lies.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.520
Idealism vs. Realism

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.040
The Romantic is excited by how things might ideally be,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.240
and judges what currently exists in the world by the standard of a better imagined alternative.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.040
Most of the time, the current state of things arouses them to intense disappointment and anger

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.080
as they consider the injustices, prevarications, compromises, and timidity of the powerful.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.800
They are often furious with governments and surprised and

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.300
outraged by evidence of venal and self-interested conduct in society.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.320
For their part, the Classical person pays special attention to what can go wrong.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.300
They are very concerned to mitigate the downside.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.800
They're aware that most things could be a lot worse.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.160
Before condemning a government, they consider the standard of governments across history

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.000
and may regard a current arrangement as bearable, under the circumstances.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.940
High ideals make them nervous.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.600
The Rare vs. The Everyay

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.220
Romantic rebel against the ordinary.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.500
They are keen on the exotic and the rare.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.880
They are anxious about higher things being put under pressure to become ‘useful’ or commercial.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.340
They want heroism, excitement and an end to boredom.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.840
Classical people like daily life.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.240
They're familiar enough with extremes as to welcome things that are a little boring.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.300
They can see the charm of staying home and doing the laundry.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.120
Both Romantic and Classical orientations have important truths to impart.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.420
Neither is wholly right or wrong.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.300
They need to be balanced.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.560
But because a good life requires a judicious balance of both,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.740
at this point in history, when the spirit of the age is pretty Romantic,

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.780
it might be the Classical attitude, whose distinctive claims and wisdom we need to listen to most intently.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.980
It's a mode of approaching life which is ripe for rediscovery, and it can be repeatedly sampled in the films on this channel.
