00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.870
My time has finally come.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:03.789
Today, I get to talk about Cephalopods

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:11.680
Hey guys, Julia here for Dnews

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.320
Octopi and their fellow cephalopods scare
the living daylights out of my sister.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
Something about a traumatic trip on the 20,000
leagues under the Sea Ride….

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.590
So sister, you should probably turn off this
episode, because it turns out, there’s a

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.029
lot to be afraid of.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.420
Okay in my opinion there’s a lot to love
about these molluscs.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.170
Like a recent discovery that some species
of octopuses can see through their skin.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.440
Seriously.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.400
Octopuses make a chemical in their eyes called
opsins, which react to light, and send a chemical

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.430
signal to the brain.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.690
In two studies published in the journal of
Experimental Biology, researchers found that

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.590
these molecules can also be found in their
skin.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.600
In octopuses, these molecules are in nerve
endings on the cell.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.850
These little hair like extensions detected
light and send a chemical signal to specialized

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.820
color changing cells on their skin called
chromatophores.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.050
In other cephalopods like squid and cuttlefish,
opsins are actually found in the chromatophores

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.050
themselves.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.170
Scientists think this might be how cephalopods
have such an uncanny ability to blend into

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.170
their surroundings.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.650
Oh yeah these guys are masters of camouflage.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.850
I mean, some cephalopods have have up to 96,000
chromatophores per square inch of skin.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.850
Each of these chromatophores contain a sac
of pigment surrounded by muscle and by stretching

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.210
or squeezing this sac, they can change the
appearance of their colors.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.050
Some species of cephalopods have other crazy
color cells, like iridophores which make iridescent

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.100
colors, or leucophores which mirror back the
environment.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.340
But besides changing colors, some cephalopods
can change texture.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.310
yeah crazy, In a study published in the Journal
of Morphology researchers found that cephalopods

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.030
have small muscular structures on their skin
that either poke up vertically in a spike

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.600
or bump or spread out nice and smooth.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.020
So they can morph into crazy patterns and
changing textures in their environment, like

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.870
mimicking corals, rocks or sand.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.030
Or mimicking other sea creatures like T. mimicus,
an Indo-Pacific species of octopus.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.390
Not only are they great pretenders but they
are crazy crazy smart.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.159
Like they’ve been known to pull pranks and
play in captivity.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.430
According to Canadian biologist Jennifer Mather,
they blow water at stuff in their tanks or

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.620
take apart stuff like robots, just for the
fun of it.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.970
And play is something thought to only be found
in intelligent creatures, like birds and apes.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.610
There’s so many stories of them sneaking
out of their tanks at night and stealing a

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.890
fish or two from a nearby tank then plopping
back in their tank and acting like nothing

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.890
happened.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.370
Mather even noticed that octopuses have personalities,
different creatures are more shy or active

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.450
than others.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.940
These come from their big brains, well relatively.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.170
They’re brains aren’t as big as ours per
say, but bigger than many other molluscs.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.850
Most molluscs have “brains” that are actually
clusters of nerve cells spread throughout

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.850
the body.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.680
But cephalopods have a more centralized group
of these ganglia, or nerve cells.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.459
This centralizes command in the creature and
provides more room for developing things like

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.459
memory.

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.060
They also have little mini brains or groups
of nerve cells in their arms!

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.060
I haven’t even mentioned that cuttlefish
are adorable and cuddly… an octopus has

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.170
a beak or some species have an arm, called
a A hectocotylus, that acts a lot like penis

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.020
by storing and transferring sperm to the female.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.599
Which just gets weird.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.970
Speaking of the weird and wonderful, Laci
explains all about real life sea monsters

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.670
in this great video here …
