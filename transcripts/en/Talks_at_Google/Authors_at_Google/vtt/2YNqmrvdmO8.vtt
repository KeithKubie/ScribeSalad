00:00:01.074 --> 00:00:03.240
MALE SPEAKER: Well, good
afternoon to everybody here

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:03.970
in Mountain View.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.580
Thanks for coming out.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.850
To our Googlers tuning in
in offices around the world,

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.020
good day to you as well.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.157
So we're in for a treat today.

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:14.490
The gentlemen to my right
probably need no introduction,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.492
but I'll still venture to
try to give them one anyway.

00:00:17.492 --> 00:00:18.950
The gentleman to
my immediate right

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.340
is none other than director
Kyle Patrick Alvarez.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.760
He's LA-based.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.806
He's a feature director,
writer, producer, and editor.

00:00:26.806 --> 00:00:28.180
"The Stanford
Prison Experiment,"

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.721
which we're here to
talk about today,

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:32.049
marks his third
film as a director.

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.660
In 2010, he won the
Someone to Watch award

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.650
at the Independent Spirit Awards
for his directorial debut,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.000
"Easier with Practice." "The
Stanford Prison Experiment"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.900
was at this year's Sundance Film
Festival and the Nantucket Film

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.290
Festival, and I think it
won two awards at Sundance?

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.080
KYLE ALVAREZ: Yep.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.788
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:48.788 --> 00:00:50.619
Very cool, exciting stuff.

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:52.160
And the gentleman
to my further right

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.412
is Philip G. Zimbardo, PhD,
AKA Dr. Z, Dr. Zimbardo.

00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:59.120
He's one of the most
distinguished living

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.840
psychologists, having served
as president of the American

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.160
Psychological
Association, designed

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.780
and narrated the
award-winning 26-part PBS

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.820
series, "Discovering
Psychology," which

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.040
hooked me into psychology
as a high school student,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.400
and has published more
than 50 books and 400

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.970
professional and popular
articles and chapters.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.020
Among them, "Shyness," "The
Lucifer Effect," "The Time

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.850
Cure," and "The Time Paradox."

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.540
He's a bit of a Talks
at Google veteran,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.060
so we're excited to
have him back here.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.670
He's a professor emeritus
at Stanford University.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.980
He spent 50 years teaching
and studying psychology,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.620
received his PhD in psych
from Yale University,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.180
and his areas of focus include
time perspective, shyness,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.616
terrorism, madness, and evil.

00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:45.866
KYLE ALVAREZ: I'm really
glad you introduced me first.

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:48.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.731
MALE SPEAKER: They gave
me a lot more to say here.

00:01:51.731 --> 00:01:52.480
We'll close it up.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.188
We'll wrap it up.

00:01:53.188 --> 00:01:56.010
Best known for his controversial
Stanford Prison Experiment

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.390
that highlighted
the ease with which

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.000
ordinary intelligent
college students could cross

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.010
the line between
good and evil when

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.950
caught up in the matrix of
situational and systemic

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.581
forces.

00:02:06.581 --> 00:02:08.539
We'll talk a little bit
of heroism later, which

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.662
is what he's got on his
shirt, but let's get started.

00:02:11.662 --> 00:02:13.120
Just so you guys
know, I'll do some

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.060
Q&amp;A. We've prepared for
the first half of the hour,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.470
and then we've got a mic for
the audience to do Q&amp;A as well.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.880
So the first part,
I want to talk

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.500
to you, Dr. Zimbardo, and
kind of set the stage for us.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.270
So your study-- SPE, Stanford
Prison Experiment 1971--

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.562
this is 10 years after
Milgram's study began in 1961.

00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:34.770
What's going on at this time?

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.475
Why are studies like this
so popular back then?

00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:39.350
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Well,
I should first mention

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.150
an interesting coincidence.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.300
Little Stanley Milgram
and little Phil Zimbardo

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.710
sat side by side in James
Monroe High School in the Bronx

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.210
in 1949, 1950.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.070
And as kids, we were
talking about situations

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.960
that-- I grew up
in the South Bronx.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.035
He grew up in the North Bronx.

00:02:57.035 --> 00:03:00.070
In what way does where you
grow up make a difference?

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.890
And we concluded it
makes a big difference.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.770
Now his study in 1963 at Yale
used adults, 20 to 50-year-old

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.000
men mostly, and he said
no college students,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.330
no high school students.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.170
And there was no selection
fact, just anybody who

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.080
answered living in New
Haven, Connecticut,

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.640
and they got $4 an hour
for a study on memory.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.980
So that was a lie.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.870
So the idea was that
he would recruit

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.437
young men, young and
middle-aged men, in what they

00:03:34.437 --> 00:03:36.770
thought was a study to help
people improve their memory.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.230
And the way they were going
to help is by hurting.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.550
So there was another
participant who they didn't

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.090
realize was a confederate.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.650
So the real subject
is the teacher.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.230
The confederate is
the student, pupil.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.907
And teacher gives
something to learn.

00:03:52.907 --> 00:03:54.240
They get it right, you say good.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.494
When they get it wrong,
you deliver punishment.

00:03:56.494 --> 00:03:57.910
And the way you
deliver punishment

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.050
is by pressing a
button on a shock box.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.670
The shock box has 30 switches.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.710
Each starts with 15
volts, and each switch

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.930
increases by 15 volts.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.210
The problem is that
the confederate

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.600
starts to make mistakes,
starts to dumb down,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.360
gets shocked more and more.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.550
And there's a point at
which the confederate begins

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.200
to scream and yell, I've
got a heart condition.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.574
And everybody says, I don't--
in terms of the experiment,

00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:22.490
I don't want to go on.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.290
The experiment's in
a white lab coat,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.620
so that's the
authority obedient.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.640
And the experiment
simply says, I'm sorry.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.070
You must continue, teacher.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.250
The experiment requires
you to continue.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.150
So in order to get out,
you had to say three times,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.760
I quit, I quit, I quit.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.770
Once or twice is not enough.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.170
And when it gets to 300 volts,
the guy is screaming and out

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.360
of control, and everybody
says, I don't want to go on.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.400
So everybody verbally complains.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.160
Everybody verbally
denies wanting to go on.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.190
The problem is, what do they do?

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.250
Two out of every three
of the 1,000 subjects

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.852
goes all the way to 450 volts.

00:05:00.852 --> 00:05:02.435
At that point, the
guy is unconscious.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:03.810
He could be dead.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.300
So it really shocked the
nation, shocked the world.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.860
And the reason I
did my study-- then

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.990
I'll get back to answering
what was happening in

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.800
that time period-- is it's
rare that somebody says,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.300
do bad shit.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.320
You're in a group, and
everybody's doing bad shit.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.790
You're in a
corporation, and people

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.180
begin to cheat and lie
and steal and get corrupt.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.330
Or you play a role.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.190
You're a manager.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.290
Your role is you're the bully.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.940
You're the traditional husband.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.780
So what we want to
see, what happens

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.920
when you're in a situation where
situational forces push you

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.140
in a negative direction,
and nobody says

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.380
you should do good or do bad?

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.460
There was something
about the '60s and '70s,

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.820
which for me, I miss, because
it was a time of revolution.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.280
It was a time of questioning.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.850
People are-- so it's civil
rights are happening.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.060
Anti-war activities
are happening, really

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.410
the start of feminism.

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.330
So it was really a
time, a very, for me,

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.570
a very exciting, exciting
period of social change.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.600
And so I think Milgram
tied into that.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.700
Now I must say he was a little
Jewish kid, meaning in 1948,

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.010
he was concerned, could the
Holocaust happen again here?

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.460
Could he and his family end
up in a concentration camp?

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.530
We said, Stanley,
don't be stupid.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:18.650
That's Nazi Germany.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.841
We're Americans.

00:06:19.841 --> 00:06:21.090
We're not that kind of people.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.290
And I still remember
him saying, I'll

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.640
bet they said the same thing
before the Nazis recruited

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.705
them to be in the SS.

00:06:28.705 --> 00:06:30.049
And it could happen here.

00:06:30.049 --> 00:06:31.090
MALE SPEAKER: I see that.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.610
Thank you for the context.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.540
So in the film and
also in interviews,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.620
you've said that you had no idea
what to expect from your study.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.470
So based on Milgram,
did you not have

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.799
an inkling that what
happened might have happened

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.090
or that folks would respond
to the authority in the way

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.910
that they did?

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.660
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Well,
in Milgram's thing,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.440
it's really a one-on-one
confrontation.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.967
Somebody says, do bad shit,
you do it or you don't.

00:06:52.967 --> 00:06:55.300
In our thing, we're not telling
them to do anything bad.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.265
If we say, be a guard, well, in
your mind, you've seen movies.

00:07:00.265 --> 00:07:01.490
You've seen "Cool Hand Luke."

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.890
You've seen "Heat of the Night."

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:08.180
You've seen other movies--
that guards had power.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.070
So essentially, we assume that
there would be verbal abuse,

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.200
and the question is,
how long would it take?

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.690
Again, nobody wanted
to be a guard,

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.910
as you'll see in the
film, because guards

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.700
were like a policeman
who, in the '70s,

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.540
were called on college campuses
to break up anti-war rallies.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.990
So cops-- police and cops
were pigs, oink, oink,

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.420
in those days.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.310
And so essentially,
it's that in our study,

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.100
it was difficult for the kids
to get in the role of guards.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.656
They put on military uniforms,
which felt awkward at first.

00:07:42.656 --> 00:07:44.030
And you'll see
the opening scene.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.670
The audience laughs
at the opening scene.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:49.380
They didn't want
to be in that role.

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.420
And it took one day
before everything changed

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.000
as you saw in the
movie, and Kyle

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.247
will talk about that
transformation on day two.

00:07:56.247 --> 00:07:57.080
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:57.590
OK.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:58.980
And not to give too
much away from the film.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.396
A lot of us were
there last night.

00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:03.301
We had a screening just down the
street, but two quick questions

00:08:03.301 --> 00:08:03.800
there.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.030
One, in the film, as you're
sitting in one of the hallways,

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.530
I guess one of your
colleagues come,

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.280
and he kind of confronts
you, and he says,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.390
what's your independent
variable in this study?

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.974
Would you answer
that for us now?

00:08:13.974 --> 00:08:14.890
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Yeah.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:20.130
So in every experiment, there's
something you vary, manipulate,

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:22.230
and there's something
you measure.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.710
When you do a correlational
study, you measure two things.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:30.740
So I want to know,
are extroverts

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.110
more open to new
experience than introverts?

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.940
So I give scale-- extroversion,
openness experiment-- and I

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:39.049
do a correlation to say,
do they go together?

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:42.090
In experiments, the
thing you want to see

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.740
is, does behavior change?

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.690
And that's called the
dependent variable.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.730
It's dependent on
what you manipulate,

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:51.200
and what you
manipulate is called

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.570
the independent
variable, just the terms.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.320
So in this case,
the manipulation

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.490
was random assignment of
a group of 24 students

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.320
have to be guards and
have to be prisoners.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.760
In the movie, they do their
thing of flipping a coin,

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.776
but in fact, there's a
table of random numbers

00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:07.150
that you give
everybody a number.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:10.080
Then pick out the number--
person to person I call it.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.840
So the reason you do that is
at the beginning of the study,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.770
there should be no
systematic difference

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:16.350
on any dimension
between prisoners

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:17.940
and the guard in
height, in weight,

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.100
in emotional
background, et cetera.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.100
MALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:21.430
Thank you.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.846
And then the last
thing here, just

00:09:22.846 --> 00:09:25.190
to set the context, what are
the results of the study?

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.070
If people don't know,
what did you learn?

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.254
What did you take away?

00:09:28.254 --> 00:09:29.170
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Yeah.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:30.400
What's interesting
about the study,

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.566
it's been called infamous,
controversial, et cetera,

00:09:32.566 --> 00:09:33.190
et cetera.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.020
That's after the fact.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.750
In 1971, Stanford
University had one

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.050
of the very first human
subject research committees

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.910
that I submitted a study to.

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.790
And every student filled
out an informed consent

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.380
to say, I will be an experiment
in which there'll be high

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.600
stress, there'll be minimally
adequate diet, et cetera,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.420
et cetera.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:05.150
I can leave the experiment-- I
can terminate my participation

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:10.490
simply by saying, I quit
the experiment or something

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.577
like that.

00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:12.910
For me, that's a magical phrase.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.210
They had to use those words,
"I quit the experiment."

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.750
If you say, "I want
out," that wasn't good.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.230
And so they filled
out that form.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:20.245
The problem was before
you knew the results,

00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:22.150
it was kids playing
cops and robbers

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.811
in the basement of
Stanford University.

00:10:23.811 --> 00:10:24.560
What could happen?

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.390
Nothing.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.389
If anything, what
they said was, you've

00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:28.680
been summoned to the committee.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.150
You needed to have a fire
extinguisher, because there

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.232
was only one entrance.

00:10:32.232 --> 00:10:33.690
There's no windows,
so if there was

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.720
a fire-- you'll see the movie,
as happened in this thing,

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.490
they used the fire extinguisher
against the prisoners.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.270
So in hindsight you say,
wow, it's really unethical.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.170
People suffered.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.900
How could anybody allow this?

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.690
They couldn't imagine,
as I couldn't, what

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.290
happened in two days.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.310
And it's not clear in the movie,
but at the end of day one,

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:58.900
I told my graduate students and
my team, if nothing changed,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.900
we're going to end this.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.260
And nothing's happening.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.260
It's so awkward.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.940
It's embarrassing to sit there.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.080
And then day two, the
prisoners revolt, and suddenly,

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.210
everything changes.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:09.210
MALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:09.920
Thank you.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.792
This is for both of
you, either of you.

00:11:11.792 --> 00:11:13.500
So how'd you get
involved in the project?

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.840
Why this film?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:15.622
Why this time?

00:11:15.622 --> 00:11:17.080
Talk to us about
how that happened.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.160
KYLE ALVAREZ: Well, for
me, and then we can--

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.000
I'll backtrack a little bit
then with Dr. Zimbardo's

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.440
initial involvement.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.146
The script-- or you can
chime in at any point.

00:11:29.146 --> 00:11:30.520
I guess the
project-- pretty much

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.103
since the experiment
happened, someone

00:11:32.103 --> 00:11:34.120
has been trying to
do a film out of it.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.210
And you know, there's
been various iterations.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.850
There was the writer of
"In the Heat of the Night,"

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.800
met you, brought you
down to Los Angeles.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.540
This is back in the '70s.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.740
There was another
version at some point.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.360
Then there was a
version in the '90s

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.000
that Leonardo DiCaprio
was going to do

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.460
before "Titanic" happened.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:53.210
It was going to be him
and Benicio Del Toro.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:56.370
And then it led to
this version happening,

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:58.140
and there was this
producer who's

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.830
from the Bay Area
named Brent Emery,

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.680
and he reached out to you.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.947
And he--

00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:05.280
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Took an option.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.279
KYLE ALVAREZ: Yeah, took
an option on the rights

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:09.130
to the story and
pieced together--

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.230
they got Chris
McQuarrie involved,

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.020
who has a movie coming out
in two weeks, the new Mission

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:14.780
Impossible movie.

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.740
And he brought in a guy he
writes with sometimes named Tim

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:19.240
Talbottt.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.040
So Tim started writing the
script at the same time

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:24.370
then that Phil was writing
"The Lucifer Effect."

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.507
And so they were always
in touch with each other,

00:12:26.507 --> 00:12:28.840
sharing the research, sharing
the documents, everything.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.946
It was sort of like a
perfect little storm for Tim

00:12:30.946 --> 00:12:31.820
to write this script.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:34.374
And the first thing he did
was throw everything in there.

00:12:34.374 --> 00:12:35.540
He's like, let's just start.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.081
I've read it.

00:12:36.081 --> 00:12:38.660
It's like a 300-something page,
whatever, 280-page script,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.960
and it starts with, waking up on
the morning of the experiment,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:43.330
and he put in every detail.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.400
And then, really, I think
the writing of it for Tim

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.470
and what Tim did so well was,
OK, what do you pull out,

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:51.380
and in effort then,
who are the people

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:53.490
we follow in the experiment?

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.710
Where is the structure?

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:59.800
And it really became an
act of structuring a story

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.080
around a lot of characters.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.790
And then the
project got cast up.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.630
It had what was not a star--
probably equivalent to the cast

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.240
we have now.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.230
It was like Ryan Philippe
and Jesse Eisenberg

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:15.445
and Giovanni Ribisi and
Channing Tatum at the time.

00:13:15.445 --> 00:13:17.820
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: This was just
before they became famous.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.540
I went down and met
with all these guys,

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.450
and they all have become
famous young actors.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.305
KYLE ALVAREZ: Yeah, and
it was 13 years ago.

00:13:24.305 --> 00:13:26.180
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: He
couldn't raise the money.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.850
KYLE ALVAREZ: Yeah.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.291
They were trying to make it
a much bigger budget film.

00:13:30.291 --> 00:13:31.290
It was a different time.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.206
Independent film was in
a very different time.

00:13:33.206 --> 00:13:35.850
I mean I was just going
into college at the time

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.040
and remember reading
about the project,

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:40.020
and it didn't come
together as hundreds--

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.980
I mean in the time
I've been talking,

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.652
five movies have
died in Hollywood.

00:13:44.652 --> 00:13:46.110
You know, they have
the billboards,

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:48.010
how many people have died
from smoking this year.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.009
You can do the same with
the Hollywood projects.

00:13:50.009 --> 00:13:52.837
And it didn't happen, but the
script was so well-appreciated

00:13:52.837 --> 00:13:55.295
that the word of the script
kind of always lingered around,

00:13:55.295 --> 00:13:58.560
or you read these articles of
the great unproduced scripts,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.920
and it was always on there.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.850
And Brent always held onto
the rights, the producer

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:03.690
I mentioned earlier.

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.280
And this actor
from my first film,

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.530
Brian Garrity, who's one of
the stars of "The Hurt Locker"

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:12.070
and a bunch of other films,
he had auditioned-- probably

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:14.280
had auditioned for the
film 10 years earlier,

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.040
13 years earlier.

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.852
And he was friends
with Brent, and they

00:14:16.852 --> 00:14:17.810
were talking one night.

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:20.929
And Brent-- long story short,
long story long-- Brent

00:14:20.929 --> 00:14:21.720
was like, oh, yeah.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.710
I'm still trying to get the
Stanford Prison Experiment

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:25.470
movie made, and Brian was
like, oh, you should send it

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.402
to my friend, Kyle.

00:14:26.402 --> 00:14:28.110
And some of the point
of that whole story

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.100
is that it really, like
sometimes these things

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.660
or here's this project that
people have been laboring over

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.547
for 40 years, and
it just came down

00:14:34.547 --> 00:14:36.880
to like two guys sharing a
drink and someone being like,

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.380
oh, I should send
that to my friend.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.840
And then I read the
script and started

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.450
to really read about the
experiment, learn about it,

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.580
realize that the script
had stayed so true to what

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.627
the experiment was,
and from there, got

00:14:47.627 --> 00:14:48.710
involved with the project.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:49.900
This was a few years ago.

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:53.510
And since then, I took
a little time away

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.800
to make the film I made before.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:59.130
But it's really been--
for Hollywood terms,

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.581
it went by-- three years for
a film to get made is short.

00:15:02.581 --> 00:15:05.080
I hate to say that, but it is
a really short period of time.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.220
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.445
So this is a question that
came up a little while ago

00:15:08.445 --> 00:15:11.300
in discussion, and the question
was, why not a documentary?

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.010
Why a drama?

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:13.870
And is it because you
inherited the project

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.930
after it was already
written as a drama, or?

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.660
KYLE ALVAREZ: No,
because I get sent

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:21.380
scripts or biopics of people's
lives or books all the time.

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.600
And I think when it's
something that's contemporary,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.310
i.e. there's video of it, and
there's interviews of the time,

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:28.059
and there's books been
written-- we're not

00:15:28.059 --> 00:15:30.760
talking about something that's
totally undocumented-- you say,

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.990
OK, well, why do this?

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.060
Why do you need to
do this as a film?

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:34.559
I think a lot of
people make movies,

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:37.200
and the rationale is based
on true people or biopics

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.760
or situations, and
the rationale is,

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.920
well, it just hasn't
been a movie yet,

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.490
so you've got to do it.

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:42.490
And that's not enough
for me, and so when

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.987
I looked at the documentary, the
"Quiet Rage", the documentary

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:47.820
that Dr. Zimbardo made
about the experiment,

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.110
and I read the book,
I felt that they

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.520
had done such a good
job encompassing

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.210
the studious nature
of the experiment.

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.267
But what those couldn't do,
and they wouldn't be able to,

00:15:57.267 --> 00:15:59.350
they wouldn't be as good
as a material as they are

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.580
is try to create the more
experiential or the more

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.620
emotional-- something that an
actor can bring to the film.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.150
And so you watch the footage,
and just like in the film,

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.950
it's just one camera at the end.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.280
And it was very expensive
to run video in 1971,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.324
so there is quite a lot of
footage, but not everything.

00:16:14.324 --> 00:16:15.740
There's a lot of
audio recordings.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.573
It just felt like there
was this opportunity

00:16:17.573 --> 00:16:19.890
to literally get
inside of that space

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:21.890
and hopefully maybe
illuminate some

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:25.260
of the that emotional
capacity, the emotional effect

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:26.587
this experiment had on people.

00:16:26.587 --> 00:16:27.420
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:28.586
So how'd you do the casting?

00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:31.209
How'd you cast Dr.
Z. and all the?

00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:33.250
KYLE ALVAREZ: We started
with the kids, actually.

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:37.230
So it's 25 leads, which is
really unusual for a low budget

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.730
movie.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.500
It's unusual for any movie.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.130
And I saw them all as leads.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.490
I didn't want to say, oh,
well, that guy doesn't really

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.970
do much, so he's not-- we'll
just get central casting.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.926
I wanted it to be
each person, you

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:51.800
could train the camera
on them, and the scene

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:52.890
could become about them.

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.750
And it took a long time.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.530
We were casting as
we were financing,

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.130
so I basically started just
meeting with these guys.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.780
I had a list of people I knew
I wanted to be in the movie,

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.946
and I started meeting with
them trying to figure out

00:17:06.946 --> 00:17:08.700
their temperaments.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.079
Young actors can be
really, really volatile

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.040
in a really great way.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.760
They can be those guys
that just want to dive in

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:15.660
and be really methody
and want to like only

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.220
be called the character's name.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:18.880
And there's so much
ambition there,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.599
and it's a really great
thing, and it's a really great

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.599
if you're making a movie
where you can give them

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:25.010
all the attention and comforts
and things that come along

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.619
with that.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.409
But when you've got
25 of them around,

00:17:27.409 --> 00:17:28.450
there's no time for that.

00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:30.200
So really, I was vetting them.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.609
I guess I was doing
psychological vetting on them

00:17:32.609 --> 00:17:33.650
to see how they would be.

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:36.700
So the hotshot kid who comes
in and sits at lunch and goes,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.194
yeah-- he like unwraps
his cigarettes out

00:17:39.194 --> 00:17:41.610
of a pack in his pocket, and
he's like, I studied Meisner,

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:43.272
and I did all
this, and these are

00:17:43.272 --> 00:17:44.480
the techniques I like to use.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.604
You'd say, that's not the
guy that's going to work.

00:17:46.604 --> 00:17:47.740
He's incredibly talented.

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:49.240
And then we started
doing auditions,

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.320
and we got some of
the guys in the bigger

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.241
parts involved initially.

00:17:53.241 --> 00:17:54.740
And then as we were
making the film,

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.290
trying to cast the
Zimbardo part, it's tough.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.060
You want someone who
can evoke that feeling,

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.950
but you're not
trying to do mimicry,

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:05.870
but you want it to
also-- as much as we're

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:08.470
recreating the experiment, try
to match that kind of feeling.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.349
And I've just always
loved Billy Crudup.

00:18:11.349 --> 00:18:12.890
He's always been
one of my favorites.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.014
I think he's underutilized.

00:18:14.014 --> 00:18:17.030
I think he's underappreciated,
and he's just

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:17.940
incredibly talented.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.720
And fortunately, I
had just made a movie

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.820
with Corey Stoll-- it's
so weird to see him.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.240
He's in "Ant Man" on the same
weekend blowing things up

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.060
and the CG stuff.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.217
But Corey had just
done a movie with Billy

00:18:29.217 --> 00:18:31.550
and had told Billy that he
really liked working with me.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:34.870
So when the script came around
to Billy with my name on it,

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:35.650
he was interested.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.830
But the interesting thing
connected to what you just said

00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:39.371
was when I first
sat down with Billy,

00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:42.950
his hesitation was-- he said,
well, I just don't understand.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.660
How did they not know
this was going to happen?

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.677
And that was his big thing that
was holding him back from maybe

00:18:48.677 --> 00:18:49.760
saying yes to the project.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.787
And I remember it like
an 8:00 AM meeting,

00:18:51.787 --> 00:18:53.120
because he had a plane to catch.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.430
And I was like tired.

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.270
And in one of those weird
moments where it dings, and I

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.960
was like, he didn't know
it was going to happen,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.418
because the Stanford Prison
Experiment hadn't happened yet.

00:19:00.418 --> 00:19:02.080
This was the thing
that defined it.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.750
That's where it's not naivety.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:05.520
There was no point of reference.

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.125
And I think that
was the thing that

00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:08.250
sort of got Billy on board.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:10.890
And he's just one of those
guys, if you can work with him,

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:13.030
it's like a highlight.

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:15.966
And I was really glad
he did the movie.

00:19:15.966 --> 00:19:18.090
And I was really glad all
these guys-- Ezra Miller,

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.620
the first time I met
on the film, I said,

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.542
if we don't make this
movie with Ezra Miller,

00:19:23.542 --> 00:19:24.500
we're making a mistake.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.080
He walked from 1971 into 2015.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.920
It's bizarre.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.910
He's not of this era, and when
we put this cast together,

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:37.202
our dream was to build a cast
like "The Outsiders," one

00:19:37.202 --> 00:19:39.493
of these from "Dazed and
Confused," where you look back

00:19:39.493 --> 00:19:40.950
10 years, and we
would always say

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.084
that you look back 10
years, and you're not

00:19:42.084 --> 00:19:43.760
going to believe all these
guys were in the same movie.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.450
And really it's
been like 10 months.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.790
We didn't know Ezra was
going to be the Flash and now

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:52.810
one of the new leads in
the Harry Potter spinoff,

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.734
and Tye Sheridan as
Cyclops, and Ki Hong Li

00:19:55.734 --> 00:19:56.650
has "The Maze Runner."

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.730
All these guys,
these were all things

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:01.286
that happened after
we made the film.

00:20:01.286 --> 00:20:03.410
And part of that's engineered,
part of that's luck,

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:05.590
and part of that's--
I don't know.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.000
Part of that's
mojo or something.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.480
And so it was really a privilege
and like an embarrassment

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.621
of riches to get to work
with all of these guys.

00:20:13.621 --> 00:20:16.120
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: You also said
you had them read both prison

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.030
and guard parts.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.160
KYLE ALVAREZ: Yeah, when we have
people come and audition when

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.990
we did the more not
open casting calls,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.545
but we'd bring actors
in, for the most part,

00:20:23.545 --> 00:20:26.170
unless I had something specific
in mind, but most of the times,

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.590
we just said-- we wrote scenes.

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.440
So I would combine
some of the characters

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.360
and just put some of the
highlights of moments

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.630
that they needed to see.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.160
And we just said to them,
you can come and read one,

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.030
you can read the other,
you can read both.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.090
And it was an interesting
thing, and in some cases,

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:41.670
I would cast them
against the part

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:42.920
they thought they should play.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.586
Some cases, they just
did what they did.

00:20:44.586 --> 00:20:46.520
They knew themselves,
so it was a weird thing.

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.320
In a lot of cases,
it was really fun

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.804
to try to take some of these
kids, who-- a lot of them

00:20:50.804 --> 00:20:53.220
were from Disney shows and
Nickelodeon shows, and this was

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.090
sort of their first more
serious feature-- and be like,

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.610
oh, no, you're
going to be a guard.

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:01.760
You're like, well, I was
Hannah Montana's best friend.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.450
But then that's fun for them,
because they don't-- I remember

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.920
James Wolk, who plays
one of the grad students,

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:15.530
was just so happy to be in a
costume and to have facial hair

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:16.220
and a wig.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.886
He just wanted that,
because he's always

00:21:17.886 --> 00:21:19.300
playing the handsome boyfriend.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:20.269
He was thrilled.

00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:21.810
It's one of these
things where you're

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:24.480
giving these guys opportunities
to do something a little bit

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.347
different, and they
just chew it up.

00:21:26.347 --> 00:21:27.180
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:30.400
Now obviously, Dr. Zimbardo's
involved in the process.

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.160
Were any of the
original subjects

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.070
involved in the
filming or not at all?

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.778
KYLE ALVAREZ: No.

00:21:34.778 --> 00:21:37.000
It was a careful and
deliberate choice for me.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.150
Part of it was that
I felt what they

00:21:39.150 --> 00:21:42.450
would contribute to it, that
research had already been done.

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.414
He had done extensive
followup interviews.

00:21:44.414 --> 00:21:46.330
There's also interviews
leading all the way up

00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:49.510
to just like maybe 10 years ago
last that you could see online.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:53.650
But while I felt we were
representing Dr. Zimbardo

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:59.830
directly and his wife, Dr.
Christina Maslach, or Christina

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.886
Zimbardo, directly, I
felt that everyone else,

00:22:02.886 --> 00:22:04.260
it would do a
disservice if I was

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:06.760
trying to cast someone that
looked like this person.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:08.180
We weren't learning about them.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.000
The only people we learn about
outside the experiment is him.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.340
And so for me, it felt like
when we changed all their names,

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.880
not even for legal reasons.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.724
We changed them,
because I didn't feel--

00:22:17.724 --> 00:22:18.890
I met a woman the other day.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:20.681
She goes, my brother
was one of the guards.

00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:21.840
My brother was John Mark.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.423
And I go, I couldn't even tell
you who played him in the film.

00:22:24.423 --> 00:22:27.030
Because in order to reduce it
down into a two-hour movie,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:29.420
we were combining certain
things people did.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.930
So these characters
were being defined

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.480
by the actions they took
inside of the experiment,

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.850
and I felt if I even connected
the actors to the real people,

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.450
it just would've created
this cacophony of-- it

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.492
just felt like we
weren't actually making

00:22:45.492 --> 00:22:46.825
a movie about those individuals.

00:22:46.825 --> 00:22:48.949
We were making a movie
about the actions they took.

00:22:48.949 --> 00:22:50.799
And you know, it's
a tricky decision,

00:22:50.799 --> 00:22:52.590
because you don't want
to make a movie then

00:22:52.590 --> 00:22:54.050
where someone goes
and sees it and says,

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:54.930
it was nothing like that.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.110
I wish you would've
touched base with me,

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.410
and I could've told you
this, this, and this.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.220
But when there's so
many, it would've

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.335
been-- I think it would
have been an endless pit.

00:23:01.335 --> 00:23:02.460
MALE SPEAKER: I understand.

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.170
PHILIP ZIMBARDO:
And the other thing

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.480
is a number of the
prisoners and a number

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.040
of the guards to this day
said, I was just acting.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.160
I was just acting.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.650
It wasn't the situation factor.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.470
I just chose to be a
prisoner who broke down.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.640
They just chose
to be evil guard.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.142
And I tell them, I say,
wow, that's really great.

00:23:19.142 --> 00:23:20.600
I don't know any
professional actor

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.660
who could stay in part eight
hours a day day after day,

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.740
day after day, day after day.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.570
So I think they were right.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:31.970
They started playing a
role, especially the guy who

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.000
plays John Wayne.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.580
In the movie it's
played brilliantly.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.370
He was an 18-year-old
college freshman

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.170
at Whitman College
interested in drama,

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:43.670
and he saw the movie
"Cool Hand Luke" recently,

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:46.080
and he just chose to
be Strother Martin.

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.980
And it was a conscious
choice on his part,

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.040
but the point is you'll see
once he gets into the role,

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.300
he becomes evil.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:58.440
In fact, it's the
definition of creative evil.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.650
Then he's stuck in
that role, and he's

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:03.850
the one who says-- now
the guards work eight hour

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.646
shifts so that they were home
doing the usual things-- some

00:24:06.646 --> 00:24:07.990
are madder than others.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.750
And he's the one that
says, you come in,

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.660
you put on your guard
uniform, you put on silver

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.580
reflecting sunglasses I got
from the movie "Cool Hand Luke,"

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:17.870
you get the billy club,
you step out on the yard,

00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:19.270
and you are a guard.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:20.530
This is what he said later.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.180
And then he said in a
recent-- after Abu Ghraib,

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.690
our prison study got infamous
again, and he was interviewed.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:30.620
And he said, given
a little more time,

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.490
we guards could have
got where they were.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.620
And he said, we were just
getting off our jollies

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:40.060
by being puppeteers, and the
prisoners were our puppets.

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.240
This is 30 years later.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.610
That is not acting.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:46.950
That is taking the
mentality he created

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:48.487
44 years ago into the present.

00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:49.903
KYLE ALVAREZ: Well,
what that says

00:24:49.903 --> 00:24:52.070
to me is that there is power
in what we call acting.

00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:54.236
That's what I talked to the
actors a lot about this.

00:24:54.236 --> 00:24:56.280
I was like, you're
professional role players

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.430
playing unprofessional role
players in this experiment.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:03.102
So you need to stay the
professional role player.

00:25:03.102 --> 00:25:05.185
That was the thing, and
that's why it was actually

00:25:05.185 --> 00:25:08.670
a really fun and pleasant set,
especially when we were working

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.149
with the kids, because they
were constantly aware of that.

00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:12.690
But I think-- I'm
mostly certain it's

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:14.270
a Vonnegut quote, which
is embarrassing, because I

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:15.180
have a Vonnegut tattoo.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.096
But he said, be careful
who you pretend to be,

00:25:17.096 --> 00:25:18.930
because you become
what you pretend to be.

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:23.420
And I do think that that to me
was a really interesting thing

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.810
to see actors do.

00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:27.310
I wasn't trying to
make a movie that

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.340
was super aware of
its meta quality,

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.200
but there is
something that is-- it

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.890
would be interesting for someone
who is in the acting world

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:36.280
or writes papers about
the acting theories

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:38.870
to write, OK, where is it?

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.320
You hear these stories of
actors who get lost in parts

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.730
or whatever it might be, and
it's really hard for them

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.730
to return to their lives
and their family lives,

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:46.906
and I think it's a really
similar extension of what

00:25:46.906 --> 00:25:49.280
was going on there, where it
does start as fun and games,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.510
and at a certain point, if
you're really good at it,

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.790
if you access yourself,
you lie to yourself enough,

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:56.751
and so our goal in making the
film was to not get that far,

00:25:56.751 --> 00:25:58.500
to get that far when
the camera's rolling,

00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.542
and then you shut it off.

00:25:59.542 --> 00:26:01.333
MALE SPEAKER: Did you
have any close calls?

00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:02.072
KYLE ALVAREZ: No.

00:26:02.072 --> 00:26:05.342
We did when Chris is doing
the pushups at the end.

00:26:05.342 --> 00:26:07.050
He was just like,
look, let's just do it.

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.508
So he was really
doing the pushups.

00:26:08.508 --> 00:26:10.800
Jack and Logan were really
sitting on his back.

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.660
And he was like, I can
give you like three takes.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.754
Fortunately, he was probably
the strongest guy in the cast.

00:26:17.754 --> 00:26:18.920
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Physically.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:20.750
KYLE ALVAREZ: Physically, yeah,
but I had asked all the actors

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.337
to stop working out,
because I didn't

00:26:22.337 --> 00:26:24.920
want them to be-- there were a
few scenes we shot that weren't

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.461
in the film where they had to
bathe before the visitors come.

00:26:27.461 --> 00:26:29.360
And people in the
'70s didn't have--

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.340
that was Matt Weiner's
rule for his actors

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.300
weren't-- that's what
they always said.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.510
The actors weren't allowed
to go to the gym who

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:35.843
were on "Mad Men," because
that's not how people looked.

00:26:35.843 --> 00:26:38.540
And these actors only
had two weeks notice.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.640
We had no rehearsal period
or anything, so by the time

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.440
he got to lunch,
we got to lunch.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:46.610
It was steak kebabs
were what's for lunch,

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.150
and Chris's arms were
like he couldn't do it.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:51.490
I had to take the steak off
for him, and you feel bad.

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:55.889
But even then, it was like
he was invigorated by it.

00:26:55.889 --> 00:26:57.680
There was never a time
where-- these actors

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.900
were actually having fun.

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.900
I have like dozens of
videos on my phone of when

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.570
we were shooting the raid stuff,
and Nick Braun, the really tall

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:05.380
guy, has Ezra against the wall.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.120
In between takes where we're
all moving the camera, just

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.578
to keep their energy up, they
would just like play wrestle.

00:27:09.578 --> 00:27:11.210
They were just having a blast.

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.280
For them, that's fun.

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.180
That's what they were there.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.050
That's what they love.

00:27:14.050 --> 00:27:15.550
PHILIP ZIMBARDO:
Yeah, but the scene

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:19.490
is where the evil
John Wayne guard has

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.360
him doing pushups and then
literally stepping on his back,

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.910
pushing him down, and
then has two prisoners

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.790
sit on him while he's
still doing the pushups.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.930
And that really
happened in the study,

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:33.456
but it was amazing that
he could even do one.

00:27:33.456 --> 00:27:34.830
He had two people
sitting on him.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.310
KYLE ALVAREZ: And it was
interesting-- speaking

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.226
of the moments where it
does, this just popped

00:27:38.226 --> 00:27:41.030
into my-- Chris is struggling
and probably legitimately

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.470
starting to tear up.

00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:45.790
And he falls, and the
producers are on my case,

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:47.867
because we're a union
project, and we're already

00:27:47.867 --> 00:27:48.950
in grace period and lunch.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:49.600
I'm like, we need to go in.

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.190
I'm like, this guy is literally
killing himself for us.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.410
We need to not cut him off.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:54.950
And Michael at the
end of the take

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.450
throws him back up
against the wall,

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:58.150
and he's like, you can't
even do one lousy pushup.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:27:59.190
And it was totally
made the line up.

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:01.400
And I was like, that's
the most-- he made it up

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.320
right there, didn't
even think about it.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.340
He doesn't remember
really saying it.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.798
And I was like, that is the
cruelest thing I've ever heard.

00:28:06.798 --> 00:28:09.440
But it came from his character,
and it really wasn't to him.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.190
There was still that line.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:12.300
But we didn't get it on
camera, so they were like,

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:13.070
we've got to break
for lunch, and I was

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:14.330
like, I have to get that line.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:19.160
I was like, there's no way I'm
not going to shoot that line.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.760
They were like
calling for lunch.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.380
I think people, the grips
were like, fuck this.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:24.421
And they're walking out
and everything like that,

00:28:24.421 --> 00:28:29.160
and it was just-- but you don't
have to-- it's a weird thing,

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.770
because I like to
follow the rules.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:32.600
And a lot of the
great filmmakers

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.709
don't follow the rules,
but the thing I always do

00:28:34.709 --> 00:28:36.250
try to remind myself,
and it's really

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.790
hard in a movie like this
where there's so little time,

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:42.204
but I worked for Warren
Beatty for awhile,

00:28:42.204 --> 00:28:44.120
and he's infamous for
doing hundreds of takes.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:45.661
I've never done more
than five takes.

00:28:45.661 --> 00:28:48.300
This film, we never did
more than two or three.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.242
There was no time to.

00:28:49.242 --> 00:28:51.450
But one time I was like,
why do you do so many takes?

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.060
And he goes, well, because
everything that costs money

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.802
here-- like the sets, the
food, getting the actors here,

00:28:56.802 --> 00:28:58.510
the locations-- he's
like, the thing that

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.968
costs the least amount of money
is the film and the camera,

00:29:00.968 --> 00:29:02.906
in this case, the hard
drive and the camera.

00:29:02.906 --> 00:29:04.530
That's the cheapest
thing there, so why

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.700
aren't you going to
always keep on running?

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:09.570
And there's a
modified truth to that

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.240
that you can harness
without doing 100 takes.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.950
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: How long
did the prisoner guard takes?

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:16.870
Was it two weeks?

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.330
KYLE ALVAREZ:
Yeah, we were there

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:19.930
two and 1/2 weeks
in that hallway,

00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:24.710
and then we had a week and
1/2 in another building where

00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:26.371
all the outside stuff was.

00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:27.370
MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:29:27.370 --> 00:29:30.690
Well, not to interrupt
the mojo here,

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:32.960
but we had a screening
last night, and about 10

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.754
of us in a group went together.

00:29:34.754 --> 00:29:36.670
There was 100 of us, but
10 of us in the group

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:37.460
that I was with.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.430
And I remember the movie ends,
the credits roll, and there's

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:44.230
just radio silence from all my
friends and I for quite awhile.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.410
And it's been awhile since
we've been to a movie

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.100
where every one of my friends
and I were just blown away,

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.990
everybody two thumbs up,
rave reviews, loved it.

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:55.510
Now first thing that
came to use as we're

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.460
talking through it is about half
of us were like, you know what?

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.010
I bet you it was that intense.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.100
I bet you they didn't
take too many liberties.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.690
I'll bet you that's
what it was like.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:05.690
And half the folks were
like, I don't know, man.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.647
There's some stuff,
some of the stuff there,

00:30:07.647 --> 00:30:09.230
I don't know if I
could have taken it.

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:10.814
So we're curious--

00:30:10.814 --> 00:30:12.980
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: I could've
taken it if I was there?

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.890
KYLE ALVAREZ: No, they're
saying what in the film

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.410
was made up or exaggerated.

00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:18.660
MALE SPEAKER: Precisely, yeah.

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:19.810
KYLE ALVAREZ: I mean, he
could speak a little more.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.030
I'll let him speak literally--
well, say that first,

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.363
and I'll say my two cents on it.

00:30:23.363 --> 00:30:26.820
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: I mean, so
they've compressed six days

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.460
into two hours.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.190
Now if anything, there were
a lot of dramatic things

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:35.090
that happened in the real
study that got deleted,

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.310
or they couldn't put
in because of budget.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:42.640
So there's nothing in the film,
none of the dramatic events

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.480
in the film were made up.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.200
They will mimicked
what really happened.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.350
The last scene I
think puts together

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:56.360
three things that happened
separated by more hours.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.630
And so the last scene is
riveting, overwhelming,

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:02.257
emotionally distressing,
and I worried

00:31:02.257 --> 00:31:03.340
the first time I saw that.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.548
I said, people are going to
walk out of here in tears

00:31:05.548 --> 00:31:07.880
and say, I'm through with this.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:13.540
I didn't pay 12 bucks to--
but the goal is, how do you

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.310
transform that
emotional distress

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:19.019
to intellectual self-analysis?

00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:20.560
What kind of guard
would I have been?

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.670
What kind of prisoner?

00:31:21.670 --> 00:31:24.190
If I was the Zimbardo
character, wouldn't I

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.930
have ended it sooner?

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.960
Should he have run
it for two weeks?

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:35.050
And then if this is a
simulated prison, what must

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.605
it be like to be
in a real prison

00:31:36.605 --> 00:31:39.300
where guards have guns
and power over you,

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.820
and there are gangs, among
the prisoners there are gangs.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.977
So our prison is really more
like a prisoner of war camp,

00:31:45.977 --> 00:31:47.810
because everybody comes
in at the same time.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:50.710
If you go to a prison,
there's a prison hierarchy.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:52.460
There's guys who have
been there 30 years.

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:53.520
There's the really bad guys.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:54.125
There's gangs.

00:31:54.125 --> 00:31:57.900
There's black, Hispanic,
skinhead, white gangs,

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:01.200
and again, if you're in
prison and you're a young guy,

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.925
and you don't have
a gang connection,

00:32:02.925 --> 00:32:04.050
you're going to be a sissy.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.430
The only question is how long.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.230
So there's a whole
dynamic, which

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:08.870
I know operates in
a system-- I studied

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.770
prison-- which we didn't have.

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:13.640
So in a funny way, it's
like everybody starts

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.470
in a prisoner of war camp,
so nobody has a history.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.360
And the curious thing is
that everyone got trapped

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.450
in the expanded moment.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:27.440
We bug the cells, and 90%
of all the conversation

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:32.370
was about the prison, the
food, the guards, escape.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.510
That means they knew
nothing about each other.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.180
They knew they're
all college students.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.070
They didn't say, what
school do you go to?

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.420
What are you majoring in?

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:40.990
And nothing about
their future-- what

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:42.800
are you going to do when you
get out, because all of them

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.320
are going to start-- it's
the end of summer school.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.089
They're all going to start
in September in college.

00:32:48.089 --> 00:32:49.880
And I should mention
only two students were

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.512
Stanford students-- one guard
and one prisoner-- because we

00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:54.470
did it in the summer,
and kids are finishing up

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.780
summer school at Berkeley, at
Stanford, and other places.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.890
The movie, it mentions
Stanford three times,

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.800
so some people believe that
they were all Stanford students.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.230
That is done in the basement
of Jordan Hall at Stanford,

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:09.550
but it's universal for college
students, white college

00:33:09.550 --> 00:33:10.660
students mostly.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.920
KYLE ALVAREZ: And my
feeling, too, we obviously,

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.940
we stayed very
true-- I mean I have

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.760
sort of like three-pronged
thing to that.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.320
One is the idea of
saying something

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.410
is based a true story
means nothing anymore.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:24.890
I mean, I remember
when I read the script,

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.480
there was a movie
around that time,

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.170
maybe it was last year or
something or two years ago.

00:33:28.170 --> 00:33:29.753
There was a movie
with Eric Bana where

00:33:29.753 --> 00:33:31.660
he's like a cop fighting
demons in New York,

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.430
and it was based on
the true accounts of--

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.220
and it's not based
on a true story.

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.160
Maybe this guy
says that happened,

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.210
but we know there aren't
demons in New York.

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.870
And so it really started
with "The Exorcist," I think.

00:33:42.870 --> 00:33:44.370
And that's not a
slam on that movie,

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:46.909
but that started with that
idea of the lure, the fear,

00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:48.950
so now when we go see "The
Conjuring," it's like,

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:51.049
"In the summer of,"
that kind of thing.

00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:52.590
And for me, I sort
of felt-- but then

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.173
we look at our really
historical films

00:33:54.173 --> 00:33:56.760
like "Lincoln" brazenly
makes stuff up.

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.280
It changes public voting record.

00:34:00.689 --> 00:34:02.480
At the end of the film
when they're voting,

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:04.060
it just made it up
for more tension.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.060
So that's something that-- and
I feel-- and that's not even

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.600
a slam on that movie.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.630
But for me, I felt like
when you look at that,

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.560
to say our film is, I think
fair when you say about 90%

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:16.310
accurate, I think is an
overwhelming number when

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.239
the movies we look at
or consider historical

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:21.510
probably live more in
the 30%, in many cases

00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:22.889
maybe the 10% or something.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.889
So we set our
threshold much higher.

00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:26.520
Now having said that,
I do think people

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:29.030
who are-- in terms
of a lot of the words

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.901
and the dialogue is
coming from that,

00:34:30.901 --> 00:34:32.650
I suspect, and I haven't
talked to anybody

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.155
who was in the
experiment, I suspect

00:34:34.155 --> 00:34:36.530
they might say something like,
it really wasn't that bad.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:39.889
You watch the footage, and
it doesn't seem that bad,

00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:43.210
but that's where what I was
doing wasn't exaggerating it.

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:45.900
I was saying, OK, well, I'm
telling you to look at this.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.350
You start to question, what's
your job as a filmmaker, not

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.719
a documentarian, but a filmmaker
is to create an emotion.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.440
So I'm putting music in.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.850
I'm putting cuts in.

00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:55.920
I'm putting close-ups in.

00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:57.240
I'm doing all
these things that--

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.240
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Slo-mo.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.000
KYLE ALVAREZ: Slow motion,
I'm doing then performance.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.760
So you're doing things that
say, we're evoking this emotion.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.407
It's not about trying to
Hollywoodize it or create

00:35:06.407 --> 00:35:07.240
something like that.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:09.906
It's just trying to say, this is
the story we're trying to tell.

00:35:09.906 --> 00:35:12.030
So to me, if someone
came-- maybe someone will

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:13.970
come forward and be like, oh,
my god, it was exactly the same.

00:35:13.970 --> 00:35:15.510
And that'd be really
enriching to hear,

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:17.080
but at the same-- or
maybe horrifying--

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.295
but at the same time, if
someone came forward and wrote

00:35:19.295 --> 00:35:20.794
something, it was
nothing like that,

00:35:20.794 --> 00:35:22.600
and it's Hollywood
doing-- I'd be like,

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.640
well, you have the
right to feel that way,

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.145
but we also have the right to
say, OK, here's this close-up,

00:35:28.145 --> 00:35:29.770
and here's this
performance, and here's

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.197
the music, and all the things
that-- it becomes fiction.

00:35:32.197 --> 00:35:34.280
As soon as you put a camera
in front of something,

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.320
as soon as you put a
cut into something,

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.789
it becomes fiction in a way.

00:35:37.789 --> 00:35:39.830
And I mean that speaking
of narrative filmmaking.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.065
That's a totally
different conversation

00:35:41.065 --> 00:35:43.200
than documentary
filmmaking, but even then,

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.070
nowadays documentary
filmmaking, especially the trend

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:49.954
lately has become very
blurry with fiction.

00:35:49.954 --> 00:35:51.370
That's now just
totally different.

00:35:51.370 --> 00:35:52.495
MALE SPEAKER: I understand.

00:35:52.495 --> 00:35:54.470
So speaking of emotion
and invoking emotion,

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.260
so what I appreciated
most about the film

00:35:57.260 --> 00:35:59.870
was not particularly
just the moments

00:35:59.870 --> 00:36:02.470
where things get really
tense, or sometimes there's

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.340
physical force used.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.670
For me, it was when folks
decide that they're out,

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:09.660
when some of the prisoners
decide, I'm done with this.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.865
And they start
trying to find a way

00:36:11.865 --> 00:36:14.550
to scheme a way out of this.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:17.700
I felt by the end of the film
like I was in this theater,

00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.200
and there were times
when I wanted out, just

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.420
like the prisoners.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:24.570
And it was so power--
not from the film,

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.990
but I felt the prisoners
is what I'm saying.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:32.000
What I'm curious about
is, what was the contract?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.690
Were they able to get out?

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:38.835
Was it paramount to keep them
involved as long as possible?

00:36:38.835 --> 00:36:40.210
And I'm saying
it's a compliment.

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.793
I think you guys did
an incredible job

00:36:41.793 --> 00:36:44.152
of making you feel like the
kids who were in the cell.

00:36:44.152 --> 00:36:46.610
KYLE ALVAREZ: What's interesting
on a filmmaking set, and I

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:48.651
think the actual contract
is an interesting thing

00:36:48.651 --> 00:36:50.370
to talk about, was
that I started to--

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:52.480
before the movie premier,
we shot it in October,

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.290
premiered it in January, so it
was a really fast turnaround.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:59.880
And at the premiere-- we
premiered it at Sundance,

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:01.820
and it went from
12 people having

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.340
seen this movie to
two hours later,

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.370
1,300 people have
now seen this movie.

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.745
And so it's an
overwhelming feeling,

00:37:07.745 --> 00:37:09.370
and it was weird,
because I was working

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.180
so hard through the film to
make it brutal by the end,

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.800
but not, so the first
hour of the film, I think,

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.782
has moments of levity.

00:37:15.782 --> 00:37:16.740
There's a lot of humor.

00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.390
I really was telling the cast
and working on the script

00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:23.500
to really make sure it wasn't--
if it was harrowing 10 minutes

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.175
in, you were fucked for the
next hour and 50 minutes.

00:37:26.175 --> 00:37:27.980
Sorry.

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:31.140
And so for me, it was about
trying to earn that ending

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.730
and for it to crescendo
to that as opposed

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:35.930
to being one of
these movies that's

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:37.680
just trying to brutalize you.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.490
But because then,
even in the editing,

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.899
for instance it's 10 minutes
the big final sequence,

00:37:41.899 --> 00:37:43.940
and the first cut of the
film, it was 30 minutes.

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.330
And it wasn't a fat 30 minutes.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:47.410
It was a lot more
stuff happened.

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.580
And so we were
trimming away to say,

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.330
well, we don't want
to make a movie that's

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:53.571
so-- so when it was going
to premiere, my fear was

00:37:53.571 --> 00:37:55.320
that people were going
to be like, ho hum,

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.290
we've seen this before.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:57.540
Like who really cares?

00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:59.289
And the first question
was out there like,

00:37:59.289 --> 00:38:01.904
did you think you made an
experiment on the audience?

00:38:01.904 --> 00:38:03.445
And I didn't understand
the question,

00:38:03.445 --> 00:38:05.450
and I probably
gave a bad answer,

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:08.310
because I thought the
person was criticizing me.

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.940
But I realized what they were
saying was what you just said,

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.170
which was what we
did, and I think

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.430
we earned it through
the effort of not

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:16.680
trying to push people too far.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.530
MALE SPEAKER: I see
what you're saying.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:18.660
KYLE ALVAREZ: I think.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.070
Well, maybe some people will
think we pushed too far,

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.020
but that's where it
really comes down

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.334
to a conversation about editing.

00:38:24.334 --> 00:38:25.750
But it was weird,
because I didn't

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:26.791
anticipate that reaction.

00:38:26.791 --> 00:38:30.230
I was so nervous at the reaction
being, oh, we've seen this.

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:33.400
But instead, it was people
were having that same feeling

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.262
of being hard to talk, and
that's what I wanted to achieve

00:38:36.262 --> 00:38:37.470
but maybe had feared I hadn't

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:38.790
MALE SPEAKER: And just
really quick, just to--

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:40.150
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: And he
also is seeing it edited

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:41.025
while he's directing.

00:38:41.025 --> 00:38:42.170
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.830
KYLE ALVAREZ: And then
you're editing it,

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.260
and you've been watching
it non-stop over and over.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.593
I can't watch the movie anymore.

00:38:45.593 --> 00:38:46.590
I poked my head in.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:48.370
It opened in theaters
in LA last Friday

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:50.862
at the theater I go to
sometimes three times a week,

00:38:50.862 --> 00:38:52.320
and so I was like,
I have to poke--

00:38:52.320 --> 00:38:54.050
I've never seen any of my
own movies on this screen.

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.430
And I poked my head in, and
I was watching one scene,

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:58.360
and then I was like,
I should've done that.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.850
There was a scene where
someone leaned back in a chair,

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:01.770
and I was like, how come
there's not a squeak there?

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.990
You start seeing those things,
and then you have to stop.

00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:05.531
That's why you can't
watch the movie.

00:39:05.531 --> 00:39:07.210
I think I read an
interview, I think

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:10.000
it was Alfonso Cuaron, who did
"Gravity," where he was like,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.515
when I finish the
film, I watch it

00:39:12.515 --> 00:39:13.890
at the premiere
with an audience,

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:15.570
and I never watch it again.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:16.630
It's partly due to that.

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:19.000
It's partly due to I need to be
here and speak about the film,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.350
hopefully in an engaging way,
and if I'm thinking about

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:23.530
the three frames I should've cut
between those shots, you can't.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:25.860
And in addition to that, you
want to be able to move on.

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.985
I'm not one of those people--
I get really confused

00:39:27.985 --> 00:39:30.460
by the filmmakers who go
back and re-cut their movies

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:31.100
years later.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.970
I think there's something
kind of-- I find

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.014
something kind of sad about it.

00:39:35.014 --> 00:39:36.430
Well, sometimes
the director's cut

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:38.346
is because the studios
give you an opportunity

00:39:38.346 --> 00:39:39.350
to put your version out.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:41.134
In this case, this is
enough of my version

00:39:41.134 --> 00:39:42.050
that I wouldn't do it.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.466
There's certainly
some things that

00:39:43.466 --> 00:39:46.214
were contentious between me and
the producers and financiers,

00:39:46.214 --> 00:39:48.380
but nothing I can't live
with at the end of the day.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:51.635
So it being a representative
of the movie I wanted to make,

00:39:51.635 --> 00:39:53.510
I think, well, I don't
want to go back-- yes,

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.540
of course, I'm going to
look back in 10 years

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:56.700
and be like, well, I should've
done a million things.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.600
I look back in 10
months now, less even,

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.100
and want to change
a million things.

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.310
But it was representative
of the restrictions

00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:05.370
I was under physically,
time, money,

00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.510
and it was a representative
of who I was at 31,

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:10.390
and all of these other things.

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:11.850
And you don't want
to change that.

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:13.280
You just want to move on
and then make the next one

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.197
with what you learned.

00:40:14.197 --> 00:40:15.529
MALE SPEAKER: I understand that.

00:40:15.529 --> 00:40:17.990
And just to clarify, when I
mentioned being in the audience

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.365
and wanting to be like, wanting
to [INAUDIBLE], what I mean

00:40:21.365 --> 00:40:23.240
is I'm starting to plot
with these prisoners.

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:25.030
I'm thinking, how
would I get out?

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.864
How would I get out?

00:40:25.864 --> 00:40:28.154
KYLE ALVAREZ: I thought you
meant, is it OK if I leave?

00:40:28.154 --> 00:40:29.890
MALE SPEAKER: No,
and I think you guys

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:31.170
captured that incredibly well.

00:40:31.170 --> 00:40:32.836
So what was it like
for these prisoners?

00:40:32.836 --> 00:40:34.787
How do they get out
if they wanted to?

00:40:34.787 --> 00:40:36.620
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: There
was a magical formula

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.560
that the human subject
committee said.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:41.130
All they had to say is,
I quit the experiment.

00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:43.490
If you say, I want
out, I'm sorry.

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:45.274
I don't understand
that language.

00:40:45.274 --> 00:40:46.940
If they say, I can't
take it, I'm sorry.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:48.280
Wrong language.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:53.660
So essentially, implicitly,
they are saying,

00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:54.930
I quit the experiment.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:58.530
But literally, if they used that
phrase, they would be released.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:03.030
After day one, the word
"experiment" ceases to exist.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.940
They say, I want out, write
a letter to the parole board.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:07.170
So we had a parole board.

00:41:07.170 --> 00:41:09.620
Now in the movie, we
only show one prisoner.

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:15.580
Every prisoner, except one
applied for the parole board,

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:19.040
and the parole board was
headed by an ex-convict,

00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:21.730
brilliantly played,
who had just got out

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.250
of prison after 17 years,
who hated parole boards,

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.880
because they had turned
him down 16 years in a row.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.620
And so he plays the role,
and he becomes his enemy.

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:34.034
And he says that
he literally got

00:41:34.034 --> 00:41:35.950
sick-- he's a friend of
mine, Carlo Prescott--

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:38.580
got sick, because he did
this brilliant performance,

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.540
an improvisational performance,
not for the camera,

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:47.160
but for-- now again,
we had secretaries.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.110
They show me and
the staff there.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:50.210
It was not the case.

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.980
It was secretaries in a
different part of the building,

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:56.970
and the most dramatic thing
that happens at the end,

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.520
he said, OK, take him away.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:05.136
Stand up, and then we ask,
if we were to parole you,

00:42:05.136 --> 00:42:07.010
would you be willing to
forfeit all the money

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:08.680
you have earned as a prisoner?

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:11.144
Everyone says yes.

00:42:11.144 --> 00:42:13.310
The only reason they're
there is for 15 bucks a day.

00:42:13.310 --> 00:42:14.976
They just said, I
don't want your money.

00:42:14.976 --> 00:42:16.550
What should they have done?

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:17.570
I'm out of here.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:18.470
They take away.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:19.580
They put their hands out.

00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.250
Guards put their handcuffs, put
their bag, and take them away.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.830
At that point,
they are prisoners.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:25.537
It's not an experiment.

00:42:25.537 --> 00:42:26.370
MALE SPEAKER: I see.

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.060
I want to turn it
over to the audience,

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:31.029
I have one more question about
this for you, Dr. Zimbardo.

00:42:31.029 --> 00:42:33.570
Coming into the film, and having
done a little research on it

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.010
beforehand, I was really looking
for the moment, the turning

00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:41.990
point where I guess
motivations get changed.

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:44.650
I was looking for the moment
where the guards cross

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:46.267
the line when people change.

00:42:46.267 --> 00:42:48.600
You to talk about these being
smart, intelligent college

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:48.860
students.

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.194
When does that change happen?

00:42:50.194 --> 00:42:51.860
And I noticed I think
twice in the film,

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.390
there's a moment where it
gets a little physical,

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:54.320
it gets a little violent.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.695
There's also a moment where
somebody does try to get out.

00:42:56.695 --> 00:43:00.400
And it seemed in those
moments that the guards

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.090
and your researchers,
everybody looked to you

00:43:03.090 --> 00:43:05.390
and wanted to know what you
thought would happen next.

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.557
And in those moments
initially, before you obviously

00:43:07.557 --> 00:43:09.723
canceled-- you called it
off six days in-- initially

00:43:09.723 --> 00:43:10.980
you said, let's keep going.

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.129
Let's let it run.

00:43:12.129 --> 00:43:13.670
Did you feel caught
up in the moment?

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:15.310
Did you feel like
your own motivations

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:16.660
were changed as well?

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.290
PHILIP ZIMBARDO:
There's no question.

00:43:17.290 --> 00:43:19.090
I mean, the main
part of the study

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:22.540
is-- the most interesting
part of the study for me,

00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:26.230
the takeaway message
is everybody's kids.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:27.360
I'm an old guy.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:30.010
I'm 36, I guess,
or 38 years old.

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:32.660
And I'm a seasoned researcher,
and I get caught up

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.570
in the system I created.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.740
Again, it was by being the
principal investigator.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.990
I should have stopped it at
after the second kid broke

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.490
down.

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:40.840
We proved our point.

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.420
But because I had in my mind
we want to go for two weeks,

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:47.010
and a prisoner breakdown, my
job as principal investigator

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.930
is get a replacement.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:53.180
Get a replacement, and
taking the student out.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.490
So I got trapped in
that role, and there's

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.640
a scene-- the real
transformation was

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:02.430
after visiting days, parents
had to see the superintendent.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.600
So they came to my office
that said Superintendent.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.600
And there's a scene where
I become something I hate.

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.250
I become a sexist, meaning
a mother and father come,

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:13.970
and the mother
says to me, I don't

00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:15.470
mean to make trouble, sir.

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:16.380
Red light, bing.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:18.630
Nobody says that unless
they're going to make trouble.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:22.587
And she says, I've never seen
my son looking so terrible.

00:44:22.587 --> 00:44:24.170
So at that moment--
I know she's going

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.910
to blow the whistle--
I immediately flip,

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:28.650
and I do what every
authority does.

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:31.740
I say, what seems to
be your son's problem?

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:34.020
So I'm making it
dispositional when we're

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.670
studying the situational force.

00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:36.970
I know exactly what happened.

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.940
She said, well, he
hasn't been sleeping.

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:41.570
I said, does he have insomnia?

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:43.600
Again, what's wrong
with your kid?

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:46.417
She says, no, he told
me they wake them

00:44:46.417 --> 00:44:47.500
up all hours of the night.

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.600
I said, oh, yes,
of course we do.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.530
That's the counts.

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:52.720
Each guard shift has
to account for the fact

00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.110
that prisoners have not escaped.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.360
And then she says again, I
don't mean to make trouble.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:59.040
What am I going to do?

00:44:59.040 --> 00:44:59.912
Who's my cast?

00:44:59.912 --> 00:45:01.870
There's the mother who's
going to make trouble,

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:03.860
and there's the father
who's been silent.

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:07.340
Both of them had just seen
their kid looking terrible.

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:08.300
I turn to the father.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:09.770
What do I say?

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:13.620
Don't you think your son
is tough enough to take it?

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.850
At that moment, she's
a silly little woman,

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:20.812
and I think we probably
did this guy shake.

00:45:20.812 --> 00:45:22.020
And he said, of course he is.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.420
He's a real leader.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:26.080
And at that moment, he
says, come on, honey,

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.400
and takes her away.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:31.490
I felt so terrible because, I
realized what I had just done.

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:35.440
I had become, again,
a sexist guy seizing

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.500
the moment for what reason?

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.830
To save my prison, because
she was going to make trouble,

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:41.610
and she would've.

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.470
He broke down that night.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:46.280
He's 819, had a
breakdown that night,

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:47.620
and she was exactly right.

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:50.494
And her husband, the
kid's father sold him out.

00:45:50.494 --> 00:45:52.410
KYLE ALVAREZ: I remember
when we were shooting

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:56.060
that scene in the film that
day, I was sharing a building

00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:59.190
downtown, and it
was Saturday night,

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:01.880
and so people started going out
to the clubs that were nearby.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.660
So there was literally
like drunk people

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:06.160
banging on the doors
of the building

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:07.285
like, hey, what's going on?

00:46:07.285 --> 00:46:08.880
What are you doing in there?

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:12.059
And Billy was trying to
work up the anger you're

00:46:12.059 --> 00:46:14.600
talking about at this woman,
and I could hear him on the mic.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.430
So before he would run takes,
he would say these things

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:16.570
to himself.

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:17.675
He'd be like, this
is my experience.

00:46:17.675 --> 00:46:19.389
You're not taking
this away from me.

00:46:19.389 --> 00:46:20.430
Who do you think you are?

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:23.220
You want me to say these things.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:24.270
They were so great.

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:27.250
It so fascinating to hear how
you-- but you run those things.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:29.610
You don't just think them,
but you say them out loud,

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.491
and then you kind of get that.

00:46:31.491 --> 00:46:32.740
So he would sort of have that.

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.090
And nevertheless, then
there's drunk people

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:38.510
like banging on the windows that
just sort of like came alive.

00:46:38.510 --> 00:46:41.430
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: So again,
forget about the kids.

00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:44.870
So here's me getting
into the role.

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:49.230
Here's Carlo Prescott, a
seasoned criminal, a felon,

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:53.380
who, again, plays the role
of the parole board head

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.490
and becomes that.

00:46:54.490 --> 00:46:56.500
And the third
character is there's

00:46:56.500 --> 00:47:00.660
a scene where a Catholic priest
comes in and talks to the kids.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.430
I taught a course on the
psychology of imprisonment

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:07.450
at Stanford in July with
Carlo Prescott in order

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:09.370
for me to learn about prisons.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.620
And this priest heard
about that and came

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.255
to see me in my
office hours, said

00:47:13.255 --> 00:47:14.880
he was doing a term
paper on something.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.535
Could I give him
some references?

00:47:16.535 --> 00:47:18.009
I said, great deal.

00:47:18.009 --> 00:47:20.550
How about you come-- I will do
that-- how about you come down

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:23.880
to the study, and interview
some of the prisoners

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.090
and tell me how realistic
it is, because he

00:47:26.090 --> 00:47:28.890
had been a prison chaplain
in a prison in Washington.

00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:32.600
He comes down knowing it's an
experiment, and in two minutes,

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.449
he is the prison chaplain.

00:47:34.449 --> 00:47:36.740
And what you see in the movie
is exactly what happened.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:39.920
He introduces, I'm
Father [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:41.440
What's your name, son?

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.510
Almost every kid
said their number.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:44.010
I'm 819.

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:45.160
I'm 216.

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.200
Then he says, what
are you in for?

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.630
And they say, what do you mean?

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.140
What is your charge?

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:52.010
And again, when we
had the police arrest,

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:55.780
the police always said one,
if a violation of penal code

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.000
459 PC, armed robbery,
breaking and entering.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.130
They gave that.

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:03.500
And then he says, what
are you doing to get out?

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.489
I look at-- they say,
what do you mean, sir?

00:48:05.489 --> 00:48:06.280
I don't understand.

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.480
And the words are exact.

00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:10.550
You're in jail.

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:12.650
What are you doing to get out?

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.840
And again, he said, you're
a college student, right?

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:16.700
You need a lawyer.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.274
You're in jail.

00:48:18.274 --> 00:48:18.940
And I'm looking.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:21.020
I'm saying, wow,
he's really into it.

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:23.010
And he says this to each kid.

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:23.860
So he--

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:25.443
KYLE ALVAREZ: It's
a different era too

00:48:25.443 --> 00:48:29.430
where priests represented
something a little bit.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:30.940
I mean this was pre-scandal.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.480
PHILIP ZIMBARDO:
Pre-incest priest.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:33.710
KYLE ALVAREZ:
Yeah, you want to--

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.310
and it was an interesting
thing, because even when

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:36.860
we were trying to
cast that part,

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:40.650
a lot of the actors who came
in played the nice priest.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:44.190
And the one guy who came in and
understood that the scene was

00:48:44.190 --> 00:48:47.150
really more that, that it was
not that he was a mean priest,

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.100
but he was like, what
are you here for?

00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:48.700
What are you in for?

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.630
And it's that thing of like,
wait, you're this priest.

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:52.180
And then also the
next day, there

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.930
was a-- this isn't in
the film-- but there

00:48:53.930 --> 00:48:55.820
was a lawyer who came
in who was-- somehow he

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:56.800
called a lawyer,
one of the kids.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.707
And the lawyer, something
happened where--

00:48:58.707 --> 00:48:59.540
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: No.

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:00.710
One of the kids said--

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:01.270
KYLE ALVAREZ: Oh, that's right.

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:02.440
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: One
of the kids said, I

00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.090
have a cousin who's
a public defender.

00:49:04.090 --> 00:49:05.480
He said, well, we
should get him.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.530
He said, well, I don't
have his number here.

00:49:08.530 --> 00:49:09.960
I'll call my mother.

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.292
So the kid gave the priest
his mother's number.

00:49:12.292 --> 00:49:13.500
The priest called the mother.

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.220
The mother called
the public defender,

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.240
and in the real thing,
the public defender

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:18.640
came down on Friday.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.400
And that's how I
ended this study.

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:21.290
And at that point--

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:22.665
KYLE ALVAREZ: But
even the lawyer

00:49:22.665 --> 00:49:24.911
was using certain
vernacular of, hey, have you

00:49:24.911 --> 00:49:27.160
done your parole hearing
yet, or let's start preparing

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:28.825
what you're going to do.

00:49:28.825 --> 00:49:30.450
There was a certain thing,
where that's what we're saying.

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:32.116
The power of the role,
you give yourself

00:49:32.116 --> 00:49:35.260
even just a little
bit of that ability

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.780
to be that, then you become it.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:37.210
PHILIP ZIMBARDO:
Yeah, so I'm saying

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:38.751
we focus on the
prisoners and guards,

00:49:38.751 --> 00:49:41.150
but I'm saying here's a priest,
here's a public defender,

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:44.240
here's me, here's a
seasoned ex-convict.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:48.000
Everybody starts playing a role,
and that's really the message,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.840
and you become the role.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.240
In fact, in your
life, who are you?

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:54.850
I'm a teacher.

00:49:54.850 --> 00:49:56.003
I'm an educator.

00:49:56.003 --> 00:49:58.800
I'm a Google coder.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:02.049
And then that's your job.

00:50:02.049 --> 00:50:04.340
The job becomes your role,
and then it's your identity.

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:05.048
Say, who are you?

00:50:05.048 --> 00:50:07.290
That's what you say.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:08.390
MALE SPEAKER: Fascinating.

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:11.340
We'd love to turn it over to
you guys for some Q&amp;A as well.

00:50:11.340 --> 00:50:12.540
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: We want
to end with this after Q&amp;A.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.581
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:50:13.581 --> 00:50:15.640
We're going to.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.490
AUDIENCE: My name's
Daniel Steinberg,

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:22.940
and with the experience of
40 years of understanding

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.390
of all this, it seems as
if Abu Ghraib should not

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:29.720
have been a tremendous
shock to those of us

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.110
who had followed any of this.

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:34.900
The question is, is it
possible and is there

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:39.410
any example of a prison in
which this kind of behavior

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:41.442
can be avoided?

00:50:41.442 --> 00:50:42.900
Do any countries
have prisons where

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:46.360
they have a completely
different paradigm that works?

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.690
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Yeah, so
most wonderful coincidence

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:52.790
is that President
Obama last week

00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:56.820
visited a prison for the first
time in the history of America.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:59.570
No president in
several hundred years

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:03.480
ever visited a prison,
meaning that whether or not

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.680
you're liberal or not, we are
paying millions of dollars

00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:12.230
in taxes to maintain 2.3 million
American citizens in prison.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.300
And hopefully, he
looks like he's

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:18.080
going to try to push
some prison reform.

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:20.530
Prisons are designed to punish.

00:51:20.530 --> 00:51:22.250
They are not designed
to rehabilitate.

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:24.310
They're not designed to educate.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:26.110
They're designed to punish.

00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:31.490
Now when a jury or a judge
gives a prison sentence,

00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:34.620
the only sentence is you
have lost your freedom

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:36.460
for this period of time, period.

00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.299
It doesn't say, and
therefore, we're

00:51:38.299 --> 00:51:39.965
going to humiliate
you, therefore, we're

00:51:39.965 --> 00:51:41.330
going to put you in solitary
confinement. therefore,

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:42.880
we're going to punish you.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.480
And the idea is you got all
these guys, many of whom

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.150
are uneducated, have an
opportunity to educate them.

00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:50.110
They're going to be there two
years, three years, five years.

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.250
You can teach them coding.

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:52.940
You could teach them
all kinds of stuff,

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:55.275
and you could teach
them-- original prisons

00:51:55.275 --> 00:51:58.780
were called penitentiaries,
meaning you have time

00:51:58.780 --> 00:52:03.430
to think about the stuff you've
done and be penitent about it.

00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:06.760
But it's been so transformed
into simply places

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:09.930
of punishment, where prisoners
come out mostly broken

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:11.840
and hate the system.

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.530
It turns out there's a prison--
it was in New York Times

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:20.310
a few weeks ago-- in Norway,
which trains the guards on how

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:22.960
to be compassionate,
trains the prisoners

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:26.830
on how to be-- accept
their role with dignity.

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:29.165
And apparently they
have like no recidivism.

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:33.820
I don't remember the name
of it, but it I know there's

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.190
a prison in Norway
that does what you say.

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:38.070
And clearly we need
just a new model.

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:41.210
We need a model--
the other thing

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.280
we should be concerned
about is the data

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:47.650
is that within three years
of being released, 60% to 70%

00:52:47.650 --> 00:52:50.630
of all prisoners released
return on another crime,

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:53.260
in some cases, an
even more severe one.

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:55.789
That means-- that's the
definition of failure.

00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:58.080
So you let somebody out, and
three years later, they're

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.410
doing the same or
worse thing again.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:01.970
AUDIENCE: I'm
Melissa [INAUDIBLE],

00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:03.660
intern actually at
Google this summer,

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:06.280
and actually a psychology
major, so this is pretty fun.

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.404
As a famous psychologist--

00:53:07.404 --> 00:53:09.070
PHILIP ZIMBARDO:
Psychology major where?

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:10.310
AUDIENCE: At George Mason in DC.

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:12.185
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: OK,
yeah, of course, I know.

00:53:12.185 --> 00:53:14.590
AUDIENCE: So how do you feel
about people associating you

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:17.044
essentially only with
Stanford Prison Experiment?

00:53:17.044 --> 00:53:18.460
You've done lots
of other research

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:20.240
and lots of other really
interesting things.

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.364
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Like what?

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:23.562
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:23.562 --> 00:53:24.270
No, you're right.

00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:29.880
I mean, it's just a
little demonstration

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:35.520
we did in six days, and
it one way, it's a curse.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.920
So I never wrote
a book about it.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:40.930
After I did this study,
I wrote a few articles.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:43.440
It became famous
instantly because

00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:47.620
of serendipitous circumstances.

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:52.060
The day after we did our
study on August 21, 1971,

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:56.100
there was an alleged escape
attempt of Soledad Brother

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.970
George Jackson from San
Quentin in which he was killed,

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:01.430
people say murdered
by the guards.

00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:04.370
But before he was released,
all of his buddies

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:07.350
from solitary confinement, who
then killed all the informants,

00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:10.420
killed some guards, and
prisons were in the news.

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.810
Three weeks later, Attica
prisoners revolted against--

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:16.590
took over the
prison, first time,

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.320
took over the whole
prison in sympathy

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.780
to George Jackson's murder.

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:25.895
And suddenly, there was a Senate
Judiciary Committee on crime,

00:54:25.895 --> 00:54:28.270
and here I am knowing nothing
about prisons other than my

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:30.340
[INAUDIBLE], and I'm in
Washington, DC talking

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.280
about prison reform.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:35.030
I'm in San Francisco talking
about juvenile justice.

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:37.730
But I should say--
you'll appreciate this--

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:40.110
so I'm sitting next
to the Superintendent

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:44.060
Mancuso of Attica, Warden
[INAUDIBLE] of San Quentin,

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:47.810
the head of the guard union,
the head of prisoners union.

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:50.040
I know nothing about
prison, so what do I do?

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.460
I say, would you mind if I
began by showing a slideshow

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:56.390
of the research we just did?

00:54:56.390 --> 00:55:00.160
What that means is everybody
now shares the same visual,

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:03.990
and from then on, people said,
as we saw in Zimbardo's prison,

00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:07.022
the guard role
dehumanizes prisoners.

00:55:07.022 --> 00:55:08.480
Not in this
experiment-- they said,

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:11.220
as we saw in Zimbardo's--
so suddenly I had status I

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.810
didn't earn.

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:14.660
And people are
turning to me, why

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:16.500
do you think guards
dehumanize prisoners?

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:18.290
They're talking to me rather
than the superintendent, rather

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:19.320
than these other people.

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.320
So that was [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.270
So the main thing I did
right after the study is I

00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:28.350
began to study the psychology
of shyness in adults.

00:55:28.350 --> 00:55:32.190
Before that, psychologists
only studied shyness in kids,

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:34.710
so this is called
developmental psychologists.

00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:36.219
Their cutoff point is 13.

00:55:36.219 --> 00:55:38.260
Once you get to be 13,
then somebody [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:41.030
So it was as if when you're
13, you stop being shy.

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:42.610
No, nobody studied you.

00:55:42.610 --> 00:55:46.300
So I studied shyness as a
self-imposed psychological

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.960
prison, where the
prison in you says,

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:52.230
here's a list of
things you can't do.

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:56.500
And the guards says what you
can, and the prisoner in you

00:55:56.500 --> 00:55:59.224
says, OK, I deserve
the raise, but I

00:55:59.224 --> 00:56:00.390
won't ask the boss for that.

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.140
I know the answer.

00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:02.737
I won't-- I paid $10.

00:56:02.737 --> 00:56:03.570
I know how to dance.

00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:05.190
I won't ask the girl.

00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:08.250
So essentially, you end
up saying, I'm worthless.

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:09.940
So I began to study shyness.

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:12.150
I had a shyness
seminar at Stanford.

00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:14.080
I started doing
research on shyness

00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:20.640
and discovered that to be not
shy is the rare exception.

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.710
In the universe, there's
not more than 5% to 10%

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.130
of people in any
country who are not shy.

00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:28.230
So shyness, people
say I'm shy now.

00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:29.500
I used to be shy, outgrow it.

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.020
I'm shy in situations.

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:32.060
It's the norm.

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:35.150
So we did research, and then I
started a clinic at Stanford,

00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:38.980
and now it's in Palo Alto
University designed exclusively

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:43.230
to treat shyness, and we get
90% to 100% cure, because we

00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:45.620
know exactly what causes it.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.260
We know how to contain it.

00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:48.290
We know how to treat it.

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:50.410
So that's what I'm most
proud of, because it's

00:56:50.410 --> 00:56:52.110
an interesting idea.

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:54.920
We did research on it, and then
we ended up doing applied--

00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.490
and then I wrote two books,
"Shyness- What It Is,

00:56:57.490 --> 00:57:00.280
What to Do about It," and
"The Shy Child" that sold,

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.930
written for the general public.

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:03.090
So that's my legacy.

00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:04.631
KYLE ALVAREZ: Well,
I definitely feel

00:57:04.631 --> 00:57:08.480
a little-- I felt a little
burdened by that idea too,

00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:11.022
knowing how much he'd done
outside this experiment.

00:57:11.022 --> 00:57:12.980
And part of the thing
that when I came onboard,

00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.300
I kind of had to
say, OK, we're only

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:15.930
making a movie about
these six days.

00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:19.700
If you made a film called, "The
Doctor Philip Zimbardo Story,"

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:21.190
it would be wildly different.

00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:22.572
This would be one portion of it.

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:24.030
And you have to
make that decision,

00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:26.620
because you can't-- we could
only afford one sentence

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:29.920
on a title card at the end
of the film was really all we

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.100
could do to try to
encapsulate that feeling.

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:33.308
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:33.308 --> 00:57:34.860
I get a sentence.

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.760
KYLE ALVAREZ: Yeah,
and it's just one

00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.700
of the challenges of
making it into a movie,

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.630
and you can only hope that
the movie leads people

00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:44.830
to "The Lucifer Effect,"
that then leads people

00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:46.060
to all these other things.

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.170
You can only hope for that or
engineer it to hopefully do

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:52.290
that, but you can't-- the
movie couldn't take on that

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:55.110
responsibility being called "The
Stanford Prison Experiment."

00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:58.310
But it was definitely a
challenge to not include things

00:57:58.310 --> 00:57:59.312
like that.

00:57:59.312 --> 00:58:02.190
AUDIENCE: To what extent do you
think the finding of the study,

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:05.770
the experiment, can be
used as exculpatory excuse

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:07.270
for evildoers.

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:09.390
Like do you worry people
knowing that there

00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:12.274
is this situational evil it
will affect their behavior?

00:58:12.274 --> 00:58:13.940
PHILIP ZIMBARDO:
That's a good question.

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:16.780
So that's what
ties to Abu Ghraib.

00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:20.290
When Abu Ghraib
happened in 2004,

00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:24.250
somebody made a lot of
money releasing 12 images

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:25.870
that the soldiers had taken.

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:27.720
So these were army reservists.

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:31.460
They were not real soldiers,
and that's really key.

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:36.510
They were army reservists,
military police guards,

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:42.420
in the basement in Abu Ghraib
on the night shift, tier 1A.

00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:45.700
It turns out they were 12
of more than 1,000 images.

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:48.430
Many of the images that were
not released are much worse.

00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:51.372
And what happened was I had
a former Stanford student,

00:58:51.372 --> 00:58:53.830
who was working at NPR, and I
happened to be in Washington.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:56.288
He called me and said, hey,
Dr. Z, do you see those images?

00:58:56.288 --> 00:58:56.840
I said, no.

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.930
He said, they're right
out of the prison study,

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:00.680
guards putting bags
over prisoners' heads,

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.460
stripping them naked,
and having them

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.750
simulate sexual activities.

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:06.590
Do you want to come
and talk about it?

00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:10.110
So I did an interview the next
day at NPR, and I said look,

00:59:10.110 --> 00:59:11.840
I know nothing about
that situation,

00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:13.650
but there's enough similarity.

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:16.850
It looks like the Stanford
Prison Study on steroids,

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:19.180
because our study
went for six days.

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.741
This went for three months.

00:59:20.741 --> 00:59:22.990
The abuses took place over
an extended period of three

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:28.640
months, and I said, I want to
believe American soldiers are

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.980
good apples, because remember,
the military and the Bush

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.070
administration, these
are a few rogue soldiers,

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.131
a few bad apples.

00:59:35.131 --> 00:59:37.380
Whenever there's a scandal,
the system protects itself

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:38.570
by saying, don't blame us.

00:59:38.570 --> 00:59:39.730
Blame them.

00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:44.340
And I said, my concern is
somebody put our good apples

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:45.750
in really bad barrels.

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:47.470
So we want to
know, who did that?

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:49.620
And those are the
bad barrel makers.

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.890
So when we want to understand
any human behavior,

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:54.790
it's not enough to make a
dispositional individual now,

00:59:54.790 --> 00:59:57.090
so we have to do a
situational analysis.

00:59:57.090 --> 00:59:58.910
And then we have to
put the situation

00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:00.570
in a systemic context.

01:00:00.570 --> 01:00:03.970
So that's the first time I
used bad apples, bad barrels,

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:05.730
bad barrel makers.

01:00:05.730 --> 01:00:06.570
And that took off.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:08.519
So then I became
an expert witness

01:00:08.519 --> 01:00:10.810
for the guard who should've
been in charge of the night

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:12.580
shift, Chip Frederick.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:17.050
And in my testimony, I
said to the presiding

01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:20.910
judge, Your Honor, Chip
Frederick is guilty as charged.

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:23.060
The fact that he did this
in this unique situation

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:27.490
does not change his
guilt or, innocence, so

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:29.580
the situation is
not excusiology,

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:34.240
but I can say with
all expert confidence

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.179
that he never would have
done that had he not

01:00:36.179 --> 01:00:37.720
been put in that
situation, because I

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.090
studied his entire life from
the time he was born to now.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:44.270
He's an outstanding soldier,
patriot, he won many awards,

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:46.160
and they put him
in this situation,

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.272
which is the most extreme
situation I could imagine.

01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:51.730
I won't go through
all the details,

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:53.700
but you work 12-hour shifts.

01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:56.134
When he finished his shift,
he slept in a prison cell

01:00:56.134 --> 01:00:57.550
in a different
part of the prison,

01:00:57.550 --> 01:00:59.380
because the prison
was under bombardment.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:03.690
And also, the abuses happen
only on the night shift.

01:01:03.690 --> 01:01:05.964
Nine of nine guards
on the night shift

01:01:05.964 --> 01:01:07.630
did these things,
taking these pictures,

01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:09.792
putting prisoners naked
in pyramids, et cetera.

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:11.500
None on the day shift,
how could that be?

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.730
So that's a situational
variable, zero of nine,

01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:15.530
nine of nine.

01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:18.276
It turns out the head
of military police--

01:01:18.276 --> 01:01:20.150
I'm sorry-- the head of
military intelligence

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:23.910
goes to the head of military
police in Abu Ghraib and says,

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:26.122
we're not getting any
actionable intelligence.

01:01:26.122 --> 01:01:27.580
We're interrogating
all these guys.

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.920
We're getting nothing.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.766
And the military, the Bush
administration is on our ass.

01:01:31.766 --> 01:01:35.110
The guys on your night shift
have to take the gloves off--

01:01:35.110 --> 01:01:37.250
so you always use euphemism--
take the gloves off.

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:38.624
They have to break
the prisoners,

01:01:38.624 --> 01:01:41.780
so when we interrogate them,
they'll spill the beans.

01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:43.860
So essentially, you're
giving them total power.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.920
In three months,
there's no evidence

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.030
that any senior officer ever
went down to the dungeon.

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.420
So you're telling them, do
what the fuck ever you want,

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.230
and nobody's going to
notice, except when

01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:54.340
we interrogate them.

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:57.430
Hopefully, they're going
to give information.

01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:59.370
And on the day shift,
senior officers

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:00.520
were there all the time.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.770
So essentially, the
message there is power

01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:06.690
without oversight, power
without surveillance

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:09.360
is a recipe for abuse.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.730
So the worst abuse at
Stanford happened that night,

01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:14.860
because sometime in the night--
I slept in my office upstairs,

01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.680
so I never left the
situation for that week.

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.360
So that's a message.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.590
You give people absolute
power, and without oversight,

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:26.460
without limits or without
constraints, over time,

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.460
that power will be abused.

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:31.640
And so my testimony reduced
the sentence from 15 years

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:32.140
to eight.

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.780
They were going to give
him 15 years, and the worst

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:37.700
that he did physically,
he hit a prisoner once,

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:41.540
but he allowed a lot of
the degrading images,

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:42.980
the degrading practices.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:46.130
AUDIENCE: After you did the
Stanford Prison Experiment,

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:49.020
I'm wondering, did you reflect
on classic works of literature

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.600
like "Lord of the Flies"
and the similarities,

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.557
and what did you make of that?

01:02:53.557 --> 01:02:55.640
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: I taught
"The Lord of the Flies."

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:57.600
I've written about it.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:01.260
And it's a brilliant--
as Goulding

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:06.640
said it's a really brilliant
analysis of ordinary kids

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:12.650
put in a new situation, where
essentially, if you remember,

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:14.910
democracy takes over at first.

01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:17.740
The good kid, the big kids
protect the little kids,

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.170
and then the message
is ultimately,

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:23.460
fascism rules,
authoritarians take over.

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.450
All you need is one or two.

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:34.870
And there's a dramatic
scene in the movie, where

01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:38.250
one of the guys
strips himself naked

01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:40.800
and then paints himself
with the colors,

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:43.510
and he gets the other guys
to change their appearance.

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:45.600
And at that point,
all hell breaks loose.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.510
I actually did research
on deindividuation

01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:50.290
following that,
meaning, what happens

01:03:50.290 --> 01:03:52.570
when you make girls
feel anonymous,

01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:54.720
and their job is to
shock other women--

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.390
I mean college students shock
the other women-- versus when

01:03:57.390 --> 01:03:59.480
they feel identifiable.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.341
They gave twice as
much electric shock,

01:04:01.341 --> 01:04:03.090
held their finger down
on the shock button

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:05.030
twice as long when
they were anonymous.

01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:08.160
So I did that study
before the prisoner study

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.510
based on "Lord of the Flies."

01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:13.730
So again, good literature
taps into good psychology,

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:16.670
and what I try to do is
have good psychology map

01:04:16.670 --> 01:04:17.750
onto good literature.

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:19.250
KYLE ALVAREZ: We
referenced that too

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:20.590
when we were shooting the film.

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:23.150
The last scene when this
character comes in and says

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:26.234
the experiment's over, we talked
a lot about their reaction.

01:04:26.234 --> 01:04:27.650
It was a really
hard thing to get,

01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:29.390
and the guys just
did it right, which

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:30.810
is sort of a sense of relief.

01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:31.570
But we talked a lot about that.

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:34.120
What happens at the end when
they show up and they're saved,

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.292
they immediately
resort back to almost

01:04:36.292 --> 01:04:38.000
like an infantile--
the way it's written,

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:39.647
they start like
crying and wailing,

01:04:39.647 --> 01:04:41.730
and they even start acting
younger than their age.

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:43.813
And it's this interesting
thing of how quickly you

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:46.220
can fall down this
hole, and then

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.970
how quickly our
bodies get out of it

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:52.549
too is really-- In a weird
way, that's almost as alarming.

01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:54.090
It bothers people
that, for instance,

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:55.660
at the end of the
film, none of them

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.010
suffered any long term abuse.

01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:59.010
People don't want
to understand that.

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:01.494
All the reviews I read,
they're like, well, yeah, sure,

01:05:01.494 --> 01:05:03.410
that's what the filmmakers
want us to believe.

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:05.243
And I said, well, no,
that's just the truth.

01:05:05.243 --> 01:05:07.870
Many of them went on-- some went
on to be psychologists, prison

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:08.840
psychologists.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:10.900
None of these guys were
known to be criminals

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.910
or had any kind of
institutionalization

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:14.410
or anything.

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:16.010
And so it's an
interesting thing,

01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:19.260
and I remember talking to the
director of compliance, which

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:21.680
is a subject matter, which
is about the fast food hoax

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.410
that Dr. Zimbardo has
written about too.

01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:25.160
And in his film,
we had on our side

01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:27.044
the benefit of this
being much more famous.

01:05:27.044 --> 01:05:29.460
So people were like, oh, people
know what really happened.

01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:31.345
But after a compliance
period, people

01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:33.364
were furious at him,
because they didn't

01:05:33.364 --> 01:05:34.530
want to believe it was true.

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:36.821
And he was like, they were
mad at me, because they were

01:05:36.821 --> 01:05:38.355
mad at the story in the movie.

01:05:38.355 --> 01:05:39.980
So they were mad--
they couldn't accept

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.850
they were mad at the story,
so they were mad at the movie,

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:43.570
and then in turn were mad at me.

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:45.320
And you can't say,
well, it was real.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.440
You can only say
so much to someone,

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:47.600
because they don't
want to believe it.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.830
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Yeah,
just very briefly,

01:05:48.830 --> 01:05:51.280
I'm not sure how many people
know-- I think with compliance

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.363
was the wrong [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:52.363 --> 01:05:54.650
So there was this
fast food hoax.

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:55.500
KYLE ALVAREZ: That was
the name of the film.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.791
I don't know what the overall--

01:05:56.791 --> 01:05:58.790
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Yeah.

01:05:58.790 --> 01:06:01.240
In 27 different states
in the United States,

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.340
some guy calls a
fast food restaurant,

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:07.130
all different kinds--
McDonald's, whatever--

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.340
and says, one of your
employees-- he says,

01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:11.710
I'm Sergeant Johnson.

01:06:11.710 --> 01:06:13.310
I'm Captain Johnson.

01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:16.940
We have evidence that
one of your new employees

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:19.140
has been stealing,
has contraband.

01:06:19.140 --> 01:06:21.490
We think it's related to drugs.

01:06:21.490 --> 01:06:23.771
You need to send it down
to the police station,

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:25.770
or you can wait, and we'll
come and pick her up.

01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:26.770
And they say, which one?

01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:28.830
Well, the new one, the brunette.

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:29.400
Oh, Jenny?

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.274
Yeah, that's the one.

01:06:30.274 --> 01:06:31.257
It's Jenny.

01:06:31.257 --> 01:06:32.090
He's making this up.

01:06:32.090 --> 01:06:33.186
He's in a phone booth.

01:06:33.186 --> 01:06:34.810
And then what happens
is he said, well,

01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:38.600
bring her to your security
area, and hold her there

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:39.520
for questioning.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.310
And they do.

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:42.980
So now you have security
cameras are covering this,

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:45.077
and then he says, OK,
now while you're there,

01:06:45.077 --> 01:06:45.910
why don't you begin?

01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:47.440
So there's a female employee.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:48.820
Strip her naked.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:52.920
Do an initial search, and
tell us what you're doing.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.756
And then in some
cases, the woman

01:06:54.756 --> 01:06:56.630
says, well, I've got to
go back to the floor.

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:58.921
He said, well, do you have
anybody who could cover you?

01:06:58.921 --> 01:07:00.474
Do you have a
husband, a boyfriend?

01:07:00.474 --> 01:07:02.015
And she says, yeah,
I have my fiance.

01:07:02.015 --> 01:07:04.130
He comes, and now
here's this guy

01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:08.050
with a naked woman and the
guy who's a voyeur saying, OK,

01:07:08.050 --> 01:07:09.564
now I want you to
follow my orders.

01:07:09.564 --> 01:07:11.230
She may have something
under her breast,

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:12.271
so feel under her breast.

01:07:12.271 --> 01:07:15.650
She may have
something in her anus.

01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:18.846
So this poor girl,
18-year-old girl,

01:07:18.846 --> 01:07:20.220
he's now doing
this sexual stuff,

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:24.595
and then finally ends up, OK,
we still think she's guilty,

01:07:24.595 --> 01:07:25.845
so I want to punish her.

01:07:25.845 --> 01:07:28.040
So make her have
oral sex on you.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:31.020
It's all caught on
the security camera.

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:35.120
And he was finally caught by
really good detective work,

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:36.400
but it's not one guy.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.700
I mean, it's one guy, but
it's 27 different places,

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:42.170
and everybody who
sees the film blames

01:07:42.170 --> 01:07:45.770
the woman in the film who
was the security manager.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.760
And she just says, he
was really convincing.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:53.180
I was following orders like
I do as a low level employee.

01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.670
At McDonald's, we follow orders.

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:56.050
People say do this stuff.

01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:58.040
And nobody wanted to believe it.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.440
So they were angry
at the filmmaker.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.427
They were angry at this woman.

01:08:02.427 --> 01:08:04.510
No, the guy you've got to
be angry at is this guy.

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:05.968
KYLE ALVAREZ: Yeah,
the creepy guy.

01:08:05.968 --> 01:08:09.480
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: He actually
got off, because from the time

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.240
he was arrested,
these things stopped.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.560
But there was only
circumstantial evidence.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.810
The good news is the
young woman who was abused

01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:18.010
got a big court settlement.

01:08:18.010 --> 01:08:19.100
MALE SPEAKER: And that's
actually a perfect transition.

01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.729
I promise I'd end with
one final question,

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.939
and I'll ask it to you both,
but in a different way.

01:08:22.939 --> 01:08:24.250
I'll let you guys decide.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.000
So for you, I'll
ask both of you,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.510
but for you, it's
the classic, what

01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:29.020
do you want people to
take away from the film?

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:30.979
And what I'll address
similarly to Dr. Zimbardo

01:08:30.979 --> 01:08:34.810
really quickly is the way this
came up was before we sat down.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:36.560
I told Dr. Zimbardo
that whenever

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:39.670
Kitty Genovese come up, this
trial Milgram's experiment

01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:40.399
comes up.

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:43.417
I am that guy in the room that
says, no, I wouldn't do it.

01:08:43.417 --> 01:08:44.500
I wouldn't have done that.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.749
I wouldn't have gone that far.

01:08:45.749 --> 01:08:47.729
I would've helped
the person in need.

01:08:47.729 --> 01:08:50.490
I would not have let the
situation affect who I am.

01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:52.120
I'm always that guy in the room.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.560
And so the question
there as well,

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.910
you talked about the hero
training that you're doing.

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:58.470
It almost surprises
me what you just

01:08:58.470 --> 01:09:00.970
said that you should blame
the guy in the phone booth

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:01.609
exclusively.

01:09:01.609 --> 01:09:06.180
Is it not also on those of us in
society to stand by our morals

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.733
and risk public
ridicule to do what

01:09:08.733 --> 01:09:09.899
we think is the right thing?

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:12.485
That's my ending question there.

01:09:12.485 --> 01:09:14.609
KYLE ALVAREZ: To take away
from the film, honestly,

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:17.470
I had one goal, which
is just conversation.

01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:19.510
I didn't want the
movie to tell you what

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:21.109
you should be talking about.

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:24.490
The experiment's still
relevant 44 years later,

01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:28.229
and it's relevant, because
it's always relevant.

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:30.700
So I didn't want the movie
to narrow that in or say,

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.609
oh, look at what
happened at Abu Ghraib,

01:09:32.609 --> 01:09:34.337
or I didn't want
to contextualize it

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:36.670
in our history, because I
wanted the movie to sort of be

01:09:36.670 --> 01:09:37.720
able to exist always.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.020
And so for me, it's just if
it leads to conversation,

01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:41.060
then it's great.

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.859
To me, that was the
number one goal.

01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:46.189
Or I should say fruitful
conversation, obviously.

01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:47.550
I mean it leads to
saying, I fucking hated

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:49.359
that movie, that's not
a conversation you want.

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:51.069
But for me, it was,
and that's the goal

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:53.235
that I just don't want to
ever make a movie that you

01:09:53.235 --> 01:09:54.550
forget 10 minutes later.

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:55.549
MALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

01:09:55.549 --> 01:09:58.300
KYLE ALVAREZ: And in this
case, hopefully people

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:00.360
look up the experiment,
and it leads them

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.310
to more understanding.

01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.600
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.480
I think we all did.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:02.979
Thank you.

01:10:02.979 --> 01:10:06.260
PHILIP ZIMBARDO: Prisonexp.org
is a great website

01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:09.450
that I've been involved
with for like 20 years,

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:10.730
and we've just redone it.

01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:14.180
And it everything there is
about the prison study, prisons,

01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:15.710
et cetera.

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:21.090
And so what I would like
to take away is the flip.

01:10:21.090 --> 01:10:24.560
So here, I created evil.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.180
See, criminologists,
sociologists,

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:30.430
study evil from the outside in,
and they interview criminals.

01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:31.760
You visit prisons.

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.080
I wanted to create
evil from inside

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:39.035
out that has put good people in
a bad place and say, who wins?

01:10:39.035 --> 01:10:41.360
If you have a bad place
filled with good people,

01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:43.470
shouldn't they dominate?

01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:47.390
Or if the bad place is
really bad and evil,

01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:49.930
doesn't the place win
and humanity lose?

01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:52.040
And unfortunately,
that's the conclusion.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.490
And in this study, in the
movie, there are no heroes,

01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:01.160
except the woman who challenges
me, confronts me to say,

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.557
what you're doing is wrong,
that these are not prisoners,

01:11:03.557 --> 01:11:05.890
they're not guards, they're
boys, and they're suffering,

01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:09.640
and it's your fault. And
in the real experiment,

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.480
she then says-- we had
just moved in, it shows,

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:16.090
which is true at the
beginning of the movie.

01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:18.360
She says, if this
is the real you,

01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.176
I don't want to continue
my relationship.

01:11:20.176 --> 01:11:21.050
We had just moved in.

01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:22.700
We were planning to get married.

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:23.616
And so that's her own.

01:11:23.616 --> 01:11:25.665
She's willing to give up
a romantic relationship,

01:11:25.665 --> 01:11:29.420
a marital relationship for a
moral principle about kids she

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.750
doesn't even though, but
she saw the suffering.

01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:35.660
So for me, that's really heroic.

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:40.570
So a hero is somebody who comes
to the aid of others in need

01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:43.160
and/or defends a moral cause
aware that there's cost.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.882
So altruism is heroism light.

01:11:44.882 --> 01:11:46.090
You give money to the church.

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:47.530
It doesn't cost you.

01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:50.110
So heroes are rare,
only because people

01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:52.700
in weighing the situation
say it's not worth it.

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.080
So whistleblowers
are proactive heroes.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.949
You see fraud, you
see corruption.

01:11:56.949 --> 01:11:57.990
You have to collect data.

01:11:57.990 --> 01:11:59.850
Often, you have to get
people on your side.

01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:05.170
Most heroes are
really more impetuous.

01:12:05.170 --> 01:12:07.262
You react to the situation
like the famous hero

01:12:07.262 --> 01:12:08.470
in New York, the subway hero.

01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:09.890
A guy falls on the tracks.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:11.890
He jumps on the
railroad track, puts

01:12:11.890 --> 01:12:15.100
the guy between the tracks
as the train goes over them.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.370
For half an inch, he would've
been a dumb, dead hero.

01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:18.950
It would've cut his head off.

01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:24.430
So essentially, when
we finish this study--

01:12:24.430 --> 01:12:28.590
when I started writing "Lucifer
Effect," I realized that I know

01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:32.880
nothing about heroes, because
I started the last chapters,

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:35.130
how do you resist
these powerful forces?

01:12:35.130 --> 01:12:37.310
In all the research,
in all the studies

01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:40.680
of evil in the real world in the
Holocaust, in Bosnia, Rwanda,

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.920
there's always a small
percentage, 5%, 10%,

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.130
never more than 30% of
people who do what-- resist.

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:47.950
I won't go along.

01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:48.783
They don't go along.

01:12:48.783 --> 01:12:51.180
In some cases, they not
only don't go along.

01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:53.360
They challenge the evil.

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:55.810
And I said, you know, I don't
know anything about heroes.

01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:57.393
I never thought about
it, and I should

01:12:57.393 --> 01:12:59.700
have given this woman
who challenged me,

01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:01.900
and we've been
married for 44 years.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:05.830
So I began to do research,
library research on heroes.

01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:07.630
Turns out the word
hero and heroism

01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:10.550
does not exist in any
psychology textbook.

01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:13.780
It's not part of the
positive psychology movement,

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:18.410
because compassion and
empathy are virtues.

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:20.500
Heroism is a civic action.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.990
So essentially, I begin to
say, hey, wait a minute.

01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:24.720
What good is
compassion and action

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.440
if it doesn't lead to
action, because action

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:29.640
is what changes the world?

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:33.130
So I started seven years
ago in San Francisco

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:36.340
a nonprofit called the
Heroic Imagination Project.

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:39.500
The simple goal is to teach
people, all people, especially

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:43.360
young people, to learn how to
express the inner hero that you

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:44.590
all have, especially as kids.

01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:46.120
We really had this inner hero.

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:49.950
Not through superheroes,
which is dramatic,

01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:51.960
but the wrong direction,
because superheroes

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.410
don't have the most
important thing in the world

01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:56.280
that every kid has is a brain.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:59.170
They are the creation of
somebody with a creative brain.

01:13:59.170 --> 01:14:01.540
So we say, you have
something they don't have,

01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:03.764
and with your brain you
could create anything.

01:14:03.764 --> 01:14:05.430
So essentially, we're
going to teach you

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:07.810
how to be a wise and
effective hero, how

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:11.360
to analyze social
situations, how

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:13.630
to take wise and
effective action,

01:14:13.630 --> 01:14:16.760
but the point is we want to
inspire you to always take

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.090
the right action.

01:14:18.090 --> 01:14:20.370
Stand up, speak out in
challenging situations

01:14:20.370 --> 01:14:22.991
starting in your family, in
your school, in your community.

01:14:22.991 --> 01:14:24.490
And then we have a
training program.

01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:28.130
We teach people how to do this,
and then the other thing we do

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:32.290
is I started a
revolution in education.

01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:35.900
We have a number of lessons
about the bystander effect,

01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:39.220
about-- I know Carol Dweck was
here from Stanford last week.

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:41.800
How do you transform
a fixed mindset,

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.840
which is to say I'm good or
not good at this, to a growth

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:45.480
mindset?

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.370
I'm good at anything if I put
in enough practice and effort.

01:14:48.370 --> 01:14:50.580
How to reverse
prejudice, how to change

01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:53.510
groups that have negative
influence to positive,

01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:55.610
so we call this
understanding human nature,

01:14:55.610 --> 01:14:57.470
and we have six
of these programs.

01:14:57.470 --> 01:15:00.435
We hope to have four
more on conservation

01:15:00.435 --> 01:15:02.320
and sustainability.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.780
But what's revolutionary
is teachers don't teach.

01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:08.500
We give them a script,
and all the programs

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:10.822
organize around powerful
videos, because kids

01:15:10.822 --> 01:15:11.780
live in a visual world.

01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:14.290
We show a video, and instead
of having a class discussion,

01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:16.926
the teacher has pairs,
pairs or triads.

01:15:16.926 --> 01:15:18.800
And we try to have a
boy and a girl together,

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.300
because boys never
answer in class.

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:21.360
Girls always do.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:23.980
And so essentially,
you show the video

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.890
of a failure of a
bystander, and then you say,

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:28.160
what were the people thinking?

01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:29.034
Why didn't they help?

01:15:29.034 --> 01:15:30.010
What would you do?

01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:31.370
What's the difference between
looking in at a situation

01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:32.420
and being in?

01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:34.410
Then we show them the
Kitty Genovese video,

01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:36.600
and we say, how does
anybody study this?

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:39.770
Then we show them video
of social psychologists

01:15:39.770 --> 01:15:40.750
study this.

01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:43.440
And then we say,
when should you help?

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.490
When should you not help?

01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:47.789
And then think of a
time when you helped.

01:15:47.789 --> 01:15:49.330
Think of a time when
you didn't help.

01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:52.310
And then we go through, so
each of the six programs

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:53.870
has the same eight activities.

01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:57.320
So once the teacher learns to
do one, it's easy to transfer.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.210
And then the key is at the end,
you say, OK, spread the word.

01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:03.147
That's activity eight.

01:16:03.147 --> 01:16:03.980
What does that mean?

01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:05.860
What's the most interesting
thing you learned today?

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:06.970
And the kid writes it.

01:16:06.970 --> 01:16:08.820
Now tell somebody.

01:16:08.820 --> 01:16:09.980
They write it down.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.870
Tell your mother, your cousin,
your bus driver, the grocery

01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:16.760
man, and then the next week
says, what did your mother say?

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:18.225
My mother couldn't believe it.

01:16:18.225 --> 01:16:20.600
How could it be that when
there's a lot of people around,

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.210
nobody helps?

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:23.030
It's better to have just one.

01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.670
Now go back.

01:16:23.670 --> 01:16:26.270
Ask your mother if she
could tell one other person.

01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:30.450
So now this little lesson, which
we now have in remote areas

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.470
in Hungary.

01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:35.130
Some mother is telling the
butcher about the bystander

01:16:35.130 --> 01:16:36.420
effect.

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:40.690
So in that sense, it's really
a revolution in education.

01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:43.850
And the problem we have
is we started here.

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:47.400
We cannot get our program in
any San Francisco high school,

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:51.490
because the high schools,
they say, if it's not STEM,

01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:54.750
it's not preparing for the
exams, we can't work it in.

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:58.010
So our program is all over
Hungary, it's all over Poland,

01:16:58.010 --> 01:17:01.540
it's in Corleone, the
Godfather town in Sicily,

01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:06.730
and so right now we're
trying to-- we just applied

01:17:06.730 --> 01:17:08.720
for a Google community
grant, because I

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.480
have virtually no staff.

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:12.440
But we have a hero
factory in my basement.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.760
We're creating these
little, little heroes.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:15.760
So we need a staff.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:20.460
We need sophisticated help
to move it to the next level.

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:21.460
So we have the material.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:25.050
We have the desire
and the inspiration.

01:17:25.050 --> 01:17:26.050
MALE SPEAKER: Wonderful.

01:17:26.050 --> 01:17:26.840
Well, thank you both.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.680
PHILIP ZIMBARDO:
Thank you so much.

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.971
MALE SPEAKER: Great to see you.

01:17:28.971 --> 01:17:31.630
[APPLAUSE]
