00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.150
- [Instructor] In previous videos,

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.300
we introduced the idea
of a production function

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.530
that takes in a bunch of inputs.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.600
Let's call this input one,
input two, input three.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.180
And that based on how much of
these various inputs you have,

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.560
your production function
can give you your output.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.960
In this video, we're going to constrain

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.180
all of the inputs but one,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.200
to really take it down to
how does our output vary

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.580
as a function of one input.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.160
And as we do that, we're
going be able to understand

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.210
these ideas of total product,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.070
marginal product, and average product.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.960
So, to give you a tangible example,

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.880
let's say that we are
running an ice cream factory

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.660
and we care about how much our
ice cream production per day

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.850
varies as a function
of the number of people

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.460
working in the factory.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.500
So, let me write this down.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.920
So, per day

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.970
ice cream,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.433
ice cream production,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.030
production.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.780
And so, let me make a table here.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.410
So, in our first column,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.840
I am going to put our labor,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.280
which you could view as the input

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.050
that we're going to see
how does that drive output.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.093
So, I will put Labor.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.733
So, you could view this
as workers per day.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.010
Workers.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.160
And we're going to see
how our output varies

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.900
whether we have zero
workers, one worker per day,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.500
two workers per day, or
three workers per day.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.820
Now, our next column
would just be our output,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.990
and we'll say that's our total product

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.260
as a function of labor.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.620
TP standing for total product.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.740
And let's say that we know,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.900
if we have zero people working
in our ice cream factory,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.570
well then, we're going to produce
zero gallons of ice cream,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.110
and let's just assume that our output

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.430
is in gallons, and it's gallons per day.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.210
If we have one worker at our factory,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.120
well then, we're going to be able

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.410
to produce 10 gallons a day.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.430
If we have two workers in our factory,

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.780
we're going to produce 18 gallons a day.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.900
And if we have three
workers in our factory,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.030
let's say we can produce 24 gallons a day.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.230
Fair enough.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.910
Now, I'm going to introduce an idea,

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.330
and you've seen this
word marginal, perhaps,

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.020
in other times in your life.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.680
I'm going to introduce
marginal product of labor.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.300
And the way to think about marginal,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.740
that's how much for every
increment of one thing,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.810
how much more of the
other thing do you get?

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.170
So here, our marginal product of labor

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.580
says, for each incremental unit of labor,

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.754
for each incremental person
working there per day,

00:02:37.754 --> 00:02:41.440
how many more gallons of
ice cream am I producing?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.950
So, my marginal product of labor,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.310
when I go from zero to one worker,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.210
I'm able to produce 10 more
gallons from that first worker.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.740
Now, what about when I go from
one worker to two workers?

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.570
Well then, I go from 10 to 18 gallons.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.250
So, that second person

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.620
gets me an incremental
eight gallons per day.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.810
And then as I go from
two people working there

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.860
to three people working there,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.760
well, my total product goes up by six.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.300
So, my marginal product of labor

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.300
for that third worker is going to be six.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.270
Now, there's something interesting

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.190
that you're immediately seeing here,

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.940
and this is actually pretty typical,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.100
is that your marginal product of labor

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.920
will oftentimes go down

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.760
the more and more people that you add.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.040
And you might say, why is that the case?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.040
Well, they're just not gonna
be quite as productive.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.900
That second person might be waiting

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.210
while the first person is using the mixer

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.100
and that third person is gonna be waiting

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.950
while the first person
and the second person,

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.630
maybe they're using the
restroom or something

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.030
and the third person has to go.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.730
And you can imagine,
you add four, five, six,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.640
at some point, you're not even be able

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.290
to fit people into the factory,

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.290
and so you're going to have

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.580
what's known as a
diminishing marginal return,

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.990
and you see that right over here.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.470
As you're adding more and more labor,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.270
your marginal return is
getting smaller and smaller,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.660
so this is a diminishing marginal return.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.900
Now, the last concept I'm
going to introduce you to

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.830
in this video is that of average product,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.450
and this is average product
as a function of labor.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.890
So, AP for average product.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.050
And all that is, is our total
product divided by our labor.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.790
So over here, when we have one worker,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.430
our total product is 10 gallons,

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.660
and we're going to divide
that by one worker.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.370
So, our average product per worker

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.290
is going to be 10 gallons.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.660
Now, when we have two
people working per day

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.150
and we're producing 18 gallons per day,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.270
our average product as a function of labor

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.280
is gonna be 18 divided by two,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.210
which is gonna be nine gallons

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.020
per worker per day on average.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.880
And then in this last situation,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.900
it's going to be 24 divided by three,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.900
which is eight gallons per
worker per day on average.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.490
And you can see this visually as well.

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.550
I can draw this on a curve.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.170
Let me do that.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:10.590
So, if on our horizontal axis,

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.940
I have our labor units,
which is workers per day,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.950
so one, two, and three.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.950
So, this is labor right over here.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.550
In our vertical axis, I'll
have our total output.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.150
So, total product, I could say.

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.550
So let's say that's 10, 20.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.240
Let's say that is 30 right over there.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.510
Well, this first one right over here,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.630
when we have one person
working in the factory,

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.010
we produce 10 gallons per day.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.920
And this is total product right over here.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.360
When we have two people
working in our factory,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.610
we produce 18 gallons a day.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.950
So, it's gonna be just like that.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.870
And notice, the slope has
gone down a little bit.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.810
We have a certain slope here,

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:57.550
but it's a little less steep there.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:00.800
And that steepness of that
line or of that curve,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.120
that tells you about the marginal product.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.380
So, it's a little bit less steep,

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.150
so our marginal product of labor
has gone down a little bit.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.820
We're having diminishing marginal returns.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.470
And then last but not least,

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.490
when we have three people
working, we're able to produce 24,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.800
so three and 24 might be right over there.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.900
And once again, we can see
our diminishing returns

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.620
gets even a little bit flatter.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.480
We go from zero to one, we added plus 10,

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.950
and you can see that there in
the marginal product of labor.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.180
And then as we add one more
person, it goes plus eight.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.080
And then we add another
person, it guess plus six.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.850
So in general, if you see total product

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.950
as a function of labor,

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.990
or total output as a function of labor,

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.850
and the curve is getting
less and less and less steep,

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.730
well, that tells you that
your marginal product

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.040
is going lower and lower

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.823
and you're getting
diminishing marginal returns.
