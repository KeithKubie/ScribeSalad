[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.611 --> 00:00:05.860
NOVA REN SUMA: Thank you so
much for that great intro,

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.910
[? Sunny. ?] So I'm
Nova, and I am here

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.560
to talk about "The Walls
Around Us," which just came out

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.830
this spring from Algonquin.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.310
And this is a young
adult novel, a YA novel.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.530
And I've said this before
outside of this room,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.840
but I'll say this here.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.520
I write stories about
teenagers, most specifically,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.250
teenage girls, but that
doesn't necessarily

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.120
mean that my books
are for teenagers.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.290
My books are for anyone who
is interested in that moment

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.160
in time, that point of being,
that urgent, frightening,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.580
exciting point of
being a teenager,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.880
that point when everything
seems important, and dire,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.380
and it seems like your whole
life is about to start,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.150
although, life has
already started,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.270
and that exciting point in
life is what I write about.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.060
And that's what found its way
into "The Walls Around Us."

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.250
But what also found its way
was some supernatural elements

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.060
and some ghosts.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.280
So when I first started thinking
of what I wanted to write next,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.750
as this is my fourth
book, I was thinking,

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.030
I really want to
write a ghost story.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.610
And I didn't know where
to start with that.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.470
I just knew somehow, I
want to write something

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.150
that feels like a classic
ghost story somehow,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.930
but is also really
steeped in the real world.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.520
And my inspirations--
a direct inspiration

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.530
would be Shirley
Jackson, who I love.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.030
"We Have Always
Lived in the Castle"

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.780
is a favorite book of
mine, and of course,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.990
"The Haunting of Hill House,"
which is really chilling

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.050
and gave me a nightmare.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.110
So that's the
direct inspiration,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.830
and also, David Lynch films.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.070
I'm a huge "Twin Peaks" fan.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.275
And what I love is that everyday
place, that ordinary world,

00:01:55.275 --> 00:01:56.770
or ordinary town.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.161
And then there's some
strange little oddity,

00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:03.050
something other, something odd.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.560
And I always like to play
with that in my writing.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.020
So I was thinking about I want
to write something surreal.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.200
I want to write
something with ghosts.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.950
And I thought, I need a place.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.070
I need a solid place
to set this story.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.080
Good ghost stories have a
really strong sense of place.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.230
And what came to me,
around the same time,

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.696
I was also watching a lot
of-- I don't even know why

00:02:28.696 --> 00:02:31.630
at the time, watching a lot of
documentaries about prisons,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.460
reading a lot about
people incarcerated.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.030
It was just an interest
of mine, and something

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.460
that I was just collecting, and
I didn't necessarily know why.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.110
And then I thought, I can set
this ghost story in a prison.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.630
And then, of course, because
I write about teenagers,

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.440
it could be a juvenile
detention center.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.030
And of course, because I
write about teenage girls.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.410
Most specifically, it could be
an all girls juvenile detention

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.390
center.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.540
So I created this imaginary
juvenile detention center

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.380
far up in upstate New York.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.260
As Sunny said, I'm
from the Hudson Valley,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.200
but this is a little farther
north than where I grew up.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.780
I imagined it to be on
the top of a tall hill,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.975
with grey stone walls, and
three lines of fencing,

00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:24.420
and barbed wire.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.380
And I imagine that originally,
it was a prison for adult men,

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.560
and that it was
converted and renovated

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.670
to house teenage girls who had
committed violent crimes, very

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.530
serious crimes.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.380
So I had my place.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.020
I had this sense of
where the story would be.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.460
And yet, for me, as a writer,
a place is not enough.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.800
What I need is a character.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.450
I need a person.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.630
I need a voice.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.980
So I needed to find my voice.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.930
And that's really how
I start a story is

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.990
to find how the person
telling the story

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.960
is going to let
us into her world.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.770
I often write in first person.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.210
So I was coming up with
this character named Amber.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.000
She has been incarcerated in
the aurora hills secure juvenile

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.600
detention center since
she was 14 years old.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.860
She was convicted
of manslaughter

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.930
for killing her stepfather.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.297
And I knew that this
would be my character,

00:04:29.297 --> 00:04:30.880
but I didn't know
how she would speak.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.680
It's so important to
know how she speaks.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.910
And so I began to write
strangely in second person,

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.769
meaning she's saying
we, instead of I.

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:45.060
And then I realized that it
wasn't a true second person

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.560
voice.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.620
It was more that
my character was

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.260
telling everyone else's
stories, in addition to her own.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.890
She was seeing everyone
else around her.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.190
She's the person sitting at
the table, at the corner,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.815
being very quiet, listening
to everyone else talk,

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:01.190
and collecting their stories.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.900
And that's the kind
of narrator that she

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.470
exposed herself to be when
I was trying to invent her.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.070
So around the time that I'm
inventing, thinking of Amber,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.520
and thinking of this story
that I knew I wanted to write,

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.150
this ghost story
in this prison, I

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.070
got a writing residency,
an artist residency

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.530
at the Millay Colony
in upstate New York,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.270
in Austerlitz, New York.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.330
And the Millay Colony
is on Edna St. Vincent

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.480
Millay, the poet's property.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.570
And there's actually
the colony area,

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.215
and then across the street is
Steepletop, Edna St. Vincent

00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:40.800
Millay's house.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.120
Her grave site is
on the property.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.290
There's just this
refuge away from things.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.840
And it houses-- you can
get a month long residency,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.800
and it's for
writers, and artists

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.680
of all disciplines, composers.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.570
So I had this residency for
November, in November, I think,

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.030
of 2012.

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.150
And all I knew going
up there is that I

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.270
wanted to write this book.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.640
And I had this character,
but I didn't have any pages.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.240
I didn't have any start to it.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.590
It was just this
kernel in my head.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.720
And I had this month
long period to write it

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.200
at the Millay colony.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.630
And when you get an artist
residency like this,

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.930
there's no one looking
over your shoulder.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:27.790
There's no one at
the end of the week,

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:29.230
like how many pages
did you write,

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.190
or at the end of your
stay, asking even

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.750
to see what you've done.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.090
No one is checking
up on you, which

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:37.130
is a wonderful sense of
freedom, that you can

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.670
use the time however you want.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.660
But at the same time,
there's that pressure

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.000
that you give yourself.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.160
I was going away from
home for four weeks

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.710
to produce something,
and so my goal

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.760
was I'm going to write so much.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.160
I'm going to make so much
progress in this book.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.520
I had a really high
standard for myself

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.100
on what I wanted to produce.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.520
But when I got there,
things don't always

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.540
work out as you hope, and
creativity is hard to rein in.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:09.330
And I kept writing, trying
to write in Amber's voice,

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.800
and I kept getting stuck, and
I kept writing pages I thought

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.500
were awful.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.640
I kept throwing them
out, just feeling really,

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.170
this is not right.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.910
I couldn't find the
way into the story.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.105
So my time there became I
would sit down at my desk

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:27.480
and try and write
in the morning,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.770
and just be really focused.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.040
And I would write awful
things that I hated

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.450
that were not worth keeping.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.860
I had to read for a
little bit, I'd try again.

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.580
And then at the end of the
day, this was in November.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.850
So before sunset,
before dinner, I

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.020
would take a walk
outside in the property,

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.995
and just waring with myself,
and angry with myself,

00:07:47.995 --> 00:07:49.370
like you're not
getting anywhere.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.930
What's going on?

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:54.220
So there was this trail on the
Millay Colony property called

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.010
the Poetry Trail.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:08:00.230
And along the path,
in through the woods,

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.530
are these poems, or
excerpts of poems

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.820
by Edna St. Vincent Millay, just
little signposts on the side.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.710
And I would walk along and
read these poems every day,

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.150
just absorbing them
again and again.

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.730
And I should say, this is
upstate New York, in the fall,

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.160
during hunting season.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.660
So the artists were
told, if we want

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.800
to go walking alone,
wear bright colors.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.670
So I'd be walking
the poetry trail

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:30.050
with this bright orange
vest on over my sweater,

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.340
watching the sunset
through trees.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.816
No one else was ever on
the trail when I was on it.

00:08:34.816 --> 00:08:38.069
And I would walk all
the way down to the end,

00:08:38.069 --> 00:08:40.110
starting off feeling really
bad about my progress

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.980
during the day, but
stopped thinking about it.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:47.930
And just sometimes, ideas come
when you're not forcing them.

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:51.080
Just kept walking, and Edna
St. Vincent Millay's grave

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.100
is at the end of this trail,
as well as her mother's grave.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.300
And I would just sit there,
and think for awhile,

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.090
and then go back in, and that
would be the end of the day,

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:02.950
and then we'd have dinner.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:06.640
And toward the end
of my residency,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.840
something clicked,
and I realized that I

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.600
had found this voice for Amber.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.600
I had a phrase.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.000
All I knew is that it would
start with "We went wild."

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.150
I had three words.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.350
And that could be
anything in this story.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.560
I knew it would set
in a detention center.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.780
So I was thinking,
this could be a riot.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.580
This could be, I don't know.

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.860
What crazy thing is happening
in which these girls go wild

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:35.720
inside the walls of this
juvenile detention center.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.140
So I started writing,
and I got a sentence.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.550
I got a paragraph,
and that's all I got.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:48.450
I basically spent a month
writing one paragraph,

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:52.100
and this is writing every
day, trying very hard.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:55.740
But this one paragraph
led me into this story.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.620
This was the voice
that I was looking for.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.200
This was the entryway
into this world.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.000
This was everything I needed.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.100
And in fact, as you'll
hear, because I'm

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.050
going to read from it, and
you'll hear this paragraph,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.200
the paragraph that I wrote
there, in the first draft,

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.080
ended up being almost exactly
the same in the final book

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.330
after all the edits it went
through, and revisions,

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.900
and working with my editor.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.140
I think there were maybe two
word changes or something.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.920
But it ended up being the exact
right way to tell this story,

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.780
after all that searching.

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.740
And even though I
went home thinking,

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.450
I went away for a month, and
here, I have one paragraph,

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.050
it really was the right
thing for this book.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:41.080
Sometimes, things happen
very, very slowly.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.100
And sometimes, it takes
you an entire month

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.610
of writing every day to
come up with one paragraph.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:52.600
So I thought that I would
read from the first chapter.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.200
And you'll get a sense
of Amber's voice,

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.030
and you'll also
hear the paragraph.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.355
But also, what happens after
the paragraph, where it led me.

00:11:06.572 --> 00:11:10.370
And you'll recognize
the three words.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.035
We went wild.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.020
We went wild that hot night.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:21.620
We howled, we
raged, we screamed.

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:29.180
We were girls, some of us
14 and 15, some 16, 17.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:32.800
But when the locks came undone,
the doors of our cells gaping

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.620
open, and no one to
shove us back in,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.730
we made the noise of
savage animals, of men.

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:43.655
We flooded the corridors,
crowding together,

00:11:43.655 --> 00:11:46.770
and the clammy, cooped up dark.

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.580
We abandoned our
assigned colors.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.230
Green for most of us, yellow
for those of us in segregation,

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:58.630
traffic cone orange for anyone
unlucky enough to be new.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.350
We left behind our
jumpsuit skins.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.470
We showed off our
angry, wobbly tattoos.

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.520
When outside, the
thunder crashed,

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.370
we overtook A wing and B wing.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.560
When lightning flashed,
we mobbed C wing.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.940
We even took our
chances in D wing,

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:20.580
which held suicide
watch and solitary.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:24.130
We were gasoline,
rushing for a lit match.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.160
We were bared
teeth, balled fists,

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.620
a stampede of slick feet.

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.220
We went wild, like anyone would.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.120
We lost our fool heads.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.570
Just try to understand.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.100
After the crimes that
had put us inside,

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.790
after all the hideous things we
were accused of and convicted

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.260
of, the things some of us
had done without apology,

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.970
and some of us had sworn
we were innocent of doing,

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.590
sworn on our mothers
if we have mothers,

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:57.460
sworn our pets if we ever had
a puppy dog or a scrawny cat,

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.990
sworn on our own measly
lives, if we had nobody--

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:06.010
after all that time behind bars,
on this night, we were free.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:07.300
We were free.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.440
We were free.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.590
Some of us found
that terrifying.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.090
On this night, the first
Saturday of that now

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.120
infamous August,
there were 41 girl's

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.160
locked up in the Aurora Hills
Secure Juvenile Detention

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.710
Center in the far northern
reaches of the state, which

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.970
meant we were one
shy of full capacity.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:30.910
We weren't yet 42.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.080
To our surprise, to
our wide-eyed delight,

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.350
the cells of B wing and C wing,
of A wing, and even D wing,

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:39.640
had come open.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:42.200
And there, we stood, a
thunder of thudding hearts

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.920
in the darkness.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.770
We stood outside or cages.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.770
We stood outside.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.030
We looked to the guard stations.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.900
They were unmanned.

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:57.670
We looked to the sliding gates
at the end of our corridors.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.700
They were wide open.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.100
We looked to the flood lights
wringing the high ceiling.

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:05.250
The bulbs had gone dim.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:07.430
We looked, or we tried to look.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.570
It was the way our bodies
pulled through the window slits

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.490
and into the storm
pounding outside,

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:14.510
all across the compound.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.620
If only we could see just pass
the triple fenced perimeter,

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:22.000
over and beyond the
coils of barbed wire,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.560
past the guard's tower,
past the steep road

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.780
that plunge downhill to the
tall iron gate at the bottom.

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.820
We remembered from when
the blue painted short bus

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.640
from the county jail
had carried us up here.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.310
We remembered we weren't so
far from the public road.

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.670
That was when it hit
us how little time we

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:45.200
were sure to have before
the corrections officers

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.364
returned to their posts.

00:14:47.364 --> 00:14:49.030
Maybe we should have
been sensible about

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:52.070
our sudden freedom, cautious.

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.980
We weren't.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:58.120
We didn't stop to question
the open locks-- not then.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.050
We didn't pause to wonder why
the emergency lights hadn't

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:04.690
blinked on, why the
alarms didn't blare.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.850
We didn't think either
about the COs who

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:08.810
were supposed to
be on night duty,

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.370
where they could have gone,
why their booths were empty,

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.180
their chairs bare.

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.150
We scattered.

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:15.400
We spread out.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.240
We pushed through
barriers that were always

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.100
locked to us before.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.170
We ran.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:24.460
The night burst open, the way
a good riot tends to, when

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.000
it takes over the
yard, and no one

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.950
knows who started what or cares.

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.390
The shouts and screams,
the whops and wales.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:36.660
41 of the worst female juvenile
offenders in the state set

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:41.760
lose without warning, or reason,
or armed guard to take us down.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.220
It was beautiful,
and it was powerful,

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.819
like lightning in our hands.

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:48.610
Some of us weren't
thinking and only wanted

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:50.400
to kick in the glass
fronts of the vending

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.060
machines in the
canteen for snacks,

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:56.280
or pillage pills from
the clinic to get a fix.

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:59.440
Some of us wanted to pound a
face in and jump someone, jump

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.420
anyone.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:02.240
It didn't matter who.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:05.170
A couple of us simply
wanted to slip out back

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.740
under the murky cloud
covering and shoot some hoops

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.500
in the rain.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.060
Then there were
those of us, the ones

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.270
with brains who took a
breath and considered,

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:17.650
because with no COs
coming at us with clubs

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:21.650
out, no alarms bleeding or
intercoms crackling commands

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.330
to herd us back to
our cells, the night

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:29.710
really was ours for the first
time in days, weeks, months,

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:31.170
years.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:34.155
And what's a girl to do with
her first free night in years?

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:40.010
The most violent among
us, the daddy killers,

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.740
the slitters of stranger's
throats, the point

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.750
blank shooters of pleading
gas station attendants

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.170
would later admit to
finding a sense of peace

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.200
in the plush darkness,
a kind of justice

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.690
not offered by the
juvenile courts.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:58.400
Sure, some of us knew we
didn't deserve this reprieve.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:00.590
Not one of us was
truly innocent,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.490
not when we were made to
stand in the light, our bits,

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.760
and cavities, and
cavity fillings exposed.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.380
When we faced this
truth inside ourselves,

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.599
it somehow felt more
ugly than the day

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.910
we witnessed the judge say,
guilty and heard the courtroom

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.140
cheer.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:19.530
That was why a few
of us hung back,

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.640
didn't leave ourselves where we
kept our drawings and our love

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:26.050
letters, where we
stewed our one good comb

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:27.660
and stashed all
our Reese's Peanut

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.040
Butter cups, which were
like gold doubloons

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.790
up in Aurora Hills, since we
didn't have access to cash.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:36.390
Some of us stayed
put in the place

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:40.000
we knew, because
what was out there?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.570
Who would keep us
safe on the outside?

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.290
Where really would a girl
from a Aurora Hills, who

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.650
disappointed her family and
scared off English teachers,

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.440
and social workers,
and public defenders,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.480
and anyone who
tried to help her,

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.970
a girl who terrorized
her neighborhood,

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.810
who was as good as
garbage, she'd been told,

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.020
who was probably
best left forgotten,

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.550
she'd read this in
letters from home.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.720
Where was a girl
like that to go?

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.130
A lot of us did try to run,
even if it was only habit.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:16.100
Some of us had been
running all our lives.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.380
We ran, because we could,
and because we couldn't not.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.950
We ran for our lives.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.160
We still thought they
were worth running for.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.000
Most of us didn't get far.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.660
We got distracted,
overexcited, overcome.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.630
A couple of us came
to a stop somewhere

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:34.540
in one of the hallways
outsider designated wing,

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:38.530
and sank to the cracked and
pitted floor in gratitude,

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.950
as if we'd been acquitted
of all our crimes,

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:43.540
our records expunged.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.250
This felt like
everything we dared

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.770
let ourselves dream, when the
taunting fantasy slipped in

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.840
between the bars.

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.330
Wishes for fast getaway
cars or Rapunzel

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:56.910
ropes to climb out the
narrow window openings, pleas

00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:00.800
for forgiveness, for vengeance,
for glittery new lives

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.450
on some far off riviera,
where we'd never again have

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.020
to face hate, or law, or pain.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.370
It was happening to us.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:12.880
We never did believe it
could happen to kids like us.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.370
Some of us cried.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:19.360
There we were, set loose
on the defenseless night,

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.500
instantly wanting
everything we could imagine,

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.960
to thumb a ride at
the nearest freeway,

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.940
to call an old
boyfriend and get laid,

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.330
to have a never ending
breadstick feast at The Olive

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:37.590
Garden, to sleep under fluffy
covers, and a large, soft bed.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.800
That August marked my third
summer at Aurora Hills.

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.650
I've been locked up
here since I was 14.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.880
Manslaughter, I played innocent.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.370
I stuffed myself into a skirt
and sheer hose for trial.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.830
My mother turned her face
away when I was found guilty

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.730
and hasn't look my way since.

00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:59.260
But it's not my arrival I
find myself thinking about,

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.290
now that we have so much
time to sit here, thinking.

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.770
It's not the judge's ruling,
and the deafening years

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:07.270
of my sentence, and
how I landed here

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:11.270
because not one person believed
me when I said I didn't do it.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:14.350
I let go of all that
a long time ago.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.960
It's this one night that
I keep coming back to,

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.760
that first Saturday in
August, when the locks

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.720
couldn't hold us, that
brief gift of freedom

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.060
we'd take to our graves.

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.480
I get hung up on it
sometimes, and what if things

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.430
had gone another way if
I'd made it past the gates

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:37.050
and gotten out, if I'd run.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.920
Maybe I would have made it
over the three sets of fencing

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.550
and down the hill to
the free patch of road,

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:45.670
and my part in this
story would be over.

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:49.170
Maybe all that was about to
come tumbling at us after this,

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:53.000
someone else would have
to bear witness to.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.240
Someone else would have
to do the remembering,

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.380
because that was the
night we went wild.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:02.420
I remember how we
fought, and we cried,

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:06.047
and we hid, and we flung
ourselves through windows,

00:21:06.047 --> 00:21:07.630
and we pumped our
legs with everything

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:11.950
we had, and we went running
as far as we could make it,

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.710
which wasn't far.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:15.910
On that night, we
felt emotions we

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:21.070
haven't had a taste of for 6
months, 12 months, 11 and 1/2

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:24.690
weeks, 909 days.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.250
We were alive.

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.920
I remember it that way.

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.970
We were still alive,
and we couldn't

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:32.560
make heads or tails
of the darkness,

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.270
so we couldn't see how
close we were to the end.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.370
So that's the first chapter
of "The Walls Around Us,"

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:45.870
and that's Amber speaking and
bringing us into the story.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:48.490
But you got a hint
in the introduction

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.220
that this book has been
called-- and I admit,

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:53.410
I did not come up with this.

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:58.160
I am not a marketing genius--
"Orange is the New Black"

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.810
meets "Black Swan," or "Orange
is the New Black Swan."

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.390
And so you might be
wondering-- right.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:08.960
And whoever came up with
that hashtag, thank you.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.480
So "Orange is the
New Black Swan."

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.620
So you must be wondering,
where is the "Black Swan"

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.780
reference in this?

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:18.880
So half of the story takes
place inside the prison walls

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.540
at Aurora Hills, but the
other half of the story

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.130
takes place outside.

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:25.870
And the narrator for
that half of the story

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:28.820
is an 18-year-old
ballerina named

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.310
Violet, who is about to
head off to New York City

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.530
to live the life of her dreams.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:39.420
Everything is coming true that
she wanted and worked for.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.880
And yet, she is
holding onto a very

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.950
tangled, complicated,
awful secret.

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:52.660
And her best friend, who
used to be a dancer with her

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.230
at the ballet school
where she studied,

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.730
ended up being
convicted of murder

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:01.850
and sent away to the Aurora
Hills Secure Juvenile Detention

00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.620
Center, where she was
the cell mate of Amber.

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.010
So that's how the two stories
converge and are connected.

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.970
And Violet's story actually
takes place two years later.

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.490
And there was a distance.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.160
She's about to leave town.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.360
And I'm just going to read you
a little bit from her voice

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.100
to give you a sense
of the Violet section.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:25.680
This is not a whole chapter.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:28.550
So what's happening
right now is Violet

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:31.860
is standing backstage,
about to perform

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:37.500
for the last time for her town's
ballet recital, the summer

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.560
recital.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.550
And she's about
to perform a solo.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.160
And she's, of course,
thinking of her former best

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.020
friend, Orianna,
who she calls Ori,

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.950
and thinking how Ori
was a better dancer

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:54.700
and if she had been here,
how different it would be.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.580
And she's also
thinking about how glad

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.010
she is to get out of here.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.780
For Ori, dancing came naturally,
without a nervous stomach

00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.320
or worries if she'd
forget the steps.

00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:08.300
She danced like
it was meant to be

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.040
in a way that
couldn't be copied,

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.540
no matter how carefully
I watched her move,

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.710
mirroring my body
after hers, and trying

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:18.110
to get my limbs to loosen
up, and act more free.

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:21.720
She had this vivid spark
of life in her wanting out,

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:24.780
and you could see it clear,
when she took the floor.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:27.480
I never witnessed
anyone move like that.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.930
I guess I won't ever again.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:32.210
If Ori and I were
dancing a duet tonight,

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.290
she for sure would've
been better than me.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.430
The audience would
have basked in her,

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:39.870
loved her, followed her
light across the stage.

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.180
My light would have
been background.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.100
That's the truth,
or it could've been.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.960
It's no longer
the truth anymore.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.611
I let the curtain drop.

00:24:48.611 --> 00:24:49.110
I'm on.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:50.650
I hear my cue.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.230
I take my first steps
out onto the stage.

00:24:53.230 --> 00:24:55.310
And next, I hear
her voice, which

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:58.400
she would have said to
me, had she been here,

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.710
breathe, V. Go be amazing.

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.490
Go show them.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:03.850
Let them all see.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:08.040
She used to say things like
that to me all the time.

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.290
I'm at my mark.

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:12.120
The darkness lifts, and
my body lifts with it.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.580
And I'm tall now,
as tall as Ori,

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:17.240
because she had only a
couple of inches on me.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.860
Taller even, because maybe
since she's been gone, I grew.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.370
I'm balanced on point, on
one leg, without a tremor,

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:25.880
without sway.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.930
The spot of light circles me,
and I'm growing warm inside it.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.090
I wonder how I look from
out there in the audience

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:37.150
to those strangers in the seats
who know me this way only, who

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:39.080
have no idea.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.130
I don't need a
mirror to tell me.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.230
I look like I belong up here.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:45.990
I've got new Grishkos on,
broken in this morning

00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.690
by massaging the shank
and slamming the hard cast

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:50.690
of the box into a door.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:53.720
My mother sewed the ribbons
on with the tiniest stitches.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.850
No one could ever
hope to see them.

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.660
My hair is pin slick
with shine to my head,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:01.200
and the tutu is a rigid
ring around my middle,

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:03.740
not as flimsy as it might seem.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.360
I'm entirely in white.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.810
I wanted it that color.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.530
I asked for it.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:10.740
The audience holds
its breath for me.

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:11.990
Ori's not the one up here.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:13.170
I am.

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:15.810
The audience eyes my
bent and poised leg,

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:17.790
my arms molded in
a graceful line

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:21.540
over my head, my lifted
and lengthened spine.

00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:24.240
All my weight is
on a single toe.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.820
I hold.

00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:28.820
At least a dozen people watching
from the wings want me to fall,

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.850
and I'm not falling.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.390
Now comes the building
crescendo of music,

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.920
every little
increment of movement

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.850
from my body studied
in mirrored reflection,

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.320
coached and
corrected into place.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.210
It may not be as free form
as Ori would have done it,

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.470
but it's impressive,
because I'm so precise.

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:50.300
I make no mistakes,
not a single one.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.860
People in the audience can't
hear the clomp of the brand

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.060
new shoes as I touch weight
to ground between each whip

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.640
fast pirouette.

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.760
Or if they do hear,
if they're seated

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.950
close enough to the stage
to hear, they ignore it.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.480
They wanted our secret.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.100
They want me to win.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.110
But there's another secret.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.610
Inside, past the tool, and the
skin tight stretch of fabric

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.310
going three layers deep, I've
got things I can't talk about,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:18.040
things Ori knew
and only Ori knew.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:21.160
If you peel away the first
layer, and the second layer,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.320
and the third layer,
underneath would

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.290
be something ugly, something
broken-- eyes clawed out,

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.880
and blood still clinging to
her neck, her arms, her face.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.030
Sometimes, I think I still
have the blood on my face.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.600
There's this
thumping, and it's not

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:38.200
my pristine pair of point
shoes touching floor

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.530
for the first night
in their short lives.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.780
It's what's going on in my head.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.824
It's a stampede.

00:27:44.824 --> 00:27:48.110
It may look like I'm dancing,
but I'm somewhere else.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.680
I'm out there,
behind the dumpster,

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.290
in the tunnel of trees, and I'm
screaming and flinging my arms,

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.330
and dirt is
everywhere, and rocks,

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.340
and twigs, and
leaves, and blackness,

00:27:57.340 --> 00:27:58.960
the whole world's
getting knocked out

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.310
like a set of teeth.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.870
I'm out there, even now,
as much as I'm in here.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.840
Before I know it, I reach
the end of the choreography.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:09.430
I can barely keep it together.

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.070
But still, I finish my
solo with a flourish,

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:16.270
poised on one rock solid leg.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.360
Silence.

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.040
They say nothing, do nothing.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.980
I can hear them all breathe.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.610
Then it happens.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:29.640
The seats creak, and shift,
and people rise to their feet.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.980
I've given them everything.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.910
I've given them
too much this time.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:33.820
And then I realize.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:36.250
It takes me a moment to realize.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.340
These people really
have no idea, do they?

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:42.000
I showed them, and
they couldn't see.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.800
They start cheering for me.

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.690
These people-- family,
friends, strangers,

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:49.970
all those innocent strangers,
they stand on their feet

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:52.820
for me, and their
hands smack and smack

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.450
with increasing violence,
and they shower me with noise

00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:00.170
like they wish I never had to
leave this town or the stage.

00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.660
They're praising me.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.090
They're showing me how much
they love me and have always

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.610
loved me, no matter what.

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.500
Look how blind they are.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.840
They're giving me a standing O.

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.260
So that's Violet, the
other voice in the story.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.750
And so much of the writing
of this book, for me,

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.980
was about exploring
guilt, and innocence,

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.580
and who really is guilty,
and who really is innocent,

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:28.420
and what happens when one
is mistaken for the other.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:30.730
So that is Introduction
to the book.

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:32.860
And I think we'll have a
little bit of discussion,

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.440
and then they'll
open for questions,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.946
if anyone has questions.

00:29:36.946 --> 00:29:38.362
AUDIENCE: So one
thing that struck

00:29:38.362 --> 00:29:41.359
me is just the voices
for Violet and Amber

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:43.546
are so very different.

00:29:43.546 --> 00:29:45.490
What did you have
to do to yourself

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:49.380
to get into each of
the other girl's heads?

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.450
NOVA REN SUMA: It's really hard
writing a first person voice

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.030
trying to sound like someone.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:58.070
And then you inhabit it so much
that then everything you write

00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:59.300
sounds like this person.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.716
So it's hard when
you're switching

00:30:00.716 --> 00:30:02.790
between two different voices.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:07.550
So for me, I tend to
write my books in order.

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:11.460
So this is a problem when
you're switching chapters.

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.960
In this book, it's
more like sections,

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.930
instead of alternating chapters.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.831
But even so, I would
be so into Amber.

00:30:18.831 --> 00:30:20.580
And then I would move
into writing Violet,

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.810
and some of the
Amber would slip in.

00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:26.220
So I ended up having to separate
the book into two pieces

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:29.420
and write just the Amber
story straight through

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.210
and write just the Violet
story straight through.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.310
And I actually
gave myself rules.

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:39.345
That always helps when I'm
trying to write something.

00:30:39.345 --> 00:30:42.690
It's down to the specifics
of this character

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:45.470
is not allowed to use
adverbs, and this character

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:48.710
is allowed to have semicolons
and em dashes, and just down

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:50.870
to the sentence level.

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:53.080
This character can have
more casual language.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:57.750
This character can have flighty
diversions in her thinking,

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.570
and get caught up in her head.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:03.320
And I had a list on
the wall of the things

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:05.400
Amber was allowed to do
and the things Violet

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.640
was allowed to do.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.860
And even down to
editing a later draft,

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:12.130
I realized that
sometimes, I would slip,

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.870
so I would-- no em dash!

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.120
And I would have to switch it.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:21.390
But that helped,
and also, just being

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:24.130
in the voice of that character
and reading it straight

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.400
through-- and I know
a lot of writers

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.490
do this-- [? along ?]
as playlists.

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:32.380
I had very specific songs
that went with each character,

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.500
and sometimes,
even each chapter.

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.580
So when I was
working on a chapter,

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:39.015
even down to revising
it, in the third draft,

00:31:39.015 --> 00:31:41.140
I would put on the song
that went with that chapter

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:44.210
to remind myself of the
feeling of writing it

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:47.872
and remind myself
of Amber or Violet.

00:31:47.872 --> 00:31:51.277
AUDIENCE: So can give us a
sample playlist for each girl?

00:31:51.277 --> 00:31:53.235
NOVA REN SUMA: I know I
should put that online.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:00.870
I could say that Amber's
songs were more dreamy.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:06.670
Her voice is more
poetic and more lyrical,

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:11.170
and so her songs were
slower and dreamier,

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:15.410
and Violet's songs were angry.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.650
Angry music would
go with Violet.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:19.900
And it didn't have to be
anything that she necessarily

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.100
would listen to.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.520
It would just be something
that had that power of punch

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.090
in the lyrics, or the
song, or just something

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:29.940
to make me mad
when I was writing,

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.582
because I felt like
that anger was needed

00:32:32.582 --> 00:32:33.790
when I was writing her voice.

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.820
But I should put up
a playlist of the two

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.721
different characters.

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:37.720
It might be interesting.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.940
AUDIENCE: I think so.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.130
Does that make you a
method writer then?

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.090
NOVA REN SUMA: [LAUGHING]
A method writer.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:46.950
Maybe.

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:50.300
I think part of it, when you're
writing first person voice,

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.630
you're really trying
to inhabit a person.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.360
You're really trying to see
the world through that voice.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:33:00.340
Bad first person is just
you're writing, "I,"

00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:01.362
and it could be "she."

00:33:01.362 --> 00:33:03.320
It could just be easily
changed, and you're not

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.540
feeling it from that character.

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.620
In that case, don't even bother.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.560
Just use third
person, is my opinion.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.660
If you're using first
person in the right way,

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.640
you're saying everything the
way this person would say it.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.546
You're noticing
things in the room

00:33:18.546 --> 00:33:20.170
that that person
would notice, and only

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.500
that person would notice.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:23.920
And the feeling of
being who that person is

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.680
comes through in how her
side of the story is told.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.750
So you have to really
get close to a character.

00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:33.630
And maybe that is
method writing.

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:34.425
That's funny.

00:33:34.425 --> 00:33:35.830
AUDIENCE: And I was
actually hoping for a story

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:38.125
where you, yourself, launched
yourself into prison.

00:33:38.125 --> 00:33:40.442
NOVA REN SUMA: [LAUGHING] No.

00:33:40.442 --> 00:33:41.150
I didn't do that.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.550
But one thing I would do
when writing this book

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:47.860
specifically was I live in a
small apartment in Manhattan,

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:51.310
and I have a writing
space where I go to,

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:54.350
which is a loft space, The
Writer's Room in Manhattan,

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.490
which is wonderful, where I
rent access and have access

00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:58.410
to a desk.

00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:59.955
But there are people around.

00:33:59.955 --> 00:34:02.330
Sometimes, I write in cafes,
but there are people around.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.250
And this book could
get really intense,

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:09.679
and this book could get
really dark and emotional.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:12.219
And I couldn't be
around all the people.

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:16.420
So I made-- in our bedroom,
in our tiny bedroom,

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:22.350
a tent over my desk, and it
was covering the window too.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:27.510
It must've been awful, just this
whole tent area in the corner.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:29.800
So if I went into my
desk, I could see nothing,

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.659
and I was just covered
by this dark tent.

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:35.960
And actually, one of
the most intense scenes,

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.880
a murder scene that
happens in this book

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:39.340
was written in the tent.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:43.850
And I had to leave the tent up
when I was revising the book,

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:48.980
because I needed access to that
space, that contained space,

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.920
where it was just
me and the story.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.485
I couldn't even see anything.

00:34:52.485 --> 00:34:53.860
There were no
lights in the tent.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.617
It was just dark, and
then my computer screen.

00:34:56.617 --> 00:34:58.200
And then I would go
in there to revise

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:01.029
this really intense scene.

00:35:01.029 --> 00:35:03.404
AUDIENCE: How did you come up
with all the other inmates?

00:35:03.404 --> 00:35:06.362
Like all the other girls,
their personalities,

00:35:06.362 --> 00:35:07.733
and the different crimes?

00:35:07.733 --> 00:35:09.316
It almost reads a
little bit like it's

00:35:09.316 --> 00:35:12.517
from "Chicago," except there's
no singing and dancing.

00:35:12.517 --> 00:35:13.850
NOVA REN SUMA: I love "Chicago."

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:16.410
Thank you.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.990
I thought of all the
possible crimes, many of them

00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:22.170
violent, that would
lead to a girl

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:25.120
to be locked up in this
place, and her circumstances,

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:29.240
and what privileges
she didn't have,

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.600
or what would lead
her to be left here.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.160
And so many of the
girls, it's like they are

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.990
considered to have no future.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.860
And even if their
sentences end, what

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.500
happens to them after, when
you've spent all this time

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.180
incarcerated in this place?

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:47.970
And so I thought of all
the possible crimes.

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:51.640
And then I thought of the girl
who might have committed this

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.057
crime or was accused
of it and didn't.

00:35:55.057 --> 00:35:56.640
There's a point in
here where it says,

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.147
they all say they're innocent.

00:35:58.147 --> 00:35:59.230
Some of them are innocent.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.270
Some of them aren't innocent.

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:05.790
And so it was fun and
interesting to create

00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.610
these girls who had had
these terrible mistakes

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.190
and ended up here.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:13.150
And there are quite
a few of them.

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:15.550
And I feel like I could
have gone and written

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:20.450
whole sections, whole chapters
about them and their stories.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:23.354
I could've kept going.

00:36:23.354 --> 00:36:26.791
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
is your fourth novel,

00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:33.174

of [? Danny ?] [INAUDIBLE]--

00:36:33.174 --> 00:36:34.647
NOVA REN SUMA: Mhm.

00:36:34.647 --> 00:36:37.593

NOVA REN SUMA: Mhm.

00:36:38.575 --> 00:36:40.744
AUDIENCE: So if I were
just being very literal,

00:36:40.744 --> 00:36:42.994
looking at just the titles,
this seems a common theme,

00:36:42.994 --> 00:36:45.534
is disappearing.

00:36:45.534 --> 00:36:47.200
NOVA REN SUMA: That's
very astute, yeah.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.830
And actually, the
book I'm writing now

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.260
has a little bit of
that theme, as well.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:54.420
I think that's something that
I've always written about,

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.520
as a girl.

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.900
And I think when I was
younger, because I've always

00:36:57.900 --> 00:36:59.830
written-- I've always
wanted to be a writer.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:03.364
And I think for me, it was
a way to talk to people.

00:37:03.364 --> 00:37:04.280
It was a way to speak.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:07.390
I was so incredibly
shy when I was young.

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:10.730
I was that kid in class
who couldn't speak.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.370
I was called on in class, and I
would turn bright red, and just

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:14.600
very uncomfortable.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:16.330
It's amazing that
I'm standing up here

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.550
in front of this room talking.

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.930
I would never have seen myself
doing something like that.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.940
And I think the writing
is the way I found

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.720
myself able to communicate.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:28.780
And a lot of it was
I want to disappear.

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:29.800
I want to be invisible.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.967
And I think that theme,
those were stories

00:37:31.967 --> 00:37:33.300
that I wrote when I was younger.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.280
But that theme has
translated to all of my books

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:39.590
in interesting ways, different
ways of attacking it,

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.430
different ways of finding
myself speaking about that.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:45.788
So that's great that
you brought that up.

00:37:45.788 --> 00:37:48.571
AUDIENCE: So how does that theme
come to play [INAUDIBLE] this,

00:37:48.571 --> 00:37:51.112
because if you just go by the
title, again, solely the title,

00:37:51.112 --> 00:37:52.653
it seems like it's
the most concrete.

00:37:52.653 --> 00:37:54.967
They can't get out
to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:54.967 --> 00:37:55.800
NOVA REN SUMA: Yeah.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.470
"The Walls Around Us."

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:03.080
Really, the way of what happens
to a teenager, a young kid when

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.460
they commit a crime like this,
and basically, their whole life

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:08.420
changes.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:12.820
They're sent away to a juvenile
detention center to do time.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.690
And it's almost like
their entire old life

00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:16.420
has disappeared.

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.700
Who they were has disappeared.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.010
And a lot of the thought
of these prisoners as

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.450
what is my life when I get out?

00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:25.560
What is my life
after I do my time?

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.960
Is this mark ever-- is this
still on me for forever?

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.120
So there's a lot of that.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.390
And then there's also
sometimes in my writing,

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:37.380
I like to play with magical
realism and fantastical things.

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.820
And the disappearing
can be quite literal.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:45.450
People actually can disappear
and have in my books.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:47.883
I won't give anymore away.

00:38:47.883 --> 00:38:50.992
AUDIENCE: Is there an author
whose career or body of work

00:38:50.992 --> 00:38:52.860
you'd like yours to
look like [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:53.610
NOVA REN SUMA: Oh!

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.710
I'm just going to be
honest and say this

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:01.030
even though she's a friend.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:05.330
I greatly admire the
[INAUDIBLE] author, Libba Bray.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:10.920
And what I admire about Libba
is she's so incredibly talented

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.590
with the range of her work.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:16.990
So she has written
historical fantasy.

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.220
Her latest series,
"The Diviners,"

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.600
is 1920s New York, with
the occult, and politics,

00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.590
and sweeping epic stories,
as well as satire,

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.830
and funny things,
and first person

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.550
beautiful voice-y things.

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:35.700
And I look at her, and I think,
if only I could find a way

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.150
to have that kind of
range as a writer,

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:40.570
and to be able to explore
everything so honestly,

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.000
where it still feels like me.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.660
In every book, that's different.

00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:44.860
And I admire that so much.

00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.620
But I also admire how
she carries herself

00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:51.150
in this industry, how helpful
she is to fellow writers,

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:55.070
and how wonderful she is with
her fans, and how open she is.

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:58.250
And so I very much
think I would love

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:03.060
to find a way to build a
career like Libba's one day

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:07.345
and to have published the kind
of books that she publishes.

00:40:07.345 --> 00:40:10.315
AUDIENCE: I think yours is
off to more than a good start.

00:40:10.315 --> 00:40:13.285
Just going back to
"The Walls Around Us,"

00:40:13.285 --> 00:40:16.750
was there a reason why you
chose Stravinsky's "Firebird"

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.029
as the ballet?

00:40:19.029 --> 00:40:19.820
NOVA REN SUMA: Yes.

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:24.840
So in the story,
Violet is, in the past,

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.870
they were performing the
"Firebird" as the summer

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:29.110
showcase ballet.

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.240
And Ori, her best
friend, was cast

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.030
in the important starring
role of the firebird, which

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:39.100
was the best role that Violet
wanted, and she didn't get.

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:43.420
So for me, sometimes, this
book, I will tell you,

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.790
is complete fiction.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:47.940
I was never in a juvenile
detention center.

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.170
I am not a ghost.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:51.650
This is completely made up.

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:55.010
But things from my real
life do end up in my books.

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:58.400
And so the ballet stuff
is from real life.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:02.690
I studied ballet from when
I was 4 to when I was 16.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:03.990
I was not very good.

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:06.950
I never would have been a
professional like Violet

00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:08.000
in this story.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.480
But it was just so
much a part of my life

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.280
going to ballet class after
school, going on the weekends,

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:16.250
doing performances like this.

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:20.850
And the last performance that I
did before I quit ballet to go

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:24.630
hang out with my friends and go
to parties, which is the truth.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.550
That's what happened, the last
ballet that I performed in

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:30.530
was "The Firebird,"
and I was one

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.820
of the dancing maidens, which
is the role that Violet actually

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:34.900
does get.

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:39.330
And I remember I had a very
plain costume in comparison

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:41.650
to the firebird's
costume, and we

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:46.180
had little bean
bags, gold bean bags

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.050
that we had to throw on stage.

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:49.996
And this was the
greatest fear of mine,

00:41:49.996 --> 00:41:52.370
that I would not catch it when
it came to me, because I'm

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:54.240
terrible at catching things.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.160
So it was just this
very vivid memory.

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.590
But I remembered you
know the dancer who

00:41:59.590 --> 00:42:03.820
danced "The Firebird," and that
incredibly intense dancing,

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:05.890
the incredibly intense solo.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.510
It was such a memorable
point in my life.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.970
And she was trapped.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:13.280
This character's trapped.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.300
And just that feeling felt
very connected to "The Walls

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.070
Around Us."

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:20.340
And also, at least the dancer
who was in the performance

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.680
that I was in, there was this
anger that was all through her.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.340
And it just really
felt connected

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.410
to when I wanted
to write this book.

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:31.724
So when I knew Violet was going
to be a ballerina, of course,

00:42:31.724 --> 00:42:32.890
it had to be "The Firebird."

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.240
It had to be with the
ballet that I remembered,

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:41.050
the last one that I danced in,
but also, the story felt right.

00:42:41.050 --> 00:42:44.630
AUDIENCE: And if Amber, or
Violet, and Ori were boys,

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:47.000
how do you think your
story would be different?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.260
NOVA REN SUMA: That is such
an interesting question.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:49.780
It's funny.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:55.180
I most exclusively write about
teenage girls and about girls.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:59.550
And I can't even imagine
what it would be like

00:42:59.550 --> 00:43:02.050
for me to write this
story about three boys

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:03.740
in a juvenile detention center.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.970
And I think maybe--
clearly, that's a story

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:08.200
that I would love to read.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:09.860
That's a story
that another writer

00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:12.260
would be able to make
so vivid and wonderful.

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:14.220
But for me, so
much of my writing

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:16.340
is about writing about
the experience of being

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:22.240
a teenage girl and all kinds of
girls, exploring all avenues.

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:25.590
And so I can't even
fathom how that book

00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:27.160
would be if written by me.

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.820
So I'm intrigued
by the question,

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:30.800
but I don't even know.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.050
I feel like it would
be not a book by me.

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:35.490
It would be another
worthy book, but not

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:37.430
something that I would
be able to do justice.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:39.263
AUDIENCE: Well, and
also, knowing the prison

00:43:39.263 --> 00:43:41.190
dynamics would be very
different, and also,

00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:42.869
[INAUDIBLE] competitive
dance world.

00:43:42.869 --> 00:43:43.660
NOVA REN SUMA: Yes.

00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:44.990
The ballet stuff
would be different.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:46.656
And there's something
really interesting

00:43:46.656 --> 00:43:51.660
to explore with female
friendship, and enemies,

00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:53.740
and friends, and how that
can be the same thing.

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:55.590
That can be the same person.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:59.760
And friendship with guys
is probably different,

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.180
but there's something really
interesting with girls.

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:06.365
And there's the girls
in the prison, locked up

00:44:06.365 --> 00:44:08.740
in the prison, and there's
the girls in the dance school.

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:11.090
And the girls in the dance
school are just as vicious

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:14.495
and mean as the
girls in the prison.

00:44:14.495 --> 00:44:16.244
AUDIENCE: That's a
"Black Swan" reference.

00:44:16.244 --> 00:44:18.735
NOVA REN SUMA: [LAUGHING] Yeah.

00:44:18.735 --> 00:44:20.735
AUDIENCE: And so here's
a metaphysical question.

00:44:20.735 --> 00:44:23.686
What are your thoughts on karma,
regret, and how supernatural

00:44:23.686 --> 00:44:24.727
[? would get involved? ?]

00:44:27.932 --> 00:44:29.640
NOVA REN SUMA: I find
that a lot of times

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.470
when I'm writing these
fantastical stories, there

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.050
always is some kind
of karmic retribution.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:41.090
Like if somebody does something
magical or has a power,

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:44.720
there's always some
consequence for that.

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.260
In the worlds that I create,
I can't imagine there not

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:48.910
being some
consequence, something

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.660
that you do that you're
not allowed to do,

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:53.390
that then you have to pay for.

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:56.720
So I think that
kind of philosophy

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.110
has seeped its
way into my books,

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:03.550
and so when I imagine
something completely fantastic,

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:06.010
and strange, and
in another world,

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.490
I'm thinking of that rule.

00:45:08.490 --> 00:45:10.570
And that's come
through in my book,

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:14.050
"Imaginary Girls," and I think
here in "The Walls Around Us,"

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:17.840
there's that feeling
of who deserves what,

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.390
and what happens when
someone who doesn't deserve

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:23.610
it starts getting a lot, getting
all the good things happening

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.990
to her, is that really
going to come through?

00:45:25.990 --> 00:45:28.470
And in real life, we
know that a lot of times

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.740
there's no retribution,
and terrible people

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:32.450
get wonderful things.

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:35.070
But maybe in
fiction, I have a way

00:45:35.070 --> 00:45:37.748
of correcting that a little bit.

00:45:37.748 --> 00:45:40.682
AUDIENCE: To cosmic justice.

00:45:40.682 --> 00:45:43.616
And so I think a number of
us are a little more extreme

00:45:43.616 --> 00:45:47.039
in saying we're curious to
hear more about this launch pad

00:45:47.039 --> 00:45:48.995
workshop that you attended.

00:45:48.995 --> 00:45:51.195
It's not often that
you hear about writers

00:45:51.195 --> 00:45:53.010
going to a workshop
that's funded by NASA--

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:53.885
NOVA REN SUMA: Right.

00:45:53.885 --> 00:45:55.352
AUDIENCE: --astronomy.

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:57.063
What was your experience
like from that,

00:45:57.063 --> 00:45:58.775
and what did you
take away from it?

00:45:58.775 --> 00:46:00.280
And how has it
influenced your work?

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.488
NOVA REN SUMA: Well, I should
say that the Launch Pad

00:46:02.488 --> 00:46:04.860
Astronomy Workshop is at
the University of Wyoming

00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.090
every summer.

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:10.450
And it's open to writers who
are interested in bringing

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:13.320
in some science into their
writing, specifically

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:14.220
astronomy.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:17.090
So you don't have to be
a science fiction writer.

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.140
You don't have to
be a science writer.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.530
I'm a YA writer who
writes magical things.

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:25.680
But I had a book in
mind that's still

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:31.700
in progress about an astronaut,
and I needed more basis

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.780
to make sure I wasn't
making terrible mistakes,

00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.470
but also, inspiration.

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:39.700
And so I was really
excited to apply and get

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.260
the funding to go.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.760
And every year, I think it's
funded from different places.

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.550
So the year I went,
it was funded by NASA.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:49.530
I don't know who's funding
it for the next summer.

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:50.200
So I went.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:56.200
And really, what it is is
an intense, week long class

00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:00.360
on astronomy, like intense, like
hours of learning astronomy.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.240
And if you've taken an
astronomy college course before,

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.760
some of it might be
an old hat to you.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.140
For me, it was all new.

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:10.300
I hadn't taken
astronomy in college,

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:12.380
and so I had a lot to learn.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.050
But at the same time,
we moved past the basics

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:18.760
and into a lot of what ifs
with terraforming Mars,

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.180
or all these really
interesting ideas.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.680
And I learned so much.

00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.990
I filled up notebooks
full of notes.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:30.890
Also, you're with a
group of a fellow writers

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:33.970
from different genres-- science
fiction and fantasy writers,

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:38.180
and there were some YA writers,
and just short story writers.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.990
And we really bonded and
connected while we were there.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.950
And there were also some
visits to a telescope

00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.410
to see the stars, and so it was
a really, really interesting

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:49.910
week.

00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:51.780
And if that anyone
is listening to this

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.320
and thinks that's
interesting, there

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.890
should be another
one next summer.

00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:57.030
And I think the applications
open in the winter.

00:47:59.976 --> 00:48:02.922
AUDIENCE: And we'll open it up
to questions from the audience.

00:48:09.603 --> 00:48:11.269
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
I was going to say--

00:48:11.269 --> 00:48:14.706
so she said that [INAUDIBLE]
got a chance [? to read it. ?]

00:48:14.706 --> 00:48:15.688
I just picked it up.

00:48:15.688 --> 00:48:16.896
NOVA REN SUMA: Oh, thank you.

00:48:16.896 --> 00:48:19.719
MALE SPEAKER: She said
about how you write so well.

00:48:19.719 --> 00:48:22.260
You develop the other characters
in the prison and everything

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:22.759
so well.

00:48:22.759 --> 00:48:26.069
If you could, is there
anybody in particular

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:28.230
that you [INAUDIBLE]
side [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:28.230 --> 00:48:32.760
that you would really love to go
on a tangent with, if you have?

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.760
NOVA REN SUMA: Well, you
know what's interesting

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.110
about this book is there's
this main, central figure

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:41.030
in this book called
Ori Orianna who doesn't

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:43.110
get her own perspective.

00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:46.235
And her story is told through
the eyes of Amber, who's

00:48:46.235 --> 00:48:48.360
her cell mate, and then
through the eyes of Violet,

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.300
who was her former best friend.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.091
And so you piece together
this portrait of her

00:48:53.091 --> 00:48:55.090
through other people's
eyes, which I always find

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:56.510
so fascinating, as a reader.

00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:58.240
I love that kind of
stuff in the story.

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:01.070
But then it leaves why
did I not tell the story

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:02.280
from Ori's prospective?

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:04.010
A lot of readers
have asked me, why

00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:06.240
is there not Ori's perspective?

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.860
And there was one
point where I was like,

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:11.236
should I have letters from her?

00:49:11.236 --> 00:49:12.860
Should I add some of
that in the story?

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.720
I even think I tried, and
I couldn't find her voice.

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:20.950
So I think I would try a more
secondary character, someone

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:24.410
that nobody would expect.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:29.740
There's a girl who is an
outcast and eats her own hair.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.760
Her name is Kennedy.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.160
She might be
interesting to explore.

00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:37.430
There's a girl who's
surreptitiously dealing drugs.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:38.470
Her name is Peaches.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:40.510
She might be
interesting to explore.

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:44.280
I feel like anyone of them
might lead to something,

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.800
but it would be a
whole separate story.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:51.070
It would be her story, and then
it would touch the other one.

00:49:51.070 --> 00:49:52.780
But it's interesting.

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:55.280
There's a lot of
vivid possibility,

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.550
if I ever wanted to write
something beyond this.

00:49:58.550 --> 00:50:01.280
But then again, my stories
are always standalone.

00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:04.410
They're meant to be
just what they are.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.840
Even if they leave
questions at the end,

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.320
the reader is left to
ask those questions

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.190
and determine the
answers on their own.

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:13.315
Thank you for the question.

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:18.070
It looks like we're
up [? time. ?]

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:18.670
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.170
Thank you so much for coming in.

00:50:20.170 --> 00:50:21.370
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.770
Please take up a copy of her
book, "The Walls Around Us."

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.287
It's in the back of the room.

00:50:25.287 --> 00:50:25.870
But thank you.

00:50:25.870 --> 00:50:26.470
NOVA REN SUMA: Thank you.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:28.428
Thank you so much everyone
for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:28.428 --> 00:50:29.170
Thanks.

00:50:29.170 --> 00:50:32.820
[APPLAUSE]
