00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.019
Find the natural log of
3 using a calculator.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.030
Round your answer to
the nearest hundredth.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.700
And just as a reminder,
natural log of 3,

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.930
this is just another way
of saying log base e of 3,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.420
or what power do I have
to raise e to to get to 3?

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.142
And 3 is a little bit
larger than e. e is 2.71

00:00:20.142 --> 00:00:21.350
and it goes on and on and on.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.490
So 3 is a little
bit larger than e

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.610
so I'm guessing it's going to be
one point something something.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.420
So let's get our calculator
out and just calculate it.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.640
So natural log-- that's this
button right over here--

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.030
ln-- I'm assuming it's
maybe from French log

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.870
natural or something like
that-- So natural log of 3

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.040
is one point-- and they want
us to round to the nearest

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.220
hundredth.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.320
So it's 1.09, but
the thousandths place

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.620
is an 8, which is greater
than or equal to 5

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.910
so we want to round up.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.570
So we want to round the 9 up,
but that essentially takes us

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.240
to 10.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.000
So 1.10.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.420
So this is approximately
equal to 1.10 when we round

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.323
to the nearest hundredth.
