00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.060
- [Narrator] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.213
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:14.195
(pleasant synth music)

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.480
- Welcome to a Conversation with History.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.680
I'm Harry Kreisler at the

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.610
Institute of International Studies.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.540
Our guest today is Dr. Lucy Shapiro,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.030
who is director of the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.090
Beckman Center for Molecular
and Genetic Medicine

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.110
at Stanford University, and the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.144
Ludwig Professor of Cancer Research

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:54.530
in the School of Medicine there,

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.246
and a senior fellow of the

00:00:56.246 --> 00:01:01.246
Spogli Institute for International
Studies also at Stanford.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.800
She is the 2009 Hitchcock
Professor at UC Berkeley.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.200
Professor Shapiro, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.033
- Thank you.

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:11.130
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.090
- I was born and raised
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.600
- Aha, and looking back how
do you think your parents

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.923
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.610
- Let's see, I'm the
daughter of immigrants,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.385
and it was extremely
important for my generation

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:31.930
of immigrant children
to be very successful,

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.610
and we were a poor household,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.130
but there was always
somehow the wherewithal

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.990
to give us piano lessons

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.071
and dancing lessons and language lessons,

00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:46.620
and academics was extremely important.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.170
- And was science something you picked up

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.360
at home, in high school, in college?

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.350
- No not at all.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.860
In fact I have a very unusual background.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.140
So music was always very
important in my household.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.393
My mother was a piano teacher
and a public school teacher,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.030
and my father was just always
interested in the entire world

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.250
but music was important.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.770
And so I read music.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.210
I played the piano
before I learned to read.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.020
My piano lessons started
at the age of four,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.390
and it was very much a part of my life,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.802
but I knew that I wasn't
a very good musician.

00:02:27.802 --> 00:02:28.635
(laughs)

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:30.910
And in the neighborhood in which I lived

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.150
in Brooklyn, New York the high
school I would've gone to,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.350
mandated, I think was called
Manual Training High School

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.350
where perhaps 2% of the
population went on to college.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.830
So this was not an option.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.040
Clearly private schools
were not an option,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.700
but living in New York
City is an incredible place

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.610
because there were public

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.230
special high schools that were free.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.030
There was the Bronx
High School of Science.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.273
There was Stuyvesant.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.360
There was the High
School of Music and Art,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.503
and so my parents said this is perfect.

00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:08.663
You will try out, and there was a test

00:03:08.663 --> 00:03:13.020
and they all assumed I would go for music,

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.950
and a year before I was to take the test

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.470
to get into Music and Art,
I decided I do not want to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.000
play a musical instrument for
four years in high school.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.080
And so I went to the
library and got a book.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.830
I remember that to this day

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.500
written by Jon Gnagy on how to draw.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.681
I said I'm gonna learn how to draw.

00:03:34.681 --> 00:03:35.790
(laughs)

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.830
And I did, and I studied this book

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.110
and I prepared a whole portfolio.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.275
Fortunately, fortunately
I have some talent.

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:49.790
Then I went off to my test
at Music and Art and got in,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.740
and my parents were utterly
astonished to find out

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.969
that I had gotten in on painting,

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:58.470
and that was the beginning of my sort of

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.889
taking left hand turns everywhere.

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:05.889
- And the science bug, and I
guess I should put that in--

00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:08.030
- There was no science
at that point at all.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.420
- So when did that come to you?

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.726
- Well I went to Music and Art,

00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:12.960
and then I went to Brooklyn College

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.140
where I was put on a new
program as a scholar,

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.842
and as this excuse me.

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:21.710
(coughing)

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.480
As this scholar, I didn't
have to take classes.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.080
I could do whatever I wanted,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.790
but I reported to people.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.730
And during this time, I
became somewhat interested

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.970
in biology but I majored in fine arts.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.020
I was a painter, and I also
minored in the classics.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.420
Wrote my senior thesis on Dante,

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.510
and why he wrote in the
vernacular and not Latin.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.690
But I was interested somewhat in science,

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.000
and then something amazing happened.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.350
When I was--
(coughs)

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.732
Excuse me.

00:04:53.732 --> 00:04:54.565
(coughs)

00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:56.363
When I was graduating from college,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.530
I was part of an art show and
a man named Ted Shedlovsky

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.580
at Rockefeller University
who was a physical chemist

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.690
bought one of my paintings,

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.320
and Ted had this avocation in life

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.070
of finding young people in the arts,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:15.340
getting to know them,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.140
deciding if they were smart,

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.654
and then convincing
them to go into science.

00:05:19.654 --> 00:05:20.487
- [Harry] Gee.

00:05:20.487 --> 00:05:22.400
- Yeah Gerry Edelman, a Nobel Prize winner

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.710
is one of us Shedlovsky kids.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.570
There are a whole bunch
of us, and he's a mentor,

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.470
and he said what you have to do

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.480
is take a course in organic chemistry.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.198
And I said really?

00:05:34.198 --> 00:05:38.090
And I did, and it was an eye opener.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.698
I absolutely loved it, and maybe

00:05:40.698 --> 00:05:43.511
because it's the way my head works

00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.130
I see things in three dimensions,

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.500
but I thought organic chemistry
was absolutely beautiful,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.440
and this is really what I wanted to do.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.700
- And then where did you do your PhD work?

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.540
- So at that point, Ted encouraged me

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.047
to apply for graduate programs

00:06:00.047 --> 00:06:04.050
even though I had barely
no background to do so.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.940
I think Rutgers was my safe school,

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.520
and they turned me down,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.010
but I got into almost
everywhere else I applied

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.610
and I went to Albert, well it was

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:13.520
New York University at the time.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.450
A year later, the whole department

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.810
moved to Albert Einstein
College of Medicine,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.560
but I was accepted and my whole first year

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.590
in graduate school was very unusual.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.160
- Well it sounds like you needed to take

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.130
some beginner courses to
do the preparatory work

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.500
you hadn't done in college.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.693
- I took a lot of math,
physics, a lot of chemistry.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.300
And I had the unusual
opportunity of taking courses

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.220
at different universities around the city.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.140
So my mentor at that time, Tom August

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.240
and mentors and Jerry Hurwitz
a very well known biochemist,

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.610
helped me find the very
best courses in the city.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.277
- [Harry] Oh gee!

00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:55.140
- And so I just had incredible training,

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:57.800
and chemistry was really

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.630
some of the most exciting
things I had been exposed to,

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.230
but I had to learn how
to think analytically.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.550
So courses in physics
and quantum mechanics

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.520
and statistical mechanics
were really very important

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.870
and it was the first time in my life

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.758
where I had to really work hard

00:07:14.758 --> 00:07:19.220
to, you know I remember doing problem sets

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.523
morning, noon, and night, but I did learn.

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:24.960
And while this was going on

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.910
I was actually working in a laboratory.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.300
- So hands on experience?

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:30.570
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.430
So this raises an interesting
question 'cause you,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.110
we'll talk about your research in a minute

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.370
but you're on the cutting
edge of major breakthroughs

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.642
in developmental biology and genetics

00:07:40.642 --> 00:07:42.590
as you studied bacteria,

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.750
and I think students in our audience

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.480
would be interested in what it takes,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.580
the skill base involved in what you do.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.150
You've already given us a hint of that,

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.120
but talk a little about that, I mean--

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.720
- Well let me come at
it in a different angle.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.553
- [Harry] Okay.

00:07:58.553 --> 00:08:03.553
- The fact that I went from
fine arts and the classics

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:08.640
to learning quantitative
approaches to science

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:12.620
sort of gave me license to
try to do different things,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.920
and gave me the belief
that I could do anything

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.080
that I wanted to do.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.860
So I was never on a track.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.960
And when I realized that I had to learn

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.672
how to think quantitatively
and analytically,

00:08:27.672 --> 00:08:30.720
and it was hard work,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.610
then I knew I could approach

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.180
any scientific question
I wanted to approach

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.510
whether it was in physics or chemistry

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.190
or biology it didn't matter,

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:41.240
but I was interested in the living world.

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:43.890
- Now that raises an interesting question

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.060
'cause it's scientists
who appreciated your art

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.390
and directed you into science
and then you were in music.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:55.390
Is there a landscape of the
mind, let me say it this way,

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.800
in music and art that in addition

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.750
to building self-confidence in you

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:04.100
that you could do anything,

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.998
talk a little about that.

00:09:06.998 --> 00:09:09.570
Are these worlds not as different

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:10.403
as we might think they are?

00:09:10.403 --> 00:09:12.090
- Oh I don't think they are really.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.000
I think what we're dealing
with is creativity,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.290
and the ability or the desire

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.680
to think differently.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.020
And I think that's critical.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.870
And what I found in writing about Dante

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:31.600
and trying to understand what he did

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.560
is I could get bits and pieces
of anecdotal information

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.280
and try to make a logical construct,

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.560
but once I was working
in the science domain

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.310
there was a lot more hard data,

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:48.750
and I could take this hard
data and what I like to say

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.750
is build stories, build
supposements, build ways of thinking

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.040
and then try very hard to disprove

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.930
what I think I'm purporting to be true.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.860
And that's the key of
doing really good science.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.330
Get your theory, get your
hypothesis, get your idea.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.700
Collect data of course to support it,

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.470
but then try very hard to find
out if you can knock it down,

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:21.630
and you know it's like a detective story.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.580
You collect clues, and I think that

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.460
that kind of approach to anything,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.171
whether it's worrying about Dante's opus

00:10:31.171 --> 00:10:34.550
or worrying about the bacterial cell cycle

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.902
is what I ultimately studied

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:41.902
is an extremely valuable
and not unusual way

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.030
that scientists approach what they do.

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:49.030
- And so in this creative
process you were really turning

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:55.030
what might be self doubt into a tool

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.140
to sharpen your hypothesis
and your assertions.

00:11:00.372 --> 00:11:01.974
- That's right, that's correct.

00:11:01.974 --> 00:11:06.974
- And I guess that it was in retrospect

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.470
it turns out to be a real virtue

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:13.350
that you weren't tracked
early in the sciences.

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.293
- Yes and I think it's
really fairly unusual.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.620
Frequently now we see people
coming from the science,

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.000
physics and chemistry
and going into biology

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.834
'cause that's pretty exciting right now.

00:11:25.834 --> 00:11:28.960
Rarely do you see it the other way.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.680
Do you see people from
humanities going into science,

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.490
and that's a pity because
certainly it can be done

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.770
and it's easier to do it in the
United States than in Europe

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:44.720
where the education is much
more channeled, or in Asia.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.890
You just don't see this
kind of freedom to change,

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.176
but I think it's extremely important

00:11:52.176 --> 00:11:55.330
that people keep an open mind

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.070
about what they might want to do

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:59.110
or how they might want to do it,

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:00.810
and there are no rules and regulations.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:03.561
You can learn how to think differently

00:12:03.561 --> 00:12:06.000
at any stage in your life,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.730
and it also gave me the freedom

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.710
at every stage of my scientific career

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.070
to learn a different kind of science,

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.290
and because of that I could apply

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.620
many many different ways of thinking.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.510
Many different disciplines
to one question.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.060
And I was very fortunate in
that after I finished my PhD

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.720
which was in molecular biology in which

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.300
I discovered a new RNA
dependent RNA polymerase,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.560
and I was really trained as a biochemist

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:43.380
when I did a short post
doc for only six months

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.120
and then was offered an
assistant professorship

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.650
back in the department that
I had gotten my PhD in,

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.240
and the chair at the time said

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.450
why don't you take three months

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.050
and think about what you want to work on?

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.210
This hardly ever happens anymore.

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:01.380
Usually you're really tracked in.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:04.900
People do three years, four
years of post doctoral work.

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.490
Well I didn't do that.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.530
And that three months
of thinking and reading

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.743
was just incredible, and I
had decided at that point

00:13:13.743 --> 00:13:17.230
that if I was going to spend my life

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:19.960
working on a scientific problem,

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.263
it had to be something
I was passionate about.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:26.890
And it seemed to me at that time

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.910
that I wanted to understand

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.990
what it meant to be a living thing,

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.550
and I tried to find the
simplest cell I could study,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.550
which turned out to be a bacterial cell,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:43.550
and study that cell as if
I were a systems engineer.

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.290
Taking it apart in all of its parameters

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.780
and then putting it back together again.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:51.890
Of course I'm speaking metaphorically,

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.070
but we've been able to in fact

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:56.330
do it much more than metaphorically.

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:59.390
And understand how a living entity,

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:04.210
all the things it does to go
from one cell to two cells

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.570
and be alive is completely integrated.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:11.490
It's like an absolutely beautiful machine,

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:16.490
and so I dedicated my
life to figuring this out.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:19.840
- And let's talk a
little about that because

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.490
in your work, and in
your lecture yesterday

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.930
you showed us a DNA and a bacteria,

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:30.660
and you know it's,

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.110
it's beautiful on the screen

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.640
but it looks like a bundle where
sort of nothing is going on

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.753
and your work really was,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.560
and your lecture describing that work

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.330
is was kind of unbelievable for a person

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.170
who's not a scientist like myself

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.450
to see this intricate machine
that lies hidden there.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.360
- Yes, it's amazing!
- Yeah.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.670
- It's truly amazing,
but you have to realize

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:02.070
that this the result of
almost 40 years of work.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:06.300
And working with over
50 talented post docs

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.950
and 40 talented graduate
students who are phenomenal.

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:13.270
You know we work in the lab as a team,

00:15:13.270 --> 00:15:16.720
and we share ideas and
thoughts constantly.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.112
For example in our lab, every Tuesday

00:15:20.112 --> 00:15:22.150
we sit for two hours,

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:26.844
the entire interdisciplinary
lab, all 22 of us.

00:15:26.844 --> 00:15:29.370
There are people in the lab
who are getting their degrees

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:33.190
in physics, in chemistry,
in genetics, in biochemistry

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.130
and we talk and we think.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:37.700
One person presents their work,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.860
and they have to make sure
that everyone sitting there

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.510
understands their language,

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.030
and then we tackle a problem

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.200
and we troubleshoot this problem

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.200
so the work that has come
out is the cumulative output

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:58.340
of almost generations of
incredibly talented young people.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:02.420
- Help us understand the creative moment,

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:07.320
maybe a creative moment that
was very important for you

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.710
and your reaction as

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:16.450
you realize what you've come upon,

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:17.910
you and your team have come upon.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.540
- Well let me give you an example okay?

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:22.180
I could give you many,
but I'll give you one.

00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:24.610
So it's known, it was always known,

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:28.560
that the bacterial cell
has free floating DNA

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.070
and you know the bacterial
cell is very little,

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.200
but the DNA if it's stretched out

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.040
is 1,000 times longer than the cell.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.270
So it's compacted inside this cell,

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.300
and it was always thought

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.680
that it was sort of smunched together

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:48.170
like a ball of spaghetti into the cell.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:52.120
That when it duplicated,
it somehow got copied,

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:55.780
attached to the inside of
the bacterial cell wall,

00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.260
and as the cell grew it
pulled it apart all right?

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.210
To me this seemed not logical.

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:06.570
It wasn't, it wasn't what nature would do.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:10.580
It was not clean, and we knew that

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:14.600
while the cell has to
duplicate this mess of DNA,

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.730
it also has to transfer
the information in it,

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.970
so you have to copy out the messages

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.880
that are encoded in this thing.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.450
So so much is going on it cannot be

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.860
a random stochastic process.

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.840
And so we all sat and
thought about it a lot,

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:34.280
and we show that at least
one part of the chromosome

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.170
was attached to one pole of the cell,

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:40.410
and the other part of the
chromosome at the other pole,

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:44.750
and then we said well, can
we design an experiment

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.780
in which we put a fluorescent tag

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.500
on many many many different genetic loci

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.350
all around the chromosome?

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:57.350
And followed it by doing very
very sophisticated microscopy.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:59.810
So we all got together and worked on this

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:04.810
and we realized that it would
take 10 students 50 years

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.875
sitting in the dark room
to take pictures constantly

00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:11.160
of these fluorescent signals,

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.390
but if we automated this and
if we designed a microscope

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.600
and a computerized system that
could analyze the data for us

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.600
we could tag up in each of
you know 115 different cells,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.640
tag a different spot on the chromosome

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.250
and then have computerated technology

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.530
solve the whole thing it would work.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:39.530
And we did just this, and
what it did in one experiment

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:44.130
was get rid of this fog of what
people thought was going on,

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:46.280
showed it was completely wrong.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.210
That the chromosome in
fact is highly organized.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.060
You know where a gene is on the chromosome

00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:56.070
reflects where it sits in the cell,

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.847
and that when you start
copying this chromosome

00:18:58.847 --> 00:19:03.847
as you copy a region, it
jumps to its correct place.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:08.335
So in one experiment, we
were able to truly understand

00:19:08.335 --> 00:19:12.380
something that had been
guessed at for years and years,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.833
and that is an incredible experience.

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:20.652
- And what, as this happens

00:19:20.652 --> 00:19:23.730
is it it's an awe I guess

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.477
that just sort of drives you
to want to find another--

00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:31.320
- Oh absolutely, so look.

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.080
Most of a scientific career is tedium,

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.100
a lot of being anxious,

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:42.670
a lot of thinking, a lot of dead ends,

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.640
a lot of blind alleys, and periodically

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.400
there's that wonderful moment

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.630
when you see something clearly
and you know it's true.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:54.410
And we all have this.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.430
There are not a lot of those,

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.400
but they're so wonderful

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.500
that it feeds this passion

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:04.560
and you want more and more of it,

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.380
and for us we just kept
digging deeper and deeper

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:14.270
into understanding this wonderful
machine that we call life

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:17.630
and it's just been very exciting.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.880
- Now this part of your work

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:26.870
has a beauty, a quietness mixed
with anxiety you just said,

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.130
but you focused on bacteria,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:37.130
and bacteria has led you to
also focus beyond your science

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.690
onto some big issues of public policy

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:45.114
because in this new
century we're in a world

00:20:45.114 --> 00:20:48.720
where things like bioterrorism,

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.720
the failure of antibiotics,
the fact that bacteria

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:57.690
are as you say, engineers themselves

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.043
are all coming together to complete,

00:21:02.166 --> 00:21:03.840
to give us a complex set of problems

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.137
that are really quite difficult.

00:21:06.137 --> 00:21:07.910
And you're worried about that.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:11.220
- Yes I think that what started me on this

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:16.220
is that I felt that there
had to be an informed public.

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:18.930
I think that decisions were being made

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:23.930
or not made at all about
issues that impacted our lives.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.080
The lives of our children, the
lives of our grandchildren,

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.380
and it was very important
to me to do two things.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.100
To number one, understand deeply

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.970
what was happening, and what could be done

00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:40.500
and number two convey this to the public.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:45.390
And by the public I mean
not only the lay people

00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:47.110
who were interested in what's going on,

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:48.960
but people in government.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.260
People in the pharmaceutical industry.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:55.730
So I began being on boards

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:58.980
of biotechs and pharmaceutical houses

00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:02.020
advising the government
and reading and learning

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.760
as much as I could,

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.760
and for many years, I
worked very hard to learn

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:15.790
how to speak to an intelligent
lay public in English

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.660
about complicated subjects.

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.990
And what worried me most was my view

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.743
that we were entering what
I call the perfect storm.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.210
And the perfect storm being

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:33.210
increasing appearance of
a new infectious diseases

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:37.493
and old pathogens in new places.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.429
- [Harry] Such as SARS or--

00:22:40.429 --> 00:22:43.530
- Such as West Nile Virus, such as Ebola,

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:46.481
such as SARS, such as AIDS.

00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:48.070
Lots.

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:52.610
And we as citizens of the United States

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:56.760
had to realize that we were
now part of a global community

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.830
and that we are no longer
just protecting our borders.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.210
We live on one globe,
and there are no borders.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.930
Someone can be in Kenya one
day and Chicago the next,

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:11.610
and drug resistant bugs and diseases

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:14.980
travel 24 hours anywhere.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.180
So we have this instance where we have

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:20.300
increasing infectious
disease on the one hand.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.470
On the other hand, we have

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.460
increasing resistance to our drugs.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.040
Increasing resistance
to our antibacterials,

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:32.100
which are called antibiotics,

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:37.020
and to our antivirals like
Tamiflu for influenza,

00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.950
and number one we have to
understand this resistance.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:43.820
Number two we have to
know how to get around it,

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.690
and we have to alter our

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:48.260
healthcare system to deal with that.

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.020
So that's another part
of the perfect storm.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.550
Then there's the part of the perfect storm

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:57.130
where it isn't financially appealing

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.630
to design new antibiotics

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.160
because if you get a new
one, it's going to be

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.160
put on the shelf and saved until
the other ones stop working

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.320
and then it has a lifetime.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.430
It doesn't go on forever

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.250
because resistance is going to occur.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.100
So that the profit motive

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.790
in antibiotics is not terribly high,

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:20.062
so now that has been left to biotechs

00:24:20.062 --> 00:24:22.185
and we're doing it,

00:24:22.185 --> 00:24:24.590
but to me it's probably one of

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.570
the most important things we do.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.720
Now at the same time that
all of this is going on,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.640
we had 2001 and the anthrax scare,

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:36.080
and there have been blips of bioterrorism

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:41.230
happening through time you know

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.820
from throwing putrefied corpses

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.080
over the walls of old castles

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.424
to measles infected blankets to Indians,

00:24:49.424 --> 00:24:51.540
this is not brand new.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.890
I mean this has been done for centuries,

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.750
but it does appear in our lifetime.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.940
We have to know about it.

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.300
Fortunately the preparative
work that must be done

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:08.060
for both the problem of natural
infectious diseases emerging

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.650
and bioterrorism is the same.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:14.190
You have to be able to
identify your pathogen,

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:17.060
you have to be able to
have an antidote to that,

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.290
and you must understand
the laws of quarantine

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.600
which we do a very bad job on.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.990
- Now I want to break this apart

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.047
and pick out some of the key points here

00:25:27.047 --> 00:25:31.510
and one is the bacteria that you know

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.608
will be the focus of our attention

00:25:33.608 --> 00:25:36.610
in what we've been talking about,

00:25:36.610 --> 00:25:39.710
they are very smart creatures basically.

00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.011
So and you say that in a way

00:25:43.011 --> 00:25:45.570
they're very good biological engineers.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:49.320
So they're at work as
we're creating a new world.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:52.898
- So I think that when we talk
about how smart the bugs are,

00:25:52.898 --> 00:25:55.773
I think we have to understand
what I mean by that.

00:25:56.614 --> 00:26:00.060
Bugs are smart because
they've been going through

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.863
billions of years of evolution.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.420
They duplicate very
rapidly, under an hour.

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.380
Sometimes under a half an hour,

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.600
making a whole new set of bugs.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:15.210
And they have the ability to design

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:18.580
new ways of getting around
problems constantly.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.650
So if you look at the
evolution of mammals and humans

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:25.450
and you look at the evolution
of these little tiny bugs

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.420
that are reproducing constantly,

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.410
you can just speed up evolution

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.310
and because of that, they can design

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.740
all kinds of new ways
of doing things so that

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:41.020
they have figured out ways
of dealing with antibiotics

00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:45.090
so that they design a mechanism
to not let the antibiotic in

00:26:45.090 --> 00:26:47.950
or to let it in, but then spit it out.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.660
Or to let it in and then
modify it chemically,

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:54.190
and their bag of tricks is truly amazing.

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:58.060
- And meanwhile they're
dealing with an adversary, us,

00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:03.060
that is both abusing the use
of antibiotics as we give it

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:08.100
to more and more animals for consumption

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.020
on the one hand, but
then on the other hand

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.970
we're over using them in
the treatment of illnesses

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:22.240
that may not even be caused by bacteria.

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.510
- That's true, and so I think that

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:26.880
it's a wake up call.

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.793
It's really a wake up call.

00:27:28.793 --> 00:27:32.590
We do have many antibiotics
that are still functioning,

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.000
but there are many pathogens that are

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
resistant to all of them, so
it's become absolutely critical

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.260
that we now really rein
in our use of antibiotics

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:49.470
for our livestock, for
our plants in orchards,

00:27:50.066 --> 00:27:52.690
for humans and make sure that we

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:55.190
use them appropriately and carefully.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.605
And this is a big problem
because it crosses

00:27:58.605 --> 00:28:02.240
all kinds of political
and legal boundaries.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.260
And I think that people are

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.533
beginning to deal with it, but not enough.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.650
- And when you get into
the world of bioterrorism,

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.750
and you've said something very
important for our audience,

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:19.640
namely that if we deal with
this biological problem

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:24.640
that smart bacteria are abusive
of antibodies, antibiotics

00:28:26.427 --> 00:28:31.427
on the one hand, that you
still have the problem

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:37.800
that these two worlds,
bioterrorism on the one hand,

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.520
the real threat that's
emerging biologically

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.744
they get intermingled and so sometimes

00:28:42.744 --> 00:28:46.870
we say there's a threat from
bioterrorism, but there isn't

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:50.190
but what you're trying
to emphasize is that

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.380
if we deal with one we
also deal with the other.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.995
- Absolutely, and also we have
to be cognizant of the fact

00:28:55.995 --> 00:29:00.995
of very minor bioterrorism effect, attack.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:07.090
Let's say anthrax, and bioterrorism
can come from anywhere,

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.903
inside or outside the country.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.890
Will cause an enormous fear response,

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:16.660
have an enormous economic impact.

00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:19.310
Look what happened with SARS, all right?

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:22.070
SARS really did not kill a lot of people.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:27.070
It was not huge, but the
fear impact was huge.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:30.790
And there was a major worldwide

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:34.460
economic disruption as a result of that.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:38.280
So that if a relatively
minor quote unquote attack,

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.220
this happened to be
natural, not malevolent,

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:43.390
would cause such havoc

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:44.870
then it doesn't take much

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:49.860
to do something that is very worrisome,

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.603
and not on a grand scale.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:56.520
- Now what would you like to see happen

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.810
you know looking into the future

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:04.170
in dealing with this set of problems?

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:08.630
Because you're dealing
with making people afraid,

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.010
which can have negative consequences,

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.670
but on the other hand you
do want to educate them.

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:16.440
I think you said in something

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:21.440
where I read Clorox is
something that everybody has

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.576
in their home that can be used yeah--

00:30:24.576 --> 00:30:28.136
- So I think that this can be
done on a number of levels.

00:30:28.136 --> 00:30:32.850
Number one, an educated
public is the most important.

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:37.850
An educated public is less
fearsome than one that's not.

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:43.630
And I think that we as
scientists have a responsibility

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:48.940
to speak as frequently and
as carefully to the public

00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:51.690
as we possibly can about what we know,

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:55.050
and not put it in terms of being terrified

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.990
but rather this is what we can do.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:01.390
So we can start with us in our homes

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.267
knowing how to protect ourselves.

00:31:04.267 --> 00:31:07.904
Knowing that we should have Clorox around

00:31:07.904 --> 00:31:11.120
if we want to clean surfaces.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:13.810
That we should wash
our hands all the time.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.950
That if there is some sort of epidemic,

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:21.030
a flu or something else, simple
face masks work very well

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.470
which they do in Asia all the time.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.860
That's home.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.053
Stay out of crowds.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:29.050
But more than that, the next level

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:31.870
is our physicians and our hospitals.

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:34.850
Hospital acquired infections are huge,

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:37.579
and in Sweden they learned
how to deal with this

00:31:37.579 --> 00:31:42.300
by instituting very rigorous
standards of cleanliness.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.740
Constantly cleaning your
hands, being very diligent

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.450
about not going from one patient

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.043
to another with dirty hands.

00:31:50.890 --> 00:31:55.103
And you know antibiotics
through this generation of ours

00:31:55.103 --> 00:31:59.104
has made us feel sort of well,
we can always take a pill

00:31:59.104 --> 00:32:00.980
and we'll be fine.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:02.980
Well those pills are going away,

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.770
and so we have to go back to the time

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:09.030
of careful, careful hygiene.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.440
And now this is happening again,

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.741
and American hospitals are just beginning

00:32:13.741 --> 00:32:16.840
to realize my god, we've got a problem.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.700
And they're dealing with it by instituting

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:23.720
very very careful regimes
of cleanliness again.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.340
So that's another level.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.490
Then you move from that level
to the government level,

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.133
and there you say well,

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:36.130
we have to have more research going on

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:38.140
for antibiotic discovery.

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:42.363
We need more research to
find out why these things,

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:46.529
why these pathogens
are becoming resistant.

00:32:46.529 --> 00:32:51.529
To do that, we need oversight
and cognizance of the problem

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:54.270
at the government level.

00:32:54.270 --> 00:32:59.270
So money can be put
into that as a priority,

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:03.500
and of course that is somewhat
happening, but not enough

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.530
and it's important to have
an administration in place

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:10.830
that appreciates science--
- And basic research.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.760
- Yes, and realize that it's not just

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:17.130
oh this is what I do for a
living, give me more money.

00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:21.210
It's much deeper than
that, and that in many ways

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.290
we're working for the common good.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:28.290
And we have to have a political system

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:32.580
that can intelligently respond

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.080
to what scientists are trying to say,

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.350
whether it's world health,

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.570
whether it's climate, whether
it's energy, any of these

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.250
and there are arguments on both
sides in all of these things

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:48.490
but with respect to health,
and antibiotic resistance

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:52.060
and emerging infectious
diseases, this is not a polemic.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.280
This is a problem here and now.

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.525
You know the canaries are dropping dead.

00:33:56.525 --> 00:33:58.440
(laughing)

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.273
- And more than one, yeah.

00:33:59.273 --> 00:34:01.530
- And yeah, and it's become

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:03.393
really critical that we do something.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:07.880
- How do we deal with the conundrum

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.060
that when you put all this together,

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:15.060
you get a policy maker, let's
say the former vice president

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.840
who focuses on one problem, you know,

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.840
to the detriment of what the
scientific community might say

00:34:26.740 --> 00:34:28.720
oh no this is where we need to go.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:30.720
There's a threat from smallpox,

00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:32.710
we understand that and so on

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.900
but we really need to
unlock these secrets.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:40.250
And then we have the individual
scientists like yourself

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:43.760
whose whole creativity lies in your

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:47.350
ability to see things in a way

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:51.160
out of where science may be going

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:53.340
and look at it from an
entirely different perspective.

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.830
It's a lot to put together.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:58.000
- Yeah, no but I think
that what you're saying

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.300
is that our political system

00:35:01.398 --> 00:35:05.130
must have people in it who can integrate

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:08.120
across many different problems.

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.970
We always have many many problems
happening simultaneously.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:15.140
It's a matter of priorities.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:19.240
It's a matter of deciding
what's good for your country,

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.010
because that's what the
political system is doing.

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:25.020
It's taking care of our country,

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.620
and different people have
different thoughts as to what,

00:35:29.657 --> 00:35:33.263
where to place problems
on the priority list,

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:39.100
and my belief is that what
we as scientists can do,

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.460
scientists and technologists
in many different areas,

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.820
is at least provide information.

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.900
Now we can provide all the
information that's possible,

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.450
but it has to enter a receptive ear,

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.100
and somehow we as a country

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.330
have to understand and
prioritize problems,

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.430
and I'm not gonna enter
this political fray.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.800
I can only speak as one humble scientist

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.890
knowing that we have a problem,

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.220
and doing the best I can to approach this,

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.680
and in addition to speaking to people,

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.849
advising the government which I have done.

00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:20.580
At the same time I
decided that I could take

00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.920
my knowledge base and
design new antibiotics.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.660
So to do that I hooked up with a chemist,

00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:31.650
a wonderful chemist at Penn
State named Steve Benkovic,

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:36.650
and we designed a whole new
library of potential antibiotics

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:41.090
and we built a small biotech
company out here in California

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:45.830
and we have designed the first
new antifungal in 25 years.

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:49.260
Company's called Anacor,
Anacor Pharmaceuticals

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.830
and two very early stage antibiotics,

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.685
but I think that's our responsibility

00:36:54.685 --> 00:36:58.960
to not only have the wonderful freedom

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.000
to muck around the insides of cells

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.810
and figure out how they work,

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:07.080
but to actually take our
knowledge and apply it

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.050
so that we can in fact help humanity,

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:14.290
and to me that is a very
important thing in one's life.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.650
- Sounds very important,
and I'm just curious

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:21.650
what do you see as the next
place for scientists to look?

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:25.510
I mean what is down the road?

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.123
A puzzle that you would like to open up?

00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:30.930
- Well I think that...

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:34.283
There are two things.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.220
For me, and I'll go
down the road in my area

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.323
and in my field.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.480
Energy.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:46.090
How to create new energy
using the algorithms

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:50.253
and the ideas and designs
that living systems use.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.970
To try to do that, there's this new field

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.440
called synthetic biology.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.770
And what does that mean?

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:02.700
It means taking ways of doing things

00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:06.490
from one little bug or one organism,

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:09.790
and putting it in another
one so that you could

00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:14.320
for example break down
cellulose and make fuel.

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:18.530
Now, that sounds pretty
simplistic, and it is,

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:21.810
and the problem is you
can't just move some genes

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:24.390
from one thing to another,

00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:28.060
even though you know
it can do it, possibly.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:32.060
What you have to understand,
and what our own work has shown

00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:37.060
is that there is a very complex
genetic network, a circuitry

00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:41.530
of feedback loops and
regulatory mechanisms

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:45.790
that must be understood as
little functional modules.

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.520
So you can't expect just to
take a bunch of genes from here

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:54.520
and put it into another
organism to give you biofuels,

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.630
and expect it to boot up.

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.760
It's not gonna boot up,
'cause you have to understand

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.190
the intricate ways in which

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.270
all these functions
interact with one another.

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:09.988
And to me, the future is helping us

00:39:09.988 --> 00:39:13.920
take lessons from the natural world.

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.660
Understand enough about
the exquisite complexity

00:39:18.660 --> 00:39:22.780
that goes on even in the
simplest living creature,

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.270
and take a lesson from that and say

00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:28.080
oh my goodness that's how it works!

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:31.430
And then we can build that,
and that's synthetic biology

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:33.680
so I do believe that that is a frontier.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.990
- And you said a second one?

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:37.070
Was there a second one,
or it was just that one?

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.900
- Well that's the one I'm
very excited about right now.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:43.530
The second of course, and is not my field,

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:45.120
is neural networks.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.590
Understanding how the brain works.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:51.450
Using our brains to
think about how we work.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:55.530
And again, it's of incredible complexity,

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.300
but you take a complex program

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.380
and you break it down
into its individual parts

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:02.490
and you figure out how it works,

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:07.490
and to me the most beautiful
thing possibly in my life

00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:11.900
is uncovering and learning about

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.050
how these quote unquote

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:17.260
simple organisms actually work.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.133
It's staggeringly beautiful.

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:22.900
- One final question
requiring a brief answer,

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.310
how would you advise students

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.240
who are excited by what you've just said?

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:32.560
How should they prepare for
a future in these fields,

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.450
and what should they do besides

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:36.692
going to art school or music school?

00:40:36.692 --> 00:40:38.090
(laughing)

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:39.570
- Look I think that

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:44.380
some of it takes a lot of
just plain hard elbow grease

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:47.360
as I did in my first
year in graduate school.

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:50.550
Take courses in the analytical sciences.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:52.780
Take math, take calculus.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:55.290
Understand chemistry and physics.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:58.720
Biology is now, in my view,

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.123
the chemistry and physics
of a living thing.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:07.340
And try to work so that

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.170
you're not afraid to approach any problem,

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.130
and you know sometimes
I feel like I'm sitting

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:16.210
at the bottom of Mt.
Everest and oh my god,

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:17.940
how am I ever gonna learn all that stuff

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:20.690
so I can apply this or that technology

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.610
to the question I want to answer?

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.510
Well take it in little packets.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:28.690
Learn how to do one thing,
apply it to something else.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:32.410
Learn how to do that, apply
that to something else,

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:33.970
and another important thing

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:35.880
that we haven't spoken about

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.530
is having mentors as
you move through life.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.280
Having, Ted Shedlovsky
was an incredible mentor.

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.940
I never would be here today
if it weren't for him.

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:47.405
A wonderful scientist
named Barbara McClintock

00:41:47.405 --> 00:41:49.432
when I was a young graduate student

00:41:49.432 --> 00:41:52.540
had a major impact on my life.

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.500
Just by talking to these people,

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.570
understanding how they work,

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.210
understanding what their life was like.

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:00.710
You know many young women say

00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:02.602
oh how can I have a life of a scientist

00:42:02.602 --> 00:42:05.400
and still be a mother

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:08.160
and you know a real
person in many aspects.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:08.993
- [Harry] And you've done it!

00:42:08.993 --> 00:42:09.910
- And you can do it.
- Yeah.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:13.330
- I'm not saying it's easy, but you know?

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:16.880
Nothing in life that's
really worth it is easy.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.540
- On that note, Dr. Shapiro
I want to thank you very much

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:23.470
for being on the campus and
for appearing on our program.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:24.303
- It's been a pleasure.

00:42:24.303 --> 00:42:26.140
- Thank you, and thank you very much

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.283
for joining us for this
Conversation with History.

00:42:31.429 --> 00:42:34.679
(pleasant synth music)
