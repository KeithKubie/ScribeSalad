&gt;&gt; Hello, everybody at YouTube. I'm Helen
Fisher. I'm an anthropologist at Rutgers University

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.130
and I study the brain. And what I guess I'd
like the world to understand is that we've

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.610
got to educate little girls as well as little
boys because the female brain is very different.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.110
It is-we evolved together-ah-millions of years
ago. I see men and women are like two feet,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.640
they need each other to get ahead.
And the female brain is-is, on average, better

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.390
connected, giving them what I call webbed
thinking. They tend to think wholistically,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.020
contextually synthetically. They think in
webs of factors, not straight lines.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.570
And as I've studied people women tend to have
a better imagination because of this, they

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.710
tend to be more mentally flexible, they tend
to think long-term, they tend to be quite

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.400
nurturing and they tend to be able to live
with ambiguity. And I would say in our modern

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.820
world the most powerful--if I have to sum
up the modern world in-in one word, I would

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.760
say it is ambiguous. And if we begin to educate
little girls, we will not only educate them,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.920
but we will educate their children and their
community and help to change the world.
