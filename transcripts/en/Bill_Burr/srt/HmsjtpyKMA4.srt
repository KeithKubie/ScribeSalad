1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,490
It's like a balls and there's another
funny promo. He's sitting there,

2
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:12,920
that Guy Post Malone, right? And
I was sitting there with Nia gone.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,950
That's the fucking guy I saw. That's
the guy that murdered that song,

4
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:18,560
those two songs. Right. So um,

5
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,070
he was talking about
con conspiracy theory.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,020
I don't even know what
the commercial was about.

7
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:25,900
It was just him talking to
another guy. I'm telling you,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,890
it's very like early days of MTV.

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,450
He was just talking about
conspiracy theory and uh,

10
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,670
being able to teleport and he was
just going like say here's area 51,

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:41,360
right? Which of course he picks that
rather than saying San Diego, okay.

12
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,200
He goes, here's area 51
right here. Here's Australia.

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,510
If you want to fly from
area 51 to Australia,

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,380
you've got to fly all the way here.
You know, and he draws the art too.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,440
We just didn't draw a straight line. Like
someone actually understands aviation.

16
00:00:54,441 --> 00:00:55,880
Right? Cause this is what creeped me out.

17
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:58,010
Cause if he just drew a straight line
and be like, all right, this guy's,

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,520
this guy's out of his mind. But the
second he drew the arc, I'm like, Oh fuck,

19
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:05,840
I'm buying into this theory. Right?
And he goes, um, and he goes, well,

20
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:06,800
with teleportation,

21
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:11,300
they just do stuff like this and he just
takes the paper and the x where area 51

22
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:15,350
was in the x, y Australia's. He just
takes the paper and he just folds it.

23
00:01:15,351 --> 00:01:18,560
He pushes him together. He
goes, it's like that. He goes,

24
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,530
I know you guys think I'm out of my
mind, but I know this shit is true.

25
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,490
I like the government and conspiracies
and aliens open your eyes. Cheapo.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,850
There's a lot of this going
on. How about the JFK shooting?

27
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,710
There's teleportation. Here's area
51. Right? And here's Australia.

28
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,050
In order to get there,
you'd have to fly there.

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,070
But if you take the piece of paper and
go like that and touch them right there

30
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:46,070
in the middle, that's how they do it.
And I know I sound crazy, but I'm not.

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:50,680
And I was like, this guy's brain.
That's what my brain tells me. You know.

32
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,750
So I, I don't know anything about
any of his, uh, and he was, uh,

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,891
any of his music,

34
00:01:56,891 --> 00:02:01,150
but I'm definitely gonna wanna download
some of his shit if anybody knows what

35
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:04,740
his best album is or whatever,
you know, a good, uh,

36
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,400
jump off point for that guy. Um, it
would be, it would be, uh, be tremendous.

37
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,320
Um, so anyways, oh, by the way,

38
00:02:11,321 --> 00:02:13,420
Navarro fucking killed the
guitar solo in that too.

39
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,450
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

40
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:49,970
[inaudible].
