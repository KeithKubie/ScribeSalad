00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.659
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, when I look at the points, I note that the Y values are all the same. Y

00:00:04.659 --> 00:00:09.523
is always equal to negative 3, it doesn't matter what x is. So the equation for

00:00:09.523 --> 00:00:14.373
this horizontal line is y equals negative 3. And remember, we have a flat line

00:00:14.373 --> 00:00:19.015
here so the slope must be zero. It has lots of run but no rise. This quiz was

00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:22.604
pretty tough. I know I haven't taught you how to write the equation of a line,

00:00:22.604 --> 00:00:25.075
so don't worry if you didn't get it right on the first try.
