SHIGERU MIYAGAWA:
I'm Shigeru Miyagawa.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.080
I'm Professor of linguistics.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.190
And I also teach Japanese
history here at MIT.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.570
This is my 26th year.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.710
My linguistics
work is on syntax.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.210
More recently, I have been
looking at language evolution.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.670
In my history class, I look
at modern Japanese history,

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.840
something I started
with John Dower.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.440
He's a very eminent
Pulitzer Prize winning

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.860
historian of modern Japan.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.420
John and I have done this
incredible project Visualizing

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.470
Cultures, which also
led to the MOOC,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.270
the edX MOOC like that
HarvardX and MITx did together

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.530
Visualizing Japan.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.940
Three years ago, I split
my position between MIT

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.760
and the University of Tokyo.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.330
And at the University
of Tokyo, I'm

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.360
the Director of
Online Education.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.080
And there I look at MOOCs
and also OpenCourseWare.
