00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Harry’s.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.850
Body shaving is a tradition in some sports…

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:16.700
Maybe I should try 
it out… you know… for sports.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.870
Shaving in sports is a big deal, cyclists
do it to reduce road rash, and cut drag; swimmers

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.890
do it to feel slicker in the water, and cut
drag, and body builders do it… well… to

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.210
look like this[a][b].

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.210
Wowza.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.210
Whew…

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.530
Anyway, you can see that speedy sports shave
their bodies to CUT DRAG.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.280
They're saying, cleaning off these follicles
are going to help you win a race!

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.470
How do you feel about leg shaving for swimmers?

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.470
Meh?!

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.470
Yeah…

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.470
That's how I felt about it.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.900
Kind of just like, okay, go ahead!

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.900
As long as you feel better!

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.079
But science says I might have been playing
down a SIGNIFICANT advantage without knowing

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.079
it!

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.140
Drag reduction in speed sports is a huge deal.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.470
Cyclists have been doing it for over 100 years.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:05.560
But it wasn't until 1987 that a study was
conducted for Bicycling Magazine by an engineer

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.560
in a wind tunnel.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.780
This study determined the speed savings were
0.6 percent.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.020
Which is just sad.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.020
That's SO small.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.600
Maybe enough to save five seconds over an
hour at 23 mph (37kph).

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.780
The results were so piddling, and wind tunnels
so expensive to use, no one ever repeated

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.940
the experiment… until now.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.400
A special bicycle-specific wind tunnel was
built by the Specialized cycling company,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.390
and the researchers had free use of it for
testing!

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.330
Coincidentally, one of their riders had shaved
that day, so they figured, why not?

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.660
Don't cost nothing, and they found the shaving
had reduced the cyclists drag 7 percent!!

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.660
SEVEN.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:52.360
This meant, a cyclist in a 25 mile (40km),
one hour race could save 79-seconds by simply

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.470
shaving their bod!

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.430
These findings were revolutionary, so to double-check
they tested five more cyclists.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.329
They all saved 50-82 seconds over 40 km.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.329
WHAT?!

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.380
They also tested different helmets, different
positions and long-sleeved racing gear finding

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.410
significant power savings here and there.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.540
They were shocked.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.730
Shaving works, at least in cycling.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.090
In swimming, the jury is still in over its
head.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.470
Common wisdom is shaving is mostly psychological.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.800
HowStuffWorks says, "Razors strip dead skin
cells off the body in addition to hair, exposing

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.870
a fresh layer of sensitive skin cells."

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.459
Because of that, the swimmer FEELS better
in the water.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.290
Though a 1989 study, the only one I could
find, tested the physiology of shaved and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.250
unshaved swimmers while also testing their
drag reduction.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.451
Turns out, physiologically, there were no
differences in heart rate, oxygen use, or

00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:56.349
lactic acid buildup (which is what makes your
muscles burn during exercise).

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.400
There WERE, however, noticeable drag reductions.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.060
Mentally, swimmers probably believe themselves
to be slicker and more powerful in the water,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.660
even without science, but we're here to back
them up.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.510
Ladies and dudes, you're totally slicker.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.629
Some runners will also get into the habit
of body shaving, expecting that over a long

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.810
race they might reduce drag, but more often
the clothing worn will produce more drag than

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.810
the lack of hair could ever make up for.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.739
So instead, most Olympic runners today wear
computer-designed, NASA influenced running

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:39.989
suits, designed to help them glide through
the air.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:04:11.409
Or so they say!
