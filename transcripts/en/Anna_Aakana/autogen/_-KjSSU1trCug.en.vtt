00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:54.426
Yeah, because I could out you.

00:14:54.459 --> 00:14:56.528 align:start size:84% position:16%
No, because I wouldn't
do that to you.

00:14:56.561 --> 00:14:57.930
And I actually care
what you think of me.

00:14:57.963 --> 00:14:59.464
What is that supposed to mean?

00:14:59.497 --> 00:15:01.700 align:start size:91% position:9%
Well, I've seen your shave,
and yet, at school,

00:15:01.733 --> 00:15:04.336 align:start position:0%
you treat me like I'm invisible,
just like everybody else.

00:15:04.369 --> 00:15:06.271 align:start size:53% position:47%
Yeah, which is me
protecting us.

Is it?

00:15:16.548 --> 00:15:20.152 align:start size:84% position:16%
My dad's stuff is in boxes.
In the garage.

00:15:22.287 --> 00:15:23.655 size:88% position:56%
Which it turns out is easier

00:15:23.688 --> 00:15:26.658 align:start size:72% position:28%
than seeing it piled up
in the dining room.

00:15:26.691 --> 00:15:28.293 align:start position:0%
What do you mean?

00:15:28.326 --> 00:15:31.229 align:start size:69% position:31%

not to see all of that

00:15:32.697 --> 00:15:34.299 align:start size:66% position:34%
where we used to have
family dinners.

gotten that.

I'm just so angry at him.

00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:46.511 size:78% position:61%
I mean, not because of
what he did to my family.

00:15:46.544 --> 00:15:49.514 align:start size:72% position:28%
I mean, that's obvious.

00:15:49.547 --> 00:15:51.450 align:start size:69% position:31%
I'm just angry because
while he's out there

00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:55.087 size:88% position:56%
doing whatever with whoever,

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.024 align:start size:91% position:9%
I'm stuck being my mom's
only source of entertainment.

00:15:59.057 --> 00:16:00.359 align:start size:56% position:44%

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:04.129

- It's just a popularity contest

chooses the theme for prom.

how you saw the theme

00:18:07.318 --> 00:18:08.887
and chose to sit that one out.

- [Boy] Nobody wants you here!

I...wasn't even
going to show up here today,

00:19:25.363 --> 00:19:28.600
but I realized that I'll never
have the opportunity

00:19:28.633 --> 00:19:31.803
to apologize to all of you
at once.

00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:33.772
Here goes.

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:39.211
I am truly sorry if I hurt
anyone with what I said.

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:41.646
I want you to know
that I understand

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:44.616
that what I said is wrong...

00:19:44.649 --> 00:19:46.885
and that I have a problem.

00:19:48.453 --> 00:19:52.257

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.459

all that I was, am,

don't know me,

00:20:51.449 --> 00:20:52.684

00:20:54.852 --> 00:20:56.021
You do know me.

00:20:59.791 --> 00:21:02.527
Look, if you want to vote
for some guy

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.031

and abs,

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:09.467

after you fall for him,

park in his garage

What?

00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:49.621
That's how it starts with her.

00:24:51.222 --> 00:24:52.624 align:start size:56% position:44%
[sighs] Good luck.

- Hey, Farrah.
- Hey, Mrs. Davies!

00:25:11.075 --> 00:25:13.545 align:start size:69% position:31%
I just talked to Will
at college.

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:16.180 align:start size:75% position:25%
He asked if I'd seen you
and wanted to know
how you're doing.

00:25:16.213 --> 00:25:18.816 align:start position:0%
Tell him that you have,
and that I'm doing great.

Hey, Woogie. How's
freshman year treating you?

00:25:21.118 --> 00:25:24.022 align:start size:97% position:3%
Fine so far.
Mostly because you haven't been
calling me Woogie at school.

00:25:24.055 --> 00:25:27.292 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [laughs] So, who do you have
for English class?
- Mrs. Koenig.

00:25:27.325 --> 00:25:29.961
[Farrah]<i> Oh, and I've already
 emailed Grace Ho</i>

Your little Grace Ho
puppet did.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.872 align:start position:0% line:0%
But I don't think
pulling her strings

00:25:40.905 --> 00:25:42.006 align:start position:0% line:0%
is gonna be
as easy as you think.

I can't think of a single thing
Farrah's done for me

00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:56.721 align:start position:0% line:0%

her more.

Nice style, Grace.
Where'd you get it?

What illegalist thing
do you need me to do now?

00:26:07.798 --> 00:26:09.033
[Farrah] We need to leak this.

The Crotch holds power.
Barely tapped into it.

- Don't!
- This is a huge story!

00:26:19.677 --> 00:26:22.213 align:start size:75% position:25%
The Crotch
has no moral compass.
