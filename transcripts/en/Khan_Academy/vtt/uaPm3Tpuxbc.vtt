00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.970
We're asked to evaluate
negative 2 times f of negative 6

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.600
plus g of 1.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.460
And they've defined,
at least graphically,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.757
f of x and g of x here below.

00:00:10.757 --> 00:00:12.340
So let's see how we
can evaluate this.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.270
Well, to do this, we
first have to figure out

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.540
what f of negative 6 is.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.760
So our input into our
function is negative 6.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.420
And we'll assume that's
along the horizontal axis.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.110
So our input is negative 6.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.690
And based on our function
definition, f of negative 6

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.010
is 7.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.890
So this thing.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.690
Let me write this down. f
of negative 6 is equal to 7.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.970
And what is g of 1?

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.890
Well, once again,
here's our input axis.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.410
And then the function
says that g of 1,

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.660
which is right over
there, is negative 5.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.920
g of 1 is equal to negative 5.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.240
So this statement simplifies
to negative 2 times

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.700
f of negative 6, which is 7.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.265
So times 7 plus g of
1, which is negative 5.

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:12.580
So plus negative 5, which
simplifies to-- let's see.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.900
Negative 2 times 7 is
negative 14 plus negative 5,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.200
which is negative 19.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.660
And we are done.
