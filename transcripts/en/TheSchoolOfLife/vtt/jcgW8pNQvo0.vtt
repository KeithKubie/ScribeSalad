00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.010
It’s easy to be pessimistic about many things:

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.719
the state of the planet

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.959
the economy

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.580
the future of humanity

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:22.580
Yet there’s one area where many of us retain
a curious sense of optimism.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.519
We have faith that, from among the millions
of our fellow human beings out there,

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:34.519
we will one day be able to locate a Very Special
Person, a being uniquely well suited to our

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.620
temperatements, tastes and aspirations; someone
who will feel like the missing bit of the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.620
complicated jigsaw of our deep selves - someone
who can make us whole.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.719
We know it won’t be easy to find them. So
many people seem nice, at first, and then the

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.839
problems emerge:

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.460
it turns out they have a very annoying sister…

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.690
or they are far too nervous about things;
always insisting on arriving at the airport

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.719
three hours too early…

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.490
or they have appalling taste in music…

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.720
or their conversation after a long day at
work leaves a lot to be desired.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.610
That’s why we keep searching: calling for
more space, taking a break, getting divorced,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.660
scrolling through future possibilities online…

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.390
Though it seems like we must be very romantic
to put such efforts into finding the Right Person

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.390
in truth, our perpetual search is
really a refusal of love. It is a guarantee

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.870
that we can never succeed at relationships,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.780
because in the end, the deep secret to love
is that there is no Right Person.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.520
There are perfect beings, we can imagine them
very clearly, but - tragically - they exist

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.250
only in the upper atmosphere...

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.980
...and never down here on the earth…

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.280
It’s the insistence on people being Right
that's at the root of rage and intolerance, for

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.630
we are never more furious than when we believe
we had signed up to perfection.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.280
And given what the human animal is like, we
can be guaranteed always to find something

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.340
that isn’t entirely right.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.340
To be really romantic, truly committed to
what love requires, we need a vital and rarely mentioned quality:

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.980
a healthy dose of PESSIMISM

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.100
...Pessimism about what even the most perfect-seeming
person will really be like once one gets to know them

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.100
and with that pessimism comes forgiveness for the inevitably very 
long range of flaws that we’ll discover in them,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.450
and they will - of course - discover in us.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.890
An optimistic search for the Perfect Person
commits us eventually to throwing away everyone

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.090
we are ever likely to meet…

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.960
Yet in truth, the person who is really best
suited to us is NOT the person who shares

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.819
all our tastes, but the person who negotiates
differences in taste intelligently and wisely.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.270
Compatibility is an achievement of love; it
can’t be its precondition.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.690
To be able to love properly, we have to attend
a funeral first: we have to bury a lot of our hopes deep in the ground

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.940
That funeral is the most romantic thing we
could ever do. It will liberate us to

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.940
go back out into the world and have proper human relationships that can endure, and flourish.
