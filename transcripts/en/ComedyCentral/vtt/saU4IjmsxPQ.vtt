00:00:00.933 --> 00:00:02.068
Haley?
Is this Steve O.?

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:04.304
Yeah what up?
How's it going Haley?

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.606
Is this him for real?

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.140
It is certainly Steve O.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.211
for real and I have
just viewed your butt hole.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:17.783
Oh my God.

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:21.321
I got to say, that's a fine
little BH you got right there.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.958
Oh my God. How embarrassing
because it was ...

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.395
okay, yeah, I'm the person.

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:32.198
I know you've done
more embarrassing stuff.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.699
I love your ass though.

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.770
Sure, yeah, my butt hole is
far more blown out than yours.

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:42.341
My butt hole's a mess Haley.
So now ...

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.147
Was it you that broke your dick
or Johnny Knoxville?

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:50.383
No, Knoxville was the one
who broke his dick.

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:53.553
So when's this Boozy concert?
I'm trying to think ...

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:57.824
and do you have
an extra ticket for me?

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:02.429
Listen, listen, look, that's
what I was gonna tell you.

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:07.233
I got VIP
but it wasn't for that.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.668
That's not what I was saying.

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.704
I know that's what it
looked like and it sounded like

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.739
are you gonna give me
some tickets for doing this

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:17.443
and da, da, da, da, da.
But that's not why I did it.

00:01:17.443 --> 00:01:20.446
You did it because you have
the utmost respect for Boozy

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.949
and so do I.

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:26.252
I would show him my butt hole in
a flash, tickets or no tickets.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.523
Well I'm just sitting here
crying

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:33.025
and I'm glad you called
and fucking made me feel better.

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:35.928
Well yeah, you should feel
not only better

00:01:35.928 --> 00:01:37.463
but you should feel
fucking great.

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.532
Today should be
the best day of your life.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.035
Yeah.
So, you got-

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.438
[crosstalk] calling me
with the bull shit

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.140
saying they're Boozy
and they're Boozy's nephew.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.212
No, no, no. We're not Boozy
and fuck all those people.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:54.380
Now I saw on your page it says

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.816
that they got no pimps,
no boyfriends-

00:01:56.816 --> 00:01:58.051
Right.
That's good.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:59.285
Right.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.653
Yeah, fuck a pimp, huh?

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:01.854
Right.

00:02:01.854 --> 00:02:03.590
Yeah one time I was
in New York City

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.659
and I was trying to film a stunt
where I went under a bridge

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.694
and paid a hooker
to piss on me.

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:12.030
I did it, it was great,
but I tell you

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.232
I had a bad experience

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:15.267
negotiating with
those fucking pimps.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:16.970
I did not enjoy that.

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.139
Hold on, you said
you was in where?

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:23.643
That was underneath a bridge
in New York City,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.845
quite a while ago.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:27.813
I mummified myself
in saran wrap,

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:29.282
it was really pretty funny.

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:31.251
Of course with you,
I wouldn't have to do that.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.553
I know that because
I seen that pussy's clean.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.093
So what radio station is this?

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.794
This is Comedy Central.

00:02:42.762 --> 00:02:45.064
Comedy Central radio
on Sirius XM.

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:48.134
And you're live with
Big Jay Oakerson and Dan Soder.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.602
These guys are
funny mother fuckers.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.370
Hell yeah.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.239
So you're like sitting there
doing an interview?

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:54.540
Correct.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.308
Yeah, he's doing an interview
and then ...

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:59.479
I'm the special guest and I
got to say this episode is hot.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.347
And it only got hotter
once we got you on the line.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.648
That's true.
That is very true.

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:04.350
I saw the video, this is Jay.

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:07.053
I saw the ...
if you're keeping score.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:09.856
I'm just mad because I didn't
post it and go viral.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:11.658
And I didn't hit world star
with it

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.325
so I could get the check.
You know what I'm saying?

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:14.727
Oh absolutely, this is-
I'll tell you what,

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.062
we're not talking
to little Boozy right now.

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:17.330
This is Dan, Jay's co-host.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:18.697
Yeah, and you're the star
of the video.

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:19.999
You're the one
we wanted to talk to.

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:21.634
We don't want
to talk to Boozy.

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:24.203
Yeah, I concur. Let's go me.

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:25.704
But yeah, does Steve O.-

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:27.006
But you all do it for free.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.240
Oh that's great.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.943
Oh shit, I get the respect
like Boozy.

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:31.243
Yeah.

00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:32.812
Steve O. getting that Boozy
respect.

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:34.614
Everybody else has to pay
for that shit.

00:03:34.614 --> 00:03:36.549
Yeah, no roll over minutes
except for Steve O.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.817
That's right.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.185
Because Steve O.
gets roll over minutes.

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:40.753
That's right.

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.121
Right, you know what,
I got to say,

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:47.293
you are a lovely lady.
And you got a great you know ...

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:50.129
a real great sense of humor
and you're a good sport.

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:52.465
It's fun to-

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:54.133
Haley, if somebody
like me walks in,

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.667
I mean I know
you don't know who I am.

00:03:55.667 --> 00:03:57.069
Picture me like a-

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:58.337
Jason Momoa.

00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:00.305
A pile of book bags
in a sweat suit.

00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:05.944
Well he looks like the guy in
Raising Arizona who is chasing-

00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:07.914
Tex Cobb, Randall Tex Cobb.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.148
Yeah.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:11.450
Have you ever had
to tap out from-

00:04:12.317 --> 00:04:14.020
Size-
From dick size?

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.322
No.
Wow, okay. Clean.

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:17.923
Wow, that's a ...

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:19.959
And accommodating pussy,
pretty good.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.226
Right.

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:22.662
That's good.

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:24.430
You're not gonna get service
and a smile like that.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.599
So how do you feel about a guy

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:30.102
who after he finishes
wants to snuggle?

00:04:30.102 --> 00:04:31.404
Oh great question.

00:04:31.404 --> 00:04:33.739
Like I never ever
was able to ...

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:36.441
And we're talking real light,
like a spooning.

00:04:36.441 --> 00:04:37.676
Yeah, a spooning.

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:39.145
Not an intertwine.

00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:41.847
I don't like that,
like boyfriend, girlfriend shit.

00:04:41.847 --> 00:04:43.983
If I'm not your girlfriend,
I'm not your girlfriend.

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:46.085
I'll make you feel good.
I'll put on a good show.

00:04:46.085 --> 00:04:49.655
I'll give you what you want
but all that extra shit,

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:53.826
I don't ...
I'm not like that.

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.928
What's the weirdest request
you've ever had from somebody?

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.630
There's gotta be
some great ones.

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:04.437
The weirdest, it was kinda like
the fucking sickest, like sick.

00:05:05.004 --> 00:05:07.873
This dude had called
and I didn't know

00:05:07.873 --> 00:05:10.109
if he was for real
or if he was not for real.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.646
He was ... I was ready
to get him in trouble

00:05:14.646 --> 00:05:16.715
because he was talking
about fucking coming

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:18.584
with a five year
old little girl.

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.285
I was very real about that.

00:05:20.285 --> 00:05:22.254
And the fact that you would
tell people about that ...

00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:26.859
just joking. It was me.
Oh that's fucking ...

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:30.530
Okay, so back to this girlfriend
experience, extra shit.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.465
Does that mean
no deep tongue kissing?

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:35.635
How about ...
is kissing not cool?

00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:38.103
Kissing's cool.

00:05:38.103 --> 00:05:40.973
I don't want to kiss
everybody but kissing's cool.

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:43.476
What about just some light
compliments,

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:44.944
like those shoes are nice?

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:46.479
Yeah.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.114
How about if I make a fart noise
with my mouth on your belly?

00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:50.416
That's cool too.

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:52.118
What about inside jokes?
Inside jokes cool?

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:53.519
If we had something
we kinda referenced-

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:54.820
That's cool too.
Alright.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.989
What if I want to smoke
a little bit of crack

00:05:57.856 --> 00:05:59.559
while we're on our date?

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:01.460
I've had that.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.331
Okay. Would you enjoy
a little bit of crack with me?

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:08.000
No, I don't smoke crack.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.336
Okay would you be
comfortable with me

00:06:11.336 --> 00:06:12.938
arguing with bill collectors

00:06:12.938 --> 00:06:14.440
while you sat next to me
on a couch?

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.808
Yes.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.443
Okay. All right.

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:19.712
What about other drugs?
What drugs do you do?

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:22.381
Smoke weed.

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.917
Smoke weed?
How about a little bump?

00:06:24.917 --> 00:06:26.753
If I want to maybe
snort some coke

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:28.754
off your ass hole
is that okay?

00:06:28.754 --> 00:06:30.022
Yes.

00:06:30.022 --> 00:06:31.356
Okay cool, cool.

00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:32.892
Do you like a little coke
in your ass hole?

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:34.594
Numb it up a little bit?

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:38.965
I like to try new shit.

00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:40.833
I like she's thinking.

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.468
Do you know what I like
about you,

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.236
and I will say this Haley,
you're up for negotiation

00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:45.504
which I think is-

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:46.706
Yeah, right.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.607
I mean you got
to meet people half way

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:49.975
and I think Haley knows that.

00:06:49.975 --> 00:06:51.209
Close the deal.

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:52.844
Would you watch me shadow box
and tell me

00:06:52.844 --> 00:06:55.214
I'm super tough
and no one can beat me?

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:56.548
That's awesome.

00:06:56.548 --> 00:06:58.417
Could you tell me
that you're scared

00:06:58.417 --> 00:06:59.718
and I'm gonna say
I'm scared.

00:06:59.718 --> 00:07:01.019
And you're gonna tell me
there's no way

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:02.655
I'm gonna win the fight?

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:04.957
Could you tell me that I'm great
and it's my dad's loss

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:06.893
that he didn't pay
more attention to me?

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:08.127
Yeah.

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.395
Would you be willing
to break down

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:11.263
high school
football tape with me.

00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:12.764
Of where I made mistakes,

00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:15.467
maybe where I could have lined
up to put myself into play?

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:16.802
Absolutely.

00:07:16.802 --> 00:07:19.138
Would you join me
to my high school reunion?

00:07:20.172 --> 00:07:23.075
So that I can say everybody
fuck you guys, I made it.

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:26.012
Abso-fucking-lutely. Absolutely.

00:07:26.012 --> 00:07:27.680
And if they go,
"Who's this girl?"

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.816
You say, "The cleanest ass hole
in all of Huntsville."

00:07:30.816 --> 00:07:33.051
And then spread your butt cheeks
for all of his friends?

00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:34.286
Absolutely.

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:36.755
Yeah. Hell yeah.

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.624
If we went to Applebee's
would you hold the thing

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:41.227
that lets us know our table's
ready and it vibrates?

00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:43.228
Hell yeah.

00:07:43.228 --> 00:07:46.332
Are you currently doing
[inaudible 00:07:44]?

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.367
No. No because I'm waiting
on my cards to come in.

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:50.069
I don't have my card
right now.

00:07:50.736 --> 00:07:53.439
Haley whenever we have
fun guests in can we have

00:07:53.439 --> 00:07:55.274
Black Lou our producer
contact you again

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.076
so we could ask
a bunch of questions

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:59.278
with all of our
great guests with you?

00:07:59.278 --> 00:08:00.546
Hell yeah.

00:08:00.546 --> 00:08:01.780
That's Jay's way of saying

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.782
that you are
a fucking star Haley.

00:08:03.782 --> 00:08:05.150
God damn right.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:06.519
You make great radio.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:08.453
You answer everything.
She answered every question.

00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:11.324
Haley you are indeed
the definition of very outgoing.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:12.691
Thank y'all so much.

00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:13.892
And fun to be with.

00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:15.094
So we're gonna put you
on hold again

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:16.362
Haley.
Thank you so much.

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:17.897
And Black Lou's gonna
give you all the info,

00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:19.799
we'll make sure we get you
at least a file of this.

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:21.400
Okay well I'm glad
I got to be on the live,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.101
I wish I got viral other
than showing my booty hole.

00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:24.369
But hell whatever.

00:08:24.369 --> 00:08:25.604
That's all right.

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:26.839
Hey whatever gets you out there.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.340
Whatever gets your foot
in the door.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.143
I bet you would sell better
than me at Albany Funny Bone.

00:08:32.044 --> 00:08:34.647
Oh that bone.
Thank you so much Haley.
