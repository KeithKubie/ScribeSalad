Go to sleep in a chocolate bar or a can of sardines

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.520
and an infectious disease stress ball

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.889
that you can squish.
It's episode 16

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:10.989
of LÃœT.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.939
Are you tired of wimpy straws that make
you look like a loser?

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.840
Well, grab ThinkGeek's food grade Titanium straw.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.980
It tears into fruit like metal justice.
Keep being awesome with this mirror decal

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.340
that makes you look like the star
of a press conference. Or

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.590
these decals you can use to let guests
accessorise themselves by standing

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.170
just the right way. Keep a stash of
temporary stache-tous handy

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.320
to quickly turn your finger into what
you must...stache.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.980
Then lay back on your hamburger bean
bag. It's not cheap,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.760
but come, a diamond-shaped bean bag?
That's almost as classy

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.070
as liquor scented soaps.
Your butt is not clean

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.590
until it smells like a whiskey sour.
Also on Etsy are these adorable punk kitties

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.190
Hank

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.340
e-mailed me about. His friend makes them
and he says each one is handmade and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.730
completely unique,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.950
there will never be another one like it.
Speaking of e-mail,

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.020
these Air Swimmers also wound up in my
inbox. Remote-controlled

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.970
floating balloons you can scare cats with.
But if you're sick of e-mailing

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.189
you're gonna love today's free thing.
Snail Mail

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.310
My Email is a project started by Ivan Cash.
All you have to do

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.590
is send an email with the recipient's address

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.320
to snailmailmyemail@gmail.com by

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.590
August 15th. A team of volunteers will then
hand-write your message

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.170
and mail it to who you say. Write your
own awesome messages in this notebook,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.390
where instead of blank paper you're given
blank New York City walls and trucks

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.460
that your notes and doodles can deface.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.939
As a final escape from modern technology,
transform your iPhone 4

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.520
into an old leather book and then enter the future

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.840
with this amazing Levitron I found on Vat19. 
It can hold objects up to

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.950
12 ounces

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.250
and automatically adjusts when they move
or change weight.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.689
Here's a wine stopper that makes the
bottle look like a message in a bottle,

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.970
but if you prefer your potent portables quantifiable,

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.680
use this glass, which has markings
designating exact servings

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.450
of spirits, beer and wine. 
Beastie Boys action figures,

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.140
a spoon action figure, a miniature camera
that's a USB flash drive

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.560
and a flash drive that's... fresh.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.660
Beans can be fun when they come in a can.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.410
Water this and when the seed grows
it'll sprout with a message written on

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.890
it.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.810
If you live in or near London,
I'm gonna be there this weekend

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.209
at Summer in the City. It's an awesome
get together for cool people

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.670
and cool YouTubers
and if you can make it, I'll be there -

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.260
Vsauce unite. Speaking of Vsauce,
