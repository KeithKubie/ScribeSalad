STEPHANIE HANNON: Good morning.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.980
Thank you for joining
us for this session.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.780
Your interest and participation
mean so much to us.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.520
It helps us to get
to know the audience

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.260
in the room a little
bit, so I'd really

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.740
appreciate if you
show by your hands

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.997
when I say your continent
where you live-- not where

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:19.330
you're from, but where you live.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.350
So who is visiting
here from Europe?

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.600
All right.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.701
From Africa?

00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:26.200
One.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.710
Just one.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.209
Wow.

00:00:27.209 --> 00:00:27.760
Welcome.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.360
South America?

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.000
Amazing.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.570
Wow.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.680
OK, we have two.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.424
North America?

00:00:35.424 --> 00:00:36.250
Yeah.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.370
How many from the Bay Area?

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.510
OK, awesome.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.480
Asia?

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.770
And Australia?

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.240
Way to go, Mike.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.810
How many of you already
consider yourself

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.720
civic tech or
social entrepreneurs

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.480
and work in this space?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.950
Great.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.491
How many of you are crazy
excited about the World Cup?

00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:57.074
AUDIENCE: Yay!

00:00:57.074 --> 00:00:58.032
STEPHANIE HANNON: Yeah.

00:00:58.032 --> 00:01:00.210
How many people are exhausted?

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.510
Oh, equal.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.070
Equal.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.401
And can somebody tell
me-- did the USA win?

00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:04.942
AUDIENCE: No.

00:01:04.942 --> 00:01:05.580
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.830
AUDIENCE: Well, they sort of--

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.280
STEPHANIE HANNON: They did, no?

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.930
AUDIENCE: Well, they lost--

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:09.930
STEPHANIE HANNON: OK.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.570
Trickier answer than
I thought, trickier.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.680
OK.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.290
Well, thanks.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.810
We will go ahead
and get started.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.920
We are here today to talk about
how technology is transforming

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.350
democracy and disasters,
keeping people safe,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.150
and improving society.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.929
We're going to tell you stories
from our work at Google,

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.220
and we're going to tell you
stories about entrepreneurs

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.160
and companies outside of Google.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.325
We'll talk about open data and
APIs that are available today.

00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:37.700
And most importantly,
we're going

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.810
to engage you in a
conversation, because we

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.640
want to support
you, the developers,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.124
and figure out how we can
collaborate better together.

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:45.790
This is the beginning
of a long journey,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.400
and it's only with the
enthusiasm and passion

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.610
of people like
those in this room

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.840
that we'll make a difference.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.420
My name is Stephanie Hannon.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.560
Along with my colleagues
Eric Hysen and Payal Patel,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.670
we're crazy proud to be
here to talk with you today.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.260
We three are part of a team at
Google called Social Impact,

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.510
and we apply our
engineering talent

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.979
to social and
humanitarian problems

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.780
like improving society,
improving democracy, keeping

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.090
people safe, ending
repressive censorship,

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.750
and making the nonprofit
ecosystem more impactful.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.690
I've been building products
at Google for almost a decade,

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.710
from launching Gmail all
over the world to building

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.110
maps for Europe,
Middle East, and Africa

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.230
and even launching Google
Wave on this stage.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.997
Anyone Wave fans?

00:02:33.997 --> 00:02:35.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.770
Thank you, thank you.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.530
But I joined this
team earlier this year

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.900
because I was in awe of the
problems that need attention

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.830
and also Google's commitment
with resources and people

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.410
to try to solve and
make a big impact.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.830
I'd like to share two
examples of the type of work

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.370
our team does by taking
you back to 2012,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.330
when Hurricane Sandy hit the
Eastern seaboard just eight

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.590
days before the US election.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.580
I probably don't
need to remind you

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.355
that Hurricane Sandy
was the deadliest

00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:08.610
and destructive of that season.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.410
Its winds spanned 1,000 miles,
and more than 268 people

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.700
died in the seven
countries it touched.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.810
The damage in the US alone
was $68 billion dollars.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.810
As you can see, this is
a picture of Hoboken.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.180
More than half of
Hoboken was flooded,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.710
as was chunks of Staten
Island and Brooklyn

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.690
and lots of coastal communities.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.340
The streets were
turned into rivers,

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.250
and lives and
homes were ravaged.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.130
At a moment like
this, there's a lot

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.090
of critical need for
information about resources.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.070
You can see this is a
picture of a Hess gas

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.110
station in New Jersey where cars
lined up for hours and hours.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.390
Nobody knew where gas
was and how to get it.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.830
The Google Crisis team was able
to publish this crisis map,

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.250
and all the green dots
on there represent

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.430
availability in
the tri-state area.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.950
You could change it to different
types of inventory questions.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.690
And the real challenge here is
fresh, real-time information,

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.330
because in a moment
like this there's

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.530
not a single source
of data available.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.340
So we were able to build this
by working with distributors

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.030
like Hess, with
government agencies,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.910
and with crowdsourcing efforts
like GasBuddy and Maplet.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.660
Some of the best
sources of information

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.451
were high school students
in New Jersey who

00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.950
were calling constantly
gas stations,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.860
and we got fresh,
real-time information.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.550
And the challenge at
Google is to ingest

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.530
data from all these
different sources and lots

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.460
of different formats,
sanitize it, and publish it

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.630
to consumers in a useful way.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.630
And tens of thousands of
people viewed this map,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.664
and we hope it helped
keep them safe and warm.

00:04:40.664 --> 00:04:43.080
Payal is going to talk a lot
more about our crisis efforts

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.579
today.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.300
Another challenge was
dozens of polling locations

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.420
were flooded just days
before the US election,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.640
and the government had
this incredible challenge

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.860
of how do we get
information out about where

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.160
people should go to vote.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.990
So a company called Mobile
Commons built an SMS messaging

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.490
app.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.940
It was really simple.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.590
You would SMS your
home address, and it

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.520
would return your
polling location.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.650
It was built in partnership
with city and state governments,

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.010
and it leverages the
Google Civic Information

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.650
API, which Eric will tell
you a lot more about today.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.890
The governor of New Jersey
and the mayor of New York

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.930
got out on social media
and in press conferences

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.240
and promoted this.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.380
And the locations were
changing hour by hour,

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.850
so it was a pretty
important service.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.070
And in the days leading
up to the US election,

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.340
more than 200,000 people used it
to find their polling location.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.810
So Google Crisis Map and
Google Civic Information API

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.690
are two examples of
the work we are trying

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.890
to do to keep people
safe and improve society.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.970
And what's really amazing to
me is that we in this room

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.540
have the ability to touch
people on a global scale

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.090
with our products and services.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.760
It's remarkable the amazing
amount of technology computing

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.990
power that I can hold my hand.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.820
And today, over 60% of
the global population

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.000
has a cell phone and more
than 3 billion people

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.410
are online with access
to the internet.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.010
Technology has already
transformed media and commerce.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.230
It has the potential to fix
democracy, improve education,

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.045
and secure opportunity and
happiness for all people.

00:06:22.045 --> 00:06:24.170
We, along with the community
of people in this room

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.560
and around the world, are
working in this space,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.770
and we hope by you guys
coming to this talk

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.917
today we're going to
recruit even more.

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:33.500
And I just want to say this is
the only use of a prop all day.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.260
So if you came for
sexy demos, wrong room.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.550
So as we've been
working in this space,

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.566
we've developed three principles
that are critical to our work.

00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:46.440
I want to share them
with you, and then we'll

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.310
talk about them throughout
the conversation today.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.850
The first is designing for
openness and interoperability.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.730
If you want to work in disaster
response or civic engagement,

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.070
you need to work
with governments.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.020
And there's thousands
of government entities

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.890
around the world, and
they're lacking incentives

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.420
to open up data
in common formats.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.770
So it would not be great
if we built something

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.840
that worked for San
Francisco but it didn't

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.880
work for Seattle
or Rio or Tokyo.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.460
So thinking early
about common formats,

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.920
how to organize
people around them,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.530
and building for openness
and interoperability

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:24.230
and advocating for open data
has been a big part of our work.

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:28.310
Second, in our experience,
the way open data is published

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.840
is very rarely consumable
in an easy format

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.090
by people or by developers.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.030
And so a lot of work has
been about transforming data

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.080
so that we can build
meaningful consumer product

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.460
features in Google Now
Search and other places,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.760
but also giving it back
to you guys in a platform

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.465
and through APIs so you can
do meaningful things too.

00:07:49.465 --> 00:07:51.090
And finally, a third
principle for us--

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:52.756
I noticed in the
keynote all good things

00:07:52.756 --> 00:07:54.130
come in three, right?

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.530
Everyone sees that--
think like a startup.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.250
So the same aggressive way
you would pursue an idea

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.895
and try to fail fast, the same
attention to user segmentation

00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:06.090
and who you're serving.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.030
Google, for example--
we're working

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.140
really hard on search quality
around the nonprofit ecosystem,

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.050
and it's a decision
whether we're

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.990
trying to reach the people who
are donating and volunteering

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.140
or trying to reach the people
who are looking for services.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.880
So be clear about
your user segments

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.620
and who you're trying to serve.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.190
Also in thinking like a
startup, funding is available.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.006
There's VC funding.

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.130
There's foundation funding.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.730
You can build sustainable,
scalable businesses.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.070
So think like a startup
as you approach this.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.770
And finally, there's
tons of action

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.169
in this space around weekend
projects or hackathons,

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.659
and that's great.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:39.320
More ideation is good.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.230
But this can also be sustainable
and scalable businesses.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.100
It can be your
full-time gig, and I

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.140
hope you'll think
about that today.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.080
As we go out and advocate
and talk to groups,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.190
people often ask, is
there funding available?

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:53.160
Can I really work in the space?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.960
So you can see in this graph
from the Knight Foundation

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.620
that civic tech is
on a fast growth.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.070
121 companies were
started in 2012 alone--

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:06.330
and I apologize that the
text here is so small.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.270
So lots of activity, lots
of growth in civic tech.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:11.890
But is funding available?

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.840
So in the period from January
of 2011 to May of 2013,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.280
$431 million--
sometimes I say 2,

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.962
so I have to check
slides-- $431 million

00:09:22.962 --> 00:09:24.510
were invested in civic tech.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.640
And the investment comes
in all different ways.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.710
The Omidyar Network did 16
investments in this space

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.290
alone.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.360
Y Combinator is now
supporting civic tech startups

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.700
and nonprofits in its program.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.780
Alumni of the Code
for America program

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:41.440
are starting lots of amazing
civic tech companies.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.940
Lots of action, which is why
it's so exciting that you chose

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:47.910
to be here with us to
talk about it today.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.400
So I'm going to turn it
over soon to my colleagues.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.260
We're going to talk
about these principles.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.001
We're going to dig into some
stories about the work we do.

00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:57.500
And then we're really excited
to have this open conversation

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.660
about how we can
work better together.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.410
And now, for Eric.

00:10:03.472 --> 00:10:04.680
ERIC HYSEN: Thank you, Steph.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:05.930
My name's Eric Hysen.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.290
I manage our elections and
civic engagement products.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:11.790
I've been a part of
this team since 2009

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.540
and before that worked
on political campaigns.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.420
I want to start by going
back to the 2008 US election.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:23.460
Just six years ago but
feels a long time ago.

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.680
So imagine you're getting
ready to vote in that election.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.210
Think about the
information you might need,

00:10:30.210 --> 00:10:31.880
what you would need to do.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.400
One of the top
things on your list

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.406
is probably where you vote.

00:10:35.406 --> 00:10:37.610
If you're anything
like me, you probably

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:41.074
think that you should go
online for this information.

00:10:41.074 --> 00:10:42.740
Unfortunately, it
turns out that, again,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.450
just six years ago, in 39
states there was no way

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.670
to find this information
online at all.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.810
But even pausing
that for a second,

00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:52.720
let's say you were lucky.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.910
You lived in one of
the 11 states that did

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.510
put this information
online-- say, New Hampshire.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.040
This is the service the New
Hampshire state government

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:04.550
provides for looking up
your voting information.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.850
Try to work through it with me.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:08.402
You have two options here.

00:11:08.402 --> 00:11:10.110
On the left, you can
enter in a whole lot

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.440
of personal information
that actually

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.130
has nothing to do with where
you're assigned to vote at all.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.090
Or on the right, you
get to do two things.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.300
First you select your
street from a drop

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.940
down of every
street in the state.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.559
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:27.559 --> 00:11:29.350
And I've still never
figured this part out.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:31.060
I've looked at this site a lot.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.690
You pick if your street
number is between 1 and 99

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:35.090
or 1 and 131.

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:40.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.720
Or if you're at
all rational, you

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.860
would probably come across a
site like this and give up.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.700
And that makes sense, but let's
think through the consequences

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.760
of that if you're
trying to vote.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.800
It's Election Day.

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.940
You've probably seen a
lot of polling places.

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.470
Maybe you passed one on
your drive into work,

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.200
so you stop there
on your way home.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.500
You very likely could end
up in a line like this one.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.280
You could wait in
this line, possibly

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.590
for hours, just
to get to the end

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:12.670
and finally figure out this
wasn't actually your polling

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.820
place.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.810
So the poll worker
there checking you in

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.990
will probably very
happily tell you

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.770
where you actually go to vote.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.310
But at this point, you've
been waiting for hours.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.020
You probably have to get home to
your family or go back to work.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:29.330
How likely are you to
actually cast your vote?

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:30.950
This isn't just an
individual problem.

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.580
This can happen to hundreds
of thousands of people.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:37.490
It's particularly bad for the
least advantaged among us,

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.660
who really don't have
this time to spare.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.150
And it's not just about
finding your polling place

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.090
but about registering
to vote on time

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:48.630
or bringing the right
forms of ID to the polls.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.710
In aggregate, what are just
frustrating experiences

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:54.780
individually can sway the
outcome of an election

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.720
just because people don't
have the information

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.290
they need in an easy format.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.430
So this is where
Google comes in.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.180
As you might imagine, the
quality of our search results

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.940
is particularly important to us.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.010
So we have a lot of people
across the company who

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.690
are frequently looking through
our broad, aggregate trends,

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.350
trying to be sure that we're
doing a good job of answering

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:17.080
our users' queries.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.130
So in the run up to
the 2008 election,

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.030
we had some of these
folks that kept

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:24.130
seeing these spikes for
searches like "Where do I vote?"

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.770
as elections approached.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:26.730
That makes sense.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.840
But like we just saw,
we really couldn't

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.150
do a very good job of
answering these questions,

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.210
because the information
either wasn't out there

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.360
or wasn't easily accessible.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.390
So we decided that we had an
obligation and the ability

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:42.310
to do much better.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.330
We set out to collect and
standardize this information

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:48.820
and quickly ran into the fact
that, like many government

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.190
services in the US,
voting is actually

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.520
not run at the national
level-- not even run

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.680
at the state level.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.770
It's run in the thousands of
individual counties in most

00:13:57.770 --> 00:13:58.780
cases.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.540
So this means that
there are thousands

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.250
of different government
agencies all running voting.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:06.000
And, of course, they
all do it differently.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.330
So rather than go
at this alone we

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.930
worked with some partners,
notably the Pew Charitable

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:13.590
Trusts, to set up a group
called the Voting Information

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:18.030
Project to go out, collect, and
standardize this information.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.050
We expected things
to be pretty tough

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.980
but were still pretty shocked
at some of what we saw.

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:25.120
This is one example.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.460
This is actually from 2012.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:29.645
It's unfortunately not
too much of an outlier.

00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:30.980
I really wish it were.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.580
But this is what
the team got when

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.550
they talked to the
election officials

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:39.280
in Dale County, Alabama, and
asked for information on how

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.270
to map voters to polling places.

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.250
So they got faxed
back this document,

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.270
and there are a lot of problems.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:48.670
My favorite is here.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.530
You can see how they tried
to update this for 2012 just

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:55.250
crossing out 2006.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.400
Problems like this
really are not uncommon

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.470
when dealing with
government data.

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:04.010
One other example-- the
state of Texas, a huge state,

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.120
doesn't finalize their polling
places until the Friday

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.650
before the election.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:12.650
So you have 72 hours to collect
this, standardize it, process

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:15.670
it, get it out to their users.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:17.560
But the team persevered.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.970
And in the end, we had
thousands of different files,

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.120
all different formats.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.390
This is where our
first pillar comes in.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:28.590
Rather than try to deal
with them all separately,

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:30.500
we created a
standard data format

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.960
to make this easier to use, the
first-ever interoperable data

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.680
format for voting information.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.120
It's an XML-based format called
the VIP, Voting Information

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.800
Project XML spec, and here's
a little bit of how it works.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.820
Since we're at a
developer conference,

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.700
I can show some XML.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:51.260
So polling places in
the US are assigned

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.190
based on these things
called street segments.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.910
Unlike most other uses of
anything related to geodata,

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:02.520
you don't have shapefiles in
this case but tabular data

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:06.990
that are lists of ranges
of addresses on the street,

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.770
even down to what
side of the street

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.970
you're on, because the lines for
which polling place you go to

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.350
can actually be drawn down
the middle of the street.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.100
So you need something
that's a little more

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.010
precise that governments
are able to use.

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:22.240
So this XML defines a
street segment in Virginia,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.970
maps it to a precinct, and
then another part of the XML

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:30.100
says where that
precinct goes to vote

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.380
and gives you that in
a structured format.

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:36.490
Other parts of this data give us
things like ballot information,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:41.450
rules on voting, early vote
places, things like that.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:44.280
In the end, this is what
we turned this data into.

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.050
This is how you can now get
voting information on Google

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.150
just by entering
in your address.

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.460
On the left, you get your
polling place, opening hours,

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.550
a link to Google
Maps for directions.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.020
On the right, you get
information on your ballot

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:00.190
all the way down
to the local level.

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.300
This has been incredibly
successful so far.

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:05.819
In 2012, this was used
over 24 million times

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:10.569
to find information on how to
vote, and that's been great.

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:13.050
We've been really amazed
at how that's been used.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.339
But as Steph said
at the beginning,

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:19.210
our team's goal is to try to
address these social issues

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:19.900
at large.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.300
And helping Google users find
this is really important,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.990
but it's far from
the entire story.

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.050
So as we were
doing this, we kept

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.690
running into other
groups that were

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.779
looking at similar problems.

00:17:31.779 --> 00:17:33.570
One of them was the
League of Women Voters.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:37.690
Their voter education group, one
of the oldest in the country.

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.440
If you get these thick paper
ballot guides in the mail

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.850
before an election, they're the
people responsible for those.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:46.610
They do really great work, and
they, as a lot of folks do,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.990
wanted to do more online.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.990
And they started looking at
how they could tell their users

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.850
where their polling places were.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.390
So their first attempt
was to take these 51 XML

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.190
files from every state and
DC and try to process them

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.260
like we were doing, but
we all pretty quickly

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.530
realized that was
not the best idea.

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:09.510
It turns out it's a lot
better to have a data format

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:12.890
than to have just jumbled
data, but it's still not

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.830
all that easy to work with.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:18.200
And groups like the League
are not technology companies.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.310
They're civic
engagement non-profits.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:24.020
So their time is best spent
actually engaging voters, not

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.160
building data
processing pipelines.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.330
So this is where our
second principle comes in.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.020
Just having open data, even
if it's in a great format

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.810
and even if it's interoperable,
isn't always enough.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:39.670
You need to transform it to
make it useful for people

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.520
to really distribute
it at scale.

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:46.040
So to do that, we built the
Google Civic Information API.

00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.990
This is a free API that
exposes all of that information

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.420
very easily.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:54.270
You just pass in an address
and get back response

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.850
about all the voting information
associated with that place.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.480
This is a simple request.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.870
It's just the plain text
address and an ID number

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.860
that's associated with what
election we're talking about.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:10.690
The documentation is on the
developer site down there.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:11.570
Here's the response.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:12.540
It's in JSON.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.260
Again, not too complicated.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:18.800
You get your polling place, some
details about that, information

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.970
on the contests on the ballot,
other things like that.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.660
So the API has been
very successful as well.

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:29.290
This was actually what
powered Mobile Commons

00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:31.720
that Steph was talking about
in the beginning in making

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.340
an SMS-based service for
use during Hurricane Sandy.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.580
Mobile Commons was able
to focus on dealing

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.890
with building a fast,
responsive mobile interface.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:44.610
They let us handle all
the messy data work.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.370
The API actually
ended up being so

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:48.430
successful we used it
for our own product.

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:50.740
We didn't expect to do this.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.400
And the voter information
tool that I showed you

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.160
a couple slides ago
is fully open source.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.010
It uses the Civic Information
API, the Maps API,

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:02.540
and a number of other
Google Developer Tools,

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.280
and you can get the code at
Google Code right up there.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.880
But after every
election, we also

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.940
then started hearing
from these developers

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.967
that they wanted to
extend their apps.

00:20:13.967 --> 00:20:15.550
No one wants to build
something that's

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.460
just usable in a small moment.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.880
And they wanted to extend it
from contests and candidates

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.410
and polling places to elected
officials and politics

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:26.400
every day.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.130
So last year we
expanded this API

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.900
to include a new
representative info query.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:36.390
It will give you information
on political districts,

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:40.150
elected officials, offices
in pretty much the same way

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.950
as what I just showed you.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.565
One of the top developers using
this so far is Change.org.

00:20:46.565 --> 00:20:47.940
If you haven't
seen them, they're

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.070
an online petition site,
one of the biggest.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.670
And if you're familiar
with online petitions,

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.870
you've probably come
across the criticism

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:57.490
that it's hard to
take them seriously

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.330
because anyone could
be signing them.

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:02.820
You have no idea where they
live or who they actually are.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.200
So what Change.org did is they
used the Civic Information

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.710
API to create a new feature that
tells an elected official how

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.110
many of the people that
signed a petition actually

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:16.080
live in their district
and are their voters.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.990
So it addresses one
of the key problems

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.530
to taking the online
activism seriously

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:25.304
and also gives elected
officials new insight

00:21:25.304 --> 00:21:26.970
into what's important
in their district.

00:21:29.776 --> 00:21:32.150
Change.org is also a great
example of the third principle

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.320
that we're talking about,
think like a startup.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:36.820
They have a social mission.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.940
They're trying to empower
anyone to drive change

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.270
through their petitions
and through their product,

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:44.030
but they've also
thought and approached

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:48.290
this with all the normal
tools of a startup.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:52.610
And as a result, they have 300
paying clients and $25 million

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:53.170
in revenue.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.300
So our team's work also
scales internationally.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.510
It was great seeing
so many of you

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.400
from other parts of the world.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.900
This is an example
of a map we built

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.610
for India's election,
which ended last month.

00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:10.500
We've done work like this
in over 40 countries.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.170
India was one of the craziest.

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:17.070
Their election is
the biggest election

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:19.470
in the history of democracy.

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:21.820
So there are over
800 million voters,

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.760
and it's so many that they can't
actually all vote on one day.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.310
Instead, they split up
voting across nine days

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.140
over five weeks.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:32.970
So you can imagine
everything I was just

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.730
saying for the US nine
times more complicated.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.330
It was a ton of fun.

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.390
But what we did was
we built this map

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.250
that, now that the
election's over,

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.940
shows results of the
voting in every district.

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:49.050
But before that, users could
enter in their zip code

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.930
and find candidates that are
running in their district.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.550
We presented a lot of
information that we aggregated

00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.970
about those candidates,
including something

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.440
that I was surprised to learn
was particularly relevant

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:03.320
for Indian politics, the
candidates' criminal histories.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:10.000
So you can see this guy was the
incumbent member of parliament

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.640
in New Delhi.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.640
You can see that he had a
criminal case against him.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.100
When he was in
parliament, he only

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.650
actually showed up
37% of the time.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.470
And then he in last
month's election

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:24.170
ended up getting
kicked out of office.

00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:28.230
He only got 18% of the vote.

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.130
Our API that I mentioned,
the Civic Information API,

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:32.980
is currently US only.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.744
But there are
developers worldwide--

00:23:34.744 --> 00:23:36.160
hopefully many of
you in this room

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.680
as well-- that are
doing work like this

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.920
and that are also building
tools to make it easier

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.980
to get involved anywhere.

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.960
One of those examples
of many is Poplus.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.860
This is a group that started
when developers in the UK

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.250
and in Chile were talking
and working together

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.850
and realized that
they were building

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.880
very similar tools
that were just

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.760
launched in different countries.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.350
So they started a
set of components

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:07.000
that are reusable and
interoperable, customizable,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.510
fully open sourced that let
developers in any country

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:14.360
easily build some of
these different civic apps

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.510
with much less startup cost.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:20.520
So that's a little
bit about some

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.540
of the work our team is
doing making information

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:25.859
on the democratic
process easier to access.

00:24:25.859 --> 00:24:27.900
There are some of the
tools that we talked about.

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:29.358
If you're interested
in this space,

00:24:29.358 --> 00:24:31.190
I hope you'll take a
look at some of them.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.690
And I want to hand it over to
Payal, who will talk about one

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.860
of the other big challenges
our team works to address.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:43.745 --> 00:24:44.620
PAYAL PATEL: Awesome.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:45.790
Hi, everyone.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.040
Again, my name is
Payal Patel, and I'm

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.980
a product manager on the
Google Crisis Response team.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.248
How many of you
recognize this screen?

00:24:55.248 --> 00:24:58.010
OK, a good number of hands.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.920
You probably also remember
the long, shrieking sound

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.150
that played with it.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.490
This is the Emergency
Broadcast System

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.350
originating from
the 1960s that used

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.870
traditional media
such as television

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:15.850
and radio as the primary
means for alerting authorities

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.370
to get critical information
such as tornado warnings

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:22.770
out to the affected public.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:25.570
Now, fast forward to 2012.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:28.730
And some of you might
recognize this message,

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:36.030
which also has a loud, blaring
tone that plays with it.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.000
There are now wireless
emergency alerts

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.360
that allow authorities
to geographically target

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:46.710
text-like messages to get
critical information out using

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.920
cell towers.

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:53.010
Now, while these alerts are very
effective to let people know

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.690
when they're in danger,
they have their limitations

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.000
as to providing details
about this emergency

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.990
situation and really
further actionable content.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.340
So people usually
turn to the internet

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:09.560
to get this additional
information.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.090
Now, step back two years ago.

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:15.800
Let's say you're in
central Tennessee

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:18.310
and you hear a siren go off.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.580
You think it might be a tornado.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:23.690
You're not sure, so you
turn to Google Search

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.940
and you search, "Is
there a tornado?"

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.650
Traditional search results
actually weren't that relevant.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:33.160
There wasn't any mention
of the tornado warning

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.100
that was just
issued moments ago.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.750
It shouldn't be this difficult
to find critical information

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:43.500
when minutes count,
and this is the problem

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.980
that our team set out to solve.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:50.990
We've done this by building an
emergency broadcast platform

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:55.240
for the internet
called Public Alerts.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.520
It aggregates, ranks, and
surfaces emergency messages

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:03.320
like this tornado warning
into everyday tools people

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:08.250
use, such as Search,
within minutes of issuance.

00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:11.800
Now, as you can imagine,
a major component

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.710
in building this
type of platform

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:17.600
is actually getting the
authoritative content.

00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:21.710
So how did we go about doing
this in a scalable way?

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.640
Every alert issuer
has their own means

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:31.960
of creating alerts and their
own dissemination mechanism.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.560
Some have a Twitter feed.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.920
Some have a website.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.230
Some don't have any
information online at all.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:43.800
It'd be much easier if
there was a standard

00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.570
that these alert issuers
used, and it turns out

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:47.360
there actually is.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:51.220
It's called the Common
Alerting Protocol, CAP.

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:54.530
About 13 years ago CAP was
designed in consultation

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.540
with over 100
emergency managers,

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.670
and it's been adopted as
an international standard.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.940
So why is this
standard important?

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:09.340
Well, if data providers can
create a RSS or Atom feed

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:13.510
with all of their content
in the CAP format,

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:17.310
then it becomes easy to
exchange this information

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:20.920
across various platforms.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:23.330
So let's look at an example.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.020
This is an example of a
tsunami warning issued

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:32.800
by BMKG, the official alerting
authority in Indonesia.

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.870
This is the alert in
the raw text format,

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:39.620
and those of you that can
read Bahasa Indonesian

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:43.280
could tell that this has
really useful content.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.100
But it's difficult to
machine parse as is.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.700
Now, here's the same
tsunami warning in CAP.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:56.270
CAP is an XML-based alerting
spec that normalizes the format

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:00.370
and provides a standard and
flexible way to target alerts

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.940
by dimensions such
as language, event

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.230
type, a headline,
and description.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.640
And again, like Eric and
Steph mentioned earlier,

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.270
building a product around a
standard is important for us

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.930
because it plays a
critical role in designing

00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:20.390
for openness and
interoperability.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:26.150
Our team has really
embraced the CAP standard

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.860
and are doing as much as we
can to drive adoption globally.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.050
We've served over
half a million alerts

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:36.000
from 17 different alert
providers across seven

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.904
different countries and in
six different languages,

00:29:38.904 --> 00:29:40.195
and this is just the beginning.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:48.070
So now in 2014, nearly a decade
since the devastating Indian

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:53.520
Ocean tsunami, how do people get
emergency information online?

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:58.010
Well, if you're in the coastal
region of northern Sumatra

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:02.590
in Indonesia and have the
Google Search app installed

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.180
on your Android or
iOS device, your phone

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.890
would buzz to notify you
that there is a tsunami

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:13.620
warning in effect, and you
could take action on it.

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.980
You'd also be given
relevant information

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.200
about the situation such
as estimated arrival

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.490
times and wave heights in
a familiar, easy-to-consume

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.400
format.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.040
Again, this is not
just about getting

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.530
the authoritative content but
really transforming that data

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:35.530
and making it useful.

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.790
Similarly if you're
in Sanmin, Taiwan,

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:43.945
you're notified via Now if
there's an oncoming typhoon.

00:30:43.945 --> 00:30:47.550
Or if you're in
Timbiqui, Colombia,

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:49.560
during rainy season
and want to check

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.700
if you're affected by
a landslide warning,

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:54.690
you can quickly find that
authoritative information

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:56.120
and take action to stay safe.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.530
Since we've launched
Public Alerts,

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.310
we've received
feedback from users

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:05.640
stating that they were
notified and able to get

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.780
relevant information about
the situation they were in

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:14.980
and take actions such as
seeking shelter to stay safe.

00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.570
Other users have said that this
was the only way they learned

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:22.020
about the situation they were in
because they're mobile phone is

00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:25.010
their only means for
staying connected.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:30.560
So now, what can you as
developers do to help?

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.930
Well, what you're
developing or your product

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:35.540
might be where
some of your users

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:40.000
spend a majority of their
time, and therefore it

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.960
can become a distribution
point for emergency alerts.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:48.100
You can help keep your
user community safety

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:51.530
by integrating alerts
into your product.

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:55.050
One way for you to do this
is to subscribe to our Alert

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:58.780
Hub, which is where we
host all the official data

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:03.780
feeds that we've onboarded
in their raw format.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:06.940
Alert Hub is open to
the developer community,

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.570
and it follows the
PubSubHubbub protocol.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:13.490
You could also check out
the current publisher

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:18.390
feeds that we have
available at the second URL.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.390
Or if you're
interested in accessing

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.760
Public Alerts at a
higher level, you

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:27.360
can become a beta tester
of our Public Alerts API.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.980
You can see the API in
action at this demo URL.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.830
The demo site gives you a
map list and a list view

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:40.500
of all the current alerts
that are accessible,

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:44.770
and on the right you
can see JSON output.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.630
If you click on any
of the active alerts,

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:51.040
you're then directed to
the Alert Details page.

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.190
And if at any given time you
want to see what alerts are

00:32:54.190 --> 00:33:03.320
active in our database, you can
go to google.org/publicalerts.

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.540
Apart from Public Alerts,
I want to quickly run

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.750
through a few other projects
that our team works on.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.220
These are all open
source projects.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.800
One, Person Finder.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:17.370
It's a tool that helps people
reconnect with their loved ones

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.640
during the aftermath
of a disaster.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:24.010
Crisis Map, which is a
rich, Geo Mashup tool

00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:27.270
designed to share
critical content,

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:30.360
and it's optimized
for mobile use.

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:34.140
And finally, we also
had a Java CAP library

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.760
that can be used for
creating, parsing,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:41.380
and validating CAP alert feeds.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:45.160
Now, I want to quickly
switch gears and highlight

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:49.650
a couple of projects outside
of Google that were developed

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:52.350
by programmers during
a disaster situation

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.550
and really had a high impact.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:57.180
I'm sharing these
examples to give you

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.050
all an idea of how
high-impact tools can

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:05.290
be developed in a
crisis situation.

00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:09.810
This is an image from March
2011 in Fukushima, Japan,

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:12.940
after the massive
magnitude 9.0 earthquake

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.075
struck followed by a
catastrophic tsunami.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.090
Within the developer
community in Japan,

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.969
there were nationwide
hackathons for programmers

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:29.139
that wanted to apply their
technical skills to help those

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.929
that were affected
by the disaster.

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:33.770
One of the apps
that was developed

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:36.949
was Wind from Fukushima.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:40.610
This app was basically
a mobile emergency kit

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:43.010
for those affected by
the nuclear power plant

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:45.250
explosion in Fukushima.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:48.370
It calculated radiation
levels around the area,

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:52.130
taking into account wind
speed and direction.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.989
It also provided users with
the resource information,

00:34:54.989 --> 00:34:59.470
such as where they could
find clean water and food.

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.850
In order to develop this app,
official, accurate content

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.460
again was critical.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.650
The developer used
openly-available radiation data

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:12.140
provided by local government
ministries and the power

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:14.920
companies.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:19.140
The raw data was in a
difficult-to-consume format,

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:23.320
so he took out
the relevant data,

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.960
matched it up with relevant
user-generated data,

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.560
and was able to
present it to users

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:31.210
in an easy-to-consume format.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.120
Again, this is an example
of taking open data

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:37.890
and transforming it
to become useful.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.300
This app was specifically
built for Fukushima.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:42.910
And while it was not
necessarily scalable,

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:46.750
it had an impact on the
residents in Fukushima

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.940
in that many relied on
it on a day-to-day basis

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:53.390
to help guide them
and stay protected.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:55.140
Another tool I want
to quickly highlight

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.690
was one that was used
during Hurricane Sandy.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:02.790
A major challenge during the
recovery phase of a disaster

00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:06.940
is managing the influx of
volunteers and the immense work

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:11.720
that needs to be done on the
ground in an organized way.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.390
This is the problem
Crisis Cleanup solves.

00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:17.400
It's a collaborative work
order management system

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:22.150
for disaster recovery agencies.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:26.300
It uses a
craigslist-like approach

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:29.260
in that any
organization that knows

00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:32.320
of work that needs to
be done can submit it

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:35.500
and then any organization
with the capacity

00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:39.980
to take that work on accepts
it and gets to help right away.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:44.990
Crisis Cleanup is a
really good example

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:48.500
of an open source tool that
thought like a startup.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:53.550
They were passionate
about an idea,

00:36:53.550 --> 00:36:57.130
were aggressive about
getting funding,

00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.340
and built a scalable tool.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:02.400
It's helped over
10,000 households

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:06.380
across 13 different disasters
in the US, the Philippines,

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.095
Australia, and India.

00:37:09.095 --> 00:37:10.720
And now, I'm going
to hand it back over

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.680
to Steph, who's going
to summarize all

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.586
that we've talked about.

00:37:14.586 --> 00:37:17.967
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:22.384 --> 00:37:23.800
STEPHANIE HANNON:
In the tradition

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.082
of great presentations, we
told you a bunch of stuff,

00:37:26.082 --> 00:37:28.040
and now I'm going to tell
you what we told you.

00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:35.060
From addressing crime to turning
us all into citizen scientists,

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:37.750
online tools and
apps have the power

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:40.100
not just to make
life more convenient

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.870
but empower and inspire
entire communities.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:46.100
These are seven of the
stories we featured today,

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.930
but they're seven
of hundreds, and we

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:49.810
wanted to tell a lot more.

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:51.550
In fact, there's
three companies--

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:55.330
SeeClickFix,
OpenCounter, and Watsi--

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:56.970
that we wanted to
talk about, but I

00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:58.760
thought we had a whole hour.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.500
And then when they told
me we had half an hour,

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.590
we had to do a little editing.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.800
But check them out,
please, Watsi, SeeClickFix,

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.400
and OpenCounter are other
amazing civic innovation

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.452
startups.

00:38:11.452 --> 00:38:13.410
And when we were rehearsed
this, lots of people

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.330
asked, why'd we
pick these seven?

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:18.340
Well, some of them are our
partners and use our APIs,

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.510
but some of them we just admire.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.240
Some follow the principles
we laid out today,

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.290
but not all of them.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.150
The Wind app wasn't built
for scalar sustainability.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:30.170
It was one engineer with a
passion and a problem to solve,

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:33.090
and he had incredible
impact in just a few days.

00:38:33.090 --> 00:38:35.460
And I hope we all as
engineers and developers

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.389
feel like we have
that potential too.

00:38:38.389 --> 00:38:40.680
So now you're probably
thinking, how do we get started?

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.790
What can we do?

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:43.470
There's so many ways
to get involved.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:46.310
As Payal said, your app
could be a distribution point

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:47.817
for public alerts.

00:38:47.817 --> 00:38:49.900
You might want to use the
Google Civic Information

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.490
APIs to do something really cool
for the US midterm elections

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:56.180
or for the 2016
presidential elections.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:59.160
Or, as Eric said, the
Google Civic Information API

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.172
is US only.

00:39:00.172 --> 00:39:01.630
If you want to talk
to us about how

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:03.780
to make it available
to your country or city

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.800
or even how to be an
advocate for open data

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:09.640
in your community,
we'd love to talk.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.350
If you can remember
nothing else,

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.260
these are the two
URLs that will get you

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.910
to all of the information about
the APIs and open source tools

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:19.590
that we talked about today.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.990
And l love how many cameras
are taking a picture.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.505
Do it.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.970
And those are Google
resources, but Google

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.340
is part of this huge
ecosystem, and there is so much

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.540
information and so
many tools available.

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.170
So we've put together a list
and a short URL at the bottom

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:43.930
if you want to check out Code
for America, Hack for Change,

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:47.100
Sunlight Foundation, Data.gov,
and lots of other resources.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:51.830
I want to put up a
short plug in that today

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:53.780
at 4:00 PM in this
very room there's

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.980
going to be a panel with three
finalists from the Bay Area

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.235
Google Impact Challenge.

00:39:58.235 --> 00:39:59.860
And if you're interested
in this space,

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.490
I think you'd really enjoy it.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:05.010
And also the Code for America
fellowship application

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:07.404
for the 2015 year
is available now.

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:08.320
I heard some clapping.

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.028
That was awesome.

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:13.257
This is my last slide.

00:40:13.257 --> 00:40:15.340
It's my call to action,
and I'm going to mix it up

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.180
by showing you pictures
unrelated to anything we talked

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:21.280
about for the last half an hour.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.660
We live in a remarkable time.

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.820
Most of us have lived
through the PC revolution.

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.410
We've witnessed the
invention of the internet

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:32.800
and in the last decade seen
a proliferation of devices

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:37.590
from mobile phones to tablets
to watches and yes, even

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:39.390
the self-driving car.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:43.690
With all this new connectivity,
many parts of human existence

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.980
have fundamentally improved.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.590
And yet, we're barely
scratching the surface

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:51.390
of how this online,
connected world can tackle

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:55.330
some of our biggest challenges,
from access to education,

00:40:55.330 --> 00:41:00.880
availability of energy and
clean water, poverty, hunger,

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:04.390
climate change,
and public safety.

00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.060
I don't have the answers,
and I'm impatient.

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.420
I think most of us that
work in this internet world

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:11.900
are somewhat impatient.

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.260
But social change is
hard, and it takes time.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:19.960
And it's only with lots of
ideation, lots of building,

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.530
and lots of
collaboration that we'll

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:23.404
continue to make progress.

00:41:23.404 --> 00:41:25.070
And that's why we at
Google hope to take

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:28.320
on some of the messiest problems
so we can give to you guys

00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:32.320
platforms and clean APIs and
data for you to innovate on.

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.260
There's no use in us all
reinventing the wheel.

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.010
And if you're new to
this space, one thing

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.970
I hope you take
away from today is

00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:41.090
that there is funding
available and there

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.277
are social ventures
that want to hire you.

00:41:43.277 --> 00:41:45.610
And I hope you'll continue
to think like an entrepreneur

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.930
and be scrappy,
ambitious, and flexible.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:52.090
We at Google are so proud to
be part of this ecosystem.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:55.600
And we want to talk now about
how we can better serve you

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.260
as developers, because
we're all in this together.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:00.512
Thank you.

00:42:00.512 --> 00:42:03.879
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:09.624 --> 00:42:11.540
So I think we have a few
minutes for questions

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:13.373
and would look for
anyone to come to the mic

00:42:13.373 --> 00:42:15.110
and talk about these
projects or anything

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:19.200
else-- projects you're working
on, APIs you want to see.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.720
We welcome questions.

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.300
AUDIENCE: Are your
APIs available on YQL

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.200
or other places where
you can access the APIs

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:30.210
without downloading the XML?

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.919
ERIC HYSEN: The APIs are all
on the Civic Information site

00:42:32.919 --> 00:42:34.710
listed on the Google
Developers site, which

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.550
is the main for all APIs there.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:37.510
STEPHANIE HANNON: I
don't know specifically

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.620
about YQL, his question.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.720
ERIC HYSEN: I don't
know specifically, no.

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:39.785
STEPHANIE HANNON: OK.

00:42:39.785 --> 00:42:40.890
We don't know about YQL.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.824
If it's a place we
should publish--

00:42:42.824 --> 00:42:43.990
AUDIENCE: YQL is from Yahoo!

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:47.390
It's a way that you can
query any data on the web

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:49.222
through a single REST API.

00:42:49.222 --> 00:42:49.930
ERIC HYSEN: Yeah.

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:50.270
STEPHANIE HANNON: OK.

00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:51.160
We'll check it out.

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.576
Not today, but
we'll check it out.

00:42:52.576 --> 00:42:53.318
Thank you.

00:42:53.318 --> 00:42:54.709
Question?

00:42:54.709 --> 00:42:55.250
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:57.599
Steph, Eric, Payal,
great talk, by the way.

00:42:57.599 --> 00:42:58.640
STEPHANIE HANNON: Thanks.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.264
AUDIENCE: I just have
a quick question.

00:43:00.264 --> 00:43:05.080
With the evolution of internet
things and new technology,

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.550
I was just wondering what you
guys' long-term vision-- say,

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:09.666
three to five years
out-- looks like.

00:43:09.666 --> 00:43:11.695
STEPHANIE HANNON: Wow,
three to five years out.

00:43:11.695 --> 00:43:13.486
Do you guys want to
talk about your spaces?

00:43:13.486 --> 00:43:14.944
ERIC HYSEN: That's
a good question.

00:43:14.944 --> 00:43:19.800
I think we want to see what
all of you can come up with,

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:23.140
and we're going to be informed
by where everyone else is going

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:24.560
and what amazing
things we can do.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:27.440
I think there are a lot of
ways that the work we're doing

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.500
is barely scratching
the surface.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.880
I think there's ways
we can scale globally.

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.240
Particularly, we can
scale more locally.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.540
We're looking now
at particularly

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:42.940
how we can start to give a more
personalized and more assistive

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:44.890
approach to a lot
of this work too.

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:46.530
But that is a very broad answer.

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:47.905
STEPHANIE HANNON:
I think we also

00:43:47.905 --> 00:43:49.296
each have personal passions.

00:43:49.296 --> 00:43:51.170
I've worked in the geo
space for a long time,

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.210
and I have a personal
mission of no wasted time.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:55.280
Just no wasted time.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.870
Why do we sit in traffic?

00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:57.995
Why do we wait for parking?

00:43:57.995 --> 00:43:59.954
Why is there a line
at Tartine Bakery?

00:43:59.954 --> 00:44:02.370
There shouldn't be wasted time,
and we have an amazing set

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:05.089
of location data that can help
cities run more efficiently.

00:44:05.089 --> 00:44:06.630
So that's a personal
passion of mine.

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:08.580
And I think in each of
the spaces we work on,

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.825
we have big visions
like that driving us.

00:44:11.825 --> 00:44:12.450
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:12.786
Thanks again.

00:44:12.786 --> 00:44:13.286
Good talk.

00:44:13.286 --> 00:44:14.660
STEPHANIE HANNON: Thanks.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.110
AUDIENCE: Hi, and thank you.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.450
I noticed that Google seems
to have a public policy group.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:24.100
And so I think one
of the questions

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:26.450
I have is all the
focus on voting.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:27.980
But voting is not enough, right?

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:30.130
We need to be involved
in our community.

00:44:30.130 --> 00:44:33.380
And wouldn't it be good
if in the voting app

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.110
there was something
that showed people

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.730
how to get involved in
their community boards

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:39.250
and actually become mayor?

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:42.720
And we should be involved in
public policy, not just voting.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.990
STEPHANIE HANNON: Absolutely.

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:45.200
Completely agree.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.020
Wholly agree.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:49.700
So you saw a slice of one of
the product areas we work on.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:52.752
Another whole area we're working
on is called civic engagement.

00:44:52.752 --> 00:44:54.460
And it's about how
you get people engaged

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.340
with their local community,
because we live in a world

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:58.010
where people don't even
know their neighbors

00:44:58.010 --> 00:44:59.005
or people on their block.

00:44:59.005 --> 00:45:00.450
AUDIENCE: They don't even
know their representatives.

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:00.870
STEPHANIE HANNON:
They certainly don't

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.120
know their representative.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:06.350
And I live by Dolores Park,
closed for half a year.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:07.630
I had no idea it was coming.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:09.213
So things happen
every day that affect

00:45:09.213 --> 00:45:11.434
my bike lanes, my
schools, my parks.

00:45:11.434 --> 00:45:12.350
Nobody knows about it.

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:14.600
So we have a huge suite
of engineers and product

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.650
people trying to think
about civic engagement

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:19.130
and how to get people
not just to be informed

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:22.070
but to take action and to care.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:23.499
And if you're
excited, talk to us,

00:45:23.499 --> 00:45:25.290
but also maybe we can
feature some of those

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:27.180
if we're lucky enough
to be here next year.

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:29.350
AUDIENCE: Yet they know
everything about the World Cup.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:30.490
STEPHANIE HANNON: Yeah,
everything about the World Cup.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:31.280
I'm with you.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.891
We're so happy you're here.

00:45:32.891 --> 00:45:35.140
AUDIENCE: Thanks for throwing
up that Code for America

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:35.815
Fellowship application.

00:45:35.815 --> 00:45:38.330
I'm a fellow this year, and
I would encourage everyone

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:40.370
to apply and check it out.

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:43.650
My question is actually about
the Civic Information API.

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:45.810
I'm curious how
that gets updated.

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.522
Is there a process for that?

00:45:47.522 --> 00:45:49.480
So when some of the
information is out of date,

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.742
I'm just curious.

00:45:50.742 --> 00:45:51.450
ERIC HYSEN: Yeah.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:45:53.400
So we work with a number
of different groups

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.074
that collect this
data as well as

00:45:56.074 --> 00:45:58.490
some groups that crowdsource
some of this data collection.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:00.460
So as more elections
are happening,

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.540
we are constantly updating it.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.200
But also long term, I think
one of the big questions

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.832
in this space is,
how can we reduce

00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:10.290
the amount of manual
work it takes?

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:11.998
So I think it's an
interesting challenge,

00:46:11.998 --> 00:46:15.045
but we definitely are
staying up to date now.

00:46:15.045 --> 00:46:15.920
STEPHANIE HANNON: OK.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:16.420
Great.

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.484
AUDIENCE: So there's nothing we
can do to update portions of it

00:46:19.484 --> 00:46:20.400
or anything like that?

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.855
Is there a way we
can contribute?

00:46:21.855 --> 00:46:22.730
ERIC HYSEN: Oh, yeah.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:24.104
I think one of
the projects we're

00:46:24.104 --> 00:46:27.260
working with Sunlight's
Open States project, which

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.890
is looking at crowdsourcing
all of this information.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:33.162
They're the best route
to go with right now.

00:46:33.162 --> 00:46:34.120
STEPHANIE HANNON: Yeah.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.020
And come talk to us afterwards.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:35.870
ERIC HYSEN: Yes.

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:36.530
STEPHANIE HANNON:
We'd love help.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:38.670
So we're going to just take
the two more questions.

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:40.990
Yeah, you guys.

00:46:40.990 --> 00:46:42.610
AUDIENCE: Thanks
again for sharing.

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:45.300
A lot of those anecdotes
were very interesting to see.

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.517
I guess the data comes
up as kind of users,

00:46:48.517 --> 00:46:49.850
and then we just kind of see it.

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:51.470
It's like, oh, it
magically appears.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:54.090
But with a lot of the voting
things, I'm really interested.

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:56.020
As we're pulling
information from all

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.430
these different
sources and we're

00:46:57.430 --> 00:47:00.260
trying to be selective on
what's very effective to show

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.150
to the different
users, how do you

00:47:03.150 --> 00:47:05.235
try to be neutral on
the entire process,

00:47:05.235 --> 00:47:07.506
especially with something
as sensitive as voting?

00:47:07.506 --> 00:47:08.214
ERIC HYSEN: Yeah.

00:47:08.214 --> 00:47:11.130
We're very focused on just
what is the core information

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:14.460
that you need procedurally
to cast your ballot right now

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.660
and then giving you the
options to explore from there.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.270
So we'll tell you
who's on your ballot.

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:23.490
We'll make it easy to search
for them on Google, which

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.620
will give you way
more information,

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:27.520
or find them on social networks.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.440
But right now, we're being very
selective on what information

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.324
we're presenting that is the
core procedural information.

00:47:36.324 --> 00:47:37.740
STEPHANIE HANNON:
I'm going to ask

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:39.948
Eric a tough follow-along
question to that, which is,

00:47:39.948 --> 00:47:42.820
doesn't even the placement of
which candidate comes first

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:44.855
in search results or
showing the ballot matter?

00:47:44.855 --> 00:47:47.750
ERIC HYSEN: That's a
good question, Steph.

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:50.700
Yeah, and that's something
I've learned way more about

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.990
than I ever expected
when joining this team.

00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:55.220
We follow the order
that candidates actually

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.950
appear on the ballot when
it is available to us.

00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:59.950
Otherwise, we'll look at
randomizing the order.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.350
We take all of that
very seriously.

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.350
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:48:03.350 --> 00:48:04.669
Our last question.

00:48:04.669 --> 00:48:05.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:06.160
Thank you.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.220
My name is Norman Avila.

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.870
I'm coming from Guatemala.

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:12.510
I am very interested
since almost once

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:16.290
a year ago about implementing
CAP alerts in Central America.

00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:23.895
I know that agencies
in Central America

00:48:23.895 --> 00:48:29.760
don't have a data
feed or alerting feed.

00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:35.350
We have earthquakes, floods,
volcanic eruptions, everything.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:39.470
So I don't work for
an official agency.

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:43.045
I'm just somebody that
likes weather and maps

00:48:43.045 --> 00:48:44.892
and this kind of information.

00:48:44.892 --> 00:48:46.850
I would like to know--
you mentioned that there

00:48:46.850 --> 00:48:51.000
was funding for this
kind of project.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.780
Do you have any leads
that we can see?

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:58.410
I'm telling you, I think that
the effort in Central America

00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:01.410
couldn't be
individually by country.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:05.020
I already know agencies that
coordinate weather services

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.800
or emergency
management agencies,

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:14.290
and I have worked on projects
not as an agency employee

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:18.370
but as a technology consultant
for regional projects

00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:23.390
where the same system is used
by all the region instead

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:26.360
of replicating the same
technology and the same cost

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:27.570
in every country.

00:49:27.570 --> 00:49:32.070
But I know that the
effort is not only to say,

00:49:32.070 --> 00:49:35.050
OK, this is the standard
place implemented.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:39.170
We have to start by
organizing the agencies

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:41.450
and then providing
the technology.

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:43.360
So I would like
if you can give us

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.040
any feed that we
can get in touch.

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.040
PAYAL PATEL: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.430
That's a very good question.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:53.040
So as we've expanded globally,
we've learned some countries,

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.004
they were already
publishing CAP.

00:49:55.004 --> 00:49:57.170
Some countries we worked
with, they didn't have CAP,

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:58.590
but they were motivated.

00:49:58.590 --> 00:50:01.650
They had the technical
resources at those agencies

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:03.510
to start publishing CAP.

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:07.980
And then, now we're coming
across countries like Guatemala

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.915
where they're very
disaster prone

00:50:09.915 --> 00:50:14.350
but they just don't have the
resources to put towards--

00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:16.340
AUDIENCE: Or the
protocols even to

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:18.577
what to do in case of disaster.

00:50:18.577 --> 00:50:19.660
PAYAL PATEL: Right, right.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:25.485
So there already is
an open source tool

00:50:25.485 --> 00:50:28.280
to help agencies publish CAP.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.880
So it's an easy-to-use
tool that doesn't

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.130
require any technical resources.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:37.200
But there's a bit of work
required for that tool,

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.900
depending on the country.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:42.450
Like you said, it's
different for each agency.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.550
So that's one way
you could help,

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:46.830
building on top of
this open source tool.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:48.840
And I'm happy to talk
to you afterwards.

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.505
AUDIENCE: OK, I'll
wait for you then.

00:50:50.505 --> 00:50:51.005
Thank you.

00:50:51.005 --> 00:50:51.440
PAYAL PATEL: OK, great.

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:51.740
STEPHANIE HANNON: Great.

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.320
We're so grateful
you came today.

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:55.590
Thank you, and enjoy
the rest of I/O.

00:50:55.590 --> 00:50:58.940
[APPLAUSE]
