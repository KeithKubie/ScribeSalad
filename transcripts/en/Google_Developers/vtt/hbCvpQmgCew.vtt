TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.640
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.640
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.760
Read Feed is an app that just
graduated from Google Play's

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.099
early access beta program.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:14.640
Now, read the post
to learn about how

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.670
they use the program, to
solicit feature requests,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.360
identify bugs, locate new
and optimize existing target

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.890
markets, as well as build
a sizable reader community.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.410
This is a great article
for fitness app developers.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.240
It outlines three
recommendations

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.220
towards building a more
valuable fitness app

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.420
experience with examples.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.770
Take a look.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.830
A Style Transfer
is the technique

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.900
used by some new
phone and web apps

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.540
to help you render your
favorite picture in the style

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.190
of a well-known work of art.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.590
This a really cool
post on our research

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.410
blog about going a step
further by combining

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.080
many different styles to
explore unique mixtures

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.040
of well-known artists and
create an entirely unique style.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.060
If you're into machine
learning, it's a fun read.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.760
You can now treat Google Cloud
Storage like a file system

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.692
with our new
PowerShell provider.

00:01:04.692 --> 00:01:06.150
It's included in
the latest release

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.860
of cloud tools for
PowerShell, and lets

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.950
you use commands like
CD, copy, or even cat

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.130
to navigate and manipulate
your data in cloud storage.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.860
More details are on the post.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.010
We now have support for
Windows Server 2016 Data Center

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.770
Edition, the latest version of
Microsoft's server operating

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.290
system on Google
Compute Engine, which

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.980
means you can launch instances
with Google Compute Engine VM

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.550
images with Microsoft Windows
Server 2016 pre-installed.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.400
