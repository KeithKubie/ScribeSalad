00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.693
- [Voiceover] In the equation
shown above, a is a constant.

00:00:03.693 --> 00:00:05.922
For what value of a does the equation

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:09.207
have infinitely many solutions?

00:00:09.207 --> 00:00:11.390
So, you end up with
infinitely many solutions

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.572
if your equation simplifies to something

00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:16.367
like x is equal to x,

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:19.233
or one is equal to one,

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:21.452
something that's true,
that's going to be true

00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:24.110
for any x that you pick.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.850
So, let's see what we can do

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.488
with this thing right over here.

00:00:27.488 --> 00:00:28.548
These are obviously, now, you know,

00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:30.198
if you've got 100 equals 100,

00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:31.046
now, that would be the same,

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:32.963
that would have infinitely many solutions.

00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:35.064
Zero equals zero, these
would all be situations

00:00:35.064 --> 00:00:37.792
where you have an infinite
number of solutions.

00:00:37.792 --> 00:00:39.323
So, when I look at this thing up here,

00:00:39.323 --> 00:00:42.285
my first instinct is, well,
let's just see if I can

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:43.688
simplify this a little bit.

00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:45.628
I'll leave the a in there,
and then see if I can get

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:46.870
to a point where it's going to have

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.368
an infinite number of solutions.

00:00:48.368 --> 00:00:49.366
So, let me just re-write it.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.224
So, we're going to have three plus ten x

00:00:52.224 --> 00:00:57.035
minus five is equal to a plus one

00:00:57.035 --> 00:01:00.499
times x minus two.

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:01.878
So, let's see, now, on the left-hand here,

00:01:01.878 --> 00:01:05.067
I can add the three and the negative five,

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:07.715
or I can take three minus five,
that would be negative two.

00:01:07.715 --> 00:01:12.288
So I get ten x minus two is equal to,

00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:14.627
now, let me distribute the x.

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:18.330
So, it's going to be ax plus x.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.330
All I did here is, I
distributed the x minus two.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.399
Now, let's see, what happens if,

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.807
so, let's see, I could get rid of both

00:01:26.807 --> 00:01:29.988
of these negative twos, if
I add two to both sides.

00:01:29.988 --> 00:01:32.461
So, if I just, remember,
anything I do to one side,

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:33.667
I've gotta do to the other one,

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:36.582
if I wanna hold the equality
to continue to be true.

00:01:36.582 --> 00:01:39.008
So, I just added two to both sides,

00:01:39.008 --> 00:01:41.751
and I am left with ten x

00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:46.684
is equal to ax plus x.

00:01:46.684 --> 00:01:49.517
Now, let's see, let's
subtract x from both sides.

00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:50.596
So, if I subtract x,

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:51.676
actually, I can just write it like this,

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:54.475
I could subtract x from both sides.

00:01:54.475 --> 00:01:56.760
On the left-hand side,
I'm gonna get nine x.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.462
On the right-hand side,
I'm going to a, ax.

00:02:01.462 --> 00:02:03.517
So, how could I have an
infinite number of solutions

00:02:03.517 --> 00:02:06.302
an equation that's
gonna be true for any x?

00:02:06.302 --> 00:02:10.133
Well, if a was equal to nine,
because if a is equal to nine,

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.329
I'm gonna have a situation.

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.790
So, if a is equal to nine,

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.390
then you're going to have
a situation where nine x

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.909
is going to be equal to,
instead of a, I'd write nine,

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.791
is going to be equal to nine x.

00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.589
Well, that could be true for any x.

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.284
Any x times nine is going to be equal

00:02:24.284 --> 00:02:25.829
to that same x times nine again.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.440
You're going to have an
infinite number of solutions.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.843
And, so, a needs to be equal,

00:02:30.843 --> 00:02:35.150
a, it needs to be equal
to, a is equal to nine.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.677
Now, what's really interesting here is,

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:40.770
think about what would
happen if is any of these

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.813
other things right over here.

00:02:43.813 --> 00:02:46.450
Then, you're going to
force a different solution.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.450
But anyway, we'll leave
that for another video.
