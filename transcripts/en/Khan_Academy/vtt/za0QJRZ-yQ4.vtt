00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:02.310
Determine the domain and range

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.070
of the function f of x is equal to
3x squared plus 6x minus 2.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.845
So, the domain of the function is:
what is a set of all of the valid inputs,

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:16.209
or all of the valid x values
for this function?

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.760
And, I can take any real number,
square it, multiply it by 3,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.150
then add 6 times that real number
and then subtract 2 from it.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.690
So essentially any number if we're talking
about reals when we talk about any number.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.674
So, the domain, the set
of valid inputs, the set of

00:00:30.674 --> 00:00:35.280
inputs over which this function
is defined, is all real numbers.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.610
So, the domain here is
all real numbers.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.270
And, for those of you who might say, well,
you know, aren't all numbers real?

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.960
You may or may not know that
there is a class of numbers,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.750
that are a little bit bizarre
when you first learn them,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.020
called imaginary numbers
and complex numbers.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.790
But, I won't go into that right now.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.397
But, most of the traditional
numbers that you know of,

00:01:00.397 --> 00:01:02.520
they are part of
the set of real numbers.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.340
It's pretty much
everything but complex numbers.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.868
So, you take any real number
and you put it here,

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:11.440
you can square it, multiply it by 3,
then add 6 times it and subtract 2.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.672
Now, the range, at least the way we've
been thinking about it

00:01:14.672 --> 00:01:16.520
in this series of videos--

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.790
The range is set of possible,
outputs of this function.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.770
Or if we said y equals f of x
on a graph, it's a set

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.030
of all the possible y values.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.914
And, to get a flavor for this,
I'm going to try to graph

00:01:31.914 --> 00:01:33.450
this function right over here.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.438
And, if you're familiar with quadratics--

00:01:35.438 --> 00:01:38.770
and that's what this function is
right over here, it is a quadratic--

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.300
you might already know
that it has a parabolic shape.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.610
And, so its shape might look
something like this.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.530
And, actually this one will
look like this, it's upward opening.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.540
But other parabolas
have shapes like that.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.201
And, you see when a parabola
has a shape like this,

00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:55.127
it won't take on any values
below its vertex when it's upward opening,

00:01:55.127 --> 00:01:59.960
and it won't take on any values above
its vertex when it is downward opening.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.450
So, let's see if we can graph
this and maybe get a sense of its vertex.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.420
There are ways
to calculate the vertex exactly,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.050
but let's see how we can
think about this problem.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.840
So, I'm gonna try some x and y values.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.360
There's other ways to directly compute the
vertex.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.850
Negative b over 2a is the formula for it.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.990
It comes straight out of the quadratic

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.300
formula, which you get from completing the
square.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.140
Lets try some x values and lets see what f
of x is equal to.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.680
So, let's try, well this the values we've
been trying the last two videos.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.610
What happens when x is equal to negative
two?

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.004
Then f of x is 3 times negative 2 squared,
which is 4, plus 6 times

00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:44.870
negative 2, which is 6 times negative 2,
so it's minus 12 minus 2.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.160
So, this is 12 minus 12 minus 2.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.630
So, it's equal to negative 2.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.660
Now, what happens when x is equal to
negative 1?

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.400
So, this is going to be 3 times negative 1
squared, which is just 1, minus, or I

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.434
should say plus 6 times negative 1 which
is

00:03:02.434 --> 00:03:05.690
minus 6 and then minus 2, and then minus
2.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.402
So, this is 3 minus 6 is negative 3 minus

00:03:10.402 --> 00:03:14.450
2 is equal negative 5, and that actually
is the vertex.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.130
And, you know the formula for the vertex,
once again, is negative b over 2 a.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.550
So, negative b.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.780
That's the coefficient on this term right
over here.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.860
It's negative 6 over 2 times this one
right over here, 2 times 3.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.280
2 times 3, this is equal to negative 1.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.070
So, that is the vertex, but let's just
keep on going right over here.

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.200
So, what happens when x is equal to 0?

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.133
These first two terms are 0, you're just
left with a negative 2.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.740
When x is equal to positive 1.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.555
And, this is where you can see that this

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.920
is the vertex, and you start seeing the
symmetry.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.500
If you go one above the vertex, f of x is
equal to negative 2.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.790
If you go one x value below the vertex, or
below the x

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.910
value of the vertex, f of x is equal to
negative 2 again.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.780
But, let's just keep going.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.170
We could try, let's do one more point over
here.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.250
So, we have, we could try, x is equal to
1.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.840
When x is equal to 1, you have 3 times one
squared which is 1.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.070
So, 3 times 1 plus 6 times 1, which is
just 6, minus 2.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.800
So, this is 9 minus 2 it's equal to 7.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.491
And, that I think is enough points to give

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:22.730
us a scaffold of what this graph will look
like.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.530
What the graph of the function would look
like.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.040
So, it would look something like this.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.690
I do my best to draw it.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.030
So, this is a x equals negative 2.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.270
We draw the whole axis.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.495
This is x is equal to negative 1, this is
x is equal to, this is x is

00:04:40.495 --> 00:04:45.720
equal to 0 and then this is x is equal to
1 right over there and then

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.980
when x is equal to, we go from negative 2
all the way to positive.

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.530
Or, we should go from negative 5 all the
way to positive 7.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.210
So, let's say this is negative 1,2,3,4,5.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.450
That's negative five over there on the y
axis,

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.760
y axis and then it will go to positive 7.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.330
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.210
I could keep going, this is in the y, and
we're going

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.540
to set y equal to whatever our output of
the function is.

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.310
Y is equal to f of x.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.110
And this is one right here.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.210
So, lets plot the points.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.480
You have the point negative 2, negative 2.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.710
When x is negative 2, this is the x axis.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.400
When x is negative 2, y is negative 2.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.590
Y is negative 2 so that is that right over
3.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.500
So, that is the point, that is the point
negative 2, negative 2.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.258
Fair enough?

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:47.130
Then, we have this point that we have this
pink or purplish color.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.900
Negative, when x is negative 1, f of x is
negative 5.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.010
When x is negative 1, f of x is negative
5.

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.590
And, we already said that this is the
vertex.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.960
And, you'll see the symmetry around it in
a second.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.914
So, this is the point negative 1, negative
5.

00:05:59.914 --> 00:06:03.550
And then, with the point 0, negative 2.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.234
0, negative when x is a 0, y is negative
2, for f' of x is negative

00:06:09.234 --> 00:06:14.624
2 or f of 0 is negative 2, so this is the
point 0, negative 2,

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:20.050
and then finally when x is equal to 1 and
f of 1 is 7, f of 1 is 7.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.895
So, that's right there it's a point 1, 7
and it gives us a

00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:30.740
scaffold for what this parabola, what this
curve will look like.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.560
So, I'll try my best to draw it
respectably.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.563
So, it would look something, something
like

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:40.830
that, and keep on going in that direction.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.320
Keep on going in that direction.

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.000
But, I think you see the symmetry around
the vertex.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.260
That if you were to.

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.870
If you were to put a line right over here,
the

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.190
two sides are kind of the mirror images of
each other.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.143
There, you can flip them over, and that's
how we know it's the vertex.

00:06:53.143 --> 00:06:56.839
And, that's how we also know, because this
is an upward opening parabola, I

00:06:56.839 --> 00:07:01.008
mean, there is formulas for vertex, and
there are multiple ways of calculating it.

00:07:01.008 --> 00:07:03.483
But, since it's an upward opening
parabola, where

00:07:03.483 --> 00:07:05.652
the vertex is going to be, the minimum
point.

00:07:05.652 --> 00:07:08.960
This is the minimum value that the
parabola will take on.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.210
So, going back to the original question,
this is all for trying to figure out

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.150
the range, the set of y values, the set of
outputs that this function can generate.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.920
You see that the function, it can get as
low as negative 5.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:22.560
It got all the way down to negative 5
right at the vertex.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.699
But, as you go to the right, as x values
increase to

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:30.160
the right or decrease to the left, then
the parabola goes upwards.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.440
So, the parabola can never give you
values--

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.040
f of x is never going to be less than
negative 5.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.920
So, our domain,
but it can take on all the vaues.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.810
It can keep on increasing forever as x
gets

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:42.750
larger, x gets smaller farther away from
the vertex.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:46.432
So, our range, so we already said our
domain is all real numbers.

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:52.463
Our range, the possible y values
is all real

00:07:52.463 --> 00:07:58.866
numbers greater than or equal to negative
5.

00:07:58.866 --> 00:08:00.234
It can take on the value of any

00:08:00.234 --> 00:08:02.646
real number greater than or equal to
negative 5.

00:08:02.646 --> 00:08:05.007
Nothing less than negative 5.
