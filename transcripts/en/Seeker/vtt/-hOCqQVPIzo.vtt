00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.120
hows your neurochemistry?

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.650
Hi everyone, its me your resident molecular
neuroscientist here for DNews

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.480
These days it seems that everyone is a chemist,
and our own brains are our experimental medium.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.599
Caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol are our favorite
legal reagents, and some states have added

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.160
a new one: THC.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.730
Tetrahydrocannabinol, THC, is the psychoactive
component of marijuana and the chemical responsible

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.029
for the “high” people reportedly feel.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.130
With legalization on the minds of many, we
thought we’d take a look at new data on

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.760
the lasting effects of this drug on our brains.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.200
Now, I wanna say upfront that studies that
attempt to examine functional and structural

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.230
changes in human brains and attribute them
to chronic drug exposure are extremely challenging

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.870
because, its nearly impossible to control
all the variables inherent in our everyday

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.870
human lives.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.710
While mice and other model organisms share
the same genetic sequence, live in the same

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.900
type of cages, eat the same food, and share
the same sleep schedule, it is IMPOSSIBLE

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.220
to replicate these conditions in human studies.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.900
The next time you’re looking at a news report
on a human pyschotropic drug study ask yourself

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.750
“how many test subjects were these conclusions
based on?” because small studies that contain

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.340
only tens of participants, are more likely
to contain high levels of variability that

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.940
*could* influence the conclusions drawn.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.810
That said, a recent report from Northwestern
University found what they call “exposure

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.890
dependent morphometric abnormalities” but
they really just mean “structural changes”

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.360
in young, non-addicted marijuana users compared
to non-users.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.590
This new study went beyond the usual brain
region activation experiments to examine the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.040
volume, shape, and density of grey matter
(a measure loosely associated with cell count)

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.159
in a group of 40 college students in the boston
area.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.591
As expected there was an increase in the volume
and density of grey matter in the Nucleus

00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:58.220
Accumbens and Amygdala of marijuana users,
but what was really interesting was a change

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.740
in *shape* of the Nucleus Accumbens in the
marijuana users.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.530
The Nucleus Accumbens is one of my favorite
brain regions because it is an important connection

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.700
in the set of neural pathways we call the
“reward circuit”.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.819
The pleasurable feelings you get when you
see or experience something that makes you

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.799
happy is because of activation in this important
brain area.

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:18.810
That all sounds good right?

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.090
well, because it’s responsible for helping
you feel good, this nucleus is also a big

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.269
factor in the development of addictions.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.709
In rodents, a portion of the nucleus accumbens
has been shown to increase in size as dependence

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.840
on addictive substance increases, and researchers
in this human study expressed concern that

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.140
the changes in shape, volume, and density
they observed in the 20 marijuana users they

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.969
looked at may be irreversible structural changes
that prime the brain for addiction.

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.700
marijuana use during the years of development
(which, for humans, doesn’t stop until the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.870
mid twenties) has been shown to correlate
to lower IQ, impaired memory, and poor decision

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:55.870
making.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.859
So when and if you decide to experiment with
your brain chemistry, make sure you understand

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.389
that it might not just be molecules that you
are playing with.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:03.629
What do you think??

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.849
how dense is your Nucleus Accumbens?
