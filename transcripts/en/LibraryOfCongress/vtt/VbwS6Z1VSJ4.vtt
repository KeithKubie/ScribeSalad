&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Ellen Oh: Good morning.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.640
Hi. My name is Ellen Oh.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.940
Thank you.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.240
Thank you.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.940
You're making me blush.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.240
Thank you.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:43.450 position:56%
I'm the president of We Need Diverse
Books, and I'm so grateful for all

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.570
of you coming in the rain
to be here with us today

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.460
at the Second Walter D.
Myers Award Ceremony.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.510
Thank you everybody.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.050
[ Applause ]

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.480 position:56%
So it is so hard to believe that
it's only been less than three years

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.960
since We Need Diverse Books
formed, and we have had

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.810 position:56%
so many changes happen, and I'm just
so proud of everybody in this room

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.730
that has been a part of that
change and supporting the movement

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.980
for better literature
for all of our children.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.860
I couldn't be prouder of all
that WNDB has done, and today,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.940
I'm so excited, I have
the great honor

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.510
to introduce the 14th librarian
of congress, Dr. Carla Hayden.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:47.290
[ Applause ]

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.760
&gt;&gt; Dr. Carla Hayden: Well good
morning and welcome to the Library

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.400
of Congress, and thank you Ellen.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.210
And you can imagine, you know,
you have many things that you do

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.190
at as a librarian of congress.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.160
There aren't many where I
get to bring my favorite book

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.020
from childhood and talk about
the need for diverse books.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.590
And so I want to thank you for
sponsoring the Walter award

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.750
and the work that you're
doing every day.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.340 position:56%
As many of you might know, I started
my career as a children's librarian

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.060
and one of my colleagues
is here today.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.310
[ Applause ]

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.520
It was in the 70s.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.820
I could admit that.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.760 position:56%
And at that time, working in a small
storefront branch on the south side

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.730 position:56%
of Chicago, there weren't many books

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.340
to give the young people
I worked with.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.310
And when I think about that and
what we've been able to accomplish

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.160
in a relatively short period of
time and the push to keep it going,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.680
I think about what
Bright April meant for me.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.790
Even though this book, and I don't
remember who put it in my hand,

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.070
but somebody saw a little
skinny African-American girl

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.910
with two pigtails and said, "Maybe
you'd like to see this book,"

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.610
and even today I can't
stop hugging this book

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.690
because what happened was I saw,
I thought, she's much prettier,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.680
myself reflected in
something that was important.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.930
Something that reflected my
experience, a loving family,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.940
an opportunity to be a
brownie, all of those things,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.040
and I love this book
so much and checked it

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.490
out so much that I got fines.

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.480
Full disclosure.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:53.070
And the fact that books can be
mirrors which is just as important

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.280
as well as windows to other people
and other experiences is something

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.470
that you celebrate, and I
know that you are working hard

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.960
to inspire others to do the same.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.860
I also and thanks to
organizations in just three years,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.140
all you've been able to do, the
publishers continue to be, I think,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.460
cognizant of the importance of
showing all types of characters,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.770
all types of families,
all types of situations.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.290
And the books we're here to
recognize today represent the best

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.660
in children's literature, and
congratulations to all of you.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.060
You may also know that
Walter D. Myers was a friend

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.140
of the Library of Congress.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.330
He was a frequent participant
in our national book festival

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.580
and a beloved national ambassador
for young people's literature.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.910
We can all agree he died too soon.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:58.030
He still had much work to
do, but his legacy continues

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.010
through the Walter Award.

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.230
He spends much of his time

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.250
when he wasn't writing
inspiring young people everywhere

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.550
to read more.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.940
And he knew, as all of us do,
that reading can be the path

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.960
to self-enlightenment,
self-enrichment, and understanding.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.110
When he served as the
national ambassador,

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:26.700
he was just continuing what he had
been doing for most of his life,

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.300
traveling the country
spreading the word.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.090
So I'm proud that the Library

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.160
of Congress is here today
celebrating his legacy.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.950
So now let me hand this
over, and you'll notice

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:46.020
that I'm pretty reluctant because
I just want to also say thank you,

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.360
thank you, thank you to all of you.

The winners, the people who selected
you, and the people who are working

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.990 position:56%

the right book at the right time.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.070
Kathie Weinberg, fellow
librarian and a great supporter

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.040
of the Young Reader's Center,
and not to mention the chair

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.510
of the Walter Award
will get things started.

[ Applause ]

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.510
&gt;&gt; Kathie Weinberg: Thank you
very much, and we all want

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.610
to thank Dr. Hayden so much for
her support of the Walter Award

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.470
and ceremony, and a big thanks
to the Library of Congress staff.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.450
This is only the second
year of the award

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:41.870
and We Need Diverse
Books has been privileged

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.730
to hold the Walter Award
ceremony and reception here

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:48.630
at the Library of Congress
both years.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.210
We are very appreciative
of your hospitality

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.290
and certainly the assistance of
Pam Jackson Center for the Book

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:59.990
and Karen Jaffe and the
YRC staff so thank you.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.520
And while I'm giving thanks,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.040
I want to say I am not the
chair of the judge committee.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.450
I am the co-chair.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.750
My fellow co-chair Kerry
Hong is back there.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.050
I want to thank her.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.510
We have bonded at the hip but -

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:21.690
[ Applause ]

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:26.320
And today we have three of our
judges here, Nia Hora Andre,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.170
Derek Ivy, and Shannon Lake.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:31.510
Thank you.

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:35.900
[ Applause ]

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:41.170
Unable to attend but with us
in spirit is Karen Lemons.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.950
And we also want to thank the
We Need Diverse Books volunteers

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.570
for all their help today.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:50.050
They're the ones with
rain spots all over them.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.030 position:56%
They've been going back and forth so
thank you very much for your help.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:59.460
Our guest speaker and
moderator today is author Rachel

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.760
Renee Russell.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.080
She's the author of the
Children's Choice Award

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.200
and New York Times best
selling the Dork Diary series.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.360
Rachel, I am sure receives more
fan mail than anyone in this room.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.080
If you're middle school career did
not include being part of the CCP,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.600
cute, cool, and popular you
could have used her books

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.230
to navigate your time
in middle school.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.980
In addition to being an
author, Rachel is an attorney

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.810
and of course mother of
two wonderful daughters.

00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:34.080
Rachel has also been
an amazing supporter

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.440
of We Need Diverse
books in our mission.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.980
So it's with pleasure that
I introduce Miss Russell.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.780
Thank you.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:50.350
[ Applause ]

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.080
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell:
Good morning everyone.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.980
I'm excited to be here.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.330
I just wanted to say a few
words, and I wanted to talk

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:09.000
about why we need diverse
books in 2017.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.480
Many individuals are passionate
about increasing diversity

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.860
in children's literature and
those numbers are growing daily.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:23.870
On March 15th, 2014, the late
celebrated author Walter D. Myers

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.520
and his son Christopher Myers,
both wrote out their pieces

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.320
for the New York Times
about the lack of diversity

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:37.180 position:56%
in children's literature mere months
before the hashtag We Need Diverse

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:39.460
Books was created.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:43.380
The editorial piece was
titled "Where are the People

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.640
of Color in Children's Books?"

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:52.120
It helped spark and renewed
the debate and passion

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.570
for change that we're seeing today.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.880
Was it [inaudible] who read that
article in the New York Times

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.180
and decided to take action?

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:11.620
No. It was mostly young adults,
book bloggers, authors, librarians.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:14.240
And others.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.480
Many of you here today.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.150
It made me want to change things.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.040
Since then, We Need
Diverse Books has grown

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:29.520
from a simple hashtag
to a powerful movement.

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.240
One that is increasing the
number of diverse books

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.280
and diverse authors
published in our society.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:39.210
We must continue to
advocate for change

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.610
because the situation is
more urgent than ever.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:48.950
Recent data from the US Census
Bureau indicates that almost half

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:51.110
of the American children
born under the age

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:55.590
of five years old are
people of color.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:58.520
We need to make a concerted
effort to ensure that the books

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:04.420 position:56%
that they will be reading are a
reflection of the world around them.

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.850
These books must contain
characters as diverse

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:13.070
as the children reading them.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:18.330
So, how can we make
change for the better?

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:22.800
There's no easy answer, but I
think the logical first step is

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.740
to continue to increase the number

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.130
of diverse children's
authors being published.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.930
The end result will be
an increase in the number

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.500
of books for diversive children.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.680
I personally know there are authors
out there, manuscripts in hand,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.240
waiting patiently to help
change the landscape.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.630
So who will also benefit from
diverse books in addition

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.140
to the children from
diverse backgrounds?

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:51.500
Everyone. In an assembly
of people from all facets

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.730
of the publishing industry,
publishing houses, booksellers,

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.810
book bloggers, authors,
librarians, et cetera,

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.580
as well as the general
public including adults,

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.600
teens, and children.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.300
I think everyone will better
relate to books when the authors

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:13.890
and characters reflect them
and or our society at large.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:18.260
This annual award ceremony
is the perfect time and place

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:20.110
to continue this conversation

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.250
and recommit ourselves
to making these changes.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.370
Although I have diverse
characters in my Dork Diary books,

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:30.760
I felt compelled to do even better.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.540
To do more.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:37.850
To say more because our
children deserve it.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:40.760
This is both a challenging
and exciting time

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:48.510
for the publishing industry, and I
am confident that we will succeed.

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:57.920
[ Applause ]

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.080
Now we can get to the fun part.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.530
I am thrilled to introduce
two talented

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:09.540
and critically acclaimed authors,
Brendan Kiely and Jason Reynolds.

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:11.510
Co-authors.

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:18.710
[ Applause ]

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.530
Co-authors of the New York
Times best-selling book,

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:25.550
"All American Boys," and winners
of the Walter D. Myer Award

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:30.300
for Outstanding Children's
Literature in 2016.

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.910
Together, Brandon and Jason have
traveled across America visiting

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:39.710
and inspiring youth
one student at a time.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:43.240
Brandon's first novel, "The Gospel
of Winter" has been published

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.910
in an impressive 10 languages
and in 2015 was selected as one

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.880
of the American Library
Associations top 10 best fiction

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.500
for young adults.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:58.260
It was also a Kirkus
Review selection for 2014.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.110
Another of his books, "The Last
True Love Story" was published

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.650
in September 2016.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.570
Brandon taught high
school English for 10 years

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:13.010
in New York before leaving his
position to write full-time.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:19.010 position:56%
He currently resides with his lovely
wife Jesse in Greenwich Village.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:24.510
Jason is also the award-winning
author of "My Name Is Jason,"

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.450
with co-author Jason Griffin.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.230
When I was the greatest,
the boy in the black suit,

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.580
as brave as you and ghost.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.940
His forthcoming book,
as if that's not enough,

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:42.710
his forthcoming books are Patina,
Long Way Down, Miles Morales,

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:48.630
a Spiderman Novel, and all
three books are scheduled

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.630
for release this fall.

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:55.770
Jason's book "Miles Morales"
will soon be a Spiderman movie

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:57.170
with Sony Pictures.

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.790
How cool is that?

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:03.130
I'm sure there will be a
star-studded Hollywood premiere

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:07.120
with paparazzi and a red carpet.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:12.260
So if you're interested in hitting
up Jason for some premiere passes,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:19.950
you can get in line behind
me because I'm going.

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.060
Jason has received many honors
including the Coretta Scott King

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.000
John Steptoe Award for new
talent, NCAAP Image Award

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.100

Jason currently makes his

and Brandon will have the honor

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:43.840
of presenting the 2017
Walter D. Myers Awards to all

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.330
of the authors here today,

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:48.510
and I believe they both
have a few words for us.

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:55.040
[ Applause ]

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.340
&gt;&gt; Brendan Kiely: All right.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.540
We'll be brief, but I just want
to -- this is a tremendous moment

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.670
and it was a tremendous
moment to be here last year

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:06.880
and incredibly grateful and
humble to be here again.

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:08.180
So thank you.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.710
And I just want to say this
because I want to say a few words

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:11.750
about what the Walter
Award means to me.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:16.320 position:56%
I stand before you deeply humble and
grateful to be part of the legacy

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.720
of the Walter D. Myers Award for
outstanding children's literature.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.470
Walter D. Myers will
forever be remembered

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.530
as a literary titan whose
ingenuity, experimentalism,

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:29.630
mastery of narrative voice and
pacing make him a cornerstone

00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:31.870
in the institution of
children's literature.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:34.270
And in addition to
his aesthetic prowess,

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.230
I believe his work will
forever be celebrated

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.450
for its profound civically
minded and communal impact.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.330
A body of work that shouted
across great distances

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:45.920
to let people know
he cared about them,

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:49.350
that they were not
alone, that they mattered.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:52.630
His work spoke to so many people
who felt unheard, dismissed,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:56.160
pushed too far to the
margins of our society.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.640
Here's the problem.

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.950
If the majority of
stories published, taught,

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.830
and read are about people who
looked like me and experienced life

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:06.610
like me, the underlying message is

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:09.560
that somehow these
stories are more important.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.960
That these lives are
somehow more important.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.680
Walter's books exposed
that lie for what it is.

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.390
He wrote an entire cannon of
stories, the manner of stories

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.770
that let so many young folks
know their lives matter,

00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:24.510
and we need diverse stories,
we need diverse books

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:29.160
because we need records of all
of these lives that matter.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.300
Black lives matter, Muslim lives
matter, refugee lives matter,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.660
immigrants lives matter, gay
lives matter, trans lives matter.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.150
All these lives have stories,
stories to raise up and affirm

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.840
that these lives matter,
stories for all of us

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.150
to learn from and celebrate.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.600
This is what the Walter
Award means to me.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.880
It's an award that shouts in the
halls of every school, library,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:54.740
and publishing house in America.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.110
Black stories matter.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:57.520
Muslim stories matter.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.020
Immigrant stories matter.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.320
Gay stories matter.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:04.860
Trans-folks stories matter because
they are all American stories.

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.080
There is no singular American boy.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.810 position:56%
There is no singular American story.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:16.360 position:56%
There are only the many stories that
gathered together bear witness to

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:20.870
and record and celebrate
the pluralism of our people.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.270
We Need Diverse Books is
the megaphone in the street,

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.250
the Walter Award, the call to
action in every library, school,

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.800
bookstore, and publishing house.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.350
Do we hear it's call
like we heard the cries

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.850
from the tents in the Hoovervilles.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:36.090 position:56%
Do we hear it as we heard the chants
and cheers of the suffragettes?

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:40.580
Do we hear it and as we remember
and recognize the songs rising

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:43.750
from the hearts marching
in Selma, Alabama

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.000
and years later in
Ferguson, Missouri?

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.890
Voices that called to us
to be our better selves.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.190
This I believe.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:52.920
I hear the Walter's call.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.510
What will be our response?

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:08.160
[ Applause ]

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.430
&gt;&gt; Jason Reynolds:
Good morning everybody.

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.360
Good to see you.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.460
It's interesting the Walter
will mean something different

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.020
to each person who ends it.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.970
It's sort of the beauty
in this award.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:26.610
Those of us who receive it will
take it from it different things.

00:19:26.610 --> 00:19:32.800
For me, I think about
who Walter was.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.730
I think about his story.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:38.860
I think about the fact
that in Walter's life

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.710
and in Walter's career, he
felt like it was James Baldwin

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:46.620
who gave him permission to
be who he was on the page.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:52.180
He felt like James Baldwin's
voice, his thoughtfulness coupled

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:59.420
with his lack of shame, his
unabashed honesty and authenticity.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.550
It was that, that sort
of bit of fire

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:05.560
on the wall made him feel
relevant, made him feel valuable

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.880
and allowed him, gave him
permission to write the stories

00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.180
that he ended up writing.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:18.070
Now fast forward 30 years
and you have a Jaclyn Woodson

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:23.640 position:56%
and you have a Rita Woods Garcia,
and years after that, I'm fortunate,

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.440
and I do mean I'm humbly,
humbly fortunate to say

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.840
that I could be a part of that
tradition because it was Walter

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.110
who made me feel like I had
permission to tell my stories.

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:39.110
To be unashamed.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:44.480
Unafraid. To be thoughtful
but to not mince words.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.010
To be proud of my language.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.410
To be proud of my culture.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:52.210
He gave me permission
to do those things.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:56.080
So the Walter awards to me is all
about tradition, the tradition

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.990
or recognition through
permission, right?

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.330
It's that -- that's the thing that
I'm always going to hold onto.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:06.220
And so, for all of us who are
receiving this award today,

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.560
it's good to see you by the way.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.540
And for my pal here who has
received this award already

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.990
and to the great WNDB for
allowing this to happen.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:17.380
I have to say that we have
to remember going forward

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.950
that our job is to
write books with eyes.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.800
Our job is to write
books that see people.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.240 position:56%
What we do is not just tell stories.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.060
Not if you're getting this award.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.680
What this award says is that it is
your obligation from here on out

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:35.550 position:56%
for every single one of your books
to be 300 pages of a permission slip

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.870
so that the next person
who reads it --

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:40.140
some other young person
feels emboldened

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.350
and empowered despite
their marginalization

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.630
of their minority status to
do the same powerful thing

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.930
that you all are doing.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.650
That is what Walter
would have wanted.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:49.950
That is what he did.

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.730
That is what we will do and
that is what I charge you all

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.510
to do going forward.

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:14.940
we're going to recognize
the three author recipients

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:19.120
of the prestigious Walter
D. Myer honor books.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.040
And finally, I'll announce
the winner

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.320
of the Walter Dean
Myers award for 2017.

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:35.350
The first recognition for honor
book goes to Marina Budhos

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:39.510
for "Watched" published
by Wendy Lamb Books.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:53.750
[ Applause ]

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:58.930
Marina is the author of such
books as "Ask me no Questions"

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:01.490
"Tell us we're home," and "Remix,

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:04.560
Conversations with
Immigrant Teenagers."

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:08.240
Marina was a Fulbright
scholar in India.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.600
She's currently an
associate professor of English

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.170
at William Paterson University.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:19.270
She lives with her husband and
two sons in Maplewood, New Jersey.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.380
Now, I'm a mom of two children.

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.020
She's a mom of two children.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:28.970
I correctly guessed that Marina
was a very busy mother and wife

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.270
from the intriguing
titles of two of her books.

00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:38.950
"Ask Me No Questions"
and "Tell Me We're Home."

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:41.510
Would you please come up, Marina?

[ Applause ]

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.580
The book "Watched" is about Naeem,

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.290
a Bangladeshi immigrant
teen living in Queens.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.180
Past mistakes catch up with him

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.520
and the police give him
an offer he cannot refuse.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:10.310
To inform on his community
or go to jail.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.960
It's such an honor to be here.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:40.430
First of all, I want to speak
personally about the namesake

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:43.780
of this award Walter D. Myers

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.810
because for me this moment has
particular personal resonance.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:52.650
Several years ago I was sitting at
lunch in the Vermont M.F.A program

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:56.120
with a number of other children
book authors, and Walter was musing

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.350
about a book he was contemplating
built around the photographs

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:04.940
of African-American pilots
fighting fascism in Ethiopia.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.750
So, for me, just the
way he was speaking,

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.500
somehow a light went off in me.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.800
This became another book
that I've just published

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:17.720
but what's more important, it
was that twinkle in his eye.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.740 position:56%
His capacity to allow his mind to
roam fused with the sense of justice

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.440
of who he was writing about.

00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.790
In that instance, it was as if the
Walter flame had ignited in me.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.690
I caught a bit of his musing.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.520
So for me to stand here in the
Library of Congress at a moment

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.570
when I believe we are living

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:41.420
under an administration
that is anti-knowledge.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.570
It aims to snuff out
that twinkle in our eyes.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:51.080
That hunger to tell stories that
have not been seen or heard.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:56.230
We live in a moment of blockade,
of restriction, of walling off.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:26:00.100
Banning, suppressing the
glorious and intemperate river

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.590
that is human experience.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.420
A book is the opposite.

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.530
A novel is the opposite.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.170
There are no walls.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:09.530
Not in our readers.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:10.970
Not as authors.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.630
There's only the ceaseless
exploration

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.210
of the human experience
in all its diversity.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.230
So I came to write "Watched."

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:23.250
A young Muslim boy's morale
odyssey as he navigates the shoals

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:29.500
of a world saturated and watching,
surveillance, profiling, suspicion.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.980
His very identity is
trapped, walled in, confined.

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:37.050
He's a Bangladeshi
teenager like any teenager.

00:26:37.050 --> 00:26:42.750
Mixed up, a screw up, a boy with
a serious case of senioritis.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:48.200
And yet for him as a young Muslim,
the cost of any misstep is higher.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.430
Somehow, he must find his manhood.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:54.100
He must find his sense of
agency and morale truth.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:58.670
That's my task as a novelist
to discover boys like Naeem

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.410
as Walter taught us to follow
our instincts as artists.

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:05.470
To never allow our
imaginations to be walled off

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.420
and to restore the
dignity, the compassion,

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:13.420
the three dimensionality
of a boy such as Naeem.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:16.700
Now I'd also like to mention
another interesting resonance.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.800
For me, it's really an honor

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:22.690
to accept this award next
to Representative Lewis.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.290
He was a childhood hero of mine.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:30.530
I grew up in a very unusual
community in Queens in the 1960s

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:35.950
and 70s, and my childhood bedroom
looked out right across the windows

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:40.210
of Roy Wilkin's with whom
John Lewis battled with

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:42.120
and what marched alongside.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.820
That was my childhood.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.670
And so, for me, that's
who's shaped what I was.

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:50.800 position:56%
This journey that our country was
becoming, and it's what I care about

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.210
and think about in
making these stories.

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.590
I'd like to share one other thing.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:59.400
I was just overseas speaking
to young people in Singapore,

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.480
and they had so many
questions for me.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.240
I was talking to them about
what it's like to come

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:06.270
of age in post-911 America.

00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:08.850
They said, "Can I come to America?

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:12.480
I've always dreamed of studying in
America," an Indian girl told me,

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.700
"But now after three
shootings, I'm afraid."

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.740
Another boy asked me, "I was born
in America and plan to go back,

00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.880
but what will I experience
as a student of color?"

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.460
This hit me very hard.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:30.800
Nearly 60 years ago, my father
came as an immigrant from Guyana.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:34.280
He'd won a scholarship,
interestingly enough,

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.890
to Howard University
a few miles away.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:41.860
His was an education into many
things including Jim Crowe America.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:46.530
At the time, because of immigration
laws, he could not become a citizen

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.370 position:56%
but for marrying my American mother.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:54.170
That means I would not be standing
here in these halls at this moment

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:55.520
in the Library of Congress.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.700
And if it were not for a
black university that reached

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.190
out to a young Indian
man across the world.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:05.130
So what I want to say
to those young people is

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:09.620
that we are fighting
for this in our books.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:12.570
That we are made of the world.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:13.870
Not walls.

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:18.270
So I want to thank We Need
Diverse Books for existing,

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:22.500
for creating an award such as this,
but most of all for recognizing

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.070
that diversity is actually the very
essence of the human experience.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:32.750 position:56%
That when we deny diversity, flatten
it, ban it, refuse to see it,

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:37.370
refuse to get inside the covers
of a book and explore and learn,

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:41.200
we deny who we are as human beings.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:45.420
I want to also thank Wendy
Lamb, my brilliant editor.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.540
My friend Susan Bartel who told
me to keep writing this book.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.150
My two sons, Sasha and Ralphy,
whose rambunctious, quarrelsome,

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:58.410 position:56%
joyous existence is somewhere on
the pages of this book, and finally,

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:04.050
I must give all and full credit to
the love of my life, Mark Aaronson.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:08.190
My husband, my co-conspirator
in all things books.

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.850
Many years ago when I was
working at a job I hated,

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:16.120 position:56%
I sent him a short story which he
promptly read and then called me up.

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.470
You can write young
adult he told me.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:21.510
I guess I can, so I
thank you all again.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:44.430
[ Applause ]

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.820
&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russell: Thank you
for those wonderful words, Marina.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:56.290
Now, the second Walter D. Myers
honorable recognition goes

00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:07.510
to Meredith Russo for
"If I Was Your Girl."

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:17.040
[ Applause ]

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.190
Published by Flat Iron Books.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:25.860
Meredith is a resident of Tennessee
and started living as her true self

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.650
in late 2013 and never looked back.

00:31:30.650 --> 00:31:34.450
Her book, "If I Was Your
Girl" was partially inspired

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:38.360 position:56%
by her experiences as a trans-woman.

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:47.250
The book is about Amanda, a
trans-gendered teen who moves

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:52.220
to a new school and live every
other student, all she wants is

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.430
to make friends and fit in.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:32:04.510
She finally finds first love
but is keeping a secret.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:19.750
[ Applause ]

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:21.060
&gt;&gt; Meredith Russo: Hi.

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:27.270
First of all, I'm overawed by
the legacy of Walter D. Myers,

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.930
and I don't think I have words

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:34.600
to really accurately convey
how honored I am to be here.

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.000
I'll get the thanks out of the way.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.220
First, I'd like to thank Sara
Barley and everybody at Flat Iron.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:43.500
I'd like to thank Joe
[inaudible], [inaudible].

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:48.660
I'd like to thank my son
Darwin for being willing

00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:56.010
to take some pretty good naps as
I was getting the manuscript done.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:33:02.730
And I also wanted to say as a
southerner who cares about issues

00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:06.410
of racial justice and civil rights,

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.080
enough that I often don't get
invited to Thanksgiving just

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:15.070 position:56%
because it's a little tedious, I
just want to say that there's nobody

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:19.440
that I would rather lost to than
to Representative John Lewis.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.510
It's truly an honor.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:25.040
[ Applause ]

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.240 position:56%
You're a hero of mine and just being
in the same room as you means more

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.250
to me than I think
you can understand.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.710
So I've prepared some comments.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.680
I will try to keep
it a little short.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:41.510
So today's an odd day for me.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.690
I turn 30 in a week which is a
birthday I never believed I would

00:33:45.690 --> 00:33:46.990
live to see.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:51.990
When I came into D.C. I landed in
an airport named after a president

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.640 position:56%
who responded to the deaths of
thousands of my brothers and sisters

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.990 position:56%
in the 80s with mostly
indifference and occasional mockery.

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.860
It's trans day of visibility today.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:13.400
Hi. And standing here in
a world where not just me

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:16.400
but trans people all over
this country are stepping

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.160
out of the shadows and taking
places in this republic

00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.260
that have been traditionally
denied to us,

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.190
I can't help wondering what the
men who built this city might think

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:29.540
if they were aware that this moment
was coming, if they could see us.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:32.830
Thomas Jefferson the man whose
books constituted the first attempt

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:36.790
to rebuild this library after the
World of 1812, believed that people

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:38.780
like me deserved to be mutilated.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.250
This isn't even an
indictment of the man.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.930
He owned human beings, and I
won't ever let anyone forget it,

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:46.750
but on the issue of sodomites
he was miles more progressive

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:48.240
than his peers.

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.410
The rest of the men who built
this city probably would have just

00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:53.980
shrugged and had me put to death.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:57.510 position:56%
This is to say well I might not have
known all the historical details,

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:02.260
I grew up with a keen understanding
that America was not for me.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.740
That the American dream
was a lie cooked

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:08.810
up to keep normal people asleep
and people like me hungry.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:12.130
Sure the time had passed when
I could easily legally killed

00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:15.700
for putting on a dress, but the
legal niceties and the realities

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.830
which trickle down to my frightened
young mind were vastly different.

00:35:19.830 --> 00:35:23.510
Television, books, movies,
religion, most adults,

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:24.820
they all told me the same thing.

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:28.300
Over and over sometimes without
knowing they were saying it.

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.590
The American dream is not for you.

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:32.650
The republic is not for you.

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.400
Life among us is not for you.

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:38.290
Even if you find people who love
you, your love will drag them

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.030
down until you are killed

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:43.580
and you will be killed,
and we will be happy.

00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.930
And yet, here I am in this city
built by men who have hated me --

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:51.500
who would have hated most of us.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.390
Being honored for a career I
never believed I could have.

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.150
I don't think I have the
words to articulate this.

00:35:58.150 --> 00:36:01.570
I don't think I even
properly understand it myself.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:05.870
I wonder what those men would think
if they saw us now here together.

00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.460
Shall we be kind and
assume their opinions

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.770
on [inaudible] issues
of political expedience.

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.290
That they might even
be relieved to find

00:36:13.290 --> 00:36:17.750
that we have circumnavigated one or
two of the flaws in their legacy,

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.060
but probably not and who cares.

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:24.190
The secret of the American dream
is that America itself is a dream.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.720
That America is as much the
faint hope of the slaved,

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.530
the desperate yearning of
secret lovers, the quiet courage

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:33.240
of a girl pretending to
be a boy her entire life.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.980 position:56%
The righteous fury of immigrants
standing together as it is anything.

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.540
That there is more of America
in these flashes of light

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:44.230
than there ever was or ever will
be in the atrophy and hearts

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:46.670
of those who seek to harm us.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:50.670
It is our job as authors and
librarians to kindle that light

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.540
in as many minds as we
can, and I stand in awe

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.670
of this room's dedication
to the task.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:00.850 position:56%
You have all worked so hard, and
I'm so infinitely honored to be here

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:03.300
with you, to be included
in the legacy of a man

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:05.460
as great as Walter D. Myers.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:10.510
We've already worked so hard
but our work has only begun.

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:44.510

&gt;&gt; Rachel Renee Russo: Now the
third Walter D. Myers honor book

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:07.490
recognition goes to Nicola Yoon

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:13.510
for "The Sun is Also a Star"
published by Delacourte Press.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:22.940
[ Applause ]

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.830
Nicole is a number one New
York Times best selling author.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:31.850
Her book, "The Sun is Also a
Star" was a 2016 National Book

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.580
Award finalist.

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:36.770
The book's movie rights
were recently auctioned

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.940
by Warner Brothers Pictures.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.300
Her first book, "Everything,

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.620
Everything" was also a number
one New York Times best seller.

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:48.130
It will be released as a movie

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.390
by Warner Brothers
Pictures on May 19th.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:54.150
Just a few weeks away.

00:38:55.510 --> 00:39:00.230
[ Applause ]

00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:03.830
Now some authors have
accomplished a little.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.790
Some authors have accomplished
a lot.

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:13.670
And then there's Nicola Yoon
who has accomplished everything.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.980
Everything.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.650
Just like the title
of her first book.

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:21.740
Two number one New York Time's
best sellers, literary acclaim

00:39:21.740 --> 00:39:27.240
and two movie deals all in 20
months, she must be exhausted.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:34.450
In the book, "The Sun
is Also a Star" Natasha

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.120
and her family are
undocumented immigrants

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:40.130
from Jamaica facing deportation.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:42.770
During her last 12
months in New York City,

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.760
she meets Daniel whose Korean
American parents expect him

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.490
to attend an Ivy league
school and become a doctor.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:54.660
Her book is a thought-provoking
story of possibilities, fate,

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.060
and the illogical beauty of love.

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:02.700
Now Nicola could not be here
with us today so accepting

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:07.510
on her behalf is Barbara Marcus.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:14.320

Now we have a videotape from Nicola.

00:40:17.170 --> 00:40:18.830
So we're going to hear
from Nicola first

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:21.950
and then we will hear from Barbara.

00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:24.640
&gt;&gt; Nicole Hume: Thank you
so, so much for naming

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.260
"The Sun is Also a Star"
a well to honor book.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:30.650
It is one of the greatest honors
and highlights of my careers

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.900
so thank you so much for that.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.830
I'm going to read a little speech
because I cannot memorize things

00:40:36.830 --> 00:40:40.630 position:56%
so forgive me for not looking
directly at the camera at all times.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:44.100
I just want to thank a few people.

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.060
Wendy [inaudible],
my wonderful editor.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.990
Barbara Marcus, Beverly Horowitz,
John [inaudible], Felicia Frasier,

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:52.080
Dominic Simina, Jillian Vandal,

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.930
and everyone at Random
House Children's Books.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:58.000
Thank you for believing
in me and my career.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.920 position:56%
Joe Hobeka, [inaudible], Josh Banks.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:03.510
You guys are the very,
very best in the business.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.510
Thank you so much for
taking a chance on me

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:07.540
and for taking chances with me.

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:12.460
"The Sun is Also a Star" is about
two immigrant kids falling in love.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.340
The book is inspired by my own
love story with my husband.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.180
I'm an immigrant and I'm
originally from Jamaica.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:22.600
My husband is Korean American, born
in Dallas to immigrant parents.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.020
One of the questions we get a
lot is, "How did you two meet?"

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.660 position:56%
It's asked with the kind of
earnestness that we're both used to.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.650
People ask because I think
our backgrounds make us seem

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:37.650
so unlikely, but the truth is
I have more in common with him

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.210
than I've ever had with
anyone in my entire life.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:41.610
We're not unlikely at all.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:44.460
One of the themes I
wanted to explore

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:47.850
with this book is all the
invisible threads that bind us.

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:51.880 position:56%
We are, all of us, shaped by our
own histories, but we're also shaped

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.970
by the histories of our families
and friends, or even shaped

00:41:54.970 --> 00:41:56.910
by the histories of strangers.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.210
We are not [inaudible].

00:41:58.210 --> 00:41:59.720
We are not so different.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.810
Like many people in this room,
I watched the election results

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:07.820
with hope and then
dread and then despair.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.530
The racism, misogyny,
and the xenophobia

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.750
that this entire election season
brought to the forum is appalling.

00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:17.180
It's a kind of violence.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.230
What is this world we ask?

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.170
This is the world we made.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:23.370
How could this happen we ask?

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.780
It happens the way these
things always happen.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:29.850
We forget as Maya Angelou
said in human family.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:32.470
We are more alike my
friends than we are unalike.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:36.000
As you guys know and the world
of children's literature,

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.340
there has been a lot of discussion
about the need for diverse books.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.820
Sometimes discussion is productive.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.480
Sometimes it's been painful.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:46.750
I'm going to be honest
with you and say

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:48.870
that I'm often weary of discussion.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:52.420
I tire of saying the
completely obvious.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.470
Everyone deserves to see
themselves as a hero of a story.

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:59.240
When you don't see yourself
represented in the media,

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.380
you feel erased as
if you don't matter.

00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:05.120
When the majority doesn't see
marginalized communities in media,

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.300
then it's easier for them to erase
us or to forget our humanity.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.470
We need diverse books
because they breed empathy.

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:17.640
It's hard to hate what
you can understand.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.830
What can we in this
room do to combat hatred

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:23.920
and misogyny, racism, xenophobia?

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:28.190
Write. Write books starring
black girls and boys, brown girls

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:30.830
and boys, Asian girls and
boys, gay and lesbian,

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.550 position:56%
transgender, and [inaudible] people.

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.600
When you write these
books, be respectful.

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:38.450
Do not write stereotypes.

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:39.750
Do not harm.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.540
Our job as writers
is to tell the truth.

00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:45.450
The truth is we live in a big
beautiful and diverse world.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:49.760
The truth is the world is
beautiful because of its diversity.

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.280
We will not survive if we
do not understand this.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:56.160
We will not survive if we do not
see each other and love each other.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.860
What do we do now we ask?

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.920
To everyone, but especially
to all the beautiful writers

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.010
in this room, I say write.

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:08.020
Write like all our lives
depend on it because they do.

00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.510
Thank you, guys.

really nothing more to say

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:27.940
than when Nicki speaks she
is always just so on topic,

00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:29.380
target, all those things.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:33.650
So all I want to say is I feel
very lucky to be here today.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:36.590
And I know that Nicki would have
loved to have been here today

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:40.830
as well but is in the UK
working and promoting her book.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:47.020
I feel so proud to be in this room
with Ellen and all the publishers

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:50.890
and amazing writers who believe in

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:54.740
and support We Need Diverse
Books and the Walter awards.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.300
I also feel so proud
to be the publisher,

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:02.560 position:56%
to have been the publisher of Walter
Dean Myers "Flying Lessons" edited

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:10.790 position:56%
by Ellen Oh, Marina Budhos and Nicki
Yoon and to accept this Walter Award

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:14.830

Now I am truly honored

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:55.920
to present the Walter
Dean Myers Award for 2017

00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:03.790
to Congressman John Lewis,
Andrew Aydin, and Nate Powell

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:10.510
for "March Book Three" published
by Top Shelf Productions.

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:30.700
[ Applause ]

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:35.690
Before Congressman John Lewis
became a respected congressman,

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:43.450
he was clubbed, gassed, arrested
over 40 times and nearly killed

00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:50.580
by angry mobs and state police
all while non-violently protesting

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:53.170
racial discrimination.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:58.550
He marched with Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. as the youngest leader

00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:00.570
of the Civil Rights Movement.

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:06.710
A movement that would change our
nation and our world forever.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:10.480
Today Congressman Lewis is the
United States Representative

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:15.750
for Georgia's fifth congressional
district serving since 1987.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:20.760
He is also dean of the Georgia
Congressional Delegation.

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:28.460
Andrew Aydin, an Atlanta native
serves as digital director

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.860
and policy advisor to
Congressman Lewis in Washington,

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:37.310
D.C. Andrew took a job with
the congressman after college

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.280 position:56%
and soon learned a fascinating fact.

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.580
Listen to this.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.170
It had blew my mind.

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:49.220
As a young man, Congressman
Lewis was inspired

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:56.770 position:56%
by reading a classic 1958 comic book
about Dr. Martin Luther King called

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:59.820
"Martin Luther King and
the Montgomery Story."

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.500
So even back then books
were inspiring young minds

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:06.980
and driving them forward, and I
just thought that was wonderful

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:09.850
that he read a book
about Martin Luther King

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:11.620
and then became who he is today.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:17.860
Andrew and the congressman
discussed the positive impact

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.180
that comic books could
have on young readers.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:24.310
Then they decided to write
a graphic novel together

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:28.210
about the congressman's experiences
during the Civil Rights era.

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:33.680
Nate Powell has been called the
most prodigiously talented graphic

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:38.330
novelist of his generation
by Book Lists Magazine.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:42.710
In addition to the March series,
his work includes illustrating many

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:46.010
of Rick Riordan's books
for young people.

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:49.840
His work has received many
honors including the Eisner Award

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.740
for best graphic novel.

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:58.180
The book "March Book Three" is the
final volume in the March trilogy.

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:02.750
It is the recipient
of multiple awards

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:07.950
and honors including the
2016 National Book Award.

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:10.770
The series tells the true story

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:15.800
of how a sharecropper's son
helped transform America

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.940
from his segregated schoolhouse
to the 1963 march on Washington

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:26.500
to the United States
Congress and beyond.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:39.230
It is with humble,
awesomeness that I present

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:51.150
to you Congressman John Lewis,
Andrew Aydin, and the illustrator.

00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:53.640
Nate Powell.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:59.510

To be here with Andrew
and Nate, these two guys,

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:06.510
these two young brothers
of mine did the hard work.

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:12.410
They [inaudible] to tell a
story, more than my story

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:15.890
but the story of a Muslim.

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:22.390
It is true that I was born
and grew up in rural Alabama.

00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:28.380
Son of sharecroppers, picking
cotton, gathering peanuts,

00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:32.410
[inaudible], preaching to chickens.

00:51:32.410 --> 00:51:34.660
Sometimes I would be out
and working out in the field

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:37.270
and my mother would have said,
"Boy, you're falling behind.

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:38.570
You need to catch up."

00:51:38.570 --> 00:51:42.830
I always said, "This is hard work."

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:44.830
She said, "Hard work
never killed anybody."

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:47.640
I said, "Well, it's
about to kill me."

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:56.120
But in 1955, 15-years-old
and in 10th grade,

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.870
[inaudible] I heard Rosa Parks.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:04.020
I heard the words of Martin
Luther King Jr. on the radio,

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.160
and I felt like Dr. King
was speaking directly to me.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.710
He said, "Boy, you
too can do something."

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:20.660
And when I met him in 1958, he
called me the boy from Troy.

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:23.620
I grew up outside of Troy, Alabama.

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:25.220
Attended school in Nashville,

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:30.560
and it was in Nashville
that I really grew up.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:40.010
Sitting down at lunch counters
and beaten, tear gassed,

00:52:40.010 --> 00:52:46.660
going on marches, coming here for
the march on Washington in 1963,

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.310
leading a march across that
bridge in Selma, Alabama,

00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:53.850
in 1965 for the right to vote.

00:52:53.850 --> 00:53:02.220
Both Andrew and Nate have
captured the essence of my life

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.200
so I want to thank the two of you.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.800
I'm sorry to get here so late.

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:10.190
I just took a train from New
York, and I have to get up very,

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:14.980
very early to make it,
but I'm happy to see you.

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:18.010
So thank you so much.

00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:19.810
Andrew.

&gt;&gt; Andrew Aydin: As I see Jason
Brandon and then I look at the three

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.030 position:56%
of us, I can't help but wonder if
once you start doing books together,

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.360
you also start dressing alike.

00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:49.980
[ Laughter ]

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:56.600
It's just an observation.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:59.780
I was raised by a single mother and
my father was a Muslim immigrant

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:02.100
who had left when I was very young.

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:05.880
And I started reading comics
after he left because I wanted

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.660
to read stories about heroes.

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:17.080
Looking back on it, those stories
tended to be white men in spandex.

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.320
I was raised in the
congressman's district.

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.260
He's been my congressman
since I was three-years-old,

00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:28.010
and as I got to be a
teenager and grew up,

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:31.910
I became very politically conscious
because you sort of can't help

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:34.640
but understand the
injustices in our society

00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.920
when you see how they
treat a single mother.

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.470
When your mother doesn't
want you to grow a beard

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:43.060
or seem anything like
a Muslim person.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:44.360
Even though I'm not.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.870
I mean I went to Trinity
College in Georgetown

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:52.510
and every Christian institution it
seems like they could put me in.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:59.790
[ Laughter ]

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:05.820
But when I joined the congressman's
staff and I joined it to help him

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:14.040
with his mail because he gets
a lot of mail, I found a hero

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:20.410
that I wished I'd known as a young
person who wasn't in my books,

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.850
who wasn't in my social
studies class.

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:24.150
They didn't teach me
about [inaudible].

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:25.870
They didn't teach about
the [inaudible].

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:33.960
So to have the opportunity
to grow up and work for him

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.840
and tell his story and to do
it in a medium that I loved

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:45.840
with all my heart as a child is
the greatest honor I could ask for.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:49.380
So I'm grateful to all of you in
this room for providing a platform

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:54.160
for stories like this because
one thing I've known --

00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.440
or come to know over the last
eight years is that there are a lot

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.370
of people and a lot of institutions

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:01.810
that don't want to
see these stories.

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:03.110
It's not the money
they want to make.

00:56:03.110 --> 00:56:05.070
It's not the stories
they want to tell.

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:07.940
But we can win.

00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:13.160
We can make these stories
told through efforts,

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.820
through working together,
through dressing alike.

00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:22.140
These are teams.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:28.410
We are teams, and we're fighting
for a world at peace with itself.

00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:31.320
So thank you for this honor.

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:32.700
Thank you for honoring "March."

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:37.130
Thank you, John Lewis for
letting us tell your story.

00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:40.050
Thank you, Nate.

00:56:40.050 --> 00:56:44.980
Your abilities just boggle my mind.

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.780
Thank you all.

00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:59.890
[ Applause ]

00:56:59.890 --> 00:57:01.190
&gt;&gt; Nate Powell: Hey everybody.

00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:03.840
Thanks for being here
and for having us here.

00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:10.970
Also, I would like to take to
respectfully object that we

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:13.140
in fact have done the
easier share of the work

00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:17.140
in bringing the story
of the struggle to life.

00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:20.060
And in fact, there is one
person here on this stage

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:22.840
who has done the heavy
lifting and who continues

00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:25.410
to do the heavy lifting and
that is you congressman,

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:28.970
but thank you from all of us.

00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:30.500
You all, I'd just like
to speak briefly

00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.610
as a parent and as a cartoonist.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:35.410
So I'm from Arkansas.

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:38.910
I live in Indiana, and
I have two daughters.

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:41.060
One is two, one is five.

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:43.220
The two-year-old is getting there,

00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:50.170
but to speak of the five-year-old,
she's a ravenous reader.

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:51.850
I mean who would have guessed?

00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:54.720
Surrounded by books, surrounded by
nerds in the house all the time.

00:57:54.720 --> 00:58:03.730
But in our daily reading sessions,

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:06.680
increasingly over these last
five years and increasingly

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:10.790
as she has grown up around the
drawing table and around "March"

00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:14.810
in progress and it's reference
to research and documentation,

00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:22.370
I'm brought back again and again
to the books that my brother and I,

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:25.300
well really the media
surrounding my brother and I,

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:29.450
including kids TV programs and
everything from the late 60s

00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:33.650
into the early 80s, and only

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:39.310 position:56%
as a parent have I really become
increasingly aware of the subtleties

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:43.030
of what stock photos are chosen for
what elementary school textbooks

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:46.650
and what they show of life in
different parts of America.

00:58:46.650 --> 00:58:52.670
Only by moving to the north
and moving to the Midwest

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:59.610
and raising Hoosier kids have I
as a southerner really been able

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:06.580
to confront and process a lot of
the beauty and the specialness

00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:10.620
about the American south amidst
the darkness and the ugliness

00:59:10.620 --> 00:59:16.120
and been able to recognize
so many more dimensions

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:22.320
of American inequality and American
injustice by living in Indiana

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.490
and raising my Hoosier kids with
rapidly expanding world views.

00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:31.530
And on that note, I have been -- I
am consistently amazed as a parent

00:59:31.530 --> 00:59:37.070
at how fast a young
kid's worldview expands

00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:39.670
and how readily they
absorb everything.

00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:46.650
And the kinds of inquisitive
questions and the subtleties

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:48.890
of my five-year-old's
questions about the world

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:54.990 position:56%
around her had made me realize that
I'm consistently lagging behind her.

00:59:54.990 --> 01:00:04.250 position:56%
And so, young people having access
not just to stories and to documents

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:07.550
which reflect their life
and which offer windows

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:15.250
into a much broader world, but
is it too much to ask for media

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:20.660
and for literature that
is simply representative

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.960
of the world around us?

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.310 position:56%
And I feel like it actually takes a
lot more effort to work against that

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:29.310
than it does to simply embrace it.

01:00:29.310 --> 01:00:32.510
It shouldn't be that hard.

01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:36.210
[ Applause ]

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:43.650 position:56%
However, I'm very encouraged by my
exposure to little kids books moving

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.090
into young people's literature.

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:48.420
As a parent, I think this may
actually give me more hope

01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:51.050
than anything else in this time.

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:55.920
In recognizing that I am the
one who is struggling to keep up

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:00.500
and to catch up with where my
kids are going to be in the world.

01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:02.430
I look forward to the time my wife

01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:06.150
and I had discussed this
semi-regularly, for these clues

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:09.000
that at a certain point,
these super cool,

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.880
progressive parents are
going to be out of touch.

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.370
We're going to be dinosaurs to
some degree, and we're excited

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:19.100
by that prospect, by that
challenge of recognizing

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.740
where we're lagging behind
and where we have come

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.900
and where we will go as a society.

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:28.190
Also to just speak very
briefly as a cartoonist,

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:33.510
thank you for your embrace of
a comic, and I want to stress -

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:42.980
[ Applause ]

01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:49.790
Graphic novels have come a long
way in terms of public embrace

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:52.910
and perceived legitimacy over
these last couple of decades.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:54.530
I want to stress, it's all comics.

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:57.000
It's okay to say comics.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.830 position:56%
They're comics and comics have
changed my life time and time again.

01:02:02.830 --> 01:02:05.890
Ever since I was three-years-old,
I feel like in a lot

01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:09.130
of ways my social consciousness
itself was awakened

01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:14.050
by crystal clear running on writing
the X-Men throughout the 70s,

01:02:14.050 --> 01:02:16.970
80s, into the early 90s.

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:24.640
Speaking of mirrors and windows
by which to view inequality

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.470
and view struggle within
the world we reside,

01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:29.540
I thank the X-Men for that.

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:36.460
And also, in terms of comics unique
strengths, in terms of balancing

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:41.020 position:56%
and communicating equally with words
and pictures, if we're speaking

01:02:41.020 --> 01:02:44.040
about representation and
we're speaking about accuracy,

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:48.370
I don't feel like I
always succeeded in the way

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:50.110
that I would have liked to.

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:55.900
That's why we continue making
work, but thank you for the role

01:02:55.900 --> 01:03:00.550
that a comic may have played in
literally representing people

01:03:00.550 --> 01:03:07.150
at a crucial moment in American
history in a way that has gotten

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:11.210
into the hands of many kids who
otherwise would never have sought

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:13.620
out or had an opportunity
to have exposure

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:19.480
to this literal representation in
a visual form, in a tangible form,

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:22.290
and I think there's
great strength to open.

01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:23.590
Thanks a lot you all.

01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:25.390
I appreciate it.

to host this award ceremony today

So I apologize to Nate Powell
for losing it up here in public,

good excuse though.

with him all the time.

here for being our special guest.

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.440
And in closing, just remember
that We Need Diverse Books

01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:58.020
and that this project has
grown from a simple hashtag

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:00.750
to a powerful movement that
is increasing the number

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:03.720
of diverse books and
diverse authors not only

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:06.250
in our nation but the world.

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.810
So I'm all done.

01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:11.110
Thank you.

01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:17.590
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
