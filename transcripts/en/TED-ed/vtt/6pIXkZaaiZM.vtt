00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.603
[What's one interview question
you ask every prospective employee?]

00:00:05.261 --> 00:00:08.190
I guess, actually, one question
that always comes up is,

00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:11.255
"What, specifically, did you do?"

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.538
In other words, people
will come to you and say,

00:00:13.562 --> 00:00:16.611
"Oh, I did this project.
I did this, that and the other thing."

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:21.156
And you're like, "OK, that's nice,
but what, specifically, did you do?"

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.422
Because a lot of things are team efforts

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:25.271
and it can be very vague.

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:26.670
You know, I asked somebody,

00:00:26.694 --> 00:00:31.533
"What did you do
in this 3D world analysis?"

00:00:31.557 --> 00:00:33.394
Because there were many parts of it.

00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:34.937
And then I would ask, you know,

00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:37.473
"What, specifically, did you do?"

00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:40.009
And the answer to that
just greatly clarifies

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.498
what their skill set is.

00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:46.093
It could have been any number of things
in the system that she had done,

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:48.117
and then when I know exactly what she did,

00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:52.654
then I have a better insight into that.

00:00:52.678 --> 00:00:54.211
Also, from the interview

00:00:54.235 --> 00:00:56.562
and the way they answer the question,

00:00:56.586 --> 00:00:58.932
you maybe not specifically ask,

00:00:58.956 --> 00:01:00.878
but you listen for a passion

00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:03.203
and an interest in what they do.

00:01:03.227 --> 00:01:05.698
If they're just answering
in one-word answers,

00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:08.331
and they seem bored by your questions

00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:09.509
or defensive,

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:11.126
that's not a good sign.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.111
But if they say, "Oh, well,
I use Microsoft Visual Studio

00:01:14.135 --> 00:01:16.779
and I'm using C#
and I really enjoy this language,

00:01:16.803 --> 00:01:19.664
because it's this, that
and the other thing, and it's better,

00:01:19.688 --> 00:01:21.553
I used to use Java, but now I use this.

00:01:21.577 --> 00:01:24.212
I love Visual Studio
because it allows me to integrate."

00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:26.880
And they go on and tell me,
or seem passionate about it.

00:01:26.904 --> 00:01:29.431
And the answer doesn't have to be,
"I love Microsoft."

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.796
It could be, "Well, I use
Eclipse, I love Eclipse,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.547
and I love Java, I love Open Source.

00:01:33.571 --> 00:01:35.118
I love Open Source because this,

00:01:35.142 --> 00:01:39.740
and I'm very passionate and I always use
Ubuntu and I love Linux so much!"

00:01:39.764 --> 00:01:41.732
If you hear that,

00:01:41.756 --> 00:01:44.914
if you hear how engaged
they are in what they do,

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.772
and that they love what they do,

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:49.510
if they come with a vital energy --

00:01:49.534 --> 00:01:51.946
that's very attractive in an employee,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.485
because that shows someone
who's going to engage and learn

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.447
and, you know, just add a lot
of energy to your team,

00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:02.362
and that's what, I think,
a lot of employers are looking for.
