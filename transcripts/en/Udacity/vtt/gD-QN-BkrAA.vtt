00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Question 2 tests that you understand procedures as well as the if construct.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The question is "Which of the following have exactly the same behavior as the procedure below?"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
For two procedures to have exactly the same behavior, that means

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that no matter what the inputs are, the caller couldn't tell

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the difference between the two procedures, so it produces the same output.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
They both have the same side effects.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In this case, we've defined a procedure here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It uses the procedure "test"--we haven't shown you how test is defined.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You should assume that test is a procedure that takes a number

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as its input and outputs a Boolean.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But you shouldn't assume anything else about test.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Your goal is no matter what the procedure test does to figure out

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
if the choice has exactly the same behavior as the procedure showing here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Here are the choices--check all the choices that have

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that have the same behavior as the procedure defined here.
