00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:07.975
Should YOU trust ME?

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:11.705
If you're intelligent enough, you can probably
figure it out.

00:00:11.705 --> 00:00:13.315
[[MUSIC PLAYING]]

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:18.945
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:18.945 --> 00:00:21.665
Here's something you might not think about
everyday: TRUST.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:23.545
Trust is a vital part of life and relationships.

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:28.245
I mean, if you're unwilling to trust anyone
or anything, it would be a cynical, sad life

00:00:28.245 --> 00:00:29.245
indeed.

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:32.435
A few years ago, the Pew Research Center found
that, worldwide, societies that trust each

00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:34.595
other have lower rates of crime and corruption.

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:39.954
They found the most trusting countries are
Canada (of course), Sweden (also not surprised),

00:00:39.954 --> 00:00:41.855
Britain, and the USA.

00:00:41.855 --> 00:00:45.755
Relevant (!) because trust ultimately...makes
the wheels of society turn.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:50.754
Social institutions like financial markets,
public health departments, and welfare programs

00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:52.095
require trust to operate.

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:55.344
The ability to trust others has also been
linked with higher rates of happiness and

00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:57.795
health by UC Berkeley's Greater Good Science
Center.

00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:02.774
Recently, Oxford published another study about
trust in PLOS 1, and what they found was verrrrrry

00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:03.794
interesting.

00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:07.135
They found that people who score higher on
measures of intelligence are more likely to

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:11.385
trust others, while those who score lower
on intelligence measures are more suspicious

00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:12.385
of people.

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:16.605
This is after controlling for things like
income, marital status, and level of education.

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:19.344
What does intelligence have to do with something
like trust?

00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:20.925
They have a couple theories.

00:01:20.925 --> 00:01:23.905
One is that the smarties are better able to
tell someone's character.

00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:26.995
Are they the right kind of person to let their
guard down with?

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:28.855
Or are they a shady brady?

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:31.785
A better read of someone's character may help
intelligent people to avoid those who are

00:01:31.785 --> 00:01:33.455
more likely to betray.

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:36.224
Another theory is that intelligent people
are better at looking at the full context

00:01:36.224 --> 00:01:40.705
of a situation -- so they can better evaluate
if another person has an INCENTIVE to betray

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:41.705
their trust.

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.965
The finding is important not just because
trust is a key player in the ever elusive

00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:48.984
goal of peace -- but it also lends a hand
to another evolutionary theory.

00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:53.405
The theory being that a good judge of character
is an important part of human evolution passed

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:55.315
on through natural selection.

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:58.645
In other words, reading someone's trustworthiness
has a survival advantage.

00:01:58.645 --> 00:02:01.795
Of course, that would need some further testing.

00:02:01.795 --> 00:02:04.255
Question for you folks: do you tend to trust
people?

00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:05.255
Or do you find it challenging?

00:02:05.255 --> 00:02:08.355
I mean hey, maybe you've had some experiences
that taught you otherwise.

00:02:08.355 --> 00:02:09.624
Thanks for joining me for DNews!

00:02:09.624 --> 00:02:11.545
I'll see you again soon with more science
updates.
