00:00:15.194 --> 00:00:16.110
KYLE KEANE: All right.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.609
Cool.

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.050
So projects, presentations
are going to happen.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.710
And we're going to start
with the video games,

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.270
and then we're going to take
a cool break in the middle

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.960
to play with a collaborative,
crowdsourced, cloud-based robot

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.380
that's going to try to follow
all of our collective input

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.590
in order to grab
a piece of paper,

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.130
that Abhinav, the TA
for the Arduino class,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.650
has been building
in his free time.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.410
That's a good embarrassed face.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.390
So that's a way to
model embarrassment.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.973
I appreciate that, because we're
all going to feel embarrassed

00:00:53.973 --> 00:00:55.440
when we present, and that's OK.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.530
I feel embarrassed right now
trying to get your attention

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.180
and pull you away
from your projects,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.040
because I know that that's what
you want to be doing right now.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.019
So that's OK.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.750
We're all going to
feel embarrassed.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.180
But we're going to
share, and not in order

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.990
to impress everyone with
how amazing our project was,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.960
but to open up a dialogue
about what we learned

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.830
and what other people
can learn from us.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.030
So the point of coming up
and sharing your presentation

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.250
is not to get accolades
from your friends

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.470
about how amazingly
brilliant you are.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.140
It's to share something, so
that if someone's interest gets

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.100
piqued, they can go, oh, cool!

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.800
How did you do that thing?

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.482
And then you have a
chance to teach them

00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:35.190
about that really
specific thing that you

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.430
did, if you were able to make a
really cute thing on the screen

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.080
move, or if you're able to make
a really cool video game work,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.100
or if you're able to make a fun
Arduino electronics project.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.800
This is your chance to
teach by sharing what you do

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.720
and inviting other people
to ask questions about it.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.870
So this is not about
impressing each other.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.620
Most of you will never--

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.770
which way are you
trying to shift me?

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.390
Oh, yeah.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.600
You guys.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.820
Most of you won't
talk after this class,

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.830
so don't worry if you do
something embarrassing.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.140
You won't see most
of these people.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.565
The ones that you do,
exchange emails with them

00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:11.190
and talk to them
after, and they're not

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.650
going to care if you do
something silly up here.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.320
So I just want to
set the expectation

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.070
that this is not a competitive
presentation environment.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.710
We're not getting
venture capital.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.162
There's nothing other than
a learning opportunity here.

00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:30.510
ANDREW RINGLER: As Kyle
said, we're not competing.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.100
Hopefully you had fun
and learned something

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.270
over the last two weeks.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.070
That's teachers'
only goal, to let you

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.780
have fun and learn something.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.280
So yeah.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.440
I think the point
of this two weeks

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.200
is to get your feet
wet with Arduino

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.640
and see what it's like to plan
a project and try to build it,

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.970
and then figure out how
to do it better next time.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.660
So that's what we do.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.970
But that said, all your
groups did amazing.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.560
You did so much work,
which is awesome,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.000
and we're all excited to see
what you have to present.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.910
Thank you.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.650
All right.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.921
KYLE KEANE: You're done?

00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:22.170
ANDREW RINGLER: Yes, I'm done.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.640
KYLE KEANE: All right, cool.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.525
ANDREW RINGLER: Come on in.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:24.441
KYLE KEANE: All right.

00:03:24.441 --> 00:03:27.055
So the first group to
present is going to--

00:03:27.055 --> 00:03:29.110
I'll let them come
up and introduce.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.870
So the video game
groups, when you

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.610
come up, take the microphone,
introduce your game,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.140
demo your game--

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.960
or introduce your game,
talk about anything

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.330
that you feel inspired to
talk about, if there is a fun,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.480
interesting learning experience,
or if something gets you really

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.970
excited, talk about that.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.530
Demo your game.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.810
And then we're going to
open it up to questions.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.150
As an audience
member, the best thing

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.970
that you can do to support
someone who's presenting

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.470
is to make occasional eye
contact and pay some attention,

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.661
and then at the end be able to
ask a question that reflects--

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:05.160
I know.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.355
I'm very explicit,
but you'd be amazed

00:04:07.355 --> 00:04:08.730
at how many people
don't make eye

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.070
contact with the presenters.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.620
And then ask
questions at the end,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.230
which reflects something like--

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.230
that looked really cool.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.250
How did you do that?

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.440
And what you're doing is
you're setting them up

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.680
to look smart and share
something that they're

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.990
passionate about
and feel supported.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.050
And you, too, will have
your chance to be up here.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.550
And I guarantee
that you will want

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.960
to have an audience
that makes eye contact

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.930
and then asks you
questions about things that

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.140
were interesting in your project
so that you, too, can feel

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.562
supported and interesting
and like people

00:04:40.562 --> 00:04:41.770
care about what you're doing.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.840
Because a lot of this class was
two weeks of passion projects.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.670
We don't have a
lot of structure,

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.700
because I think that
you're here for two weeks,

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.040
and you should opt into the
project that you want to do,

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.290
and you should find people
that you want to work with.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.206
So a lot of this
work that you've

00:04:57.206 --> 00:04:58.830
done over the last
two weeks represents

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.600
a personal investment.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.060
And so respect
that in each other.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.670
Everyone who's up
here presenting

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.210
put a lot of their own
interest and passion into this.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.580
So yeah-- support,
support, support.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.050
So, first group, are
you ready to present?

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.940
All right.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.140
Here you go.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.990
[CLAPPING]
