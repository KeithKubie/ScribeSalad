00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.990
So these tools give us the ability to build designs that

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.270
are fluid. But as it turns out, that's not enough. As you

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.050
may have noticed as you went through this lesson, the experience

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.270
of re-flow from a very small window size to a very large

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.730
window size is not really a great one for the user.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.340
Now that you know how to build fluid designs, you need to

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.060
learn to adapt those designs to radically different scenarios, like a

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.560
four inch phone screen, and a 30 inch desktop screen. And that's

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.590
what we're going to be talking about in the next lesson.
