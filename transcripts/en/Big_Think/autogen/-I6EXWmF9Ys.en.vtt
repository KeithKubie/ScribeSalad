an elaborate Network and if we actually

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
an elaborate Network and if we actually
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.450
an elaborate Network and if we actually
understand how that network works we can

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
understand how that network works we can
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.720
understand how that network works we can
do a much better job of overcoming

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730
do a much better job of overcoming
 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.400
do a much better job of overcoming
problems and limitations and for that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
problems and limitations and for that
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.470
problems and limitations and for that
matter we're all limited secondly we can

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
matter we're all limited secondly we can
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.590
matter we're all limited secondly we can
create more intelligent machines we've

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600
create more intelligent machines we've
 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510

done a fairly good job without actually

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
done a fairly good job without actually
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.889

understanding how the own brain works

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
understanding how the own brain works
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.860

but now that we're beginning to get

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870
but now that we're beginning to get
 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.930
but now that we're beginning to get
biologically inspired methods this is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940
biologically inspired methods this is
 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.330
biologically inspired methods this is
going to greatly accelerate AI and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
going to greatly accelerate AI and
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.549
going to greatly accelerate AI and
thirdly it'll provide more insight into

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559
thirdly it'll provide more insight into
 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.380
thirdly it'll provide more insight into
ourselves and we can't understand

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390
ourselves and we can't understand
 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060
ourselves and we can't understand
ourselves if we don't understand how our

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
ourselves if we don't understand how our
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.270
ourselves if we don't understand how our
brains work and our identity our

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
brains work and our identity our
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.460
brains work and our identity our
consciousness the concept of free well

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
consciousness the concept of free well
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.109
consciousness the concept of free well
is closely associated with the brain now

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
is closely associated with the brain now
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.030
is closely associated with the brain now
it's not exactly the same thing we can

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040
it's not exactly the same thing we can
 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.210
it's not exactly the same thing we can
talk about how these philosophical

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220
talk about how these philosophical
 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.940
talk about how these philosophical
concepts relate to the brain but you

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
concepts relate to the brain but you
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010
concepts relate to the brain but you
can't really have a kind of a discussion

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020
can't really have a kind of a discussion
 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.170
can't really have a kind of a discussion
about consciousness freewill and enmity

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
about consciousness freewill and enmity
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.420
about consciousness freewill and enmity
without talking about the brain

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430
without talking about the brain
 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.969
without talking about the brain
intelligence is also what we need to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
intelligence is also what we need to
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.620
intelligence is also what we need to
solve all the major challenges of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
solve all the major challenges of
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.440
solve all the major challenges of
humanity and of the planet and so on we

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
humanity and of the planet and so on we
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.270
humanity and of the planet and so on we
need more intelligence in fact we won't

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
need more intelligence in fact we won't
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.700
need more intelligence in fact we won't
be able to solve the major problems that

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710
be able to solve the major problems that
 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.399
be able to solve the major problems that
we have without more intelligence so for

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
we have without more intelligence so for
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.740
we have without more intelligence so for
all those reasons it's important to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750
all those reasons it's important to
 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.600
all those reasons it's important to
understand how the brain works and it's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
understand how the brain works and it's
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.910
understand how the brain works and it's
really only very recently I would say in

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
really only very recently I would say in
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.160
really only very recently I would say in
the last year that we have enough

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
the last year that we have enough
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.429
the last year that we have enough
information to actually make intelligent

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
information to actually make intelligent
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.980
information to actually make intelligent
statements about intelligence and how

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
statements about intelligence and how
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.820
statements about intelligence and how
you even tell

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830
you even tell
 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.340
you even tell
