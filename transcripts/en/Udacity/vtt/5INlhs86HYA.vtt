00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.030
This lesson is all about code design.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.970
When presented with the exact
same problem, two different

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.740
programmers will most likely come up
with two very different solutions.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.590
Both work, but
how do you know which one is best?

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.990
Or is one better?

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.870
Is it just a matter of opinion?

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.020
What makes good code?

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.980
So how can we take all the tools you've
learned about, things like methods,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.720
classes and inheritance, and
combine them in the best possible way?

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.890
Learning the syntax to define
a class is only the beginning.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.560
In this lesson, we'll discuss
when you should define a class.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.660
You'll learn about different strategies
for structuring applications,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.330
with the goal of making our
code as flexible as possible
