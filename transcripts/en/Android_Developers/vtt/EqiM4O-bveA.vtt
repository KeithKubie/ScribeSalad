MIKE GORDON: Kongregate was
founded by Jim and Emily Greer.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.440
They wanted to create an open
web platform for developers

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.600
and indies alike.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.580
They originally called
it the YouTube of games.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.219
My name is my Gordon and I'm
the vice president of publishing

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.440
here at Kongregate.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.850
We saw a lot of web developers
making the transition

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.940
to mobile, and we saw a need
for a partner like Kongregate

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.544
to get into the mobile space.

00:00:24.544 --> 00:00:25.960
PETER EYKEMANS:
I'm Peter Eykemans

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.590
and I'm a senior producer
here at Kongregate.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.970
Some of our early challenges
when we moved to mobile

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.360
were really getting
a grasp on what

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.910
players in the mobile
marketplace were looking for.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.370
TAMMY LEVY: We knew what
we were doing on the web

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.060
to figure out what players
would like and wouldn't like,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.380
but we didn't really have
those tools on mobile.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.730
So we were really struggling
with figuring out,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.720
how is this going to translate?

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.700
I'm Tammy Levy and I'm
the director of product

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.284
for mobile games
here at Kongregate.

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.200
MIKE GORDON: The Google
Play Developer Console

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.460
provides developers with a
ton of really useful tools

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.710
in a really accessible manner.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.918
PETER EYKEMANS: We didn't
necessarily have a good way

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:02.220
to distribute builds.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.239
So using the alpha and
beta testing frameworks

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.080
within Google Play we were
able to very easily do that.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.230
We can add lists of emails,
groups of people, Google

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.740
communities, and rather than
emailing out individual APKs,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.300
we're able to actually
just say, hey,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.020
hit this website
accept tester status

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.190
and go download to build.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.500
And that's all we need to do.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.541
TAMMY LEVY: That's how
you do experiments, right?

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:25.115
You don't roll out
something to everyone.

00:01:25.115 --> 00:01:28.730
If it's not good, how can
we improve it before we just

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.784
push it on everyone else?

00:01:29.784 --> 00:01:32.200
PETER EYKEMANS: One of our
first uses of the store listing

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.400
experiment was running a
head to head icon test.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.540
One showed an iconic
hero from the game

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.120
against a helicopter,
which was one of the units

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.160
inside of the game.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.580
Players who were shown
the helicopter icon,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.180
we saw a 92%
increase in downloads

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.780
of those users versus the
ones who saw the iconic hero.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.510
So we then moved on
to testing screenshots

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.440
where we saw over a 14%
increase in downloads

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.640
for the players who were
shown the new variant.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.860
We then moved on to the
text about the game,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.020
where we indicated more
about the strategy,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.860
the types of units players saw.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.600
By testing each of these in
line and we saw increases

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.750
across the board.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.479
And when you tally
everything up,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.250
we saw over a 45%
increase in downloads

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.090
for players hitting
the new shot.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.380
So it was a very successful
experiment for us.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.360
TAMMY LEVY: We basically
started going crazy

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.330
and just applied this
to every single game.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.520
We know that the results
that we're getting

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.870
are actually actionable.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.020
And from there put
it all together

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.480
and make sure that
we're presenting

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.830
the best game possible.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.100
Our advice to all
developers out there

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.490
would be to utilize all
the tools in the developer

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.194
console to make sure you
set up yourself for success.

00:02:38.194 --> 00:02:39.860
MIKE GORDON: There's
a tremendous amount

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.060
of information that just lives
in the developer console.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.340
That's accessible by
you at any moment.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.005
It's really easy to use,
really straightforward,

00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:50.140
and the information there
is incredibly useful.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.760
PETER EYKEMANS: To
be cliche, you only

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.265
get one shot at a
first impression,

00:02:53.265 --> 00:02:54.640
so make sure you
test everything,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.940
because you just want to
be sure that the are you

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.260
love is the art that your
players are going to love,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.770
and you might not
always be right.
