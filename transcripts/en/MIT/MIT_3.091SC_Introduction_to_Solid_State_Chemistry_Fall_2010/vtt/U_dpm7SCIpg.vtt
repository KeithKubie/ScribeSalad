00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.310
SAL BARRIGA: Hi, I'm Sal.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.840
Today, we're going to
solve Problem #5 of

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.250
Exam 3 of Fall 2009.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.250
Now before you start this
problem, there are a couple of

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.360
things that you need to know
in order for you to fully

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.680
understand the science
behind it.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.210
And so what you need to know
is Fick's first law.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.030
Not just knowledge of it,
but how it works.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.850
Also, Fick's second law.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.440
And not necessarily the
equation form, but the

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.110
solution to Fick's second law,
which is a function of

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.060
concentrations, and which
we will refer to

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.150
to solve the problem.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.240
And also know popular
dislocations, how they help

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.930
your material and whatnot.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.010
So the problem reads
as follows.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.300
Specimens of steel are being
surface hardened by the

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.940
introduction of carbon.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.630
The concentration of carbon at
the free surface of the steel

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.480
is kept constant at c sub s.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.460
Chemical analysis of a number
of specimens indicate that

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.430
after a time--

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.640
t sub 1--

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.920
the carbon concentration has the
value of c star at a depth

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.710
from the surface-- x1--

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.900
shown below, which is
shown on your graph.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.450
So this is given to you.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.090
So this pretty much is your
concentration profile as a

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.110
function of position.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.080
And it's telling you
what's happening.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.470
So a good thing to do is draw
a picture of the science

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.730
that's happening here.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.830
And they tell you, first of
all, I'm going to draw it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.710
underneath here that you
have a rod of steel.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.980
And so this is steel.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.410
And I have a certain fixed
concentration here at the

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.320
surface of carbon.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:08.140
So I have some type of a carbon
flux in my surface.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.740
And this is a visual image
of how it looks.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.102
And what the problem says is
that you have a certain

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:19.170
concentration on your surface,
which is given by c sub s.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.610
And then it starts telling you
that chemical analysis was

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.590
able to go ahead and measure
this concentration at two

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.400
different values inside your
position at different times.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.470
So if I continue reading the
problem, it says that chemical

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.930
analysis of a number of
specimens indicate that after

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.190
a time-- t1--

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.510
the carbon concentration
has a value of c star.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.100
So this one right here--

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.190
this is x1--

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.490
so this has a value
of x1 at t1.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.800
And it also tells you that after
a certain time-- t2,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.410
which is equal to 2 times t1--

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.750
the carbon concentration has a
value of c star, so the same

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.090
value at a depth of x2.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.560
So now, this thing says that at
a depth of x2, at a time of

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.910
t2, we measure the same
concentration, c sub star in

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:18.420
the specimen.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.080
And it tells you that x2 equals
2x1, and it also tells

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.460
us that t2 equals 2t1.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.100
Now they tell us that for a
reason, because it's probably

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.190
expected for us to use this to
solve the problem, so don't

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.270
forget that.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.300
So the question is, under these
conditions, would you

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.310
describe the rate of
carburization as one, steady

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.770
state diffusion.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.850
Two, transient state
diffusion.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.140
Or three, not governed by any
diffusion, i.e., rate limited

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.270
by some other process.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.290
Now you have to justify
your choice.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.680
So this is pretty much a
problem of process of

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.920
elimination.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.065
And for part a, which is--

00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:08.120
I'll label this part a--

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.610
it wants us to do
three things.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.380
So the first thing, it asks
us if it's steady state.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:20.220
So the first thing to ask
yourself is, well, what's

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.180
steady state?

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.680
And the definition of steady
state is that whatever

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.080
phenomenon is happening doesn't
vary with time.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.810
But the problem already tells
you that it varies with time.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.200
It tells you that at a certain
time you measure this and at

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.140
another time you measure this,
and you have this flux coming

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.210
in, and this is what's
happening.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.510
So from just reading the
problem, I can already say

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.840
that this process can't be
steady state, because your

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.460
concentration profile varies
as a function of time.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:05:04.580
So for one, I would write, can't
be steady state due to

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.930
the concentration being
a function of time.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.140
So one is out, so we
can scratch that.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.730
It's not a steady state.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.180
Now two.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.060
This is where it gets a little
bit more complicated.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.780
Two is a transient
state diffusion.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.000
Well, how do we know whether
or not this is

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.780
governed with time?

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.190
Well, you would argue, because
this is not steady state, then

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.920
it has to be time dependent.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.330
But, there are certain rules
that you need to know to be

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.040
able to make that
justification.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.080
First of all, if it's time
dependent, then whatever your

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.140
concentration and whatever your
position in your time is,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.460
has to fit into your solution
to Fick's law.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.810
So if I look at my solution to
Fick's law right here, I know

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.300
that on the left side of
my equation, I have the

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.440
concentration at any
point in x--

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.170
that's what c stands for--

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.060
minus the concentration
at my surface,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.560
which is given as cs--

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.660
sorry, this is supposed
to be sub s--

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.580
divided by the initial
concentration.

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.300
So c sub naught is if there was
already some carbon in my

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.480
steel, minus, again, the
surface concentration.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.590
This equals to an
error function--

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.140
which is the solution to
Fick's second law--

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.880
and this error function has
the values of position,

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.840
diffusion coefficient,
and time.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:43.180
So in order to verify if it's a
transient state, we're going

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.800
to go ahead and take that
equation and break it down.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.500
So if I assume that there's no
carbon, I can go ahead and

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.690
write this down.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.360
Assume c0 is 0, just to make
the equation easy.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:00.410
I can, because there was no
information given about that.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.390
I can go ahead and--

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.100
because we're trying
to figure out if

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.830
it's a transient state--

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:07.770
write this down.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.340
So c minus c sub s over
negative c sub s.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.380
This equals to my error
function, which is x divided

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.630
by 2 squared of Dt.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:28.220
And I know that at x1
and time-- t1--

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.240
I have this value of my
concentration, c sub star.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.800
So I'm going to go ahead
and plug that in

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.030
here into this equation.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.530
So I know that my concentration
is c sub star.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:48.600
So that's what we measured, c
sub star minus c sub s over

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.680
negative c sub s.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:59.815
This equals to my error
function, x1 over 2 square

00:07:59.815 --> 00:08:01.460
root of Dt1.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.510
So this is for the first
time point, x1, t1.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:13.210
Now I want to go ahead
and do the same thing

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.980
for the second point.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.630
And if I do it for the second
point, I know that just by

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:25.330
looking at the equation, I have
the same concentration at

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:29.000
x2, and I have the same
surface concentration.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.670
So what that tells me is that
this value is going to be the

00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:41.430
same for x1, t1, and x2, t2.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:46.950
So if I go ahead and plug
this into my equation.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:53.190
I can go ahead and look at this
and say, this is for t

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.020
equals 1 for that, and
this is going to be--

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.752
or, t equals t sub 1, sorry--
and this is t sub 2.

00:09:00.752 --> 00:09:05.650
I have c star minus cs
all over negative cs.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:14.280
This equals to my error function
of x2 over 2 square

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:15.530
root of Dt2.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:24.190
So I know that this value is
the same as this value.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.850
So therefore, this should
be the same as this.

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:32.020
The argument in both your
error functions.

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:33.640
So we have to go ahead
and prove that.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.870
Well, how are we going
to do that?

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.880
Do I know x2 as a
function of x1?

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.680
I do, because that's
given in the data.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:52.220
And I know again, that x2 equals
2x1 and t2 equals 2t1.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:10:03.740
So what I want to know, does x1
over 2 root Dt1, does this

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:12.590
equal to x2 over 2 root Dt2?

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.560
Well, I'm going to go ahead and
plug in my values that I

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:25.490
know, and this becomes 2x1
divided by 2 times the square

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.530
root of D--

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:30.100
and t2 happens to be 2t1.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.250
So those two cancel each other
out, and I end up getting that

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:45.225
this is actually equal to x1
over square root of 2Dt1.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:55.400
Now this and this are
not the same.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:59.300
Because this has a square root
of 2, where the other

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.130
one is just a 2.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.730
So because it did not satisfy
the solution to Fick's second

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.940
law, we can say that it's
not case two either.

00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:14.770
This is not transient
state diffusion.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.380
So therefore, by the process of
elimination, it has to be

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.080
governed by some other
phenomena.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.450
And that is the answer
to this problem.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:25.190
The fact that it's governed by
something that we don't have

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.590
enough information to answer.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:29.390
We don't have enough data
points to answer.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.580
So that's part a,
which is good.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:41.350
Now part b asks, if the steel
specimens in part a were

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.480
replaced with steel specimens
of identical composition but

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.900
with a dislocation density 10
times greater than that of the

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.260
steel in part a, how
would the rate of

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:51.760
uptake of carbon change?

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.650
Explain.

00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.340
Again, this requires you
to know properties of

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.620
dislocations, and what

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.640
dislocations do to your materials.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.890
Your metals, for example.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:05.610
What is a dislocation?

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:09.430
Well, a dislocation is--
if you have a bunch

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.050
of a plane of atoms--

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.230
what a line dislocation is, or
an edge dislocation is, this

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.110
line defect such that
it just terminates.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.010
So you have a plane of atoms
that just comes to a point and

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:21.090
then it stops.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.200
And what do you create here?

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.240
Well it creates void, and void
facilitates diffusion.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:28.490
It increases--

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.970
in our case, we're talking
about carbon

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.000
diffusion into steel--

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.430
so I would argue that the more
dislocations that you have,

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.500
the greater the diffusion
should be.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.660
Because you have more
void-- more spaces--

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:51.540
for your carbon atom to
jump into and from.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.260
So for part b, just by arguing
the fact that dislocations

00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.090
represent defects in
your crystal--

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:03.900
specifically a defect that
can create void--

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:09.050
then with that argument, the
fact that more void means

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:14.030
higher diffusion, I would
conclude that--

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:15.190
for this part--

00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:39.340
that my rate of diffusion of
carbon should increase when

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:50.390
using steel of a greater
dislocation density.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:02.025
So the rate of carbon uptake
or diffusion of carbon into

00:14:02.025 --> 00:14:05.620
your steel increases
as you increase

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.920
your dislocation density.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.600
And with that, you're to be able
to solve a lot of these

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.110
problems. And these are
common in 3.091.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.150
And again, knowledge of Fick's
first and second law, how to

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.910
use the solutions to Fick's
first, second law, and knowing

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:26.150
what a dislocation is, that will
help you a lot in solving

00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:27.550
these problems.
