1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.350
Show. Okay. Ready? Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.160
I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and we're getting ready for, well,

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.910
this whole podcast you're about to hear is an invitation to join us in the next

4
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.650
podcast. We will be going

5
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.280
<v 1>[inaudible] second year. This is not, I hate Facebook.</v>

6
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.990
Hate that. Everybody knows that. So many of them,

7
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.420
ladies and gentlemen, I witnessed the death of privacy.

8
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.070
<v 0>Yes. So that happened. We thought we'd throw it in anyhow, back to the flow.</v>

9
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.660
So I'm glad I remember because Radiolab and this particular episode is more or

10
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:53.470
less an invitation for you to get ready for the next episode.

11
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.180
Yet today we have a preview of a,

12
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:58.460
an episode that we are working on furiously right now, uh,

13
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.390
about the periodic table of elements.

14
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:04.990
We're gonna tell individual stories about the different elements and those

15
00:01:04.991 --> 00:01:07.210
stories are going to take us into outer space,

16
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.290
into deep manmade holes in the middle of America, into ourselves,

17
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.830
all kinds of places. So this week we decided to make a small telescoped, uh,

18
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.880
preview in which we go to one apartment in one building in the city of New York,

19
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.640
occupied by the rather singular Dr. Oliver sack.

20
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.950
We should say this was a visit we paid 10 about six, seven years ago I think.

21
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.230
And um, this is the story that in a very real way inspired us to do,

22
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.790
uh, this upcoming episode about the elements. And we also know by the way,

23
00:01:39.791 --> 00:01:42.160
that Oliver isn't, isn't feeling so well right now,

24
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.110
which makes it particularly wonderful to hear him in enjoy.

25
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.000
Off we go.

26
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I think there's always been a desire to somehow categorize and classify the

27
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:55.080
world around us.

28
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.030
I remember it and when you were in,

29
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.250
I don't know when it would be like an eighth grade when they,

30
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.060
when the teacher comes in in general science and he pulls down the periodic

31
00:02:06.061 --> 00:02:08.550
table of elements wherever that, I mean,

32
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:11.330
that was one of the first times where I was like, yeah,

33
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.710
I don't want to be a scientist. It's not for me.

34
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.580
But for kids who love this kind of thing. Take Oliver Sacks for example.

35
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.090
Especially come in. Yeah,

36
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.550
so a couple of years ago we had went to talk to Oliver sacks about something.

37
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.960
Well,

38
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.100
it's actually mostly you that was going to talk to them and I was just tacking

39
00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:29.910
along for the hell of it and for some reason we ended up in his bathroom.

40
00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.540
I tend to read a little bit maybe to look at a book or something.

41
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.670
He seems to have facts and figures in his as well. There's a lot of us in there.

42
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.603
I'm sorry, sorry.

43
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.290
And that's when we noticed you're the periodic chart in the bathroom,

44
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.620
but he had a periodic table of the elements on the wall in the bathrooms.

45
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.800
We thought, wow, how funny. Periodic table in the bathroom. But then he said,

46
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.510
well, you know, if you go out into the couch,

47
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:59.160
you'll see type of cushion cushions embroidered with the periodic table.

48
00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.980
Then he took us to his

49
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.310
<v 2>bedroom. Although I don't usually take people into my bedroom. Oh,</v>

50
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.490
we'll come where he showed us his periodic table, a comforter.

51
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.140
I tend to sleep here right under tungsten.

52
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.640
But the cool part was when he took us to the living room where you had this, uh,

53
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.950
describe what isn't before us here. And I'm like an altar. It's like a little,

54
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.960
a little dictionary Stan on top of,

55
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:26.050
which was a beautiful Mahogany box.

56
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:30.610
Say fine wooden box at the size of her back game and set core periodic table of

57
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:34.660
the elements is a very fine wooden buck if you care to open it.

58
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.280
All right? It's, it's,

59
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:40.690
it's a made of some sort of fine wood if it comes from Russia.

60
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.600
All right, man. Is there a trick to opening this? No.

61
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.050
[inaudible] okay.

62
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.750
We've all seen the periodic table being Alona chart,

63
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.550
but I don't want for his box. There were the chewable elements.

64
00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.320
These are all these we have here like 90 some odd little, uh,

65
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.370
little tubes saw plus TV vials,

66
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.460
almost all the elements. Arsenic, bismuth,

67
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.030
[inaudible], manganese, mercury, nitrogenic, Lipton goal. Since I am,

68
00:04:16.031 --> 00:04:19.880
for example, having my 77th birthday tomorrow. Yes.

69
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.110
And element 72 is half Niamh there isn't it for half a million little rocks

70
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.200
here. Here's what, here's what they sound like. If he's grabbing me,

71
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.730
I have coming to me. I hope it lives today and in got of half an im,

72
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.110
which will be very much more satisfying. What would you do with it in God?

73
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.980
But you can't do with the two little pebbles. I'll be able to hold as my hand.

74
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:46.810
I first love of chemistry had to do with the the said she wants. Yeah,

75
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.800
we one of the liquid elements. Hello me. I loved the colors.

76
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.190
Lousy Lee Brown fluidity luster. Pale golden can. Very, very beautiful.

77
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.810
The the physical property is a gas trapped in a little vial. Yes. I wasn't,

78
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.010
the one wouldn't want to drop that. Why not? I will, it's not good to with,

79
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.450
can I just jump in here for a second? Sure. Um, cause I, I really need to jump.

80
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.010
But the thing that's really crazy about that box and this you don't get from,

81
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.680
uh, from looking at a period periodic chart on a wall,

82
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.670
is that all those elements [inaudible] carbon nitrogen,

83
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.530
that's like to the world. I mean everything that we can see and perceive.

84
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:31.120
This table right here, the depth in my mouth, sky,

85
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.770
ocean, the mountains, it's all need of some combination. Yeah.

86
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.760
<v 3>Bell Ms from that box and the box itself gives it all in deep,</v>

87
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:42.350
deep order.

88
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.570
<v 2>I had noticed myself,</v>

89
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.810
I can't help noticing that the elements are organized in a very special sort of

90
00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:59.090
way. For example, excuse me, I have managed to not notice.

91
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.930
I find it a little odd that you could organize them at all.

92
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.700
I don't even know how to begin the process of figuring out they're related in

93
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:12.530
some way. Well, we'll then, then you are sort of um, recapitulating what,

94
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.920
you know, what everyone felt in the, in the early days,

95
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.880
of course in the really early days people thought they were just four elements.

96
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.900
Ancient notion of elements took the form of earth,

97
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.800
fire and water.

98
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.740
Basically the thought that the whole world could be composed of these four

99
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:35.080
ingredients in different

100
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.160
<v 4>ways. But then in the 18th century, we're skipping ahead a bit.</v>

101
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.350
Chemists began to break things down into a smaller pieces like wind became gases

102
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.200
like oxygen and hydrogen and nitrogen and earth got divided up into things like

103
00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.450
sulfur, phosphorus, iron,

104
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.990
and eventually chemists got all the way down to the root of it,

105
00:06:54.991 --> 00:06:59.100
which was the atom. That's really what an element is.

106
00:06:59.101 --> 00:07:02.670
It's a particular kind of Adam. The problem was though,

107
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.700
when chemists began to start measuring these atoms and they found that they were

108
00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:09.090
all different sizes and types, like one would be heavy,

109
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.710
another would be light.

110
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.920
Third one would be really friendly Lex to link up with other Adams.

111
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.310
Where's the fourth would be a loner and they would come and combinations like a

112
00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:21.660
heavy, friendly, heavy, shy, light, friendly, light shine.

113
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:23.340
What was the pattern? That was the question.

114
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.120
Could they fit all of these differences and similarities into one big

115
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.910
<v 2>mentioned his name. You have to me here, show you a picture of the um, um,</v>

116
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:35.440
here's where we get to Oliver's hero.

117
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.340
The Siberian big a mist I is called.

118
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.300
That would be Demitri Mandalay, the great men delay of who we will talk about.

119
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.690
Oliver has a black and white picture of him on his kitchen cabinets.

120
00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:50.320
Man is not going to win any, any beauty contracts? No. He,

121
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.700
he jokes like a mixture between a Rasputin and um,

122
00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.250
uh, who do, I mean, what do you mean? He is a big nose, a shaggy,

123
00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:03.760
slightly unkempt white beard and mustache that goes all over the place.

124
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.890
Piercing eyes, thick eyebrows and looks like he's in a hunchback position.

125
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.800
Generally, if you met him on the sidewalk, you'd probably want to walk around.

126
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.320
Yeah. He didn't believe in wasting time. Gone to a Baba.

127
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.070
Let me just ask you as the degree of your passion, when you look at this man,

128
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.850
do you think he's a beautiful looking guy or do you see what I see? Um,

129
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.091
I think Mendeley,

130
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:31.091
I've had a beautiful mind and when that mind gets on a train and it was a long,

131
00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:34.630
long ride from your coats to Moscow,

132
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.280
strange things will happen. As you're about to hear. We'll be right back.

133
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.010
<v 4>My name's Annalise and I'm calling right before going to bed in Des Moines,</v>

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.110
I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab and we're going to go back to Oliver sacks talking

150
00:09:45.111 --> 00:09:48.560
about his hero. Did me treatment delay. Laugh now about to take a trip.

151
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.270
<v 2>All right. Okay.</v>

152
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:55.960
In 1860 alone and 1860 there were trains going all over Russia and Mendell f

153
00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.450
could afford to take trains.

154
00:09:59.451 --> 00:10:04.451
He was often on enormous journeys and to wile away the time since he couldn't do

155
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:06.620
chemical experiments or whatever,

156
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.830
he would take playing cards with the name of various elements that chemical and

157
00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:16.420
physical properties and he would play what he called chemical solitaire,

158
00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.020
sorting them for likeness or sorting. I'm afraid I,

159
00:10:20.021 --> 00:10:21.710
I don't know the details,

160
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.060
<v 4>but you know what we can imagine, right? Sure.</v>

161
00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:26.210
So let's just say he's Day sitting there on the train.

162
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:29.580
He's looking out the window. Your police sees trees made of Carbon

163
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.380
[inaudible],

164
00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.380
a lake made of hydrogen and oxygen and oxygen behind that amount should you made

165
00:10:37.771 --> 00:10:40.800
of silicone, any shuffling the properties,

166
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.080
are there atomic weights in his mind wondering how do these things go to Kevin?

167
00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.720
What's the pattern? Any shuffling. I'm shuffling, shuffling,

168
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.830
shuffling range of lane of traffic.

169
00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:56.070
And he did this for years until one night.

170
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.693
<v 2>This we think is true.</v>

171
00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:03.790
In February of 1869 he is said to have had a dream industry.

172
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.840
<v 7>All the atoms have all the elements of all the world.</v>

173
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:09.810
If that wants a small noise, dense wants the heavy ones,

174
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:13.170
the friendly ones to shine. Once they all begin to dance in his mind and then

175
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.570
<v 2>mapped into a grid,</v>

176
00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.010
the awoke with a vision of the periodic table,

177
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.400
<v 7>Oh</v>

178
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.760
<v 2>oh dreams, which he then wrote on the back of an envelope.</v>

179
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.480
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>

180
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.970
<v 4>The thing about what he wrote on the back of that envelope is that it starts out</v>

181
00:11:37.971 --> 00:11:40.070
so simply left to right.

182
00:11:40.071 --> 00:11:42.780
The Adam's just get heavier and heavier and heavier and heavier,

183
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.160
but every so often, and this is what he intuited in his dream,

184
00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:49.670
is that while they're getting heavier there other traits like whether they're

185
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.620
shy or magnetic or whatever, those traits, oh,

186
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.160
repeat UDL declared change burger again and every time they do start a new

187
00:11:57.161 --> 00:12:01.720
route, it properties repeating gain out of this simple repeating structure.

188
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.220
You get a table that you can read in a million ways.

189
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.420
There are so many ways to read this table.

190
00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:15.040
I'm going to call this the PTO Dick Table that if you use your imagination,

191
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:15.963
okay,

192
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.140
<v 2>you can see yourself in there.</v>

193
00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:25.420
I was a lot of a shy kid with a difficulty forming relationships.

194
00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:27.370
Um,

195
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:32.370
and I sometimes compared myself to the inert gases in nerd cancers.

196
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.940
They're very isolated.

197
00:12:33.941 --> 00:12:38.440
They react with nothing because I felt that they too had difficulties forming

198
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:43.270
relationships. But, um, I did, uh,

199
00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.150
he goes now, left the chair and has moved to the library, is taking on a new,

200
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:52.600
a hugely thick, actually a dangerously thick book.

201
00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.090
This is the handbook of physics and chemistry,

202
00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.850
as you see it says 5,000 pages.

203
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.300
I had a smaller version as a boy,

204
00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.660
and I'm from brooding in this book.

205
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:09.160
It seemed to me just possible that one of the inert gases is that norm might be

206
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:14.161
seduced into combination by the most active element of all,

207
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:20.070
which was flowing this lonely, lonely gas might find a partner somehow. Yeah.

208
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:21.970
Did they ever get together? In fact,

209
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:27.090
it came to me with great joy when I found out her in the 1960s that a actually a

210
00:13:27.581 --> 00:13:32.010
Canadian chemistry, uh, had an effect, made a floodlight of xenon

211
00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:39.760
elemental love. And speaking of love,

212
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:41.800
he then took us, he gets come here

213
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:48.490
to the living room and he showed us a small painting in the painting.

214
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:50.200
There was this dramatic figure of him

215
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:56.710
scowling character on the side of a mountain holding two stone tablets over his

216
00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:00.160
head. And the sky was filled with lightning. And who was it? It was

217
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.550
Dimitri Mandalay. F when I heard of how Mindell AAF had, um,

218
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.880
discovered the periodic table.

219
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.480
I imagined men to laugh as a sort of Moses going up to a chemical Sinai and

220
00:14:16.571 --> 00:14:19.600
coming down with a tablets of the periodic law.

221
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:25.480
And when I mentioned this fantasy to Peter Celkon, my friend, uh,

222
00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:30.230
a, an artist or he did this imaginative picture of the young men,

223
00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.480
Dilla f the peaks of a chemical Sinai behind him holding aloft the tablets of

224
00:14:36.761 --> 00:14:37.870
the periodic table.

225
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.370
<v 4>He's is maybe the deepest question of all,</v>

226
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.640
did mentally think this up and impose it upon the world or was this pattern

227
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:52.040
always there? In which case mentally just removed

228
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.960
<v 0>the veil and said, call very. You are,</v>

229
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:58.040
is the periodic table a discovery or an intervention?

230
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.580
Is it a human construct or is it a revelation of the cost?

231
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:05.110
And before define water, is it so to speak? [inaudible]

232
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:18.323
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

233
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.350
<v 0>okay, so that was our visit with, wow.</v>

234
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:27.140
Did I just get carried away with the sound? All right, so yes,

235
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:29.900
it is a little bit a closet cluttered, but this a long time ago.

236
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.660
It was a long time ago. Anyhow, that was our visits,

237
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.250
Oliver sacks and a also preview to an upcoming episode that we're making right

238
00:15:37.251 --> 00:15:39.380
now about elements which we're really excited about.

239
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.800
I hope you'll be back for that. In the meantime, I'm Robert Krulwich.

240
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.380
I'm Jad AB and Ron, this is Radiolab. Thanks for listening.
