00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.410
In this and our previous lessons,
we developed a set of ideas and

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.310
definitions.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.610
To set the stage for understanding what
we can, and cannot solve on a computer.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.340
We've seen the Turing machine,
an amazingly simple model that can only

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.320
move a tape back and forth,
while reading and writing on that tape.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.350
Yet we see that this model capture the
full power of computers now and forever.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.710
You see now how to consider Turing
machine programs as data themselves.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.600
And create a universal Turing machine
that can simulate those programs.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.090
At the end of this lesson, we saw some
languages defined using program as data,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.780
that don't seem to be easily decidable.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.790
In the next lecture,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.940
we will show how to prove many languages
cannot be solved by a Turing machine.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.370
Including the most famous one,
the halting problem.
