NATHAN ROGERS: Hi, everybody,
and thanks for coming.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.830
My name is Nathan Rogers.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.920
Today I have the pleasure of
introducing Porter Gale.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.530
She's the former VP of Marketing
for Virgin America.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.950
And her new book, "Your Network
is Your Net Worth" is

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.300
all about values-based
connections now

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.860
in the digital world.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.670
So without further ado,
Ms. Porter Gale.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.113
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.113 --> 00:00:28.450
PORTER GALE: OK, perfect.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.510
Thank you so much.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.240
It's really great to
be at Google today.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.770
Do I look familiar to anyone,
because I used to be over here

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.710
all the time because we did so
many partnerships with Google?

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.315
No?

00:00:39.315 --> 00:00:42.150
Well, you know me.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.620
So I was at Virgin America.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.770
We did tons of partnership
with you guys.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.050
Just to give you a little bit
of background on that, we

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.830
worked with Google Apps and Maps
and Wallet and Offers.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.460
And so I do feel like I know
quite a few people here, and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.700
it was great.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.540
I was at the airline
for four years.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.170
And ultimately, I decided
to leave.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.570
I didn't want to be an airline
person forever.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.100
I started to get very passionate
about technology.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.200
And I had one of those
aha moments.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.810
I'm not sure if you guys
have had these.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.320
But I was sitting one day, and
I just was thinking, wow, my

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.230
life has gotten so
full and so rich.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.290
Have you had that feeling where
you're like, wow, how

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.280
did this happen?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.760
You've had it, right, where
things feel really good?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.500
And I was reflecting, and I was
trying to think about why

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.440
is this happening?

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.840
What's going on?

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.460
And what happened was during
my time at Virgin, we were

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.280
pretty scrappy.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.520
We didn't have tons of money.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.740
And I talked to everybody
on airplanes.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.560
I was constantly talking
to people.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.640
So if you didn't have your
headphones on, forget it.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.660
I would have been, where
are you from?

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.310
Tell me more about yourself?

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.100
My world started getting
bigger and bigger.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.890
I kept meeting all these
fascinating people.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.380
So there was one time I was on
the plane, and there was a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.130
gentleman next to me.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.680
And he started saying something

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.710
about the mood lighting.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.060
He was like, the mood
lighting is so cool.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.759
And I was like, yeah,
well, tell me more.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.210
I work for the airline.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.140
Turns out that he was building
a boat made out of recycled

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.050
bottles, and he was sailing
it from San Francisco to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.160
Australia, a boat called "The
Plastiki." It was just this

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.530
fascinating story.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.860
His name was David
de Rothschild.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.560
So I said, can I bring my
daughter to come see the boat?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.900
And he said, yes, of course.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.330
No problem.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.890
What happens next is that her
class starts studying the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.530
environment.

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.730
So there's this ripple effect
of one conversation

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.410
impacting the next.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.870
And so I started to become
fascinated by the spontaneity

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.880
of these random conversations.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.220
So with that started happening,
another spontaneous

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.830
event happened.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.410
I had met Tim Ferriss,
who is an author.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.030
Have you guys heard
of Tim Ferriss?

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.850
You have? "4-Hour Work
Week"-- yeah.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.070
I think he works more
than four hours, but

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.430
it's a great book.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.280
So he had invited me to come
to one of his events.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.740
And he said, why don't
you come and talk

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.300
about social media?

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.760
And I said, well, I'm getting
bored with that topic.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.500
I've given that speech
about 50 times.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.750
Let me do this new presentation
about three

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.440
degrees of separation and all
about the spontaneous

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.900
connecting, and that's what
I'm passionate about.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.850
And he said, no problem.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.430
So I go to this event
up in Napa.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.470
I give this presentation
about the world

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.790
getting smaller and smaller.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.660
So in the past, it's six
degrees of separation--

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.240
six degrees of Kevin Bacon.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.240
Is anyone good at
that game here?

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.020
A couple of you.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.390
I'm horrible at that game.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.190
Six degrees of separation is
now down to four degrees of

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.060
separation or even three if
you have common interests.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.430
And a lot of that is because of
companies like Google and

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.360
Twitter and Facebook--

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.330
that our connections
have reduced.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.980
We've got more global
connecting.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.990
It's much easier
to find people.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.150
So I gave this presentation.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.310
Lo and behold, lucky for
me, there was an

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.310
agent in the room.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.600
And he said, I think
there's something

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.410
really interesting here.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.610
You're talking about a
completely new way to network

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.020
and connect.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.750
So we started brainstorming on
this idea, and we came up with

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.790
the concept for the book.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.130
And what the book is all about
is that, in the past, a lot of

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.660
people thought of networking as
a very almost negative or a

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.350
have to methodology.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:48.030
Any of you think of it as
schmoozey or negative?

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.580
One, two-- two, right?

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.850
Where even for me, when
I was in my 20s--

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.430
but I'm not going to tell
you how old I am.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.020
But I know I'm way older than
you two, since we talked--

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.360
but it was really hard for me at
first to network and to go

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.830
to parties and have authentic
conversations with people.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.010
And I've learned how to do it
over the years with all my

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.940
work experience.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.940
So this kind of networking
that was uncomfortable--

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.660
and all of the sudden, I'm
thinking about when I was in

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.240
my 20s and it was an
uncomfortable feeling--

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.520
to now, what changed?

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.180
How come my ability to connect
is so much greater?

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.930
It's obviously age and,
it's confidence.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.410
But it was more than that.

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.550
So I started looking at
networking and thinking about

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.480
it not as a transaction--

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.780
where a lot of people think
about it as going and giving

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.960
out your business cards,
figuring out how many people

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.890
are in your contact list--

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.300
but looking at it more as a
transformation and looking at

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.840
it more towards, how can I be
the best person that I can be?

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.636
So in a grand scheme, it's
not who you know.

00:05:58.636 --> 00:06:01.330
It's who you're becoming
as a person, and

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.160
it's what you believe.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.890
And it's what you're sharing
with other people.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.940
So that's one premise
of the book, is that

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.560
it's not who you know.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.670
It's who you're becoming
as a person.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.840
So the whole first section of
the book is all about is there

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.520
anything that's holding
me back?

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.740
It could be something like
fear of public speaking.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.920
You guys are probably
good at that.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.830
I bet you do a lot of public
speaking at Google.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.830
It could be anxiety about
being in crowds.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.480
It could be anything like that
that keeps you back from

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.480
connecting.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.370
So the first section of the book
is all about identifying

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.960
are there any barriers that
are holding me back.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.980
Now, I share a lot of stories.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.050
There is one story that is not
in the book, but I've written

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.730
a lot about it.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.610
There's a gentleman named
Victor Cheng.

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.940
He is a very successful coach.

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.700
He does a lot of content, but he
happens to be an introvert.

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.260
He's very shy.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.670
And when he started trying to
connect with people, it was

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.930
very hard for him because he
always felt like a phony.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:18.060
So I worked with Victor.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.140
He was actually at that
speech that I told you

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.500
about with Tim Ferriss.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.540
And I said, well, what are the
three things that you're most

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.450
passionate about?

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.340
And start connecting with people
based on your passions.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.030
So for Victor--

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:39.770
technology, entrepreneurship,
and family.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.890
Those are the three
things that he's

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.380
most passionate about.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.410
And I'll give you a structure
of how to do this.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.920
And over the last two years,
when he would meet people, he

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:52.710
would start to connect with them
on the topics that he was

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:53.900
comfortable with.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.860
And lo and behold,
it transformed

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.020
the way that he connected.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.590
So giving you a little bit
more structure about this

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.740
idea, in the book I call
it the Funnel Test.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.050
Now, I'm not sure if this is
true, but I believe that Apple

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.485
uses three core words when
they define their brand.

00:08:13.485 --> 00:08:15.120
And so I talk a lot
about this.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.960
I don't have it in the book,
because I don't want the Apple

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.510
people to come to me
and say it's wrong.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:23.780
But the three words that I think
you'll agree our very

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.000
synonymous with Apple are

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.940
innovative, simple, and beautiful.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.289
Everything that they do comes
out of that filter.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:40.880
So after working with brands and
companies and brands like

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.010
Virgin America over the last
20 years, it's proven that

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.820
companies that have defined
positioning, a defined

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.820
mission, defined core
objectives--

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.650
like a road map-- are
more successful.

00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:59.800
So how come as people we don't
have our road map?

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.010
We don't have our mission,
our objective?

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.240
So the Funnel Test in the book,
the first step of it is

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.065
figure out three
core passions.

00:09:07.065 --> 00:09:09.550
And I might put someone
on the spot.

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:11.395
I won't do somebody
who's chewing--

00:09:11.395 --> 00:09:14.440
as everybody starts taking
a bit of their lunch.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.850
So-- three passions.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.770
Step two of the Funnel
Test is tonality.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.870
How do you want to be
perceived by others?

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.270
So an example of that--

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:31.280
Lady Gaga, bold, eccentric.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.010
The tonality that I've picked--
and I hope that you

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.130
guys will find this one somewhat
symbolic of what I'm

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:38.890
trying to do--

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.570
so inspirational is the
tonality I have.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:43.660
I would like to inspire
others.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.830
But I also want to be inspired
myself, where I am constantly

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:48.420
learning and changing.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.690
So step two is picking
your tonality.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:55.030
You might want to be perceived
as intellectual.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.780
You might want to be perceived
as creative.

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.550
So now we have step one
is our three words.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.090
Step two is a tonality.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:12.160
Step three is defining, 15
words or less, what your

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.570
passion or your objective is.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:16.990
Make sense?

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.140
OK, I see a couple people
thinking, hmm.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.110
Any questions on that.?

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:22.160
No?

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.948
Anyone want to share what some
of their passions are?

00:10:25.948 --> 00:10:29.180
NATHAN ROGERS: Those are
two of my passions.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:29.870
PORTER GALE: OK, great.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:34.150
So now Nathan, being that he
loves sports and kids and

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.130
volunteering, what happens when
you start connecting with

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.480
people based on those topics?

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.180
NATHAN ROGERS: I think people
warm up to you a lot quicker

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.627
because when you are genuine
and talking to them about

00:10:47.627 --> 00:10:50.360
something you're passionate--
and especially if they have a

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.770
shared interest--

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:54.560
you really build a quick
relationship based on that.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.660
PORTER GALE: That's
exactly right.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.260
So he's not a plant.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.690
I didn't give him money
to come sit here.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:03.680
But when you start connecting
with people based on topics

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.330
that you're really passionate
about and that you're

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:10.310
knowledgeable about or care
about, you're going to have

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.100
more authentic connections.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.580
So that's why one of the
reasons that it's very

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:18.770
important to figure out these
things and connect that way,

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:24.770
because in today's world, we're
no longer business life

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:26.340
and personal life.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:27.780
It overlaps a lot.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.540
We were talking earlier
that you come here.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.880
You eat every meal here.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.890
And then you go to the gym,
and then you play games.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:37.500
And you're here probably
12 hours a day.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.770
So I bet some of your
friendships are here, too.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:44.360
So our business life and our
professional life, everything

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:47.400
is starting to overlap
in our new economy.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.500
So really important to think
about how to have strong

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.730
relationships with the people
that we work with and the

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.120
people that we're spending time
with and to be efficient.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.650
A lot of times, we're going to
have to do things that are

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.310
overlapping.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.710
So I go hiking a lot with
girlfriends that I'm still

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.290
working on projects with because
it's an efficient way

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.740
for us to get things done.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.450
So after the Funnel Test, what
I talk about in the book is

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:18.130
looking at do you have a support
system that actually

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:24.950
helps you achieve your goals
and fulfill your passions?

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.350
And if you don't, how
can you fill it in?

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.190
So of course, technology
is a really

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:33.930
important facet of this.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.430
I talk a lot about technology in
the book, how it can be the

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:39.280
accelerator.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.220
For example, I'm going to tell
you one story about how

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:44.910
communication has changed.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.130
And you probably have thousands
of them here at

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.100
Google that you could tell.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.790
But there is a military family
that I spoke with.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:54.000
Vivian is the wife.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.960
She lives outside of DC, and
her husband Mike has been

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.920
deployed six times in
the last 10 years.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:06.200
And I said, well, how are you
guys staying connected?

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.750
Have you ever seen that
game where you put

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.345
a photo on a stick?

00:13:10.345 --> 00:13:11.910
You know what I'm
talking about?

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:14.190
Like Mike on a stick, her
husband's got a little picture

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.350
on a stick, and she brings him
around-- a little popsicle.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.610
So they've got two kids.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:21.500
The kids, everywhere they go,
they bring their dad, his

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.710
photo on a stick.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:28.640
They take pictures
on their iPhone.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.840
And they constantly are sending

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.030
messages back and forth.

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:36.330
That has completely changed the
way that they can create a

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:40.240
sense of empathy, a sense of
connection and with technology

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.340
that wasn't here five
or six years ago.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.410
You couldn't take your instant
digital photos.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:47.530
You couldn't send it
over Facebook.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:53.850
So that kind of connection is
changing the way we create

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:54.510
connections.

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.910
Now because you're in tech,
you've probably heard about

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.230
this already.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.970
But there is research by a
gentleman named Steven Pinker

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:07.290
who has said that, in the
past, we had about 10

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.190
connections that were really
important to us.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.350
Maybe it would be our immediate

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.410
family, maybe our neighbors.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.000
Now we're up to 150.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.080
So our circle of empathy and
everything that we're doing

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.560
has more ramifications
across our network.

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.120
Path--

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.920
obviously, you guys are
familiar with Path.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.620
That's one of the reasons they
have a limit of 150, because

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:32.550
they want to try to keep
the close connections.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:36.690
So knowing this, everything
that you're doing, your

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.690
actions, your behaviors, are
going to be amplified and

00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:44.880
leaving a digital footprint and
impacting your network in

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.820
the future.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.700
So again, this is another
big shift that we

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.860
didn't have in the past.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:57.230
In the past, I think about
when I first got a job.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.580
It wasn't that long ago, but
I do remember being at the

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.950
library researching and sending
out letters and making

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.120
phone calls.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.700
There was not the ability to
connect with people by

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:12.450
LinkedIn or sending a
very well written

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:14.170
email to get the job.

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:17.810
Again, today things have
completely shifted in terms of

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.450
how we network, how we
have jobs, and how we

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.460
move through the world.

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:26.930
So another thing that I've
tried to point out in the

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.360
book, which I think is really
interesting, is that

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:37.040
innovation has changed over the
years and how we come to

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.460
breakthrough thinking.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.380
There's two things that I
want you to think about.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:45.165
The first one is that in the
past, things like the light

00:15:45.165 --> 00:15:53.000
bulb, the car, a lot of
innovation was based on single

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.780
thought processes, single
innovations.

00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:00.640
And now, true innovation comes
from collaboration.

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.340
It comes from co-creation.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:04.320
It comes from people
coming together.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:08.750
So your ability to network and
work in teams and to create

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:13.600
these strong relationships is
even that much more important

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.630
than it was in the past.

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.160
So I'm imagining here at
Google, I know you

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.990
guys have 20% time.

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:20.830
I've read about that before,
which sounds awesome.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.020
But I'm imagining that a lot
of the great work is coming

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.140
out of team-based learning.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.930
So that's another big shift
that's happening.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.780
Another trend in networking,

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.950
obviously, is content creation.

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:38.790
But what I like to do is talk
about it on a bigger level

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:44.330
where the idea is or the
question to ask yourself is

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:49.420
are you a producer or
are you a consumer?

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:51.430
Now in our economy,
we need both.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.300
We need people that are
buying and selling.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:58.360
But if you are a producer--

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.920
or at least thinking every day,
what value am I bringing

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.680
to the table?

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.660
What value am I bringing
to my relationships?

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.450
Am I bringing ideas
to the table?

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.230
Am I bringing creativity
to the table?

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:16.460
Similar to connecting on your
passions, if you're connecting

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:20.380
around ideas and thoughts,
products, all of those things,

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.790
if there's something in between
the relationship

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:27.329
that's here, you're going to
have stronger connections.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:30.480
So I talk a lot about
how do you get

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.970
into a producer mindset?

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.700
A couple of things that
are important

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.130
with a producer mindset--

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:40.400
have any of you read "Little
Bets" by Peter Sims?

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.440
It's a really good book.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.250
I would recommend it.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.650
"Little Bets," basically, the
book, what it says is that

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:51.100
true miracles and breakthroughs,
usually when

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:55.470
they happen, we don't know about
it until it happens.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:00.040
It's little steps and little
bets that we take to get us to

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.740
the breakthrough.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:04.300
So think about that in
terms of networking.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.680
There may be these relationships
that are

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:10.050
long-term relationships that
are going to be very, very

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.850
impactful for you, but you have
to keep working across a

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:13.700
series of steps.

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.320
And it may be multiple years.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.440
So true innovation comes from
little steps, little bets,

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:24.350
collaboration, sharing your
values across your network,

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.180
and working together
in collaboration.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:30.680
The creativity, that's a
very, very important

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.450
part of this process.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:37.360
Another thing that I talk a lot
about is just how media

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.770
manipulation has changed
over the years.

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.020
And again, because you guys are
technology experts, you've

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.060
probably thought a
lot about this.

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:52.830
But it is easier than ever to
raise your profile around a

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.580
specific topic or subject.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.630
So for example, when I left
Virgin America, I decided I

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:00.400
wanted to blog.

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.680
And it was very easy.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.140
You can set up your own
blog, of course.

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.070
But then I thought, well, I'm
going to blog for "Ad Age."

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.870
That will position me as an
expert in the marketing space.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.520
I'd like to blog for
"Huffington Post."

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.560
Anyone can blog these days.

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.020
And if you select the right
blogs and you select the right

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:23.680
content to put out there, it's
going to help you accelerate

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.930
your networking abilities.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.520
So every time I wrote a piece
for "Ad Age," it probably

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.330
would get retweeted
about 500 times.

00:19:31.330 --> 00:19:34.070
I'd get more contacts
asking me about

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:36.330
marketing or start-up gigs.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:40.310
It's a great way to accelerate
your networking.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.860
So in the book, there's also
lots of thoughts about

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.810
accelerating, how to connect
with more people, partnership

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.320
strategy, that type of thing.

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.020
Another thing that is core to my
philosophy on networking--

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:58.250
and it sounds like at Google
you guys already have this,

00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.480
because Nathan was telling me
about some great programs

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:06.380
where you're doing educational
programs to help others learn

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.565
across the company, right?

00:20:08.565 --> 00:20:10.020
You have something
like that, right?

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:11.010
NATHAN ROGERS: Absolutely.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.930
PORTER GALE: And there's
a lot of volunteerism.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:18.120
So you guys are already focused
on the "we." This is

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.200
critical because networking
today, if you're more focused

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.430
on giving and supporting others
and focusing on the we

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.680
instead of just the men, you're
going to have a much

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.810
more successful career path,
much more successful

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.060
networking.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.330
So for example, I spoke
with George John.

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.150
He's a CEO of Rocket Fuel.

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:42.970
It's a media company that does
programmatic buying.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.400
They've grown not as fast as you
guys, but they've grown to

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.620
about 200 people in the
last four years.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.710
And I said to him, tell
me how it happened?

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.250
How did you get the growth?

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.160
And he tracked every single

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.900
connection back to his network.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.260
His partners were through
his network.

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.880
His employees, most of his
employees were recruited

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.070
through his network.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:09.140
His funding was through
his network.

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.690
Time and time again, he kept
turning back, and it was

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:12.950
through his network.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.760
In a lot of situations these
were people that he had helped

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.930
over the years with
other things.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:20.670
So what happens, when you make
an ask when you've been

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:24.030
helping someone for five years,
and then you come to

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.890
them and you say, I'd like
your help on x, it's much

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.870
easier for them to say yes.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:34.630
So again, in the past, I do have
a hypothesis that people

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.470
would hoard their
contacts more.

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.370
It would be, I don't want
to share this with you.

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.745
I don't want to share
that with you.

00:21:40.745 --> 00:21:42.690
And I want to make sure
that I get ahead.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:46.910
And it was more of a climbing
the ladder mentality.

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:50.830
Now, the job market is more
of a horizontal in a

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.340
collaborative fashion.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:57.440
Today's intern might be
tomorrow's CEO, right?

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.310
AUDIENCE: Hopefully one day.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.400
PORTER GALE: Hopefully
one day?

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.170
Well maybe tomorrow.

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:02.090
You never know.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:05.690
So the book talks a
lot about the we.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:10.300
It talks about respecting people
regardless of age,

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.140
title, income, because the
world is shifting.

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:16.460
An example of that--

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.620
Dennis Crowley, who is the
CEO of Foursquare.

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:22.270
I interviewed him in the book.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.530
I interviewed about 60 people.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.160
Dennis--

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.150
actually Dodgeball
was acquired by

00:22:29.150 --> 00:22:30.810
Google at one point.

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.310
Are you guys familiar
with this story--

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:33.470
because I see you nodding--

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:35.060
a little bit, maybe?

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:36.957
AUDIENCE: I don't know where the
story is going, but I know

00:22:36.957 --> 00:22:37.610
about Dodgeball.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:38.440
PORTER GALE: All right,
so Dodgeball

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.280
was acquired by Google.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.940
Prior to that, Dennis was
working with three different

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:46.110
start-ups, and he
lost his job.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.135
Oddly, when I met him,
it was in Tahoe.

00:22:48.135 --> 00:22:49.500
And we were at a conference.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.500
And he said, didn't
you use to work at

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.300
Kirshenbaum and Bond?--

00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:53.790
which is an ad agency.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:54.600
And I said, yeah.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:57.660
And he said, well I was an
intern there when you were the

00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:58.430
general manager.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:22:59.590
And I'm like, oh my god.

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:00.930
And here he is, this CEO.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:01.610
It's like, what happened?

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:02.450
I did something wrong.

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:05.120
He's the CEO, and I'm
doing whatever.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.900
So he was an intern
while I was a GM.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.620
He had these three jobs
at the start-ups

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.080
afterwards that he got fired.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.890
He started Dodgeball.

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:18.660
Gets acquired by Google, and
then I don't know exactly what

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.100
happened there.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.470
But it went flat.

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.020
So they stopped--

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.880
probably should not be talking
about Dodgeball,

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.450
but it's too late.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:26.780
I'm already halfway in.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.750
So then he ends up restarting
it himself as Foursquare.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:36.910
And the pivot point that he went
through he describes as

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:43.180
one of the most growth-filled
periods in his life in that he

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.760
had all of this change that
was happening that he

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:46.300
wouldn't have done.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.770
So pivot points are also
really important.

00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:55.100
Pivot points can come in the
form of pink slips, job loss,

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.430
recessions.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.000
Remember back in 2008?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.480
I don't know if it happened
here at Google, but, oh my

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.180
god, half of my friends
lost their jobs.

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:09.630
And that's when a major shift
in terms of your networking,

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.500
your experience and your
abilities, all those things

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.670
can really move forward in
an exponential rate.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.900
Today's intern can be
tomorrow's CEO--

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.120
really, really important
to think about.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:25.290
One thing that is happening
here, and I think that it is

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:29.406
more rampant in Silicon Valley,
is that collaboration

00:24:29.406 --> 00:24:31.440
and sharing--

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:34.280
and you guys can agree
or disagree--

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:38.760
I think it's actually happening
more here than it is

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.800
across the globe.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.480
I talked to one VC who said that
software and tech, when

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.430
you are open about things and
you start sharing, you get

00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:50.220
more feedback.

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.070
And then you have a
better product.

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:55.040
It's one idea about it.

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:59.760
But so people are sharing
more in this market.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.460
So you can be the leaders in
this idea of networking and

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:05.920
connecting and sharing
and giving back.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:09.410
You can be the ones that are
starting to have that trickle

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:14.250
out and creating great
positive change.

00:25:14.250 --> 00:25:16.780
One of the last sections of the
book-- and then what I'm

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.380
hoping we'll do is
do a quick Q&amp;A--

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.290
but the last section of
the book is called

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:24.140
Head, Heart or Wallet.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.460
And obviously, head, heart,
or wallet, we all

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:28.860
need financial security.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.120
We need to be able
to pay our bills.

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.590
We need to be able to feel
secure about that.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:39.670
But this section of the book
really looks at how are you

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.620
valuing your life?

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:47.210
What are you looking at at the
end of the day in terms of

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.980
what's making you happy?

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:52.700
Is it the experiences
that you had?

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.840
Is it the relationships that
you've had over the years?

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.370
Again, time and time and time,
the people that I interviewed,

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:05.525
everybody from Dick the CEO of
Twitter to Malik to Brit

00:26:05.525 --> 00:26:09.090
Moran, everybody started
talking about that.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:12.490
It wasn't necessarily
the material goods.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:14.210
It's the accomplishments.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.340
It's the ideas.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.970
It's the legacy.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.920
So the book will bring you
through this thinking where

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.760
you're also thinking about, am I
connecting based on what I'm

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:29.230
trying to leave, in terms of the
world, leaving my imprint

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.580
and leaving as a legacy?

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.480
So your network is
your net worth.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:42.050
What I hope that you'll think
about is that networking is

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:48.880
more of a lifestyle and a
process and that if you focus

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:52.530
on relationships rather than
just looking at money and

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:58.630
finances, that success,
happiness, productivity, all

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:02.670
of those things come
from relationships.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:05.610
So I'm imagining that
a lot of times--

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.030
I've been in this place before,
too, where I think

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.420
about, am I investing in
the right company?

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.320
Am I getting the deal?

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.700
Am I getting the right job?

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.450
You get very focused on,
am I getting this,

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:16.470
this, this, and this?

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.850
Am I getting the right
stock options?

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.890
And I fully vested?

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:23.660
We start thinking a lot about
all these things that are more

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.530
financially-based.

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.950
If you focus on the
relationships, keeping them

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:33.280
strong, and you nurture the
relationships, you help other

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.260
people, my belief is that
everything else falls in line

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.850
and that you will have the
success, the productivity, and

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.530
the happiness.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:47.220
So in closing, just to tell
you more about the book, I

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.500
worked on it for 18 months.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.150
It was really amazing.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:53.720
About 70% of it is story-based,
so it's

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.270
interviews with lots of
different people, both

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:00.080
personal and professional
stories.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.620
I interviewed a young woman who
was battling leukemia who

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.600
talks about how connecting
helped her through that.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.130
You've got the military
moms, entrepreneurs.

00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:12.970
It also goes through a lot on
how to make an ask and how the

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:16.520
importance of storytelling in
today's world is really

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:19.650
important in how people connect
on emotions more than

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:22.240
they do on facts and figures.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.990
Then there's about 30%
of the book that

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:27.580
is how-to and exercises.

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.190
So for people that are more
like me, who are more

00:28:30.190 --> 00:28:34.060
analytical and they want a road
map, the exercises give

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.340
you a road map of how
to chart things out.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.320
So with that, I want to thank
you guys for being here.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.620
I see the book is on sale for
$10, which is the cheapest

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.510
I've ever seen it.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.810
So I'm going to buy all of
them that you don't.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.780
But it's an honor to be here.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.800
I have such respect
for Google.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.540
You guys were a great partner
at Virgin America.

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.180
We did amazing things with
you, so I always will be

00:28:58.180 --> 00:28:59.860
grateful for that.

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:02.940
And I'd love to open it
up for questions.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.550
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.940
What I'd like to know is what
triggered you to leave Virgin

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.840
America and then decided
to write a book?

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.070
What's the journey about that?

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.190
PORTER GALE: Yeah.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.410
I loved Virgin America.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.280
I was there for four years.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:20.100
I'll be honest, I was fully
vested and knew that I didn't

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.910
want to be an airline person
for the rest of my life.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:24.240
It's a great business.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:30.060
It's also a challenging one
in terms of the economics.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:33.260
It's hard to describe what
it's like to have outside

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:37.170
influences that impact a
business as much as airlines.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:42.560
The oil prices, swine flu,
everything you can imagine

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.950
impacts travel.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.740
So at the end of the day, I just
decided I didn't want to

00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.820
be an airline person forever.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.040
And I felt like four
years was a good,

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.060
healthy amount of time.

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.420
But I'm still very
close with them.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.990
A lot of the start-ups that I
advise now, actually, I'm

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:58.320
helping them do some
partnerships with Virgin.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:59.330
But it was great.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.500
I met Sir Richard.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.110
Actually, there's one story
I'll share with you guys

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.190
that's really fun.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.650
It's about the power of the ask
and going for things and

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:09.660
going for your dreams.

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:11.540
So there were these kids--

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:13.660
and I just did an event with
them last week-- but they're

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.260
from an underserved
area in LA.

00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.340
They made a video.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.580
They were up for a contest.

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:21.600
And they made a video, and
they sent it to me.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.820
And it said, Sir Richard, will
you help us win this contest.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.360
They needed votes.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.960
And I had never asked him a
favor, because I just didn't

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.500
feel like that was
appropriate.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.020
I would be like asking some of
the top people at Google to do

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:36.890
a favor for you.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:39.570
You'd probably think
about that twice.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.510
But the video was so compelling,
and the kids did

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:44.710
such a great job that
I sent it to him.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:49.950
And I said, I know you're busy,
but if you could tweet

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:53.380
for the kids or go on uStream
or do something for them, I

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.810
would really appreciate it.

00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:58.290
So that was around 10
o'clock at night.

00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.690
The next day, about
2 o'clock in the

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.875
afternoon, my phone rings.

00:31:02.875 --> 00:31:05.120
Porter, it's Richard.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.060
And I was like, oh my god.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:06.940
Is this a joke?

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.510
I thought it was one
of my friends.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:13.430
And he said, I'm actually
in LA right now.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:15.610
I'm at the Sunset Marquis.

00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:17.360
I have about a half an hour.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.090
If you want, you can bring
those kids over, and

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.612
I'll meet with them.

00:31:21.612 --> 00:31:23.085
I'm like, oh my god.

00:31:23.085 --> 00:31:24.010
I can't believe this.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:27.620
So I call the woman who's the
mentor, and I said, Nancy, get

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:30.850
the biggest SUV you can because
Sir Richard will take

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.090
a meeting with the kids.

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:33.250
Gather as many as you can.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:35.950
Now these kids are from a
low, low income area.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:42.160
The point of the story here is
that, if the kids would have

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.650
ever asked anyone in their
world if they could have

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:47.860
scored a meeting with
Sir Richard, what

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.800
would the answer be?

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.570
Never in a million
years, right?

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:55.870
They didn't know that they were
two degrees of separation

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:58.760
away from him because I knew the
woman who was the mentor

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.170
of the class.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:03.500
She gathers the kids
up in an SUV.

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.390
I think about six of them
went to the meeting.

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.190
And they videotaped the meeting,
so even though I

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:08.430
wasn't there, I got to see it.

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:12.570
And I have to be honest, it
still brings tears to my eyes.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:16.840
But what's amazing about Sir
Richard is, first of all, he's

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.220
very down to earth.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.110
He is very present.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:21.080
When he's at a meeting,
he would be

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.620
giving you eye contact.

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:25.340
He would not be looking
at his cell phone.

00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:29.930
He asked the kids, what
do you value?

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.200
What's holding you back from
being entrepreneurs?

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.930
What do you want to achieve
in your life?

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:40.500
And I can say with all
confidence that those 45

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:46.490
minutes changed the lives of
those kids, that they felt a

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:49.500
respect and an empowerment that
they probably had never

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:50.860
had before.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:54.660
So that's the type of thing
that can happen with

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:59.580
connecting and the way
interaction happens today that

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.450
didn't in the past.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:05.280
In the past, you wouldn't have
the tweet that you could send

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.760
to the president of a country
or to a basketball player.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.220
We hear about it all the time,
kids sending something and

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:15.000
ending up with the NBA
player playing ball.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.600
Technology has changed
how we connect.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.820
So after that meeting with the
kids with Sir Richard, what

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.890
happened at their school?

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.770
Well, people heard that
Sir Richard was there.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:31.060
And so then Steve Schimmel, he
was Googler number 13, he went

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:34.540
to the school and presented
to the kids.

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.350
Then the CEO of a skin
care company went.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.620
Then Rob Minkoff, who
was the director of

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.380
"The Lion King," went.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:47.880
So it was the ripple effect that
our actions in a network

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.910
can have so many
ramifications.

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:52.640
So your actions--

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.840
the kid who sends you the letter
that says, can I talk

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.500
on the phone?

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.860
Can I have five minutes
of your time?

00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.110
That five minutes can change
somebody's life.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:04.400
So that's what the book
is really about.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.110
It's about helping.

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.730
It's about being authentic.

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:12.469
It's about having connections
that are really real.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:15.500
They're not based on just
exchanging a business card and

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:20.139
having an egg roll at
some cocktail party.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:23.239
It's about ideas and sharing
and doing things better for

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.940
the future.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.820
So that's a very long answer to
your short question of why

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.480
I'm not at Virgin America
anymore, but that's my

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.940
favorite Virgin America story.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.310
AUDIENCE: Can you tell us more
about how you maintain your

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.139
relationships?

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:41.969
Especially going from 10
relationships to 150 and going

00:34:41.969 --> 00:34:44.800
from college to changing
workplaces or meeting people

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.929
on the plane, how do you
sustain those actively?

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:49.949
PORTER GALE: Yeah.

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.489
Well, the actively part is where
you have to think about

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:54.340
what are the core relationships
that are the

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.340
most important.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.270
But I do keep a database of
all my relationships.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:01.300
And some people use CardMunch.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.030
I do.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.980
I put everything in.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.040
And so I find value in that.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.790
Now I have a big email list.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:11.330
But what I would say is
that there are ways

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:12.270
that are more efficient.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.360
So now, I go to New
York a lot.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.660
When I go to New York, I'll
invite all of my New York

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.370
friends, or 10 of them,
like, hey, let's

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:20.630
all meet for cocktails.

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:23.350
Doing group activities
can help.

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.640
I also call it being positively
and productive

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.190
where I'll overlay personal
and work things.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:31.370
So the hiking example and having
a business meeting, I

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:33.260
advise one company
called ZOZI.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.060
And they're all about

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.110
experience travel and adventure.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.990
So whenever I meet with the
ZOZI guys, it's like, well

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:40.050
let's just go on a hike
while we're talking.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:42.950
So looking at how to keep
being efficient.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:46.560
The other thing that's really
important is all of those time

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.210
wasters that you have
in your life.

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.500
So I don't know how many emails
you get a day, but

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.500
think of all of the ones that
you could unsubscribe from,

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.120
those hundreds of emails.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:00.550
So looking at all the
inefficiencies and keeping

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:04.610
your time as productive as
possible is really important.

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:07.570
The other thing is that I have
made really good contacts

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:09.840
through social media,
just because I'm

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:13.310
in the social space.

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:18.240
I have moved those from online
to offline by having Skype

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.150
coffees, meeting them
at a conference.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:23.020
Oh are you going to be at
South by Southwest?

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:24.330
Let's meet up there.

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.340
So safety first, but looking
at, if it's an interesting

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:33.030
relationship, how do
you move it into an

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.580
offline one from online?

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.530
So those are things
to think about.

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:40.910
In terms of job contacts, I've
got to tell you, the annual

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.130
holiday card, a lot of people
don't do it anymore.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.290
That's an amazing way to stay
in touch with people, and

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:50.180
people really love it, because
you don't get mail that often.

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.590
So little things like that--

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.600
a written birthday card,
all those little

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.602
things, a thank you note.

00:36:56.602 --> 00:36:59.110
Amazing and it really
stands out.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.490
So think about little things
you can do like that.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:05.050
Also, when you meet people at
events or meetings, another

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:07.160
thing I like to do is, well, can
I follow up and send you

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.850
this article that I think you
might find of interest, that

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:11.290
kind of thing.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:13.860
So look for how to keep it
sticky if you think it's a

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.830
good relationship.

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:17.950
AUDIENCE: So I see a lot of
parallels with Gary Vaynerchuk

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:21.050
whole "Crush It" and "Thank You
Economy." How would you

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:23.430
apply some of the same
principles if you're a scrappy

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:27.300
marketing budget start-up that
he uses, and what you would

00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:29.220
say in building relationships
and whatnot?

00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:31.180
PORTER GALE: Yeah,
I love Gary.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:33.390
And by the way, we just did an
event at the Apple Store in

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:34.900
New York last week.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.830
So we are in sync.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:40.470
I think that his personality
versus mine is very different.

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.830
He's a New Jersey--

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:42.630
a lot bolder.

00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.310
But I adore him.

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.802
Some of the principles that I
think work for start-ups--

00:37:47.802 --> 00:37:50.240
let me give you an example
that's in the book.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.540
So Melody, who's the
CEO of StyleSeat.

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.960
She used to be at Current TV.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:01.480
And she knew in her heart that
she wanted to have a start-up.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:05.120
She knew that she
had this idea.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:07.780
It's like OpenTable except
for hair salons.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:09.890
So that was her concept.

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:13.140
She was fearful about
how to do this.

00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:16.830
And what she did was she
immersed herself in the tech

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:20.710
world by going to about two
conferences a day and

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:23.280
constantly getting in
and socializing with

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.910
people in the space.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:28.160
Ultimately, what happened was
that once she had found a

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:32.185
partner and an engineer and she
decided to have an A-round

00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:37.520
of funding, she already had a
network built up of people

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.020
that she respected and trusted
because she was setting her

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.850
vision on that.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:48.190
So the people that funded her,
they also are co-founders of

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.930
Uber and all sorts
of other things.

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.740
But she had met them through
personal relationships.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:56.120
So figuring out who are the
people that you want to meet,

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:59.100
how do you meet them in an
authentic way, so when it's

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:02.980
time to make the ask, the
relationships are existing.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:05.830
It's always better to have the
people in your network when

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:10.040
you don't need them instead
of when you need them.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.060
I'm a big fan of warm
introductions, too.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.230
I think cold calling is
very hard these days.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:18.130
So I always look for the
warm introduction.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.550
There are trends in hiring that
more and more companies

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:23.290
are using LinkedIn to hire.

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:26.020
They're using internal
referrals to hire.

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.090
They're not going
to monster.com.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:32.110
They don't use external
recruiters as much.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:34.480
More and more is internal.

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.580
You probably all want to stay
at Google because you're at

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:38.050
the best place to work.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.980
But hypothetically, your friend
who wants to be at a

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:44.410
different company, if you want
to be at a company--

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.320
let's say you want to get
to Virgin America--

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:50.520
the fastest way is to network
within that and figure out all

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:52.520
the people that you know
to get in there.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.190
So those are some
of the things.

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.260
Immerse yourself in
the community.

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.840
And it's easier to find people
in the community now because

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.370
we've got online profiles.

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:04.360
We've got very specific
conferences.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.300
And get smart.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.640
Read and research as much as
you can about whatever

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.690
vertical you're in.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:11.740
AUDIENCE: During the 18 months
of writing your book, which

00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:13.870
one was your favorite
interview and why--

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:15.120
your most interesting
interview?

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.640
PORTER GALE: The most
interesting interview--

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.500
well, there's a couple
that come to mind.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:27.800
I'm a big baseball fan, so Larry
Baer was really fun to

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:30.680
interview, who's the
CEO of the Giants.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.010
And his story is pretty exciting
because he loved

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:38.540
baseball when he was 10 years
old, and all his life he

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.200
wanted to work in baseball.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.430
And he shares a story about
when he was in college.

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.820
He called the owner of a
baseball team in Chicago and

00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:52.540
was like, I want to do radio
show on your sports team and

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.620
closed the deal.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.580
So then he started getting the
background in baseball.

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.350
And it's, again, another one of
those stories that if you

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:00.760
don't ask for it, you
don't know if you're

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:01.450
going to get it.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:04.650
So he was really fun
to interview.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:07.260
Michael Mina, the chef, who I
am now good friends with, he

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.110
was fun to interview, too.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:13.610
And the reason his story moved
me so much was that he was

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.950
always passionate about
food, but his

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:17.490
parents are from Egypt.

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.080
He was born in Cairo.

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:22.400
And when he went to them and
said, I'm going to be a chef,

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.400
his dad was like, are
you kidding me?

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.890
You need to be a lawyer, a
doctor, or an engineer.

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:30.790
And so he made a deal with his
dad that he would go to

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:36.030
college, but he still kept
focusing on his passions.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.700
Ultimately, what happened, after
about two years into

00:41:38.700 --> 00:41:43.540
college, his dad realized that
Michael's passion for food was

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.220
not going away.

00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:48.110
And so his dad said, I've
actually researched, and if

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.610
you're going to do it, you
need to do it right.

00:41:50.610 --> 00:41:53.150
You need to go to the Culinary
Institute of America.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.010
It's on the East Coast.

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:56.480
Let's see if we can
get you in.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:58.050
So the dad came around.

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:01.350
And the way Michael
told that story, I

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:02.840
actually needed a tissue.

00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:07.880
It was so powerful that his
dad came to a place, even

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.970
though there was a cultural
difference between what the

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:16.020
father believed was a good
career path for his son, but

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.500
Michael networked.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.190
He proved himself, and he stayed
true to his passions.

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:22.650
And of course, now he
has 18 restaurants.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:23.680
But he's another one--

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.930
he's in the book because
he flew on Virgin

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.390
America all the time.

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.180
And one of the things that I did
there was I knew who our

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:34.260
top 100 flyers were.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.547
And so I had sent everybody
airplanes, those

00:42:36.547 --> 00:42:38.120
little model airplanes.

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.800
So Michael received one
of those airplanes.

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:42.670
And I ran into him at
an event, and I

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:43.690
like, hi, I'm Porter.

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:45.130
I sent you that airplane.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:48.010
And he's like, oh my god,
I love the airplane.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.260
And every time he would fly--
he's got two boys.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.410
The airplane is in his boys'
bedroom-- and he'd say, Dad's

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:55.620
going on Virgin America.

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:57.080
I'm going to Vegas,
and I'll be back.

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.530
So this airplane became symbolic
in their house.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:03.120
So Michael and I became
very fast friends.

00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:05.920
And he's now in the book,
and I also advise him.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:10.370
So again, that's relationship
that I was saying thank you

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:12.620
for flying us, and you
never know where it's

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:13.640
going to end up.

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.480
And because of that, he's done
charity events and different

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.150
things that I've asked
him to do.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.950
And I just had my book launch
party at his restaurant.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:23.560
So you never know how a

00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.180
relationship is going to unfold.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.640
AUDIENCE: Can you elaborate a
little bit more on some of the

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:33.490
tactics or your secret tips when
you first meet someone?

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:37.430
For example, at networking
events or conferences, what

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.880
are some questions you would ask
and the technical level?

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.100
PORTER GALE: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:47.980
So try to steer the topic to
things that you are interested

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.420
in and knowledgeable about.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:53.440
Another tip is that if you don't
know the answer or you

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.290
don't know the topic,
be honest.

00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:00.310
So my example with was, in the
book, I write about I had a

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:03.310
boyfriend in my 20s who
was a journalist.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:06.200
And he was very smart, and
he had this book club.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.020
And I remember thinking, I don't
know all the authors

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:09.410
they're reading.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:11.450
And I was intimidated by that.

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:15.130
But instead of being
intimidated, now the right

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:17.840
response would be, oh, I don't
know about that author.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:18.800
Tell me more.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.390
Why are you interested?

00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:22.480
So again, if there's
something that the

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:24.300
conversation comes up and--

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.070
people talk about pop culture
all the time.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:27.440
Like, oh, I haven't
seen that movie.

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.760
Why do you like it?

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.890
Always try to probe
with questions.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.940
And honesty is the
best policy.

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.240
And try to talk about stuff
that you care about.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.140
The other thing is
that I'm more for

00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.150
quality versus quantity.

00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:43.140
So if you're going to a
conference, try to research

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:45.910
who's there and think about, who
are the three people that

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:47.000
I want to meet?

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.890
Who are the three people that
I want to focus in on?

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:53.150
And set your sights on doing
that, trying to just meet

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:55.520
those two or three people.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.530
AUDIENCE: So now that you've
got this book written and

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:02.000
you've probably got a little
rest period, what's next?

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.230
PORTER GALE: What's next?

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:06.090
Well, I'm going to apply to
Google so that I can come here

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:08.830
and have lunch with you guys.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:09.560
What's next?

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:13.010
Well, I advise about seven
companies right now, and so

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.370
that's been really interesting
to me.

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.550
And then I've got the book.

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:20.520
I do have another book that I've
already written about 70

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:26.670
pages of, but it's a humorous
memoir on dating and having a

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:27.720
midlife crisis.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:29.240
So that's a completely
different book.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:32.620
So I hope I get invited back
if I get that one published

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:36.720
because that will be the
stand-up comedian routine.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.980
And then I've been creating
content with some friends, and

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.520
so I'm creating a lot
more content.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:44.210
I also do classes on
creativeLive, if you guys have

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:45.940
heard of that platform.

00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:48.020
It's an online educational
platform.

00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:50.260
So I just did a three-day course
on building a brand

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.650
from scratch.

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:53.710
And I'm doing another one
coming up on networking.

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:56.600
But it's in that space
of online learning.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.210
So that's been really
fun for me.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:01.050
So I'm trying to take what I've
learned over the last 20

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:05.734
years and give it back
as much as can.

00:46:05.734 --> 00:46:06.710
I am lucky.

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:09.280
I still get CMO calls
all the time.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:13.080
So if the book bombs,
you'll see me

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.104
back as a CMO somewhere.

00:46:15.104 --> 00:46:16.430
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about this

00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:19.260
producer versus consumer.

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.350
For me, I'm basically
a consumer.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:25.550
Even though I think I have a
lot to offer, I always hold

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:27.690
back or whatever.

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:28.950
Do I want to share this?

00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:30.720
Maybe from that--

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.630
to push myself towards the
producer side, can

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.140
you offer some tips?

00:46:38.906 --> 00:46:41.710
PORTER GALE: That's
not uncommon.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:45.640
A common theme of the 60 or so
people that I interviewed--

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.490
there are a lot of people
who are introverts.

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:51.690
And a good book to read about
being an introvert-- and I'm

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:53.750
not saying that you are
one-- but "Quiet" is

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:54.400
a really good book.

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.631
It just came out.

00:46:57.631 --> 00:46:59.890
There's nothing wrong with
being an introvert.

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.130
What you have to do is
find ways to feel

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:04.220
comfortable about talking.

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.440
So already, you and
I chatted a little

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.670
bit about your career.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:08.980
And you've been here
five years.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:12.120
You're adding a lot of value
to the area that you're in.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:17.040
I bet that you have a lot of
inspiring information that

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.770
many people would love
to hear about.

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:24.310
So what I would say is test
it out in small bits.

00:47:24.310 --> 00:47:28.090
Mentoring is a really great
way to help people.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:32.110
Start sharing in a way that is
comfortable to you, and you

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:33.840
might be surprised.

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:36.830
The example that I gave you of
Victor Cheng, he said that

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:39.510
it's really shifted completely
for him now that he's starting

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:42.820
to share and connect
with people.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:47.110
As human beings, we need
people around us.

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:50.170
And there's tons of research
that if we have good

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.990
connections, we're going
to be happier.

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.980
We're going to be healthier.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.260
or We're going to live longer.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:00.150
Another thing you might want to
do is try finding a team.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.480
I'd love mastermind groups.

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.410
I think that it can be a really,
really positive thing

00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:08.670
where you get a group of maybe
five or six people where you

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:11.920
have shared goals, and you
meet once a month or once

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.150
every two months.

00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:16.390
I do a mastermind group with
a bunch of women, and it's

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:17.280
really fun.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.400
It's all tech women.

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.500
And we eat dinner
once a month.

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:21.990
And it's been huge for me.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:26.670
I also am on an authors Facebook
group that I am on

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:28.480
all the time, and that's
been really supportive.

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.460
So look for the things that you
can join that are going to

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.812
give you some of that
support, too.

00:48:34.812 --> 00:48:37.450
Yeah, I love mastermind
groups.

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:40.880
Well if there is something that
you want to ask or you

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:45.710
think about later, you can email
me, portergale@gmail.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:47.050
Or we could do a
Google Hangout.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.630
I have been doing
Google Hangouts.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:52.420
Or my Twitter handle
is @portergale.

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.500
But it's been an honor.

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:56.280
I know that you guys are all
really busy and that you have

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.210
tons of stuff going on.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:48:58.700
So thank you for making
the time.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.880
And Nathan, thank you for
inviting me here today.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.280
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:03.580
PORTER GALE: Thank you.

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:06.612
[APPLAUSE]
