00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:08.307
Narrator: WITH AN ATMOSPHERE
OF SIMILAR DENSITY TO EARTH'S,

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:12.478
IT WAS BELIEVED TITAN MIGHT EVEN
HARBOR PRIMITIVE LIFE.

00:00:12.478 --> 00:00:13.946
TO FLY PAST TITAN,

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:18.651
VOYAGER 1's GRAND TOUR
WOULD HAVE TO BE SACRIFICED.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.621
TO VISIT THIS INTRIGUING MOON,
IT NEEDED TO BE PUT

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:24.691
ON A DIFFERENT PATH,
THROWING IT UP AT AN ANGLE,

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:28.361
OUT OF THE PLANE
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:30.830
BEYOND TITAN,
THERE WOULD BE NO MORE

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.133
PLANETARY ENCOUNTERS
FOR VOYAGER 1.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:40.140
THERE WAS ONE LAST, SPECIAL TASK
ITS MAKERS ASKED OF IT.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.174
BECAUSE IT WAS HIGH
ABOVE THE SOLAR SYSTEM

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:46.045
RATHER IN ITS PLANE,
VOYAGER 1 HAD A VIEW

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:50.916
OF ALL THE PLANETS
THAT ITS TWIN COULD NEVER HAVE.

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:55.021
CARL SAGAN AND CAROLYN PORCO
BEGAN DISCUSSING AN IDEA.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.961
VOYAGER WAS GONNA BE
IN A LOCATION

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:05.498
THAT NO OTHER SPACECRAFT
HAD BEEN BEFORE,

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:09.501
EQUIPPED WITH, YOU KNOW,
SOPHISTICATED INSTRUMENTATION

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:13.172
SO THAT IT COULD TURN AROUND
AND TAKE A PICTURE

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:16.041
OF ALL THE PLANETS
IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM,

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:19.979
AND I THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE
A RIVETING COLLECTION OF IMAGES.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.814
YOU KNOW, A FIRST.

Narrator:
SO ON VALENTINE'S DAY, 1990,

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:32.124
13 YEARS AFTER LEAVING EARTH,
VOYAGER 1 WAS ASKED

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:35.261
TO TURN ITS CAMERAS BACK
TOWARDS THE PLANETS.

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:42.735
NOW, 3.7 BILLION MILES AWAY,
BY THE TIME

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:46.239
VOYAGER'S PITIFULLY WEAK SIGNAL
REACHED THE DISHES ON EARTH,

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:51.944
IT WAS JUST A MILLIONTH OF
A BILLIONTH OF A WATT OF POWER.

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:54.613
IT WAS THEN BOOSTED
AND SENT ON TO PASADENA,

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:56.916
WHERE THE IMAGE
WAS ASSEMBLED HERE

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:59.018
IN THE DEEP-SPACE CONTROL ROOM.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:04.857
A UNIQUE FAMILY PORTRAIT --

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:08.228
THE ULTIMATE SNAPSHOT
OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM.

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:17.937 line:0%
HERE IS THE MOSAIC TAKEN...

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.539
Narrator: FOR CARL SAGAN,
THE SYMBOLIC VALUE

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:22.841
OF THE PHOTOGRAPH WAS A GIFT.

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:24.677 line:91%
...THE PLANETS MOVE AROUND THE
SUN, AND IN ANY GIVEN MOMENT...

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:29.549
HE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE TO
PUBLICIZE IT AROUND THE WORLD.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.153
THE PORTRAIT OF THE PLANETS
HAS NOW BEEN TAKEN.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:36.756
THIS LOOKS LIKE MORE THAN A DOT,

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:40.359
BUT IT IS, IN FACT,
LESS THAN A PIXEL.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:45.064
IN THIS COLOR PICTURE, YOU CAN
SEE THAT IT IS SLIGHTLY BLUE,

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:51.404
AND THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE,
ON A BLUE DOT.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:54.039
Narrator: WITH THIS FINAL
HISTORIC IMAGE CAPTURED,

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.975
AND NOTHING MORE TO PHOTOGRAPH,

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:59.845
VOYAGER 1's CAMERAS
WERE TURNED OFF TO SAVE POWER.
