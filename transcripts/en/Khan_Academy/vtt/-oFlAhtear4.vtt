00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.640
Choose the right number of
each place value to make 8,129.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.150
And we could say this
is 123 thousandths.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.520
Or we could say it is 1 tenth,
2 hundredths, and 3 thousandths.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.190
So let's just go place by place.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.399
So first we have 8.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:22.440
This 8 right over here is
in the thousands place.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.182
It represents 8 thousands.

00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:25.640
So we're going to
have 8 thousands.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.120
So let's select 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8 thousands.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.920
Then we have one 100.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.800
So we literally just have
only one 100 right over there.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.930
Then we have 2 tens.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.960
This 20 is 2 tens.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.670
So we're going to need 2 tens.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.290
Then this 9, well,
that's just 9 ones.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.900
So it's 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.250
And now we're going
into the tenths place.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.740
This is only 1 tenth.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.680
So 1 tenth right like that.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.040
Now this is 2 hundredths.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.810
So we're going to put
2 hundredths there.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.220
Then finally, 3 thousandths--
1, 2, 3 thousandths.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.230
And we check our answer.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.467
And we got it right.
