00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.160
Let's remind ourselves a little
bit of what we already

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.200
know about orbitals and I've
gone over this early on in the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.710
regular chemistry playlist.
Let's say that this is the

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.250
nucleus of our atom, super
small, and around that we have

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.280
our first orbital,
the 1s orbital.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.290
The 1s orbital, you can kind
of just view it as a cloud

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.940
around the nucleus.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.890
So you have your 1s orbital and
it can fit two electrons,

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.820
so the first electron will go
into the 1s orbital and then

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.140
the second electron will also
go into the 1s orbital.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.690
For example, hydrogen has
only one electron, so it

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.020
would go into 1s.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.570
Helium has one more,
so that will also

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.320
go into the 1s orbital.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.340
After that is filled, then you
move onto the 2s orbital.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.330
The 2s orbital, you can view
it as a shell around the 1s

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.760
orbital, and all of these, you
can't really view it in our

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.980
conventional way of thinking.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.340
You can kind of view it as a
probability cloud of where you

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.820
might find the electrons.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.150
But for visualization purposes,
just imagine it's

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.290
kind of a shell cloud around
the 1s orbital.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.850
So imagine that it's kind of
a fuzzy shell around the 1s

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.390
orbital, so it's around the
1s orbital, and your next

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.390
electron will go there.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.370
Then the fourth electron will
also go there, and I drew

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.870
these arrows upward and downward
because the first

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.750
electron that goes into the 1s
orbital has one spin and then

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.190
the next electron to go into
1s orbital will have the

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.950
opposite spin, and so they keep
pairing up in that way.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.070
They have opposite spins.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.125
Now, if we keep adding
electrons, now we move to the

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:42.660
2p orbitals.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.960
Actually, you can view it as
there are three 2p orbitals

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.760
and each of them can hold two
electrons, so it can hold a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.490
total of six electrons
in the 2p orbitals.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.960
Let me draw them for you just
so you can visualize it.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.710
So if we were to label our axis
here, so think in three

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.490
dimensions.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.405
So imagine that that right
there is the x-axis.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.919
Let me do this in different
colors.

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:17.550
Let's say that this right
here is our y-axis and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.700
then we have a z-axis.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.490
I'll do that in blue.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.340
Let's say we have a z-axis
just like that.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.080
You actually have a p orbital
that goes along

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.190
each of those axes.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.810
So you could have your
two-- let me do

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.020
it in the same color.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.560
So you have your 2p sub x
orbital, and so what that'll

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.725
look like is a dumbbell shape
that's going in the

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:46.500
x-direction.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.220
So let me try my best attempt
at drawing this.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.640
It's a dumbbell shape that goes
in the x-direction, in

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.510
kind of both directions, and
it's actually symmetric.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.800
I'm drawing this end bigger than
that end so it looks like

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.535
it's coming out at you a little
bit, but let me draw it

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:00.950
a little bit better than that.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.230
I can do a better job.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.670
And maybe it comes
out like that.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.760
Remember, these are really just
probability clouds, but

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.190
it's helpful to kind of
visualize them as maybe a

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.690
little bit more things that we
would see in our world, but I

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.640
think probability cloud is the
best way to think about it.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.350
So that is the 2px orbital,
and then I haven't talked

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.340
about how they get filled yet,
but then you also have your

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.220
2py orbital, which'll go in this
axis, but same idea, kind

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.530
of a dumbbell shape in the
y-direction, going in both

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.570
along the y-axis, going in that

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.820
direction and in that direction.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.230
Then, of course, so let me do
this 2py, and then you also

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:47.870
have your 2pz, and that goes
in the z-direction up like

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.790
that and then downwards
like that.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.120
So when you keep adding
electrons, the first-- so far,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.480
we've added four electrons.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.700
If you add a fifth electron, you
would expect it to go into

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.380
the 2px orbital right there.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.130
So even though this 2px orbital
can fit two electrons,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.220
the first one goes there.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.905
The very next one won't
go into that one.

00:04:14.905 --> 00:04:17.550
It actually wants to separate
itself within the p orbital,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.110
so the very next electron that
you add won't go into 2px,

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.440
it'll go into 2py.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.170
And then the one after that
won't go into 2py or 2px,

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.060
it'll go into 2pz.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.640
They try to separate
themselves.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.210
Then if you add another
electron, if you add-- let's

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.880
see, we've added one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.030
If you add an eighth electron,
that will then go into the 2px

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.290
orbital, so the eighth electron
would go there, but

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.290
it would have the
opposite spin.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.590
So this is just a little bit of
review with a little bit of

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.790
visualization.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.010
Now, given what we just
reviewed, let's think about

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.620
what's happening with carbon.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.795
Carbon has six electrons.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.300
Its electron configuration, it
is 1s2, two electrons in the

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.090
1s orbital.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.700
Then 2s2, then 2p2, right?

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.270
It only has two left,
because it has a

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.310
total of six electrons.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.350
Two go here, then there,
then two are left

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.260
to fill the p orbitals.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.780
If you go based on what we just
drew and what we just

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.310
talked about here, what you
would expect for carbon-- let

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.930
me just draw it out the
way I did this.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.930
So you have your 1s orbital,
your 2s orbital, and then you

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.570
have your 2px orbital, your 2py
orbital, and then you have

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.790
your 2pz orbital.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.460
If you just go straight from
the electron configuration,

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.890
you would expect carbon, so the
1s orbital fills first, so

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.520
that's our first electron,
our second

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.900
electron, our third electron.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.580
Then we go to our 2s orbital,
That fills next, third

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.000
electron, then fourth
electron.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.700
Then you would expect maybe
your fifth electron

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.330
to go in the 2px.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.020
We could have said 2py or 2z.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.410
It just depends on how
you label the axis.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.150
But you would have your fifth
electron go into one of the p

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:11.660
orbitals, and then you
would expect your

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.780
sixth to go into another.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.720
So you would expect that
to be kind of the

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.980
configuration for carbon.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.880
And if we were to draw it--
let me draw our axes.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:28.320
That is our y-axis and then
this is our x-axis.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.390
Let me draw it a little
bit better than that.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.190
So that is the x-axis and, of
course, you have your z-axis.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.130
You have to think in three
dimensions a little bit.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.230
Then you have your z-axis,
just like that.

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.060
So first we fill the 1s orbital,
so if our nucleus is

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.480
sitting here, our
1s orbital gets

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.480
filled with two electrons.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.480
You can imagine that
as a little

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.350
cloud around the nucleus.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:07:00.020
Then we fill the 2s orbital
and that would be a cloud

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.630
around that, kind of a
shell around that.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.330
Then we would put one electron
in the 2px orbital, so one

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.430
electron would start kind of
jumping around or moving

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.920
around, depending how you want
to think about it, in that

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.530
orbital over there, 2px.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.450
Then you'd have the next
electron jumping around or

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.140
moving around in the 2py
orbital, so it would be moving

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.580
around like this.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.950
If you went just off of this,
you would say, you know what?

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:29.380
These guys, this guy over
here and that guy

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.560
over there is lonely.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.780
He's looking for a opposite
spin partner.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.270
This would be the only places
that bonds would form.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.710
You would expect some type of
bonding to form with the

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.190
x-orbitals or the y-orbitals.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.360
Now, that's what you would
expect if you just straight-up

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.600
kind of stayed with this model
of how things fill and how

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.040
orbitals look.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.210
The reality of carbon, and I
guess the simplest reality of

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:57.040
carbon, is if you look at a
methane molecule, is very

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.800
different than what you
would expect here.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.490
First of all, what you would
expect here is that carbon

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.770
would probably-- maybe it
would form two bonds.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.840
But we know carbon forms four
bonds and it wants to pretend

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.490
like it has eight electrons.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.390
Frankly, almost every atom wants
to pretend like it has

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:13.550
eight electrons.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.800
So in order for that to happen,
you have to think

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.840
about a different reality.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.450
This isn't really what's
happening when carbon bonds,

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:31.400
so not what happens
when carbon bonds.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.890
What's really happening when
carbon bonds, and this will

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.915
kind of go into the discussion
of sp3 hybridization, but what

00:08:37.915 --> 00:08:39.159
you're going to see
is it's not that

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:40.120
complicated of a topic.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.830
It sounds very daunting, but
it's actually pretty

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:42.919
straightforward.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:45.180
What really happens when carbon
bonds, because it wants

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.740
to form four bonds with things,
is its configuration,

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.510
you could imagine, looks
more like this.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.830
So you have 1s.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.050
We have two electrons there.

00:08:57.050 --> 00:09:04.760
Then you have your 2s,
2px, 2py and 2pz.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.480
Now what you can imagine is it
wants to form four bonds.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:09.740
It has four electrons that are
willing to pair up with

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:11.680
electrons from other
molecules.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.100
In the case of methane, that
other molecule is a hydrogen.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.760
So what you could imagine is
that the electrons actually--

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:23.900
maybe the hydrogen brings this
electron right here into a

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.550
higher energy state and
puts it into 2z.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.200
That's one way to
visualize it.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.670
So this other guy here maybe
ends up over there, and then

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:33.570
these two guys are over
there and over there.

00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.240
Now, all of a sudden, it looks
like you have four lonely guys

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:39.520
and they are ready to bond,
and that's actually more

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:42.060
accurate of how carbon bonds.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.670
It likes to bond with
four other people.

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:47.440
Now, it's a little bit arbitrary
which electron ends

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.350
up in each of these things, and
even if you had this type

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.610
of bonding, you would expect
things to bond along the x, y,

00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:57.180
and z axis.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.850
The reality is, the reality of
carbon, is that these four

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.870
electrons in its second shell
don't look like they're in

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:07.895
just-- the first one doesn't
look like it's just in the s

00:10:07.895 --> 00:10:12.100
orbital and then the p and y
and z for the other three.

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.340
They all look like they're a
little bit in the s and a

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.010
little bit in the p orbitals.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.440
Let me make that clear.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.390
So instead of this being a 2s,
what it really looks like for

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:26.570
carbon is that this looks
like a 2sp3 orbital.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:30.430
This looks like a 2sp3 orbital,
that looks like a

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.310
2sp3 orbital, that looks
like a 2sp3 orbital.

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:37.110
They all look like they're kind
of in the same orbital.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:39.520
This special type of--
it sounds very fancy.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.790
This sp3 hybridized orbital,
what it actually looks like is

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.520
something that's in between
an s and a p orbital.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.050
It has a 25% s nature
and a 75% p nature.

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:55.460
You can imagine it as being a
mixture of these four things.

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.170
That's the behavior
that carbon has.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.750
So when you mix them all,
instead of having an s

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.510
orbital, so if this is
a nucleus and we do a

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:08.540
cross-section, an s orbital
looks like that and the p

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:15.000
orbital looks something like
that in cross-section.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.080
So this is a an s
and that is a p.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:21.790
When they get mixed up, the
orbital looks like this.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.960
An sp3 orbital looks something
like this.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:33.170
This is a hybridized
sp3 orbital.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.500
Hybrid just means a combination
of two things.

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.720
A hybrid car is a combination
of gas and electric.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:43.800
A hybridized orbital is a
combination of s and p.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:48.750
Hybridized sp3 orbitals are the
orbitals when carbon bonds

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.300
with things like hydrogen
or really when

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.320
it bonds with anything.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.480
So if you looked at a molecule
of methane, and people talk

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.970
about sp3 hybridized orbitals,
all they're saying is that you

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.400
have a carbon in the center.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.760
Let's say that's the carbon
nucleus right there.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:10.460
And instead of having one s and
three p orbitals, it has

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:12.320
four sp3 orbitals.

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:19.190
So let me try my best at drawing
the four sp3 orbitals.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.350
Let's say this is the big lobe
that is kind of pointing near

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:25.320
us, and then it has a small
lobe in the back.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.180
Then you have another one that
has a big lobe like that and a

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.110
small lobe in the back.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.852
Then you have one that's going
back behind the page, so let

00:12:35.852 --> 00:12:36.910
me draw that.

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.940
You can kind of imagine a
three-legged stool, and then

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.180
its small lobe will come
out like that.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.990
And then you have one where
the big lobe is pointing

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:50.400
straight up, and it has a
small lobe going down.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.580
You can imagine it as kind
of a three-legged stool.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.410
One of them is behind like
that and it's pointing

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:59.120
straight up, So a three-legged
stool with something-- it's

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.960
kind of like a tripod, I
guess is the best way

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.560
to think about it.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.690
So that's the carbon nucleus
in the center and then you

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.720
have the hydrogens, so that's
our carbon right there.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.770
Then you have your hydrogens.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.935
You have a hydrogen here.

00:13:11.935 --> 00:13:16.530
A hydrogen just has one electron
in the 1s orbital, so

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:19.520
the hydrogen has a 1s orbital.

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.735
You have a hydrogen here that
just has a 1s orbital.

00:13:21.735 --> 00:13:24.400
It has a hydrogen here,
1s orbital,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.590
hydrogen here, 1s orbital.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.550
So this is how the hydrogen
orbital and the carbon

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.710
orbitals get mixed.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:35.990
The hydrogens 1s orbital bonds
with-- well, each of the

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:38.590
hydrogen's 1s orbital bonds
with each of the

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.710
carbon's sp3 orbitals.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.540
Just so you get a little bit
more notation, so when people

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.620
talk about hybridized sp3
orbitals, all they're saying

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.580
is, look, carbon doesn't bond.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.900
Once carbon-- this
right here is a

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.280
molecule of methane, right?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:01.500
This is CH4, or methane, and it
doesn't bond like you would

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.240
expect if you just want
with straight

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.060
vanilla s and p orbitals.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.910
If you just went with straight
vanilla s and p orbitals, the

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.080
bonds would form.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.000
Maybe the hydrogen might be
there and there, and if it had

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.450
four hydrogens, maybe there and
there, depending on how

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:15.230
you want to think about it.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:17.180
But the reality is it doesn't
look like that.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.110
It looks more like a tripod.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.080
It has a tetrahedral shape.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.780
The best way that that can be
explained, I guess the shape

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:33.950
of the structure, is if you have
four equally-- four of

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.130
the same types of orbital
shapes, and those four types

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.980
of orbital shapes are hybrids
between s's and p's.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.180
One other piece of notation to
know, sometimes people think

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.550
it's a very fancy term, but when
you have a bond between

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:52.390
two molecules, where the
orbitals are kind of pointing

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:55.240
at each other, so you can
imagine right here, this

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.330
hydrogen orbital is pointing
in that direction.

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.130
This sp3 orbital is pointing
that direction, and they're

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:04.170
overlapping right around here.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:13.730
This is called a sigma bond,
where the overlap is along the

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.100
same axis as if you connected
the two molecules.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.420
Over here, you connect the two
molecules, the overlap is on

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.510
that same axis.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:25.330
This is the strongest form of
covalent bonds, and this'll be

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.480
a good basis for discussion
maybe in the next video when

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.630
we talk a little bit
about pi bonds.

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.110
The big takeaway of this video
is to just understand what

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.910
does it mean?

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:35.530
What is an sp3 hybridized
orbital?

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.580
Nothing fancy, just a

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.580
combination of s and p orbitals.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:44.670
It has 25% s character, 75% p
character, which makes sense.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:48.120
It's what exists when carbon
forms bonds, especially in the

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.880
case of methane.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.920
That's what describes it's
tetrahedral structure.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:57.580
That's why we have an angle
between the various branches

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.580
of a 109.5 degrees, which some
teachers might want you know,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:02.300
so it's useful to know.

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:06.350
If you take this angle right
here, 109.5, that's the same

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.910
thing as that angle, or if you
were to go behind it, that

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:13.380
angle right there, 109.5
degrees, explained by sp3

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.460
hybridization.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.500
The bonds themselves
are sigma bonds.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.420
The overlap is along the axis
connecting the hydrogen.
