PROFESSOR: The humanities,
to me, particularly at MIT,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.620
are essential, indispensable, to
help break those infamous walls

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.430
and build bridges.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.930
Why?

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.540
Because the humanities are the
only disciplines of philosophy,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.800
psychology, linguistics,
history, writing, women

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.390
and gender studies,
that can give us

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.740
the tools to understand
how phenomena connected

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.100
to race, to language,
to religion, to gender,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.800
to sexual orientation,
to have the tools to be

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.020
able to understand
how they can be used

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.800
or misused for domination
or for liberation.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.700
This is the only
group of studies,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.850
of disciplines, that
give us those tools.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.180
As Paulo Freire and
[INAUDIBLE] said,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.820
we have to learn
to become literate.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.530
Not literate just being able to
read, but being able to, as we,

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.940
as Freire says, to read the
world, and read the word.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.560
Because as we read
the word, we have

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.160
to understand the impact
of what we read on the way

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.210
the world works.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.890
And the way the
world works often

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.800
is based on these hierarchies
of power that are often

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.709
embedded in the text we read.

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:23.000
But we're not able to critically
understand those texts

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.810
and see how they create a myth,
or maintain those hierarchies

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.790
of power, then we're
going to become

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.890
part of these hierarchies
We help maintain them.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.010
So the humanities
give us the tools

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.230
to be critical about
these hierarchies

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.510
and be able to distance
ourselves from them,

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.080
and perchance to even
undermine those hierarchies,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.550
and create more
inclusive, and more--

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.820
kinder, more humane societies.
