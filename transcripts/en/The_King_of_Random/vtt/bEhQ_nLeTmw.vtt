00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
Hey guys, welcome back. Today we're in the backyard with the mega Solar Scorcher.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.800
Some of you long-term fans will remember this thing, because about five years ago

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.640
It's the project that launched my channel.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.520
It's made from the front of a giant TV screen, and its whole purpose is to take sunlight

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.800
and concentrate it into a solar death ray so powerful, it can melt holes in concrete.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.160
So if it can do that, is it powerful enough to ignite thermite?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.260
Well, today we've got blue skies and the sun is shining, and Kilian Fitzpatrick really wants to know,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.420
so Kilian, we're doing this experiment for you.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.460
Now, Kilian has a good point, guys.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.300
Thermite burns at about 4,000-5,000 degrees Fahrenheit. (2205-2760 Celsius)

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.680
Which is extremely hot. But it's also very very difficult to ignite.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.480
Usually, sparklers or some kind of magnesium strip are used to ignite thermite,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.900
because it requires an ignition point around 3,000 Fahrenheit (1650 C)

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.320
to even get the reaction started at all.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.980
Now, I know that the Solar Scorcher will get up around 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1090 C) because I have used

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:48.880
it to melt copper.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.360
But will it be enough to actually light off thermite?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.180
That's the purpose of this experiment today.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.820
So, to get this experiment started today, we're gonna mix up a fresh batch of thermite.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.700
That's a three-to-one ratio of iron oxide and aluminum powder.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.020
We're gonna stick all that in a terracotta planter pot lined with aluminum foil,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.200
and set it on a cinder block, to the point where it matches the focal point on our solar death beam.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.540
And at that point, we're gonna set the frame, stand back, and watch what happens.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.780
Now, the sun's hiding behind a cloud right now, so let's take the opportunity to mix up a batch of thermite

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.800
and get everything in position, so we're all ready to go when it pops back out.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.540
Funny story, the reason my Solar Scorcher is marred up the way that it is is from that 4th of July experiment

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.360
we did with black powder, that made the big mushroom cloud and spewed out all kinds of black powder ash.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.040
That was like, four years ago. Dang.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:38.460
[music]

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.800
Juust a touch more for kicks...

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:54.980
[music]

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.780
Beautiful.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.640
[music]

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.560
The aluminum should help give a little bit more reaction time, so the thermite gets a little hotter

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.560
before it spills through.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.840
[music]

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.640
alright guys, its time to focus and light up our thermite

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.820
I got a little jar over here filled up with thermite to the top. I have got it set up on some 2x2s with a little terracotta base underneath.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.100
All I'm going to do now is take the lens from our solar scorcher, and tip it over until it focuses onto the thermite

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.180
and then im going to hold it there until it lights off

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.680
if it does at all

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.380
we got my little wood 2x2s lined up here with a hole in the centre

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.740
that's gonna go right over top

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.180
and it should allow our molten metal to flow down the bottom.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.340
alright, let's light it up and see if we can get it to work!

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.260
here we go

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.720
I can already see it's going to focus

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.600
here we go in three, two, one

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.060
oh, dang

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.840
woohoooohooohooo

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.000
WOW!!!

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.460
WOW!!!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.560
Wow, oh my goodness, come look at this!

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.280
look at the way this is glowing

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.040
the pot is cracked

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.360
everything is on fire

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.100
we got a ton of metal down here

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.060
wooh dawggie

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.160
look at that pot!

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.220
I'd say that was a success!

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.140
WOW! oh my goodness look at that!

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.800
pieces of wood are charred and burned

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.520
and we are left with a cool metal residue

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.120
when that cools down we're going to have to chop it open, but that should be

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.200
IRON molten iron

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.820
and look at that, our pot has just disintegrated.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.900
absolutely. look at that

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.500
super brutal

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.080
absolutely destroyed

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.940
that wood I can't believe that wood just went up in no, no time FLAT

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:45.980
completely charred

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.880
and this is still glowing

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.320
that was fun, let's do that again

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.920
guys I'm a foot away from this right now and it's been about 3 minutes

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.980
since this reaction went off, it's still incredibly, incredibly hot, and you can see this iron is still glowing

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.400
My terracotta pot is COMPLETELY destroyed

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.260
And it's a really good thing that I took the solar scorcher and ran when I did

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.340
Because there was a shower of sparks spewing about 4 feet in every direction

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.180
and it was burning about 5000 degrees Fahrenheit

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.320
this is absolutely amazing! with the ignition point of thermite being so high, i was expecting

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:19.200
quite a bit of a delay, maybe 30 seconds to a minute before it lit off

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.620
but no, that thing was instant, like the second the focal point made contact

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.020
the thermite went off

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.240
and I have to say, I'm actually quite pleased about those results. Let's do it again!!

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.020
I got another pot, pretty good amount of thermite in there as well, I'm using our old blocks here

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.920
and just kinda put them in a 'V' shape so we can set this down over top

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.820
I've built this up about as high as I feel comfortable

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.400
There is no way to support it up and really see the lava flow

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.720
like we did before

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.700
but um at this point I'm just really excited to do it again

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.920
oh look, it's actually so hot the wood just caught on fire

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.060
oh well

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.020
flames are not going to ignite our thermite

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.900
so I'm not really worried about that too much

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.100
We'll just leave that there, set the solar scorcher up, and go for round 2

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.760
hahaha

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.920
man it's a good thing I got it out here in a hurry!

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.840
I have to make sure I do that again

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.580
Like that.. OH danggit!

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.120
Oh, danggit, I just lost a whole bunch of our thermite there

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.240
salvage what you can

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.440
Ok, well, we're down about an inch, but no worries

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.780
Sure we'll still make it work

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.280
Alright, let's see if we can get that to work again! Here we go!

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.160
Oh, the focal point isn't quite as concentrated this time

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.020
I think it's a little bit too high, actually. OHHHH!!!!!

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.420
*THERMITE IGNITES UNEXPECTEDLY!*

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.300
[Music]

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.420
Nice!  Nice. Nice, ok. That, that was cool

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.440
Look at that!

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.880
You what impressed me about that, is that all metal came out into the dish under underneath

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.520
I thought it was gonna spew out to the side here

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.920
and overflow, but it didn't

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.300
Looks like we captured it all

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:11.180
[Slowmotion clips of thermite ignition]

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.980
And looking down that pot there,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.700
You can see all of it has reacted, there is nothing left

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.480
Maybe just a little bit down the corner but all went through that hole

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.220
and filled up the gaps at the bottom

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.880
WOW! that was great!!

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.740
Pieces of wood are like fused in there

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.980
That's where all the molten metal went in, it just went in and filled all the gaps that were there previously

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.560
Which makes me wonder...

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:44.100
Could you possibly make a mould out of sand or something of that nature and use thermite to cast iron?

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.500
hmmm. maybe an idea for another project?

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.120
Let me know in the comments below

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.440
alright guys, it's been about 20 minutes since our second reaction took place, it has had a chance to cool down.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.980
So just for funI grabbed a hammer so we could crack this metal open and see what happened inside.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.640
This is still surprisingly hot

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.780
You can see the uh terracotta base here, kinda stuck to something there.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.660
That's well cracked

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:10.420
In fact if I hit that a little bit, I can get it just to flake off, look at that

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.380
So what are we left with on the inside here?

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:23.540
We got big globules of this what looks like metal if we hit it, *hits metal with hammer*

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.680
It's actually pretty solid! I mean it is cracking, and that one split in half

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.520
If that was Iron, I wouldn't be expecting it would be splitting in half like that

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.180
But look right there, you can see a little bead of iron

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.740
And little beads of iron throughout

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.440
What appears to be metal, almost looks like a metal foam

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.340
And if you look at the cross section of that, you can see hundreds of little bubbles on the inside

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.040
Which is kinda cool but it's not solid, is it?

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.080
Whoo it's still crispy warm

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.920
Cooled down quite a bit, but that's still quite toasty

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.640
[Music]

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.640
Oohh

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.320
Look in there. that right there is a big glob of iron

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.940
That's quite a bit harder than the other ones were

00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.180
oh, I still broke it though

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:16.060
there's another piece

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.640
they all seem to be hidden inside

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.800
It's like what's inside this one? What's inside this one?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.260
So this is pretty cool guys, we started this experiment today on a quest to find out

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.560
Whether we could use sunlight to ignite thermite

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.680
which has a very very high ignition point

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.800
we mixed 3 parts of iron oxide with 1 part aluminium powder to generate

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:34.380
generate a homemade thermite mixture

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.600
then We brought back the solar scorcher from a previous project to concentrate the rays of sunlight into

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.020
a solar beam of death

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.960
The question we came here to answer today was whether that would be enough to ignite thermite

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.720
And after these experiments today, I think we can all conclude that the answer is a resounding yes.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.840
Not only will it ignite thermite, but you saw in the first experiment, it lit off

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.900
within seconds. And even on the second experiment, even though the focal point wasn't ideal,

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.240
it was still enough heat to initiate the reaction

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.520
and it's only 85 degrees Fahrenheit today.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:04.180
well guys, now you know how to harness the power of the sun to initiate a thermite reaction

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.060
right in the comfort of your own backyard

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.580
But don't do that in your backyard, leave that to me.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.380
Again, a huge thanks to Kilian Fitzpatrick for suggesting this experiment today.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.600
Kilian you can go check your youtube inbox, I'm sending you $25
