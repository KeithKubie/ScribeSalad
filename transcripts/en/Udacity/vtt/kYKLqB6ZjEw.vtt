00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.580
PKI can be confusing.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.900
For our purposes, you need to
master three concepts, public and

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.620
private keys, the difference between the
message, the sensitive information and

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.120
the digital signature derived
from it and attached to it.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.500
And the function of
two key organizations.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.100
The first organization confirms
the identity of the people or

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.720
entities involved in
the exchange of information.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.259
This is the Registration Authority,
or RA.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.410
Functionally separate,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.030
although one organization could
do both is actually signing and

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.100
issuing additional certificates
that are bound to that identity.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.380
This is the Certificate Authority,
or CA.
