00:00:01.101 --> 00:00:02.736
It's Black History Month.

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.271
It's the one month of the year

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:06.907
where we all get together
and talk about race.

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.510
And how we pretty much fixed it.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.379
But the social justice warriors
will woke-splain to you

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.182
that this month is a time for me
to learn something.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:17.918
Listen and take a backseat.

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:19.620
It's not gonna happen.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.655
I'm not taking a backseat.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:24.358
I have to sit up front because I
get motion sickness.

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:26.360
Moving forward makes me puke.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.528
It's a very common ailment for
people like me,

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.465
so riding shotgun with me is
Kobi Libii.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:32.866
Welcome, Kobi.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.035
(cheering and applause)

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.104
Thank you, Jordan.

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.139
I'm here to bring attention

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:42.543
to an important cause out there,
BLM.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:45.312
Wait, are... are you talking
about Black Lives Matter?

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:48.148
Oh, God no, I'm not some
militant radical.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.150
I'm talking about BLM:

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.053
Black lives? Manners.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:55.489
Because, as we all know,
there is an epidemic

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.658
of impoliteness in
the black community.

00:00:57.658 --> 00:01:00.794
And it could easily turn into a
case of systemic rudeness.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:04.031
The Black, the Black Lives
Manners movement

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:05.999
has its roots in the Jim Crow
era, where,

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:07.801
if you were impolite
to white people

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:10.704
you were scolded... with murder.

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:14.975
And to make sure I'm up on the
good etiquette, I check-in

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:19.146
with television's home for
Black History Month, Fox News.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:22.516
These guys just don't
see race.... until they do,

00:01:22.516 --> 00:01:25.252
and then immediately become an
authority on it.

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:27.821
I should know, I went to
Fox News finishing school.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:32.326
So, like many black men in
America, I'm virtually finished.

00:01:32.326 --> 00:01:35.462
Isn't the mascot over there the
"fighting status quos"?

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.097
Yes, indeed.

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:40.167
And all across Fox News, they're
taking advantage of this month

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:42.102
to really listen...

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.972
to themselves telling
black people how to act.

00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.873
After the State of the Union,

00:01:46.873 --> 00:01:48.942
Geraldo had some really
helpful advice

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.944
for the congressional
black caucus.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.613
Everybody's parents teach them
manners.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.349
Manners are very simple.

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:56.783
How can you not cheer

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.286
if you're a member of the
congressional black caucus

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:03.290
for historic low black and
Latino unemployment?

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.725
-I mean.
-TV REPORTER: Of course.

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:06.226
That's an applause line.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.627
I-I don't care who says it.

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:09.496
Sure, he looks like

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.865
if Willy Wonka ran
a tanning salon,

00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.401
but he makes a great point.

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:16.470
If it's an applause line,
you applaud.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.772
So what if Donald Trump
mildly supported

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.707
some tiki torch
white nationalists.

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.477
He still said one nice thing
in his speech.

00:02:23.477 --> 00:02:25.545
Say Jack the Ripper gave

00:02:25.545 --> 00:02:27.914
a "state of the serial killer"
address, saying,

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:30.851
"sex worker wages
are on the rise."

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:34.688
The women he left alive owe him
a standing ovation.

00:02:34.688 --> 00:02:36.289
That's just good manners.

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:39.059
-Yes, yes, yes, yes.
-Right?

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:41.728
It is, it's all about manners.

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:43.230
But it doesn't stop there.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.399
Let's jump over
to Laura Ingraham,

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.969
Fox News' rich aunt
at the picnic.

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.105
She saw that
Congresswoman Maxine Waters

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.307
gave a response
to Trump's speech,

00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:56.877
and she just knew that she had
to offer a helping hand.

00:02:56.877 --> 00:02:58.679
Give us the angle, Ingraham.

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.215
BET featured a response
to the State of the Union

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:04.251
-a day after the
State of the Union. -Yeah.

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.520
Whenever he appears on TV,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.222
there should be a disclaimer
that says,

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:12.325
"This may not be acceptable
for children."

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:14.227
First of all,
was Maxine Waters--

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:17.030
did-did a child make
the backdrop for that set?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.799
-What was that?
-(laughing)

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.002
Nothing says you're seriously
engaging with someone's ideas

00:03:22.002 --> 00:03:24.337
like criticizing
their camera backdrop.

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.239
Yes, exactly.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.208
And Laura is an expert on
backdrops.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.377
Her show really captured
the feeling

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:33.814
of living inside a game of
off-brand Tetris.

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:37.084
See Maxine's crime is
she's no fun.

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:39.920
Black manners dictate that if
you want to participate

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.022
in the public discourse,
you need to be either fun,

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:44.658
or grateful, and, ideally, both.

00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:47.227
Like pre-Scientology Will Smith.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:49.729
Exactly, Jordan.

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.300
But if black people don't speak
in a humble, accessible way,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.135
the rest of America
won't hear them.

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:57.070
Just listen to Greg Gutfeld.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.840
If you look up "ally"
in the Urban Dictionary,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.375
you'll find Greg.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:04.811
He's been laser-focused
on the issue

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:07.447
of NFL players kneeling
during the national anthem.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:09.449
Now, everyone knows that started

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.451
as a protest
against police brutality,

00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:14.588
but Greg does a great job
of also not knowing it.

00:04:14.588 --> 00:04:17.090
The kneeling stuff
was poorly articulated.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.126
Nobody really knew
what it meant.

00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:20.427
It had-it had...

00:04:20.427 --> 00:04:22.062
People had to keep repeating it
over and over again,

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:23.530
and it became
a question of patriotism,

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.898
not a question of brutality.

00:04:24.898 --> 00:04:28.068
Yes, they had to say it
so many times,

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:30.971
as if no one cared to listen.

00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:33.974
And because players
weren't being articulate,

00:04:33.974 --> 00:04:36.877
the good people at Fox News
had to grab the bullhorn

00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:39.613
and tell protesters
what they're really protesting.

00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.548
(reading):

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:48.655
Kaepernick disrespects
the national anthem.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:49.956
Disrespect for the flag.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:50.991
Disrespecting our anthem.

00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:52.459
Disrespect our troops.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.861
If you listen close,
you can hear these commentators

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:57.731
beating us over the head
with the idea of disrespect.

00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:00.800
Where are the manners,
protesters?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.135
That's systemic rudeness.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.205
Yes, these protests
are just so disruptive

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:07.474
when all I'm trying to do
is have a good time

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:11.144
not considering
what they're about.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:13.780
And you should be able
to enjoy yourself.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.849
The Black Lives Matter movement
is all about

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.250
keeping black people alive,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.453
while the Black Lives? Manners!
movement is all about

00:05:20.453 --> 00:05:22.956
keeping white people
comfortable.

00:05:22.956 --> 00:05:25.125
Because if you study
American history,

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:26.760
you'll notice that white comfort

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.896
has always been more important
than black lives.

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:31.998
And Fox News knows that.

00:05:31.998 --> 00:05:34.167
So let's not rock the boat,

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.069
even if the boat
is carrying slaves

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.306
on a horrifying journey
to America.

00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:42.242
-Well, I got...
-(cheering and applause)

00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:44.477
Kobi, I... I will say...

00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:47.247
I certainly don't feel
white comfortable right now.

00:05:47.247 --> 00:05:49.015
Oh, don't worry, Jordan.

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.084
Black History Month
is practically over already.

00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:53.420
-February is basically a week.
-(laughs)

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.655
So, you-you think we can have
this whole race thing

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:56.957
-wrapped up by March?
-Oh, yes.

00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:59.593
Oh, and it's called
White March, Jordan.

00:05:59.593 --> 00:06:01.695
The month we focus on
all the great white marches

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:02.963
that will no doubt be happening

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:04.197
-in response
to Black History Month.
