00:00:00.822 --> 00:00:03.353
- [Instructor] So we've been
given the value of h of x

00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:06.348
at a few values of x, and then we're told,

00:00:06.348 --> 00:00:10.110
James said that since h
of seven minus h of three

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.825
over seven minus three is equal to one.

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:16.797
So this is really the
average rate of change

00:00:16.797 --> 00:00:19.885
between x is equal to three
and x is equal to seven,

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.741
between that point and that
point right over there.

00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:24.297
So since that is equal to one,

00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:26.921
there must be a number
c in the closed interval

00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:29.638
from three to seven for
which the derivative

00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:33.005
at that value c is equal to one.

00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:36.046
So what James is trying to do is apply

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:38.763
the Mean Value Theorem,

00:00:38.763 --> 00:00:41.642
which tells us if the conditions apply

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.616
for the Mean Value Theorem,

00:00:43.616 --> 00:00:47.699
it tells us that if I'm
going through two values,

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:52.463
so let's say this is
a, let's say this is b,

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:55.435
and let's say the function
does something like this.

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:57.943
If we meet the conditions
for the Mean Value Theorem,

00:00:57.943 --> 00:01:00.915
it tells us that there's
some c in the closed interval

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:04.677
from a to b where the
derivative of c is equal to

00:01:04.677 --> 00:01:07.347
the average rate of
change between a and b.

00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:09.344
So the average rate of
change between a and b

00:01:09.344 --> 00:01:13.511
would be the slope of the
secant line right over there,

00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:17.285
and then we could just think about well,

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:19.328
looks like there are some points.

00:01:19.328 --> 00:01:20.420
The way I've drawn it,

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.509
that point right over there
seems to have the same slope.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.318
This point right over there
seems to have the same slope.

00:01:26.318 --> 00:01:28.570
And so that's all what the
Mean Value Theorem is claiming,

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.427
that there's going to be at least one c,

00:01:30.427 --> 00:01:33.005
if we meet the conditions
for the Mean Value Theorem,

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.466
where the derivative at
that point is the same

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:38.601
as the average rate of change
from the first endpoint

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:39.808
to the second.

00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:42.432
Now what are the conditions
for the Mean Value Theorem

00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:45.404
to apply, and we've reviewed
this in multiple videos.

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:46.728
One way to think about it,

00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:48.191
if we're talking about the closed interval

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.677
from three to seven,

00:01:49.677 --> 00:01:53.462
one condition is that you
have to be differentiable,

00:01:53.462 --> 00:01:56.629
differentiable, over the open interval

00:01:58.152 --> 00:01:59.592
from three to seven.

00:01:59.592 --> 00:02:02.378
So that's the interval but
not including the endpoints.

00:02:02.378 --> 00:02:05.443
And you have to be continuous

00:02:05.443 --> 00:02:09.550
continuous over the entire closed interval

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.431
so including the endpoints.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.335
And one interesting thing
that we've mentioned before

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:15.912
is that differentiability
implies continuity.

00:02:15.912 --> 00:02:18.188
So if something is differentiable
over the open interval,

00:02:18.188 --> 00:02:21.648
it's also going to be continuous
over this open interval,

00:02:21.648 --> 00:02:24.132
and so the second condition
would just say well then we also

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:26.965
have to be continuous at the endpoints.

00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:28.614
Now let's look at the answers.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:31.493
So it says which condition
makes James's claim true?

00:02:31.493 --> 00:02:33.838
So we have to feel good
about these two things

00:02:33.838 --> 00:02:36.857
right over here in order
to make James's claim.

00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:41.036
Choice A, h is continuous
over the closed interval

00:02:41.036 --> 00:02:43.126
from three to seven.

00:02:43.126 --> 00:02:46.145
So that does meet this second condition,

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:49.094
but continuity does not
imply differentiability.

00:02:49.094 --> 00:02:50.510
So that doesn't give us the confidence

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.971
that we're differentiable
over the open interval.

00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:54.527
If you're differentiable
you're continuous,

00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:55.758
but if you're continuous

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:57.546
you're not necessarily differentiable.

00:02:57.546 --> 00:03:00.750
Classic example of that is
if we have a sharp turn,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.888
something like that,

00:03:01.888 --> 00:03:03.560
we wouldn't be
differentiable at that point

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.207
even though we are continuous there.

00:03:06.207 --> 00:03:08.389
So let me rule that one out.

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.224
I'm gonna rule that one out.

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:13.557
Choice B, h is continuous and decreasing

00:03:14.427 --> 00:03:18.177
over the closed interval
from three to seven.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.021
Now that doesn't help us either

00:03:21.021 --> 00:03:23.482
because it still doesn't
mean you're differentiable.

00:03:23.482 --> 00:03:26.501
You could be continuous
and then decreasing

00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:27.894
and still have one of these sharp turns

00:03:27.894 --> 00:03:29.705
where you're not differentiable.

00:03:29.705 --> 00:03:32.910
So we will rule this one out.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.255
H is differentiable
over the closed interval

00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:37.043
from three to seven.

00:03:37.043 --> 00:03:38.273
This one feels good

00:03:38.273 --> 00:03:40.572
because if you're differentiable
over the closed interval,

00:03:40.572 --> 00:03:42.082
you're definitely gonna be differentiable

00:03:42.082 --> 00:03:44.868
over the open interval that
does not include the endpoints.

00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:47.422
This is a subset of this right over here.

00:03:47.422 --> 00:03:49.303
And if you're differentiable
over a closed interval,

00:03:49.303 --> 00:03:50.882
you're gonna be continuous over it.

00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:53.227
Differentiability implies continuity.

00:03:53.227 --> 00:03:56.501
So I like this choice right over here.

00:03:56.501 --> 00:04:00.216
Now this last choice says the
limit as x approaches five

00:04:00.216 --> 00:04:03.133
of h prime of x is equal to one.

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:08.436
So they're saying the
limit of our derivative

00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:11.436
as we approach five is equal to one.

00:04:14.172 --> 00:04:16.052
Now that doesn't, we don't know for sure,

00:04:16.052 --> 00:04:17.515
this limit might be true,

00:04:17.515 --> 00:04:19.350
but that still does not necessarily imply

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.554
that h prime of five is equal to one.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:24.551
We sill don't know that.

00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:26.107
And you know five is in this interval,

00:04:26.107 --> 00:04:28.823
but we still don't know just
from this statement alone

00:04:28.823 --> 00:04:31.912
that there is definitely
some c in the interval

00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:34.907
whose derivative is the same
as the average rate of change

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.741
over the interval.

00:04:36.741 --> 00:04:39.824
So I would rule this one out as well.
