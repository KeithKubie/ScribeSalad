00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.230
This situation is reminiscent of
the network of specialized suppliers to

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.380
a manufacturing company.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.260
One makes seats, but

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.450
not radiators, while another
makes dashboards, but not tires.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.360
But somehow it all comes together
seamlessly to produce a great car,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.510
those industries long ago recognized the
need for automation to help coordinate

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:28.030
their supplier network starting with
the automobile industry in the 1980s.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.369
Until very recently, and this really
only started to change as a result of

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.510
the federal programs we'll
discuss in this lesson.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.610
The healthcare industry
tried to operate its complex

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.850
care network using paper records and
fax machines.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.686
Name an example of a specific,
non-healthcare,

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:49.810
non-automotive corporate success story

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.620
in using information technology to
manage a complex logistics network.
