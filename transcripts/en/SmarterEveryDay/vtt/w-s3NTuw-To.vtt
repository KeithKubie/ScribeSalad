Okay so Wayne asked me if he could have a fire at my house,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.040
and I said yes, and then he shows up with like, a truck,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.090
with speakers or subs or something, and then there's kids like chopping stuff up...

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.110
with an axe, and they're throwing stuff

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.140
in a fire. I don't know. I don't know.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.190
And just move the camera to whatever I'm pointing out okay? Alright? Okay?

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.230
Hey it's me Destin welcome to Smarter Every Day. We're gonna talk about something called group sourcing.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.260
[music]

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.280
Group sourcing is when you have a large group of easily influenced people...

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.290
Yeah, easily influenced people with cameras, and we're gonna

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.330
do a rocket on a rope, and the rocket on a rope is gonna fly down

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.840
and we're gonna have gasoline on the target and it's going to light the bonfire maybe.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.880
It's either gonna do that, or we are going to look really stupid.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.920
So what's gonna happen right now is all you have cell phones with cameras on them right?

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.010
Everybody turn to horizontal mode, horizontal mode. And then what I want you to do is

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.050
get in an arc around the fire on the back side.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.070
And then what we're gonna do is something called bullet time.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.080
What bullet time is, is you're gonna give me all your videos after the fact, and we're gonna

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.120
shoot the rocket and it's gonna blow up the fire, and then I'm gonna take

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.140
all your videos and stitch them together and it's gonna look like The Matrix.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.580
Back up a little bit so you don't catch on fire, with your face.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.230
- Dan the rocket will blast off.
(Dan) Then what happens?
- I don't know!

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.270
(Dan) You don't know?
(Destin) If you're expecting an explosion I'm sorry it's not gonna happen.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.310
This is gonna be kind of girly a little bit. It's a really old rocket so

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.340
they might not work.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.400
[laughter]

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.410
[cheering]
(Destin) So did you get it?

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.460
So now what we gotta do is figure out how to give me all of your video files.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.470
So obviously the first challenge I had to overcome

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.480
is these videos did not kick on at the exact same time so I had to synchronize that by

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.530
looking at the fireball or listening to the audio and lining them up. The next thing I had to do

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.590
is I had to arrange them spatially as they were positioned around the bonfire.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.600
Click on any of these videos and go to that person's perspective to see what their

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.640
reaction was to the fireball. Everybody with low resolution phones and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.770
high resolution phones tended to group together. What does that tell us about the group?

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.810
Alright hold on, here we go.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.170
That's awesome. Alright so here's what we did. We took this information

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.190
and we stitched it together to see what I could do with it. The first thing I decided to do

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.240
is to re-watch the video in real time but do it by scrolling through the different perspectives and

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.260
spin around the fire.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.050
So after that I decided to try my hand

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.990
at bullet time.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.690
So yeah I know, it looks pretty bad, but if you think about it we had 30 seconds of

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.730
instructions for a large group of amateur videographers who were able to accomplish

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.780
something pretty cool. What did we learn? First of all the radial distance from the object

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.820
that you're looking at is important. Pull a string and get everybody on the same distance.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.840
Secondly the angular spacing. It'd be great if you could pace that off beforehand.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.880
Third, it's important that you use the same devices all throughout because different devices react to brightness

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.910
levels and white balance differently. So if I'm honest this is the part of the video where I provide

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.970
links to other stuff on my channel in hopes that you'll check it out and subscribe. But, there's a cool unofficial

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.020
holiday in the UK set around bonfires at Periodic Videos. Feel free to check that out.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.040
I'm Destin, thank you for watching. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one.
