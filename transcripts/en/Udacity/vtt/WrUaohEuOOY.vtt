00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.133
believed that attachment was based on how a parent interacted with the child.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
If the parent was secure and warm towards the child, then the child would have

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
a secure attachment. If the parent was anxious or avoidant, then the child

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.066
would have that same type of attachment. However, recent research shows that

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
this is an over simplification. Children are born with a biologically based

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
temperament. Some are really easy going, others might get distressed really

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
easily. It's temperament that interacts with parenting style, and that creates

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.133
attachment style.
