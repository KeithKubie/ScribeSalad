00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm here at the Davos summit and
have followed meetings and

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.910
followed conversation.
Of course, one of the big topics of the discussion

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.349
here is how do we
create a safer banking system?

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.730
And what has created a lot of interest is
what the President of the

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:22.020
United States, Obama, has said about both
limiting sort of the riskiest

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.750
activities that retail bank undertake like
large-scale proprietary

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.809
trading.
And also looking at the idea going forward

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:35.340
of a banking levy to better
protect taxpayers against the instances of

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.410
banks getting into trouble.
Now both these ideas are ideas that myself

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.400
and the British Conservative
Party are very interested in, we'd like to

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.970
see this done
internationally.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.580
This is an international banking industry
and talking to people here at

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.980
Davos, both officials and politicians, you
get the sense that there is

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.270
quite a lot of support for this.
It's a big challenge.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.480
How do we have successful financial services
for as many thousands of

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.170
people, make sure Britain remains a great
center of global financial

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.830
services while at the same time protecting
the British State and making

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.910
sure that the banking customers is serving
its customers instead of

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.470
serving the businesses and it's spent on its
credit.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.580
So lots of interesting discussions.
I feel that what the British Conservative

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.380
Party has set out is the
right direction.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.000
It's certainly with the mainstream of thinking
here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.490
And I look forward to -- I've got one more
day left, seeing what the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.230
people have to say about this.
