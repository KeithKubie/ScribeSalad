1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,240
You know, something I realized, so as
Lafe and I had been talking about why you,

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:05,730
we wrote the book, the
Dichotomy of leadership,

3
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:10,731
why we picked that topic and what we've
been saying is most of the questions

4
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:14,430
that we would get asked would be
about that iconomy leadership.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,380
That's completely true. But I'll tell
you on top of that, more important,

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,160
most of the answers that I give are that
there is a dichotomy in leadership and

7
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:29,610
you needed to be balanced. That is what
you, even today I got asked at Camp,

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,500
Hey Jocko, I'm a white belt, but
I want to be default aggressive.

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,970
But I also hear you telling me to
relax all the time. Which one is it?

10
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,920
What do you want me to do? Should I be
default aggressive and get after it?

11
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:46,560
Yeah. Or You tell me relax.
And I actually, you know,

12
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:51,330
I say relax harder, right? Charter,
which one do you want me to do?

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,610
And I said, well luckily, and
lives there too. I'm like left.

14
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,450
Luckily for this very reason Lafe and I
just wrote a book called the dichotomy

15
00:00:57,451 --> 00:00:59,400
of leadership. And there's
a dichotomy with aggression.

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,960
Even though I say default
aggressive, and I say you've got,

17
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,000
that's gotta be your mindset.

18
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:04,950
That's gotta be your default mode as
you're going to be aggressive and you're

19
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:05,784
going to go get after it.

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,170
And there's a chapter in the book that
doesn't mean that you run to your death,

21
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:14,310
right. You have to balance
that with caution with,

22
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,310
with energy conservation,

23
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,980
with not wasting movement on the mat,

24
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:24,090
with not wasting capital in
business without burning bridges.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,710
Like all those things, you have to be
balanced. And that's why I think like you,

26
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,330
and that's a great way of
putting it. It's going to,

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,890
it's going to recalibrate
and fix your brain. Yes.

28
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,620
I've had a lot of these conversations
with be little, you know. OK. Uh,

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,600
because something, cause he's, he's a
different beast than I am. I'm pretty,

30
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:47,010
I'm pretty passive. Like, like
do your job, do it, right.

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,310
Like I'll help anywhere I can. And, and
that's just in general, right? Like,

32
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,200
I'm, I'm there, like I'm there, I'm always
on contact me anytime a day in some,

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,800
in some. And so be littles in, uh, in a
leadership position sometimes be like,

34
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:03,990
Jocko says, you ever get
that? Jocko says, oh yeah.

35
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,540
So the Jocko says thing in, you know,

36
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,870
Junko says default
aggressive Jocko says this.

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,410
And the idea isn't that in your
brain you're thinking Jocko says the,

38
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,910
the idea is that you, you,
you rewire your brain.

39
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,950
So that innately your saying something
and not thinking about what Jocko would

40
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:30,120
say, you know, you want to make it
your own. And that's a real ownership.

41
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:31,500
And we were talking about
a little a little bit ago,

42
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,050
real ownership is that
you're not just saying it,

43
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,980
but you're understanding what you're
saying and why you're saying it and the

44
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:42,930
words are coming not as a game, but as
truth because that's what you believe.

45
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,510
And that I think takes
a long time for people.

46
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,220
I thought where you're going
with the Jocko says is when,

47
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,890
when the subordinate uses your name
to make something happen. Right?

48
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,470
Well exactly, exactly.
Hey, well, hey Giacosa,

49
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,090
this is where we're going to do things.
And it's like, okay, well that's not,

50
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:05,020
why do you need to say that? That's
the same as saying I outrank you.

51
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,810
That's the same as ankle. Look.
Exactly. Rank you. Yeah, and just do it.

52
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,330
We're going to do it. Yeah. Hey
Jocko said that's what he wants.

53
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,610
It doesn't make any sense.
Jocko said that's what he wants.

54
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,920
Like you can't do that. You can't do that.

55
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:18,220
You can't use your boss's
name as your authority. Right.

56
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,250
If what your boss has told you to make
happen doesn't make sense and you can't

57
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:26,380
explain why it makes sense and you need
to go to back to your boss and say,

58
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,030
Hey boss, I'm having some trouble here.

59
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:29,740
Can you explain to me why
we're doing it this way?

60
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,500
So I can explain that down the
chain of command to the troops.

61
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:34,030
They know what's going
on in the field and,

62
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,720
and you know what else is real important
and valuable that I think I took away

63
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:43,050
this year is like the 70
30 the 80 20 the 90 10

64
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,890
if, if,

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,000
if there's a decision that
needs to be made and, and

66
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,270
yeah,

67
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,280
someone else's 70% there.

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,390
And you're the leader and in
your mind you're 90% there.

69
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,150
What do you do? Yup. All Day long. Pick
that up. Set a Saturday set or set.

70
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,030
Yeah. And that has been
a hard lesson for me.
