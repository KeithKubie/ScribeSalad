00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:11.680
*Disneycember theme*

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.400
I've been introduced to a lot of interesting kid's shows over the years

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.860
Adventure Time, Gravity Falls, Steven Universe

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.160
But somehow, Phineas and Ferb has missed my eye.

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:24.455
I do see people dress up like them at cons,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.073
and even some kids wearing T-shirts and stuff but-

00:00:27.073 --> 00:00:27.805
I really don't

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:29.380
have any Idea of what the show's about.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.240
Just that people think it's good and getting a bit of a following.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.440
Well, after seeing 'Phineas and Ferb across the 2nd Dimension'

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.100
I can definitely see why.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.040
This is definitely a strange but highly entertaining idea.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.520
The plot of the show, if read the movie correctly is that

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.500
two boys named Phineas and Ferb go on wild anventures

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.180
with their pet Perry, a platypus.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.460
And yet somehow have no idea that they're going on these wild adventures.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.840
because Perry keeps his secret identity of a secret agent a secret.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.160
Their sister Candace always try to get them in trouble but the mother never sees what they're up to.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.240
Well this time things are a little different

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.500
As Dr. Doof, Perry's arch nemesis creates a device

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.060
that can go into parallel dimensions where he actually is incredibly powerful and has taken over the world.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.540
Of course when that successful Dr. Doof finds out about the device.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.200
He wants to use it to take over even more dimensions.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.300
Starting with the one Phineas and Ferb are from.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.900
But in order to save them Perry has to revel his secret identity.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.020
This creates a riff in there friendship and they don't know if they can ever trust one another again.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.335
And things get even crazier when they meet themselves in the parallel dimensions

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.580
Find their usually the opposite.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.960
And try to utilize their strengthens and weaknesses

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.180
to work together and stop the evil takeover.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.520
The best way I can describe this movie is think:

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.400
Kim Possible meets Rick and Morty for kids.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.560
But still a funny Rick and Morty.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.460
The humor is very fast, very strange, and very visual.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.540
Even though not every joke gets a hard laugh

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.940
they keep throwing them at you so quickly that you forget the ones you didn't laugh at

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.880
are just having so much fun with the ones you are.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.640
Even though I've never seen an episode of the show. I can quickly figure out what the running jokes are.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.740
Perry never talks, Ferb usually doesn't talks,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.580
Phineas is optimistically naive,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.100
and the parents never figure out what going on.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.980
With the sister getting more and more angry.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.920
With that said I do feel theres a couple of things I would probably enjoy more if I watched the show.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.240
For example in the last third all these other animal critters show up

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.420
and I don't really know who they are but I'm sure they were in  the shows.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.320
Theres also all these strange robots and inventions that come out of no where

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.335
and they look so well design

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.720
they must have been from the series.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm assuming everyone of these creations probably had there own episode and there

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.500
all coming together here.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.780
Which for a fan would be a really really big deal.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.440
Heck Perry reviling his true identity is a big deal.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.100
But for someone who hasn't seen the show it's still pretty entertaining.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.180
There nice if not simple characters

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.480
living in a very bizarre and surreal world.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.960
At first I was kind of thrown off by the animation

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.340
I don't know something about the designs are really weird.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.100
Are they suppose to be shaped like the first letters of their names.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.260
But in the last third the action scenes are amazing.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.980
Look at how quick they are look at how smooth it is.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.620
Its just one crazy energized thing after another crazy energized thing.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.720
And it never lets up it just keeps going and going and going and its a ton of fun.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.660
So yeah i feel like I would like this movie a lot more if I did watched the show.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.960
But at the same time it does encourage me to go and watch the show.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.440
It's seem really cute, creative, and funny all at the same time.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.400
Definitely something I wouldn't mind checking out.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.040
So whether you're a fan the show or a complete new comer,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.780
slap on you fedora for secret agent craziness.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:35.520
