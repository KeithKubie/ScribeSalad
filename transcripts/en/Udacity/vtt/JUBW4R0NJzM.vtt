00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.490
But we know the first part of the

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.100
answer because that sequence hasn't changed. We know

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.620
it's going to be QA for glutamene and alamine.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.290
But then what's going to happen here? Instead of CTT,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.460
we're going to get CCT. Where's CCU in the genetic

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.780
code? And CCU codes for P or Proline, PRO.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.450
Well lets go to the next one, well now look what's happened, we've shifted and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.680
this T here now goes into the next corner so we

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.716
get TGA, we come to the generic code and we find that

00:00:32.716 --> 00:00:37.280
a TGA codes for nothing, its a stop code on, so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.120
that means protein synthesis ends, no

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.657
more translation, done, stop, finito, right,

00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:42.580
[FOREIGN].

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.350
All we get are these three amino acids right here.
