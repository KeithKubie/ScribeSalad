00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, we suspect the drug doesn't work as well as advertised, here is the hard question.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Where does the credibility region end?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Put differently, what is the largest number of healthy people

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
in the critical region or that define the critical region?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What's the largest number of healthy people out of the 10 where you'd be suspicious

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and you wouldn't be 95% confident using our 95/5% confidence threshold.

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You'd really reject the claim made by the manufacturer of this drug.
