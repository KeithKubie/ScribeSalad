1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.680
Well,
there's movies like that too,
right?

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.770
There's movies about really important subjects that are terrible movies.

3
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.173
Like how many

4
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.370
caused me to think that it's are really,

5
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:15.870
really important subject.
It probably is a terrible movie.
Yeah,
most likely.

6
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.580
Why do I think that?
Right?
Well,

7
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:21.270
there's no way to really get an important subject and boil it down to two hours.

8
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.200
Oh,
I didn't think of that.
I mean,
give me two hours

9
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.490
and employ your right jacket.
Yeah,
I mean,
especially like,

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.390
one thing that drives me crazy is when they take liberties with someone's

11
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:34.230
biography,

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.740
like if they would do a biography on someone's life and they change things

13
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:42.510
around or add things to it for theatrical flair.
Is She the Queen Movie?

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.900
No,
I did not see it yet.
I haven't seen it either.
I heard it's very good though.

15
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.850
You heard it's very good.
Did you ask the person who told you that why it's good?

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.140
Um,
yes.
Yes.
And what did they share?
They said the,
first of all,

17
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:58.140
the guy who plays Freddie Mercury apparently is brilliant in it.

18
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:01.770
And it said they,
Shane originally had they seen Freddie lies?
No,
not live.

19
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.330
I saw Freddy live at the forum.

20
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:08.331
I was in the maybe 20th row six in when Bohemian rhapsody had just come out.

21
00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.100
Oh my goodness.
Yeah.
I saw him in his absolute,
that is major,
major prime there.

22
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.240
So I'm very curious as to,
well stage craft is one thing,

23
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:22.890
but what Freddie was and what he brought was way more than what you saw on
stage.

24
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.930
Yeah.
Yeah.
Fella.
What was he bringing?
Well,

25
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.440
his sensibilities in terms of music weren't just three core origin and attitude.

26
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.260
And they'll fall for that shit either.
If Keith ever sits here and tries,

27
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:41.160
that shit is all wrong.
You just need three,

28
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.650
three goals in an attitude.
Yeah.

29
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.890
And you need to know the inversions of each one.

30
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:49.320
All seven modal and fuck you Keith,

31
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.460
because he does know all those and the trick tunings and whatever.
Um,

32
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.510
Freddy brought a whole wealth of listening to different kinds of music,

33
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.040
whether it was orchestral big band,
Bistro you mean?

34
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.500
Nah,
that's bestrode uh,

35
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.960
uh,
what do you call it?
Music,
music,
music,

36
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:17.640
that small,
uh,
something you might hear in a coffee shop in France.

37
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.030
Well,
his music was so different.

38
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.500
His singing was so different than anything else from his era.
But you listen to,

39
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:30.300
we are the champions.
He didn't try to sing black.
Okay.

40
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.440
Sang Freddie Mercury.

41
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.180
We Shang European nonblack what?

42
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:38.550
We're very used to,
even in country.

43
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.130
I had a very famous black producer,
African American producer,
shading me,

44
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:44.964
David Lee.

45
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.310
Do you know what it means to be a black man in the United States today?
Hash.

46
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.100
Every time I step up to the mic,
I try.

47
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.050
That's what I grew up with.

48
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.710
Trying to sound like meltdown and trying to sound like Wilson Pickett.

49
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.170
Try to sound like an on and on that,

50
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.090
that you know that voter block had such an impact on music,

51
00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:08.330
much less the overall culture.
Right.
