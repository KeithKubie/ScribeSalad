00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.600
Your brain is sabotaging you all the time!

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.990
WHO CAN WE EVEN TRUST?

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.480
Anthony here for DNews and your brain is built
around survival in a harsh, unforgiving environment.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.770
Unfortunately, those survival loops can cause
us some harm in our safer, smarter modern

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.770
world.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.840
Here are 3 things your gray matter is a little
too black and white about.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.060
Have you ever kept watching a show, week after
week, even though you don't like it?

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.130
Or finished eating a meal at a restaurant
even though you were full because you already

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.420
paid and you didn't want the money to go to
waste?

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.780
That's the Sunk Cost Fallacy That food was
already made for you.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.730
It's as wasted as it's gonna get the moment
it hits the table.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.249
You don't like that show, watching more hours
of it doesn't make those other hours less

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:45.249
wasted.

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:50.430
On a larger scale, it can cause bad investments
and keep people in the wrong relationships.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.339
Whyyyyy, brain?

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.030
Because in order to survive, early humans
had to prioritize loss.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.489
Losing a home, food, a mate could mean death.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.329
Not losing is more important to us than gaining.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.750
Sunk cost takes place in the lateral front
and parietal cortices, which are involved

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.280
in risk-taking and aversion.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.510
When we're losing, our brain only thinks in
terms of saving the situation, not what's

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.580
best for us.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.750
On the flipside is something called optimism
bias.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.290
No matter what the odds of something bad happening
are, we tend to believe it's less likely to

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.140
happen to us personally.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.921
Divorce rates in the US are 40%, but newlyweds
rate their likelihood of divorce at 0%- even

00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.200
if they're divorce lawyers.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.770
Smokers think cancer is less likely to happen
to them, people think unprotected sex can

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.890
result in pregnancy and infection- but probably
not to them if they do it this once.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.310
I won't get alzheimer's, I won't get mugged.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.820
What the what, brain?

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.740
Specifically, what the what, inferior frontal
gyrus?

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.550
THAT'S IRRESPONSIBLE.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.600
But optimism's linked to knowledge of our
future- if we're smart enough to picture a

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.780
happy life, we're smart enough to picture
death.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.950
And constantly thinking about death and failure
doesn't sound like the behavior of a growing,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.590
thriving species- so people who are hopeful
survived in our early history and helped us

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.629
reach all the great achievements we have.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.560
We also know that stress has negative physical
effects on the body- so optimists make for

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.180
healthier, longer living humans.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.709
Finally, let's talk about one that I'm always
trying to avoid- but I'm never sure if I'm

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.980
doing a good enough job.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.670
Confirmation bias.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.719
We hang out with friends who have similar
interests.

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:27.319
We read news from sites that agree with us.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.250
We have a sense of beliefs that defines who
we are- and we tend to only seek out or information

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.049
that aligns with those beliefs.

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.989
Other stuff just doesn't hold our interests.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.349
A 2009 Ohio State University study says we'll
spend 36% more time reading an essay that

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.250
aligns with our opinions.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.459
It's more pattern recognition- teaming up
with the like-minded meant a stress-free survival

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.749
in early society.

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:54.579
But it's bad when it's applied to news, media,
research, or politics.

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.579
Because if you just keep confirming your own
thoughts instead of seeking out full truth

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.719
of something, you actually wind up less intelligent.

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:05.340
So how do you avoid this stuff?

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.389
Well, short of transcranial magnetic stimulation
to your brain, the best thing you can do is

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.599
be aware of it and try to question yourself.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.330
Have you ever caught yourself doing one of
these things?

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.689
