Hi, I’m Indya and I’m here to show you
how to make sure you’re immunization compliant

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:11.930
in time for registration.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.570
It’s an easy four-step process.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.840
Step One: Make sure you have a signed and
verified immunization record.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.119
If you don’t, start by logging into OPUS
with your Emory Net ID username and password

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.859
at O-P-U-S dot Emory dot E-D-U.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.550
Click on the tasks tile to see your personal
“To-Dos List.”

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.820
Look for your immunization related to-dos,
follow the links to the Student Health Patient

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.300
Portal.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.870
Sign in with your Emory Net ID and password
again.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.370
Click on the immunization form link listed
on the Emory Patient Portal home page.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.440
Download and print your school-specific immunization
form.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.829
Have your doctor complete and sign it.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:00.829
Keep the signed form handy!

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.190
You’ll need it later for step three.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.400
Step Two: Complete the tuberculosis questionnaire.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.229
Go back to the Emory Patient Portal home page.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:22.009
Click on the tuberculosis questionnaire link
and fill it out.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.210
Step Three: Enter your immunization dates
online.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.310
Return to the Emory Patient Portal home page.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.759
Click on the Immunizations Form link.

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:42.100
Scroll down and enter all your immunization
dates.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.100
Hit “Submit.”

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.100
OK.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.490
You’re almost done!

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.700
Step Four: Upload your signed and verified
immunization records.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.969
Go to the bottom of the immunization form
where you hit submit to upload a healthcare-provider

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:06.859
signed and verified copy of your immunization
record.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.970
Once Emory Student Health has verified your
records, OPUS will remove immunization tasks

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.500
from your to-do list and you’ll be immunization
compliant.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.250
Verification can take up to five business
days, so plan accordingly!

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.390
Visit student health dot Emory dot E-D-U for
more information on being immunization compliant.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.220
Thank you for doing your part in keeping the
Emory community healthy, and helping every

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.200
student be well and excel.
