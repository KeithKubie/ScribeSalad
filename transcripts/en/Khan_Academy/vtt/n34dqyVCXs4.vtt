00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.200
f of x is equal to 9 minus x.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.620
Actually, it should
be 9 minus x squared.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.080
And g of x is equal to 5x
squared plus 2x plus 1.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.090
And then they say
find f plus g of x.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.590
And this looks a
little bit bizarre.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.190
What kind of notation is this?

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.980
And that's really the
core of this problem

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.830
is just to realize that
when someone writes

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.300
f plus g in parentheses like
this of x this is just notation

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.120
for-- so f plus g of
x, I just rewrote it.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.430
This is the same thing.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.830
This is just a kind
of shorthand notation

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.760
for f of x plus g of x.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.890
You could view f plus g
as a new function that's

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.744
created by adding the
other two functions.

00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:44.410
But when you view it
like this-- so this

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.890
is really what we have to find.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.190
Then, you just have to
add these two functions.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.320
So f of x, they've given the
definition right over there,

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.675
is 9 minus x squared.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.540
And g of x, they've given the
definition right over here,

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.450
is 5x squared plus 2x plus 1.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.369
So when you add
f of x to g of x,

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.160
this is going to be
equal to-- and I'm just

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.159
rewriting a lot of things
just to make it clear.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.670
The f of x part is
9 minus x squared.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.740
And then you have the plus.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.070
I'll do that in yellow.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.410
Plus the g of x part, which
is 5x squared plus 2x plus 1.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.010
And now we can just
simplify this a little bit.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.526
We can say-- let me just
get rid of the parentheses.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:34.400
I'll just rewrite it.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.050
So this is equal to
9 minus x squared

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.961
plus-- since this
is a positive, we

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:43.710
don't have to worry
about the parentheses.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.910
So plus 5x squared
plus 2x plus 1.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.020
And then we have two x squared
terms or second degree terms.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.620
We have 5x squared.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.300
And then we have
negative x squared.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.470
5x squared minus x
squared is 4x squared.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.090
So you get 4x squared when
you combine these two terms.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.630
You only have one first degree
term 2x there, so plus 2x.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.220
And then you have two constant
terms, or 0 degree terms.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.210
So you have the 9
and you have the 1.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.350
And 9 plus 1 gets us to 10.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.512
So we're done.

00:02:19.512 --> 00:02:25.600
f plus g of x is equal to
4x squared plus 2x plus 10.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.430
Notice this is a
new function that's

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.700
created by summing the function
definitions of f and g.
