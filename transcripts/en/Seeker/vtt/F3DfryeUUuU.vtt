00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.380
What’s your dream car?

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.660
Something fast?

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.660
Sleek?

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.660
Fuel efficient?

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.500
Mine is all those, and it runs on saltwater.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.550
Sound ridiculous?

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.950
Well my dream car may be closer to reality
than you think.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.190
Hello gearheads and geeks alike, I’m Julian
for DNews and I have a tasty treat for both

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.190
of you.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:23.440
The car is unquestionably one of the most
important inventions ever.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.740
It’s made transportation available to the
masses and independence available to teenagers.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.160
Most of our daily lives aren’t possible
without one.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.159
But the car as we know it has some huge challenges
looming over it in the not-so-distant future.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.550
First there’s the problem of what goes into
it.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.030
Gasoline is an oil product, and oil isn’t
renewable in any way.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.670
It’s a resource that will one day be too
scare to meet demands, and while sources disagree

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.589
on when that’s going to be exactly, it’s
likely going to be within my lifetime.

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.719
Even if gasoline is replaced with ethanol
from renewable sources, there’s still the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.659
issue of what comes out of the internal combustion
engine: Carbon Dioxide.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:04.920
CO2 is the most common greenhouse gas and
in the US, 32% of that comes from transportation.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.770
So our cars, while useful, are not sustainable
and are contributing almost a third of the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.829
CO2 that’s destabilizing out climate.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.460
There has to be a better way.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.859
Electric cars look to be that way.

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:17.219
They allow us to still be mobile and independent,
but there are hidden caveats.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.380
Battery powered cars take a long time to charge
when they run out of juice.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.310
Instead of a 5 minute fill up, drained batteries
of electric cars can take one to eight hours,

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.229
depending on the kind of car and charging
station.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.329
Fast charging can cut that time to 30 minutes,
but if you do that all the time the battery

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.460
could be ruined in three years and replacements
will likely cost thousands.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.530
And don’t forget that that electricity has
to come from somewhere, and in the US, that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.969
somewhere is likely a coal power plant.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:45.689
Electricity production is the only source
of CO2 bigger than transportation.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.850
But electric motors can be powered by other
means.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.569
Liquid hydrogen, when recombined with oxygen,
can be used to generate an electric current

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.469
and the only waste product is dihydrogen monoxide.

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.069
More commonly called water.

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.740
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the
universe, so we probably aren’t going to

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.740
run out.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.060
And delivering it in liquid form means you
preserve the splash and dash ability gas cars

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.060
enjoy.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.069
But to keep hydrogen in a liquid state, it
has to be stored at high pressure.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.819
This raises issues of safety, and we as a
species already have to be reminded not to

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.680
light a cigarette at gas stations.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.019
Now however there’s a third option.

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.900
German company Nanoflowcell debuted their
QUANT e-sportlimousine at the geneva motor

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.989
show this year and it’s goal is to be the
first saltwater powered production car…

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.530
in the world.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.290
The QUANT e-sportlimousine has two tanks of
liquids with dissolved metallic salts that

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.989
give them opposite charges.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.980
These are pumped through a membrane and the
process of recombining them generates electricity.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.709
Nanoflowcell claims one fill up is good for
over 300 miles.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.400
That’s surprisingly… car-like.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.180
Though the combined volume of the tanks is
over 3 times that of a large SUV, so fill

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.760
ups will take longer, but certainly not hours.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.220
And without the hazards of liquid hydrogen
or gasoline.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.040
More than that, the QUANT e-sportlimousine,
despite its ridiculous name, is quite a handsome

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.040
thing.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.049
And the company promises performance figures
like 0-60 in 2.8 seconds and a top speed of

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:07.860
over 200 miles per hour.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.629
And best of all, it’s just been approved
for testing on european roads.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.550
Personally, I couldn’t care if it looked
like an ugly christmas sweater and made fun

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.030
of my ears; if there’s a car that can run
on saltwater with no emissions, I want one

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.040
yesterday.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.840
Cutting edge electronics are awesome in all
forms, and another cool new tech you’ll

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.590
probably seeing a lot more of is wireless
charging.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.519
If you want to learn the science behind it,
Trace has you covered with this video here.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.800
What do you think will be the next big transportation
innovation?

Let us know down below.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.329
And don’t forget to subscribe…

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.709
I couldn’t think of a rhyme for that one.

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.459
Thanks for watching!
