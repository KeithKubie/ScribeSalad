00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:08.120
To understand climate change,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.844
think of the game "Tetris."

00:00:09.844 --> 00:00:14.262
For eons, Earth has played a version of this game with blocks of carbon.

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:17.797
They enter the atmosphere as carbon dioxide gas from volcanoes,

00:00:17.797 --> 00:00:19.343
decaying plant matter,

00:00:19.343 --> 00:00:20.510
breathing creatures

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.968
and the surface of the sea.

00:00:21.968 --> 00:00:25.888
And they leave the atmosphere when they're used by plants during photosynthesis,

00:00:25.888 --> 00:00:27.512
absorbed back into the ocean,

00:00:27.512 --> 00:00:29.677
or stored in soil and sediment.

00:00:29.677 --> 00:00:32.179
This game of Tetris is called the carbon cycle,

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.682
and it's the engine of life on Earth.

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:36.761
What's the connection to climate?

00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:39.177
Well, when that carbon dioxide is in the air,

00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:40.820
waiting to be reabsorbed,

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.705
it traps a portion of the sun's heat,

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:44.844
which would otherwise escape to space.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:47.786
That's why carbon dioxide is called a greenhouse gas.

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:49.579
It creates a blanket of warmth,

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.261
known as the greenhouse effect,

00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.929
that keeps our Earth from freezing like Mars.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.793
The more carbon dioxide blocks hang out in the atmosphere waiting to be cleared,

00:00:57.793 --> 00:00:59.796
the warmer Earth becomes.

00:00:59.796 --> 00:01:01.881
Though the amount of carbon in the atmosphere

00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:05.013
has varied through ice ages and astroid impacts,

00:01:05.013 --> 00:01:09.262
over the past 8,000 years the stable climate we know took shape,

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:12.141
allowing human civilization to thrive.

00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:14.145
But about 200 years ago,

00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:17.511
we began digging up that old carbon that had been stored in the soil.

00:01:17.511 --> 00:01:20.845
These fossil fuels, coal, oil and natural gas

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:23.697
are made from the buried remains of plants and animals

00:01:23.697 --> 00:01:26.782
that died long before humans evolved.

00:01:26.782 --> 00:01:29.179
The energy stored inside them was able to power

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.871
our factories, cars and power plants.

00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:37.042
But burning these fuels also injected new carbon blocks into Earth's Tetris game.

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:39.845
At the same time, we cleared forests for agriculture,

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:43.466
reducing the Earth's ability to remove the blocks.

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:46.730
And since 1750, the amount of carbon in the atmosophere

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.761
has increased by 40%,

00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:50.928
and shows no sign of slowing.

00:01:50.928 --> 00:01:53.761
Just like in Tetris, the more blocks pile up,

00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.736
the harder it becomes to restore stability.

00:01:56.736 --> 00:01:58.928
The extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:00.925
accelerates the greenhouse effect

00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:03.109
by trapping more heat near the surface

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:05.823
and causing polar ice caps to melt.

00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:09.032
And the more they melt, the less sunlight they're able to reflect,

00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:12.009
making the oceans warm even faster.

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:15.540
Sea levels rise, coastal populations are threatened with flooding,

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.841
natural ecosystems are disrupted,

00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:21.425
and the weather becomes more extreme over time.

00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:25.005
Climate change may effect different people and places in different ways.

00:02:25.005 --> 00:02:28.552
But, ultimately, it's a game that we're all stuck playing.

00:02:28.552 --> 00:02:30.053
And unlike in Tetris,

00:02:30.053 --> 00:02:32.975
we won't get a chance to start over and try again.
