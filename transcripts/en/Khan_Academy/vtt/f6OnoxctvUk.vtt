00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.580
Our goal is to simplify this
expression for the squared

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.740
error between those n points.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.960
Just to remind ourselves
what we're doing, we

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.420
have these n points.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.470
And we're taking the sum of the
squared error between each

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.930
of those n points and
our actual line, y

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.620
equals mx plus b.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.720
And we get this expression over
here, which we've been

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.720
simplifying over the
last couple videos.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.190
We're going to try
to simplify this

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.570
expression as much as possible.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.940
And then, we're going to
try to to minimize this

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.620
expression.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.740
Or find the m and b values
that minimize it.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.790
Or I guess you could call it
the best fitting line.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.835
Now to do that, it looks like
we were just making the

00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:39.940
algebra even hairier
and hairier.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.910
But this next step is going to
simplify things a good bit.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.260
So just to show you that, if I
want to take the mean of all

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.610
of the squared values of the
y's-- So that would be this.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:01:03.990
That would be y1 squared plus y2
squared plus all the way to

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.750
yn squared.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.900
So I've summed n values,
n squared values.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.376
And then I want to divide
it by n, since there

00:01:12.376 --> 00:01:13.480
are n values here.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.560
And this is the mean
of the y's squared.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.240
That's how we can denote
it, just like that.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.390
Or, if you multiply both sides
of this equation by n, you get

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:41.160
y1 squared plus y2 squared plus
all the way to yn squared

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:56.970
is equal to n times the mean
of the squared values of y.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.860
And notice, this is exactly
what we have over here.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.280
That is n times the mean of
the squared values of y.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.830
Or the mean of the y squareds.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.580
And we can do that with each of
these terms. What is x1y1

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:29.620
plus x2y2 plus all the way
to all the way to xnyn.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.460
Well, if we take this whole
sum and we divide it by n

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.690
terms, this is going to be the
mean value for x times y.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.460
For each of those points,
you multiply x times y.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.460
And you find the mean of
all of those products.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.160
That's exactly what this is.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.180
Well, once again, you multiply
both sides of this equation by

00:02:47.180 --> 00:03:01.480
n, and you get x1y1 plus x2y2
plus all the way to xnyn is

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.480
equal to n times the
mean of xy's.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.990
I think you see where
this is going.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:20.920
This term right here is going
to be equal to n times the

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.200
mean of the products of xy.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.460
This term right here
is n times the

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.300
mean of the y values.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:42.860
And then, this term right here
is n times the mean of the x

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.050
squared values.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.340
This term right here is the
mean of the x's times n.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.530
If you divided this by n,
you'd get the mean.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.570
Since were not dividing it by
n, this is the mean times n.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.860
And then this is, obviously,
we don't

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.700
the simplify anything.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.630
So let's rewrite everything
using our new notation,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.490
knowing that these are the
means of y squared,

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.450
of xy, and all that.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:11.320
So our squared error to the
line from the sum of the

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.150
squared error to the line from
the n points is going to be

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:24.160
equal to-- this term right here
is n times the mean of

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.370
the y squared values.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:36.550
This term right here is
equal to negative 2m.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.020
That's just that right there.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.200
Times n times the mean
of the xy values,

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.730
the arithmetic mean.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.990
And then we have this
term over here.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.060
I think you can appreciate
this is simplifying the

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.870
algebraic expression
a good bit.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:05:02.060
This term right over here is
going to be minus 2bn times

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.900
the mean of the y values.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:16.980
And then we have plus m squared
times n times the mean

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.260
of the x squared values.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.450
And then we have-- almost there,
home stretch-- we have

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:33.360
this over here which is plus 2mb
times n times the mean of

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.670
the x values.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.845
And then, finally, we have
plus nb squared.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.710
So really, in the last two to
three videos, all we've done

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.370
is we simplified the expression
for the sum of the

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.520
squared differences from the
those n points to this line, y

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.900
equals mx plus b.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.220
So we're finished with the
hard core algebra stage.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:06.140
The next stage, we actually
want to optimize this.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.070
Maybe a the better way to talk
about it, we want to minimize

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.150
this expression right
over here.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.320
We want to find the m and the
b values that minimize it.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.560
And to help visualize it, we're
going to start breaking

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.260
into a little bit of

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.150
three-dimensional calculus here.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.530
But hopefully it won't
be too daunting.

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.620
If you've done any partial

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.820
derivatives, it won't be difficult.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.630
This is a surface.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.460
If you view that you have
the x and y data points,

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.340
everything here is a
constant except for

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.250
the m's and the b's.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.310
We're assuming that we
have the x's and y's.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.020
So we can figure out the mean
of the squared values of y,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.610
the mean of the xy product, the
mean of the y's, the mean

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.230
of the x squareds.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.670
We assume that those are
all actual numbers.

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.410
So this expression right here,
it's actually going to be a

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.550
surface in three dimensions.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:03.380
So you can imagine, this right
here, that is the m-axis.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.620
This right here is the b-axis.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:20.780
And then, you could imagine the
vertical axis to be the

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.340
squared error.

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.770
This is the squared error
of the line axis.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:28.670
So for any combination of m
and b, if you're in the mb

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:30.710
plane, you pick some combination
of m and b.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.230
You put it into this expression
for the squared

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.760
error of the line.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.360
It'll give you a point.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.600
If you do that for all of the
combinations of m's and b's,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.850
you're going to get a surface.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.730
And the surface is going to
look something like this.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:50.670
I'm going to try my
best to draw it.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:56.170
It's going to look like this.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:01.100
You could almost imagine
it as a kind of a bowl.

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.370
Or you could even
think of it as a

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.440
three-dimensional parabola.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.070
If you want to think
of it that way.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.670
Instead of a parabola that
just goes like this.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.350
If you were to kind of rotate
it around and distort it a

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.700
little bit, you would get this
thing that looks kind of like

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.350
a cup, or a thimble,
or whatever.

00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:19.970
And so what we want to do is
to find the m and b values

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.070
that minimize.

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:24.420
Notice, this is a
three-dimensional surface.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.480
I don't know if I'm doing
justice to it.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.110
So you can imagine a
three-dimensional surface that

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.140
looks something like this.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.429
This is the back part that
you're not seeing.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:38.090
So that's the inside of our
three-dimensional surface.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.169
We want to find the m and b
values that minimize the value

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:42.929
on the surface.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:46.040
So there's some m and b
value right over here

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.390
that minimizes it.

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.120
And I'll actually do the
calculation in the next video.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.500
But to do that, we're going to
find the partial derivative of

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.910
this with respect to m.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.500
And we're going to find the
partial derivative of this

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.370
with respect to b and set
both of them equal to 0.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:09.020
Because at this minimum point, I
guess you could say in three

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.090
dimensions, this minimum point
on the surface is going to

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:18.720
occur when the slope with
respect to m and the slope

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.230
with respect to b is 0.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.010
So at that point, the partial
derivative of our squared

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:28.860
error with respect to m is
going to be equal to 0.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:34.490
And the partial derivative of
our squared error with respect

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.020
to b is going to
be equal to 0.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.890
So all we're going to do, in
the next video, is take the

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.060
partial derivative of this
expression with respect to m,

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.390
set that equal to 0.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.690
And the partial derivative of
this with respect to b, set

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.680
that equal to 0.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.590
And then we're ready to solve
for the m in the b.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.580
Or the particular m and b.
