&gt;&gt; Voiceover: From the Library
of Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.990
&gt;&gt; Martha Kennedy: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.890
My name is Martha Kennedy.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.760
I am a curator of Popular
Graphic Art in the Prints

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.580
and Photographs Division, and
it's my pleasure to welcome you

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.110
to the 2018 Swann
Fellows Lecture today.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.950
This program is sponsored by the
Swann Foundation for Caricature

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.530
and Cartoon, and the Prints
and Photographs Division.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.980
The Swann Foundation
is one of the few

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.730
that provides direct support
for scholarly graduate research

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.350
in the field of caricature
and cartoon

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.910
through annually
awarded fellowships.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.490
Since 1977, it has
been an important part

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.370
of the library's
graphic arts program.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.560
The foundation underwrites
important work relating

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.410
to caricature and cartoon
here at the library,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.860
and this includes
preservation and processing

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.530
of the library's
holdings of comic art,

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.070
development of these
collections,

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.450
related public programs,
and many exhibitions

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.860
in the graphic arts
galleries and other galleries

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.050
in the library's Thomas
Jefferson building, and in fact,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.040
there some up right now that
you might find of interest,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.850
if you haven't seen them.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.000
There is a new selection of
original Herb Locke drawings

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.520
from 1968 in the Herb Locke
Gallery, part of this complex,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.840
and also, Drawn to Purpose,
which consists of illustration

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.770
and cartoon art by
women creators.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.580
This event is being
videotaped for future broadcast

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.460
on the library's
website and other media.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.120
So, we encourage
you to ask questions

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.000
and offer comments
after the talk.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.080
If you participate in
the Q&amp;A, please realize

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.790
that you are consenting
to the library

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.230
to possibly using your
filmed image and remarks.

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.840
Today's speaker, Erika
Pazian, is a PhD candidate

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.370
in the Department of Art
History at the Graduate Center

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.750
at the City University
of New York.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.330
Her research focuses on
Mexican visual culture

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.010
in the 19th century, and her
dissertation examines the visual

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.530
culture of the United States and
Mexico from post-independence

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.410
to 1876, in order to establish
the role of imagery in formation

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.810
of national identity in
each of these countries.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.430
She has presented her research
at the Association of Historians

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.430
of American Art, their
bi-annual symposium,

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.200
and the College Art
Association Annual Conference.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.490
She has received support for
her research through the Center

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.830
for Latin American,
Caribbean, and Latino Studies,

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.430
their 2016 Summer
Research Travel Fellowship,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.740
and the Early Research
Initiative Knickerbocker Award

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.980
for Archival Research
in American Studies.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.090
She's been teaching art history
at the University of Minnesota

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.740
in Morris and St. Olaf College.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.750
During this year, she
will complete fellowships

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.320
at the Amon Carter Museum of
American Art in Fort Worth

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.530
and the American
Antiquarian Society in Wister.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.650
It has been a pleasure for
me to introduce Erika to some

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.800
of the resources in the Prints
and Photographs Division

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.960
and some other divisions
here in the library.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.620
Her lecture today is titled
Villains to Vanquished,

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.130
Envisioning the Enemy in the
United States-Mexican war.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.080
Please join me in
welcoming Erika Pazian.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.880
Thank you.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.340
&gt;&gt; Erika Pazian: Thanks, Martha.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.060
I also want to think
the Swann Foundation

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.340
for generously supporting this
fellowship, and the Prints

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.520
and Photographs Division
staff, who provided me

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.430
with helpful suggestions,
remained patient

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.160
as I called item after
item from their collection.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.640
So, I really felt that
I benefited greatly

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.920
from this six-week fellowship
that I completed last year.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.430
So, this presentation focuses
on images of the other produced

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.120
on both sides of the
US-Mexico border,

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.090
in response to the
US/Mexican war of 1846 to '48.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.380
The 20-month conflict was a
watershed event for both nations

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.220
that transformed the
North American continent.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.990
Many US citizens during the
war was an imperialistic thrust

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.890
toward a fulfillment of
manifest destiny that threatened

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.720
to expand slave-owning
territories.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.680
Mexicans' sense of both their
young nation's instability

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.110
and the aggressive nature

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.370
of their northern neighbor was
heightened by the conflict.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.870
With the signing of the
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.030
on February 2, 1848, Mexico
lost approximately half

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.910
of its national territory
in the north,

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.440
and the United States acquired
the modern states of California,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.080
Nevada, Arizona, New
Mexico, and Utah,

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.890
and parts of a couple
others, as you see here.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.410
Both nations were plagued
by internal conflicts

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.380
after the war, and each
was plunged into civil war

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.930
within 15 years of
its conclusion.

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.840
During this time
of turmoil, Mexican

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.950
and US artists inundated
visual culture consumers

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.630
with satirical illustrations,
comic and military prints,

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.880
and political broadsheets
that reached --

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.520
reacted to the events
of 1846-'48 and worked

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.800
to build a sense of national
identity among their viewers.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.260
Through comparative analysis of
images produced on both sides

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.980
of the border, this presentation
will first address the national

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.210
identity inherited from each
country's European rulers

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.510
in the years prior

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.910
to independence before
examining images

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.450
that conveyed localized
notions of nation

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.190
in the decades following
independence.

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.820
After the outbreak of the war,
artists in the United States

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.930
and Mexico continued to create
allegories of power and homeland

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.490
but also used representations
of battle's actualities.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.610
This doublespeak allowed
artists to celebrate

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.340
that which made their
homeland unique,

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.550
while simultaneously
vilifying the apposition.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.430
Through an examination of
battle scene lithographs

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.430
and satiric periodical
illustrations

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.320
that exemplify this concept,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:37.600
this presentation will
demonstrate the US-Mexican war

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.840
prompted artists to accentuate
differences between homeland

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.190
and enemy and encouraged
each nation to define itself

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.760
in contrast to its foe.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.650
These over-arching efforts

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.090
to construct national identity
inflected the visual cultures

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.740
of both Mexico and the United
States during the period

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.740
of the North American
Continent's division

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.180
into distinctive segments.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.620
National identity is
a complicated term

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.060
that is often defined
dependent upon its context.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.190
Benedict Anderson
defines nation as,

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:12.890
"An imagined political
community, and imagined both

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.180
as inherently limited
and sovereign."

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.090
And Leonard Nuovi
describes nationalism as,

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.480
"A sense of difference with
regard to other communities."

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.880
In the decades prior
to the US-Mexican war,

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:28.450
the notion of nation
was largely complicated

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.840
by both countries'
statuses as colonies.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.890
This is made evident
in an examination

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.800
of the allegorical
figure of America,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.670
which we'll look at
in just a second.

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.670
Difference, when it
comes to the Americas,

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.430
was defined for centuries
by Europeans.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.870
There was no distinction
between North and South America,

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:48.190
much less the United
States and Mexico,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.160
and the name America referred
to the Western Hemisphere,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.050
alternatively called the
New World by Europeans.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.190
After the "discovery,"
(I'm using air quotes)

00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:02.610
of the Americas, European images
depicted the personification

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.110
of America as an indigenous
woman, two examples

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:07.560
of which you see here.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.230
The figure highlights
both the exotic nature

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.820
of this new destination and
the economic abundance the

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.120
land possesses.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.680
The profusion of feathers that
make up the figure's headdresses

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.830
and skirts, as you can see
here and here, and then also,

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:31.010
an addition of a cloak
here, also made of feathers,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.060
marks the figures, and by
extension, the land, as exotic.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.770
Their accoutrements, the bow and
arrow that you see on the right.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.700
She has the quiver
slung over her back

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:45.840
and the arrow right here --
excuse me, left, and the parrot,

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:50.440
with the figure on the right,
along with their bare torsos,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.040
emphasized a deep connection

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.080
between the primitive
people and the land.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.720
In addition, the
potential wealth

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.480
of the land is highlighted
in both images.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.440
The figure on the left passively
spills gold coins from the arrow

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.710
and her hand, while the
figure on the right sits

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:10.670
on a throne made
up of a plethora

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:13.940
of exotic fruits and vegetables.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.680
Images such as these
informed Europeans view

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.050
of the Americans is a
singular, exotic land inhabited

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.790
by exotic flora,
fauna, and peoples.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.300
As it was the European
nations of Spain and England

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.450
that colonized Mexico and
United States respectively,

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.570
European symbolism, accordingly,
made its way to the New World,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.910
and the depiction of America

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.730
across the Atlantic
was continually used,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.760
both in the United
States and Mexico,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.100
as a symbol for their
own nation.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.130
In the United States,
early images

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.900
such as the one you see
here, were often copied

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.450
from British models, and
continue the tradition

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.460
of depicting America
as an indigenous woman.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.690
The America figure, which is
located right here to the right

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:01.620
of this obelisk, is once
again, bare breasted,

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.040
and the partial clothing
she wears is made of fur.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.650
This link to the
notion of America

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.380
as an untamed wilderness
is further emphasized

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.490
by her feathered headdress,
unkempt hair, and the arrow

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:14.490
on the ground in front of her.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:18.100
In addition, she wears a pearl
armband, which you can just make

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.500
out here, likely an allusion
to the wealth of America.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.240
Despite the many references to
previous depictions of America,

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.170
this image published in the
United States at the end

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.940
of the American Revolution,
offers us a glimpse

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.210
of the transformation this
allegorical figure undertakes

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.190
in the US to context
in later years,

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.030
and that glimpse is represented

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:43.340
by all the Grecian figures
you see on the right.

00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.830
After the war of
1812, the first war

00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.540
that the United States fought
as an independent nation

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.800
against a foreign
enemy, the nation worked

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:54.630
to shed representations of
itself established by others,

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:56.480
and instead, created
symbols and images

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.180
that reflected its
ideals on its own terms.

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:04.820
Accordingly, America received a
makeover, as demonstrated here.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.560
Now, she seated right here.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:11.370
As with the previous image,
America is, once again,

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:16.080
surrounded by references to
antiquity, but in this instance,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:19.710
America herself has adopted
the look of a Roman goddess.

00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:23.220
Like the Minerva, the goddess of
wisdom, who stands beside her,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.420
America wears a modest gown,
gladiator sandals, and a cloak.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.530
She still dons a
feathered headdress,

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.130
and a cornucopia
rest beside her foot,

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:35.250
as seen with other examples,
but even these vestiges

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.240
of previous depictions of
America have shifted in meaning.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.260
Now, the feathered
headdress mimics Minerva's

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.320
and maintains her orderly,
rather than unruly hair style.

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.220
The cornucopia rests beneath
the shield that you see here

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.170
that bears the arms
of the United States

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.080
and includes the motto
"Union and Independence,"

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.740
as if to convey that the
country is no longer a place

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.770
of potential wealth, but
instead, enjoys prosperity,

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.280
due to its people's commitment
to commerce and agriculture,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:08.770
who are personified by these
two figures right over here.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.500
This prosperity is not
without great sacrifice

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.400
and great leadership, as
represented on the right

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.740
by this triumphal arch,
celebrating the war of 1812,

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.740
and this equestrian statue
of George Washington.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:25.600
Thus, in the US context, the
personification of America sheds

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.120
or reframes the characteristics
adopted from European depictions

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.940
and incorporates Greco-Roman
themes to tie to Greece,

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.670
the birthplace of democracy,
in order to identify the nation

00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:40.120
as one built on democratic
foundations

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.980
and create a new
vision of America.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.910
In Mexico, the figure of
America was an integral part

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.270
of the visual culture
of the colonial era.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:54.620
In this image, we see that the
figure of America, oops, sorry,

00:12:54.620 --> 00:13:00.190
here on the right, includes many
makers of the European vision

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.880
of the American continent
and its peoples.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.650
She wears a feathered headdress,

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.760
and a quiver is slung
over her shoulder.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.570
Though more modestly dressed

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.070
than European models
previously discussed,

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:16.190
she wears a dress vaguely based
on generic indigenous attire

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.240
that clearly marks her as other.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.110
Her clothing and accoutrements
are further contrasted

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.580
by the figure of
Spain on the left,

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.450
whose appearance bears
much more in common

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:28.800
with the previously discussed
Minerva, as Spain is depicted

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.800
as a Roman warrior, wearing
an armor dress and helmet

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.860
and brandishing a
sword and shield.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.710
Although the figure
of New Spain,

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.170
as Mexico was called during the
colonial era, is clearly marked

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.940
as the other, she
is, at the same time,

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.840
embedded in the affairs
of her colonizer.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.790
The colors of her clothing
match those of the Spanish flag,

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:52.110
and her hand, like Spain's,
reaches out to take an oath

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.070
on the book and cross religion
holds to defend the cause

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.690
of Fernando VII, the former king
of Spain, who was overthrown

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.120
by Napoleon in 1808, a year
before this print was published.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.020
Firmly entrenched in
Spain's visual traditions

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:07.410
and political affairs,

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.840
this image reflects the
continued European view

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.790
of America as an exotic other,

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:16.780
with no unique identity
of its own.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:19.710
Mexican independence
in 1821 marked a shift

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.710
in Mexicans' perceptions
of national identity,

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.910
as Mexicans rejected
the identity

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.180
of their Spanish
colonizers and attempted

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:30.590
to forge a new independent
character.

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:35.090
Thereafter, images of Mexico, no
longer New Spain, began to shift

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.570
to highlight the proud
pre-Columbian heritage

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.400
that for centuries had been
suppressed by the Spanish.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.590
The personification of Mexico

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.920
in an 1848 lithograph
demonstrates

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.750
this transformation.

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.210
In many ways, the figure
parallels the depictions

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.510
of America previously discussed.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.240
Perched on a crocodile throne,
which is hard to make out,

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.890
but here his head is right here,

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.360
she wears an elaborate
feathered headdress

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.500
and extravagant jewelry
to represent her status,

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.730
holds a bow in her left hand,
and rests her right hand

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:10.180
on a cornucopia of produce.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:14.500
However, slight changes localize
her to the Mexican context.

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.250
The nopal cactus on
her left, seen here,

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.830
is a symbol of the nation,

00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:24.650
and her dress is specifically a
weave heel, an embroidered dress

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.300
that was associated with
pre-Columbian culture.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.200
In addition, the battle
scene to her right,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.630
which you can just make out
here, it represents the struggle

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.520
for independence from Spain.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.150
Rather than completely
re-envision the figure

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:43.210
of America, Mexico localizes
the once broad stereotypes,

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:45.610
emphasize the components
of Mexican culture

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.480
that predate Spanish
colonization.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.310
So, freed from the yoke
of their foreign rulers,

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.700
independent Mexico and the
United States both attempted

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.690
to establish national cohesion

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.690
through reinvented
allegorical figure of America

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.750
that constructed
national paths apart

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.200
from their European colonizers.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.530
While these images helped create
a sense of different with regard

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:13.040
to the European continent, it
was not until the US-Mexican war

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.090
that artists on both sides
set to distinguish themselves

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.310
from their previous ally.

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:23.720
So, switching gears, although
the decades following each

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.170
country's independence allowed
each nation to separate itself

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.560
from its foreign ruler, Mexico
and the United States struggled

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.630
to find a tenable balance

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:35.530
between creating a
distinct national identity

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:38.110
and maintaining diplomatic ties.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.950
Their uncomfortable relationship
became increasingly stressed

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.760
after Texas seceded
from Mexico in 1836,

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.730
as Mexican media outlets claimed

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:50.380
that the United States had
fomented the unrest in Texas,

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.120
and that the United States
promoted Mexico's ruin,

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.080
in order to enrich itself.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:17:00.130
After the annexation of Texas
by the United States in 1845,

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.280
a move seen as an act
of aggression by Mexico,

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:05.610
all diplomatic communication
lines

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:08.170
between the two were
severed, and by January

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.950
of the following year, it
became increasingly clear

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:14.490
that it was only a matter of
time before war was declared.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:21.970
On May 11, 1846, President James
K. Polk went before the Senate

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:23.270
and House of Representatives

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.930
and delivered a speech
calling for war.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:27.430
Congress approved
the declaration

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.130
of war two days later,

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:33.700
and Mexican President Mariano
Paredes y Arriaga released a

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:37.580
manifesto declaring a
defensive war on the same day.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.700
The relationship between the
neighboring nations abruptly

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.870
shifted from resentment to open
warfare, and cultural producers

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:47.770
in both nations dutifully
rose to meet the challenge

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.820
of bringing the public
the most up-to-date

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:52.970
and complete coverage a
war had ever received.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.530
Many of the major battles
and prominent heroes

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.650
of the war received
media coverage,

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.890
if you will, through
lithographs.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.320
The war coincided with an
outburst as lithography,

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.250
as improvements in the
medium allowed producers

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.800
of visual ephemera to distribute
their images to larger audiences

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.690
than ever before and reach
them with an expediency

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:17.140
that fine artists cannot match.

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.900
To today's viewer, the prints
you see here may not bear much

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:24.310
resemblance to today's newspaper
graphics, but during the war,

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:27.820
the public viewed prints
as news sources and relied

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.260
on war imagery to
accurately convey settings

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.070
and outcomes in a timely manner.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.240
Images were often stylized
to evoke sentiments of pride

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.100
and patriotism and were not
overly concerned with accuracy,

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.340
but nevertheless,
maintained journalistic value.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.840
Nathaniel Currier, the
man today associated

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.340
with this scenic picture prints,

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.560
thanks to the ubiquitous
holiday jingle,

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.080
was in his own time considered
one of the most prolific

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.000
and innovative lithographers
in the United States,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.630
producing over 85 prints of
the US-Mexican war alone,

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:03.990
including the one you see here.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:05.580
To a casual viewer,

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:08.000
this lithograph includes
many characteristics

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
of a typical battle image.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.170
The opposing sides are
clearly distinguished

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:15.210
by contrasting colors
of their uniforms.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:18.380
The victor of the battle
dominates the picture plane,

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:21.490
and the text caption beneath
the image identifies the date,

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.220
location, and outcome of
the conflict depicted.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.040
Upon closer inspection, we can
identify several visual cues

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.100
that work towards two
goals, celebrate the victory

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.400
of the US forces, and
depict the Mexican forces is

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.080
inferior enemies.

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.970
In order to establish
legitimacy,

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.170
the artist roots the
scene in reality.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.220
The text beneath
the image explains

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.240
that this is a depiction of
Colonel William S. Harney,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.330
who led parts of the first,
second, and third dragoons

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.330
in a pursuit of the retreating
Mexican forces during the Battle

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:57.720
of Churubusbsco on
August 20, 1847.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.220
This event was an important part

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:01.590
of a larger final drive
towards Mexico City

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.370
and received major
media coverage.

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.020
By the time the image was
printed, the skepticism

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.560
of engaging in a
seemingly unprovoked war

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:12.710
that many US citizens
initially felt, was replaced

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.930
by an acceptance to the idea
that the war was necessary

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.110
to fulfill a manifest destiny.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.720
This was, in large part,
thanks to images such as this,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.070
which makes clear the
contrast between the Mexican

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.500
and US forces and
conveys fundamental ideals

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.770
of US national identity.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.670
In particular, Colonel Harney
embodies the national character

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:38.310
through his attire, his
demeanor, and his leadership.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:44.070
When we compare his uniform
to the slightly blurry diagram

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:46.070
on the right, my apologies.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:49.490
We see that his uniform
is an amalgamation

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.120
of several different
military-issued uniforms,

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:58.360
as he wears the trousers
of a dragoon major,

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.940
the jacket of the
dragoon general,

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:06.430
and his hat is loosely
based on the hat, actually,

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.280
of a private in the infantry.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.250
The tassel that we see in
the Currier image is sort

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:18.360
of a mystery as to
where exactly this long,

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.000
flowing tassel comes from,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.440
but it certainly emphasizes
the Colonel's rapid movement

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.980
and heightens the
urgency of the pursuit.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.670
Harney's domination

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.180
of the battle is further
conveyed pictorially

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:38.770
through the many diagonal lines
incorporated in this image.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:43.490
This sword sheath, we see here,
attached to Harney's belt,

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:45.690
parallels his left leg,

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:48.420
conveying the Colonel's
dynamic movement.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.260
The sheath's diagonal
is extended

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:54.980
through the horse's back left
leg and leads us to the ground,

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:00.180
where we see a variety of
refuse from the Colonel's wake.

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.040
We see the obvious markers
of a defeated force,

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:08.560
including a musket and a sword
from a fallen Mexican soldier.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.740
But then, we also see
more symbolic symbols

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.390
of Mexican identity,
including the trampled agave

00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:19.300
and the tattered sombrero here.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.680
These seemingly haphazardly
placed items impressed

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.760
on the viewer both
the physical reality

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:28.510
of the US troops' victory over
the Mexican forces, and also,

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:32.500
the ideological defeat of the
Mexican people and its lands.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.350
The idea of physical

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.830
and ideological victory
is further conveyed

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:38.440
through the positioning

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.160
of the sheath's counterpart,
the sword itself.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.290
The sword's parallel position

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:47.460
to the sheath further emphasizes
this ideal of movement,

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.420
but also brings our eye up to
the upper half of the image,

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.740
where we see the sword paired
with the American flag.

00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:02.440
On left side of the image, we
see a faint palm tree appearing

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.870
out of the battle smoke, and
finally, the last symbol to rise

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:08.570
above the conflict is
the cross held high

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:11.000
by a fleeing Mexican soldier.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.610
The contrast between
these symbols

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.050
and the countries they are
associated with this made clear.

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.150
The sword and the flag embody
the United States military

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.160
strength and the
ideals of liberty

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.120
and freedom, respectively.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.580
The palm tree and cross
symbolize the exotic foreignness

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.210
of the land and the stubborn
traditions of its people

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.890
through their adherence
to Catholicism.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.250
Although many US citizens
considered Christianity the

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.710
ordained religion of
progress and believe

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.550
that it was the divine
right to colonize the lands

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.560
of native North American
peoples, Catholicism,

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.410
particularly in the context
of Mexico, was associated

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.660
with corruption and an
unwillingness to modernize.

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.480
Thus, as Harney and his troops
forge ahead with strength

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.190
and liberty, of Mexico and
its soldiers remain backwards,

00:23:56.190 --> 00:23:58.720
extolling a corrupt
religion, and trampled

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.380
by a seemingly inevitable --

00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.020
the seemingly inevitable
nature of progress.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.720
Through formal and
iconographic analysis,

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.200
we can identify the myriad

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.200
of ways US cultural
producers attempted

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.520
to bolster national identity
through the aggrandizement

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.720
of its own forces
and the denigration

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.450
of the Mexican troops.

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:22.880
Turning now to Mexico,
in the Mexican context,

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.740
imagery of battle
scenes produced

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.860
for Mexican audience are
scant, but the few examples

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.980
in existence similarly
display visual cues that work

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:33.180
to evoke sympathy for
the Mexican troops

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.370
and unite the Mexican people.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:39.310
This lithograph, produced in
Europe for distribution Mexico,

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:42.700
depicts the Battle of
Monterey, a multi-day battle

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.770
in Northern Mexico
that involved assaults

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.320
on the city's fortifications

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.220
by multiple divisions
of the US Army.

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:53.270
The battle ended with an
8-week armistice in exchange

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:55.290
for Mexico's surrender
of the city

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:58.150
and the Mexican forces'
armed evacuation.

00:24:58.150 --> 00:25:01.650
The fact that Mexico's
5000-strong army was unable

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.840
to defend the well-fortified
city from General Zachary Taylor

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.610
and his troops was a major blow
to the Mexican Army's morale,

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.380
leading some scholars to argue

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:13.360
that this battle marked the
beginning of the end of the war

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.340
for the Mexican forces.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:19.660
Many Mexican soldiers deserted
as the army marched south.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.970
Yet, this image conveys
resolve instead of dissolution,

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.210
unity instead of division.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:28.630
According to the caption beneath
the image, the heroic events

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.950
of the city takes place
on September 23rd,

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:32.970
the final day of fighting.

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:36.080
The scene maintains many
markers of authenticity.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.280
Soldiers on both sides
of the melee are dressed

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.060
in accurate uniforms,
and the conflict is set

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.280
in the streets near
the Plaza Major,

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.870
in keeping with the
battle reports

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:47.100
that detailed the
advancement of US troops

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.190
to two blocks east of the Plaza.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:52.880
Yet, the image also carries
an agenda, as evidenced

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.010
by this scene on the right.

00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:59.200
The colonel that we see
here, calls on the soldiers

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:02.470
to forge ahead, and the troops
enthusiastically follow.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.670
The soldiers represent
a cross-section

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:06.170
of the Mexican people.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.590
We have members of
the officer corps,

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:13.470
clad in regulation uniforms,
representing the upper echelons

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:18.840
of society, while the dragoons,
wearing a variety of attire,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.830
denote the poor farmers
and laborers

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.360
who were often coerced
into service.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.460
Accompanying them as
a military chaplain,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.830
who we see here,
holding a cross.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:30.000
You can barely make
out in one hand,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.740
and the Mexican flag
in the other hand.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.820
The image works to
convey a clear message.

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.990
Regardless of their station
in life, on the battlefield,

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:42.540
each man exhibits heroism
and resolve, as they fight

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.150
and die for their country.

00:26:44.150 --> 00:26:47.270
The depiction of the
Mexican forces contrasts

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.550
with the US troops,
who are barely visible

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:51.260
but an important
component of the image,

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:53.400
to reinforce Mexican identity.

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:58.450
Several US troops on the left
attempt to make their way

00:26:58.450 --> 00:26:59.850
through the barricade,

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.050
while three of their
compatriots demonstrate

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:06.580
that this journey is not an
easy one, these three here.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.450
The US soldiers,
following their commander,

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:12.960
these three in particular,
look young and almost timid

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:17.290
and no match for the musket and
ax-wielding Mexican soldiers.

00:27:17.290 --> 00:27:24.600
In addition, the US
reinforcements, largely shroud

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.890
in smoke, appear small
and insignificant.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:31.300
The image convinces the viewer
that the Mexican forces are

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:34.480
in control of the space,
through both the determination

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.190
of the soldiers and the
intimidating setting,

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:38.560
as the cathedral that we see

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.460
in the background
looms large overhead.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:46.240
Much like Currier's print, the
image similarly conveys physical

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:49.540
and ideological dominance
over the enemy.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.320
Once again, we see this message

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:54.280
through the use of
flags and crosses.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.440
While Currier used the cross as
a symbol of Mexico's weakness,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.350
here it is positioned as a
source of strength and pride.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.960
As aforementioned, the Mexican
chaplain thrusts the cross

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.720
into the air with his right hand

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.440
and bears the Mexican
Standard in his left hand.

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.350
The chaplain's right hand
leads the viewer's eye,

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:17.880
if we follow the
cross, to the US troops

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.420
in the center background,

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.920
which includes a barely
visible US flag right here.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.440
The Mexican Standard
points upward right --

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.360
echoing the position of several

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.950
of the muskets also
pointed upwards,

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.660
carried by the Mexican forces
and leading the viewer's eye

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.750
in the direction of
the cathedral steeple

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:42.520
in the central background.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.790
Each component, the
flag, the cross,

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.680
and the muskets work together
to communicate a clear message.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.710
Mexico's defense of Monterey
was fought for the love of God

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.940
and country against a weak
and insignificant enemy.

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.350
Although this print was made
two years after the conclusion

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:01.770
of the war, its outcome,
a major blow to Mexico,

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:05.140
the need for a united
national identity remained.

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:10.230
When comparing this image to
the lithograph that inspired it,

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:12.790
which you're seeing on the
bottom right, we see that one

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:15.650
of the most significant
changes is the incorporation

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:19.550
of this large cross
section of Mexican society.

00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.100
While the makeup of these
troops is a relatively accurate

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.580
depiction of the types of
soldiers who participated

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.740
in the defense of Monterey,
the artist likely focused

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.910
on these figures to
establish societal unity.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.720
The war did little to unite
deep divides between the classes

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.950
that led to uprisings
and frequent changes

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:38.640
in government leadership.

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:41.660
Thus, the artist recalls a
time from the recent past,

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:44.710
when all Mexicans came
together against a common enemy,

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:47.320
and when people put aside
their differences to fight

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.510
for country and honor.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.280
These ideals permeated the
visual culture of the era

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.560
on both sides of the border
and extended to other media,

00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.290
such as satiric periodicals,
to which we will now turn.

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.250
While battle screen
prints attempt

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.250
to sway viewers' opinions of
themselves and their enemies,

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:07.660
through pictorial nuance

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.980
that incorporated
cultural stereotyping

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.320
and patriotic symbolism, satiric
periodicals often exaggerated

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:18.690
these same ideas to further
their nationalistic agenda.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:19.990
The two publications we'll look

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:24.860
at today both began publication
shortly after the outbreak

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:28.140
of the war and address the
conflict through satirical text

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.780
and imagery guided by
a central character

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:34.070
that also provided each
publication's title.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:36.870
These publications are
Yankee Doodle on the left

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.440
and New York City-based
weekly satirical journal,

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.230
first published in October
of 1846, and El Calavera,

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.810
a bi-weekly satiric
periodical first printed

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:51.080
in Mexico City in
January of 1847.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.160
Both publications
attempted to incite a sense

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.920
of national identity in
their respective readers

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.770
through depictions celebrating
their homeland heroes

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:03.550
and vilifying their neighboring
enemies, so that regardless

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.180
of the war's outcome, the people

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.410
of each country would remain
ideologically united behind

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.840
principles of freedom,
independence, and homeland.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.940
Both the Yankee Doodle and El
Calavera are early examples

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.190
of satirical humor
in the popular press

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.990
in their respective nations
and were likely inspired

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.750
by European models such
as the French Le Charivari

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:26.390
and British Punch Magazine.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:30.210
To distinguish Yankee Doodle
from its foreign precedence,

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.700
editor Cornelius Matthews,
stated plainly within the pages

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.570
of the periodical, that the role

00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:40.170
of the publication's namesake
was to "embody and reproduce,

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:44.090
in permanent form, that free
spirit, that exuberant life,

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.650
that creative energy,
and refining enthusiasm,

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.780
which so eminently
characterize us

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:52.690
and distinguished the
New World from the old."

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.690
In the Mexican context, while
depictions of El Calavera

00:31:56.690 --> 00:32:01.030
or The Skull date back to
preconquest Aztec imagery.

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:03.790
Editor Ignacio Diaz Trioque's
[assumed spelling] illustrated

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:07.400
satirical publication would
have been a novelty to viewers,

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.670
as it is generally
credited as one of the first

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.510
of its kind in Mexico.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:15.850
Regardless of the inspiration
for these publications,

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:18.800
editors of full journals
consistently published images

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.740
that incorporated
negative stereotypes

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.380
of the enemy while
celebrating their homeland.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:27.710
Unlike the battle scene prints
discussed earlier, which focused

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.320
on the events of the
war on the battlefield,

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.050
satiric periodicals
primarily centered

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.960
on the important political
figures and diplomatic events

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:39.160
that steered the course of
the war, satirizing the enemy

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.470
to gain popular support
for the war cause.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:48.160
In the July 17, 1847, edition
of Yankee Doodle, Santa Ana

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.550
and his generals incorporates
exaggerated stereotypes

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:54.510
to humiliate the
country's leadership,

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.530
as the caricature's namesakes
are depicted from left

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:01.630
to right is neurotic,
inept, sulky, and devious.

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.540
Each figure dons
an elaborate hat

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.450
and bears a grotesque
expression,

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:07.660
accentuated by absurd eyebrows

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.910
and the stereotypical
large moustache,

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:12.270
an omnipresent feature
of Mexican soldiers

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:15.430
in images created by US artists.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.770
Mexican President, General
Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana,

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:22.140
the second from the right,
looks despondent and frail

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:25.270
as he clutches his cloak
tighter to his torso and looks

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:28.080
up hopelessly at his
oversized head gear.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.210
His sizing is actually
out of character,

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.490
as the general was
infamously tall.

00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:36.210
The incongruity is explained
in the text beneath the image,

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:39.470
as the editor explains that
this group portrait was inspired

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.970
by the publication of the first
volume of J.T. Headly's book,

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.190
Napoleon and his Marshals.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.030
These figures -- excuse me,
these figures, the editor states

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:53.380
with heavy sarcasm, are "A group
of four heroes, whose prowess,

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:56.100
if not cut off in the
bud by some mishap,

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.150
to which military chieftains
are particularly liable, will,

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.850
no doubt, rival those
of the little corporal."

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:05.510
The image and text work together
to demean Mexican leaders,

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:08.770
and in a similar manner,
celebrate US victory.

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:12.790
As the text goes on to read,
"The Palms, Rio Grande,

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:17.470
Buena Vista, Monterey, Cerro
Gordo, will remain monuments

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:20.250
of what the generals would have
accomplished, had it not been

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:24.300
for a series of unlooked for
accidents, which Generals Taylor

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.440
and Scott of the US Army
were mainly instrumental

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:28.740
in producing."

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:33.450
The publication plays on Santa
Ana's nickname of the Napoleon

00:34:33.450 --> 00:34:36.760
on the West to humiliating
effect, seemingly inferring

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:39.980
that Santa Ana, like
Napoleon, will end up disgraced

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.400
and exiled, due to the
ineptitude of himself

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.580
and his generals,
and peerless prowess

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.660
of the US military leaders.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:52.170
While Santa Ana and his generals
used exaggerated stereotypes

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:54.280
to demean the Mexican military,

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:56.410
the periodical also
featured images meant

00:34:56.410 --> 00:34:59.790
to highlight the diplomatic
superiority of US leaders

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:04.030
at the expense of their
Mexican counterparts.

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:07.360
Triumph of the Letheon
from April 10, 1847,

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.480
edition of the periodical,
seen here, is one such example.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:14.340
The cartoon illustrates
the peace negotiations

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.960
between the two warring
countries,

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:18.380
through the three
political figures featured

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.010
in the foreground.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.750
In the background, Yankee
Doodle observes the scene

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:26.110
at a distance, but with his
hand to his chin in thought.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:29.500
In the foreground,
President Polk is the central

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:34.240
and imposing figure, who calmly
administers Letheon to Santa Ana

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.880
by holding the tube
from that extensor

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.810
in the anesthetic's container,
and with the other hand,

00:35:40.810 --> 00:35:43.930
forcing Santa Ana to
swallow the substance

00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.510
of plugging the general's nose.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.060
The jug on the left
of the image,

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.850
in addition to the Letheon
label, is also marked $3 million

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:57.060
that you see here, the amount
appropriated by Congress in 1847

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.230
to negotiate peace with Mexico.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.150
Santa Ana, with his
characteristic long hair

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:06.530
and large mustache, resigns
himself to accept the substance,

00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:09.570
as his hands are literally
and figuratively tied,

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:11.680
and he closes his
eyes and leans forward

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.460
to receive the anesthetic.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.750
Meanwhile, Thomas Hart Benton,
a senator from Missouri,

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:20.460
and a staunch advocate
of the westward expansion

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:24.010
of the United States, saws
off Santa Ana's left leg,

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:28.500
labeled New Mexico, while Santa
Ana's infamous prosthetic peg

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.120
leg is visible behind Benton,

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:34.600
and you can just make
it out here, the peg.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.900
The cartoon humiliates Santa
Ana on multiple levels.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.490
His willing acceptance of the $3
million would have contradicted

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.980
the popular opinion of
Mexican society and government

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:48.670
as the United States began a new
offensive, targeting Vera Cruz

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:51.940
and Mexico City by the time
negotiation talks formally

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:56.200
began, making any consideration
of peace a disgrace.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.750
In addition, Benton saws
off Santa Ana's left leg,

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:02.280
which further highlights
the inconsistency.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.720
It was the same like that
had already been amputated

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.410
in 1938 during the
Pastry War with France.

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:12.750
Although the United States was
not involved in that conflict,

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.980
the switch brings attention
to fate of the prosthetic leg,

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.520
which was captured by US
forces during the battle

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:21.720
of Cerro Gordo, and oddly
enough, is still on display

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.400
at the Illinois State
Military Museum.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.620
Benton, and by extension,
the US forces,

00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:30.440
immobilized Santa
Ana militaristically

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.440
through the capture of his
prosthetic leg and politically

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.120
by forcing him to accept an
unpopular peace agreement.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.080
While in reality, a
treaty was not signed

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.480
until the following year,
the implications of the image

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.700
that the United States
is clearly in control

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:48.050
of its foe is made clear.

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:51.710
The stereotypes of the enemy
included in the representation

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:55.250
of Santa Ana reached across
multiple media platforms,

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:57.290
as seen in this single-sheet
lithograph

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.580
that similarly used the
theme of bodily dismemberment

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.230
as an allegory for
military paralysis.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:08.660
Each figure's features' are
exaggerated to the point

00:38:08.660 --> 00:38:12.530
of absurdity, with long,
unkempt hair, bushy facial hair,

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.530
and noses so large
that they peek out from

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:17.390
under the soldiers'
large sombreros.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:20.470
Their military uniforms
distinguish their officer rank,

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:22.470
but they are completely
defenseless in the wake

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.850
of their limb amputation.

00:38:24.850 --> 00:38:27.420
They stare in bewilderment
at their missing legs,

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:30.000
resigned to this loss
of body, as, perhaps,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.260
an allusion to the
presumed loss of land

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.360
that Mexico would endure
in the coming months.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.880
As many US citizens viewed the
war and the eventual extension

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.720
of the US's lands to the Pacific
Coast as divinely ordained,

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:47.280
cultural consumers viewed these
images of Mexicans' compliance

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.960
with the loss of land is
appropriately emblomatic

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.750
of the forthcoming US victory.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.960
Switching to Mexico,
in this context,

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.250
satiric publications
similarly bolstered views

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.800
of viewers' sense of national
identity at the expense

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.980
of their, what the same
time, extolling the virtues

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.350
of the homeland through
allegorical figures

00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.470
that incorporated popular
Mexican traditions.

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.920
Although the character of
Yankee Doodle rarely featured

00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.680
prominently in the pages of
his namesake publication,

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.800
the images featured in the
stearic periodical, El Calavera,

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.640
always featured the
character of the same name,

00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.940
and you see him here

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.020
on the right-hand
side of this masthead.

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.320
The inaugural issue

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.980
of El Calavera specifically
identifies its namesake

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:35.680
character as the hero of
the publication, stating,

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:38.710
"You will see that El
Calavera, if he is understood

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.580
with only a picturesque
epigram can change the lover

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.250
of meanness to good."

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:46.420
Although El Calavera
was first positioned

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.760
as an objective bystander, you
can see he's sort of outside

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.220
of the melee in this one, he
became increasingly prominent

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.340
in later images, as
the war progressed,

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:58.840
and Mexican citizens became
increasingly disenfranchised,

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.350
as their military forces
suffered continuous defeat

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:07.520
and the US troops move
ever closer to the capital.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:10.300
In a cartoon published
in the May 7, 1847,

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:13.960
edition of El Calavera, the main
character takes center stage,

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.950
embodying the nation's
ideals and conveying no signs

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:18.920
of an impending defeat.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.640
Rather than dwell on the
disillusion and despair

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:24.730
of losing almost half of
the nation's territory,

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:27.120
El Calavera maintains
a courageous outlook

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.000
and firmly extols the
virtues of his nation.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.900
The character wears a regulation
uniform of the Mexican

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.910
and proudly holds, in one hand,
a flag that bears the freedom --

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:40.940
the values of freedom, homeland
-- independence and homeland,

00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:44.640
while the other hand raises
a sword ready for battle.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.240
The sword is positioned
directly in front of the flag

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.100
with El Calavera's hand in
front of the word Independencia,

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.310
or independence, and
the sword pointing

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.810
to the word Patria, or homeland.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:57.480
Much like the chaplain's
positioning

00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.710
in the heroic defense
of the City of Monterey,

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.610
the image makes clear
the ideals the troops aim

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:05.290
to defend during the conflict.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:09.490
While El Calavera's
attire and accessories link

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:13.110
to current events, the skull
mask he wears carries a long

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:18.010
history in Mexican imagery, and
I have a few examples in here.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:21.130
Skulls were an integral part
of pre-conquest aspect imagery,

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.650
and maintained a
significant role

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:26.180
in Mexican visual culture
during the colonial era.

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:29.010
In addition, skeletons
featured prominently

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.800
in images commemorating
the Day of the Dead,

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.770
a holiday that transcended
class boundaries.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:37.020
Thus, the character of
El Calavera is a figure

00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:41.390
who embodies the nation's ideals
and affirms the continuity

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:45.730
of longstanding traditions
despite these turbulent times.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:49.920
As El Calavera courageously
strides into battle,

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.400
he effortlessly tramples
his enemy,

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:55.260
symbolized by the
objects under his feet.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:58.580
Beneath his right foot
lies a disabled canon

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:03.130
with several cannonballs
haphazardly cast on the ground.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:07.660
Under the canon is the US
flag, not particularly visible,

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:11.120
and its staff leads
the viewer's eye

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:14.170
to this creature on the right.

00:42:14.170 --> 00:42:17.250
The monstrous figure bears
the face and military coat

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:21.140
of a soldier, but his body
is grotesque, with the paws

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.700
of the beast and the torso and
legs, if you will, of a snake.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:30.550
The last loop of the figure's
body is conspicuously labeled

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:35.120
"Invasion," Invasion, and
the creature raises its tail,

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.970
as if about to strike.

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:39.560
Any potential threat is
suppressed by El Calavera,

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:43.220
who drives the Mexican
flag staff straight

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:44.570
into the creature's head.

00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:48.390
The symbolism throughout
the vignette is clear.

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:52.300
Neatly stacked cannonballs,
like the ones you see here,

00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:54.990
and their powerful
associated weapon,

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:57.310
were consistently
included in wartime imagery

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.670
to represent the military
prowess of the US forces,

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:04.200
as featured on this
song sheet cover.

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:07.590
Here, on the left, the
military might is scattered

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:10.790
across the page, and
the flag is pinned

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:13.720
down by the celebrated
weapon, the defenses

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.410
and patriotic symbols
of the US dismantled

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:18.560
under the tread of El Calavera.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.800
The creature's dual,
deceitful identity,

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.400
a respectable soldier upon
first glance, but in reality,

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.630
a monstrous snake, links
to the perception in Mexico

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:31.700
of the United States as
a suspicious aggressor,

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:35.610
stemming from the US's perceived
involvement in Texas' secession

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.720
from Mexico and further
bolstered,

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.110
of course, once the war began.

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:41.700
[clearing throat] Excuse me.

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.030
Although the image
villainizes the United States

00:43:44.030 --> 00:43:46.870
through this depiction, the
main focus is essentially

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:49.340
on the triumph of El Calavera.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.250
The treachery and
self-aggrandizement

00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:53.820
of the United States are set

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.740
against the earnest
values of Mexico.

00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:59.850
The young face of the deceitful
creature contrasted by the skull

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:02.690
that links to centuries-old
traditions.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.520
Al Calavera states
in the prologue

00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:07.590
that accompanies this image,
"For I have been invited

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.440
to come back from the
afterlife, so that I give back

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.770
to my beloved office."

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:14.520
As if to assert that even

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.530
when inevitable defeat
makes the principles

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:19.740
of national identity difficult
to maintain, the traditions

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:23.100
and ideals of the nation
will always return.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.940
In conclusion, the
us versus them model,

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:29.270
in which nations define
themselves in opposition

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.070
to their enemies, was
integral to the establishment

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.720
of national identity
during the US-Mexican War.

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.830
Before the conflict, both
countries used visual imagery

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:41.390
to distinguish themselves
from their foreign rulers

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:44.600
after gaining independence,
transforming the allegory

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:48.930
of America from a generic symbol
of the Western Hemisphere,

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.950
to a localized figure that
reflected constructions

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:55.760
of the national past and
elucidated the present.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.060
With the outbreak of the war,

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.780
allegorical figures alone
remained insufficient

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.080
to create distinctions
between two nations

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:04.970
that were once allies
and buoy support for war

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:07.750
that was unpopular
in both countries.

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:10.140
Cultural producers in
both nations turned

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.690
to stylized images
on the battlefield

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:14.850
and satirical depictions
of diplomacy

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.690
to glorify their own forces
and belittle their enemy.

00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:22.210
Through comparative analysis, we
see that artists on both sides

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:24.270
of the border used
similar strategies

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.960
to separate themselves from
their foe, in an effort

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:30.030
to bolster national
identity when ideals of whom

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:33.480
and what constituted a
nation were rapidly shifting.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.710
I'm curious about the
artists themselves.

00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:53.860
Were they freelancers or
were they paid specifically

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:58.190
by the magazines and
newspapers and told

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:03.550
to represent a certain
side or [inaudible].

00:46:03.550 --> 00:46:05.540
&gt;&gt; Erika Pazian: Short
answer is depends.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:09.460
Some of the really big
firms could have full-time

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:13.490
lithographers, but lithography
is exploding at this time

00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:17.170
to the point that
there are artists

00:46:17.170 --> 00:46:20.900
who are making satirical
imagery for this publisher

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.870
and making battle scenes for
this publisher, and sort of,

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:26.780
yeah, freelancing a lot
more, as you mentioned.

00:46:26.780 --> 00:46:30.740
And that's in the US context.

00:46:30.740 --> 00:46:35.590
In Mexico, especially
for satiric periodicals

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:39.210
like El Calavera,
there was a fair amount

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.280
of government regulation
in the press.

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:46.430
So, the artists necessarily
remained anonymous.

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:49.210
It's sort of exciting that we
even know the publisher's name

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:53.840
for El Calavera, and actually,
El Calavera, in particular,

00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:57.940
was stopped by the government
and Trioque was jailed.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:01.820
So, those artists we
know a lot less about,

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.990
just because they
had to sort of remain

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:07.650
under the radar of
the government.

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:33.360
Great question.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.430
Again, the short
answer is depends.

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:37.780
So, the color lithographs
would've been

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:40.520
for an elite audience, because
those were hard to make,

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.620
and they had to be hand
colored at this time.

00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:45.840
So, that's much more
for the upper echelons,

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:49.930
but a lot of the
black-and-white lithographs,

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:53.660
those were definitely for a
broader audience than before.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.670
That's not to say that everyone
on the street had access

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:01.260
to them, but they were certainly
a lot more inexpensive.

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:03.300
This is sometimes called
"the penny press" too,

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:09.110
just because these publications
were often only a cent or two.

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.110
So, they were definitely --
had a much broader audience,

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:16.390
because we have to remember, at
this time, still, in the 1840s,

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.080
art is still very
much for the elite.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:21.660
So, this is sort of
bringing a brand-new audience

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.080

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.720
Hmm, that's a good question.

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:51.050
Interestingly, this -- a lot

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:54.770
of Texas museums have huge
collections of stuff related

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.380
to the US-Mexican
war, not surprisingly,

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:01.510

the main place for news.

That's where all the news
is coming in, and then sent

out throughout the nation,

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:16.170
I think that there's less
distribution of these images,

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.520
simply because some of
the fighting is going

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:24.270
on in what we now know as Texas,
and it had just been entered

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:27.640
into the union the year
before the war breaks out.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:31.800

sort of distribution centers

that the images made
clear who won.

the more clear that it was,

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:01.400
also received a gunshot wound,
and there's also took blood

00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:04.370
and all sorts of gore in the
many depictions of that image.

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:08.120
So, violence, very pertinent,
and it becomes all the more real

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:12.090
to us when in it's
in color, too.

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:14.390
Any other questions?

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:17.510
Okay, thank you so much.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.560
