&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.826
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760
Good morning.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.560
I'm Marcus Brauchli of
The Washington Post.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.980
We're one of the charter sponsors
of the National Book Festival,

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.856
big believers in reading
as you can imagine.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.890
On behalf of the Library
of Congress,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.956
I do welcome you to
the book festival.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.690
We hope you're having a good day.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.283
I want to inform you that
the presentations here

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.033
at the pavilion are being
filmed for the Library

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.070
of Congress website
and for their archives.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.850
If you don't want to
be part of history,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.516
you might not wanna ask questions.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.893
And via C-SPAN for airing on
BookTV, please be mindful of these

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.740
as you enjoy the presentation.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.663
Also, please stay away from the
risers where the cameras are

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.530
on the back, unless you want
a camera to topple on you.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.986
And please turn off your cell
phones, pagers, or other devices

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.726
that might disturb the
person sitting next to you.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.803
It's a special privilege
to be introducing a writer

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.136
for whom I have really
the greatest admiration.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.510
David Hoffman is a
long time reporter

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.603
and editor for The Washington Post.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.570
He's one of the hardest working,
most passionate believers

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.753
in the power of good
journalism to change the world

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.016
and he's been a mentor to some of
our finest foreign correspondents.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.476
He's here today to talk about
his Pulitzer Prize-winning book,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.690
The Dead Hand.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.310
It's a chilling account of the
last days of the cold war and how

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.870
that era still ominously
shadows us all.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.950
It's an extraordinary
piece of reporting

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.093
on previously unknown documents and
conversations both from this country

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.940
and from Russia where David
was stationed for the Post.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.880
Before David mastered
the illuminated texts

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.743
of the Soviet Union, he had already
visited the Stations of the Cross

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.366
in the monastic world of
Washington journalism.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.080
He covered the White
House in the Reagan

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.700
and George H.W. Bush
administrations.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.393
He was the Post's diplomatic
correspondent

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.660
and as Jerusalem corespondent.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.303
And he served as assistant
managing editor for foreign news.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.906
It was during that last stint which
would be arduous enough for most us

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.993
that he managed to write this book.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.010
Maybe he was able to do that
because the subject of this book

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.930
which David captures brilliantly
is urgent and compelling.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.923
Please join me in welcoming
David Hoffman.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.190
[ Applause ]

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.156
&gt;&gt; Marcus, thank you very much
and thanks to everybody for coming

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.436
on what I hope is gonna be a really
interesting and exciting day.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.226
This book grew out of
work that I did in Moscow

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.200
as the Washington Post correspondent
there from 1995 until 2001.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.666
I really apologize for this
hoarse voice but I'll try

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.000
and make myself very, very clear.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:49.363
When I was the correspondent
in Moscow,

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.963
as American newspaper
reporter, I kept the doors

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.176
of our Moscow bureau open
and oftentimes people

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.780
who were visiting Russia for
the United States government,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.173
for scholars and others
would come to our bureau

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:06.660
because they knew the door would
be open, we'd like to listen

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.580
to their experiences there,
serve them tea and cookies.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.726
And one day, a man came to
see me in the autumn of 1998.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.370
The door was open.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.836
I'd never met him before.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.403
It was a very, very
sad and sullen time

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.803
in Moscow, early autumn like today.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.386
Only a few weeks before,
Russia defaulted

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.910
on its debts and devalued the ruble.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.806
The great capitalist
experiment of those years seemed

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.983
to be crashing around everybody.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.866
They-- lines were forming
outside the banks,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.393
people couldn't get their
money out of the bank.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.206
The money they had
been given, the bills,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.206
the rubles were suddenly
worth much less.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.383
They were very, very upset

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.316
and people didn't really
know what to do.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.196
This man came to my
office and he said, "David,

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.543
I work for the United States
Department of Energy and my job is

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.673
to go and check all the nuclear
facilities here in Moscow

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.986
to make sure that all
the nuclear materials,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.373
the highly enriched uranium and
the plutonium is locked up."

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:22.616
And I said, "Well, that's
really interesting work.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.523
How do you do that?"

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.990
And he said, "Well, I have this
checklist and I go to each place

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.763
where there's uranium and
plutonium and I run down the list.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.216
I make sure for example the
locks are properly on the doors

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:37.116
and that the video
cameras are working

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.930
so we can make sure nobody takes the
uranium, and we have portal monitors

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.716
and scales and all this
equipment was purchased

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.280
by the United States government
in the 1990s and given to Russia

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.140
to make sure that nobody
took the bomb-grade uranium

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.653
out of these institutes, that
nobody, no terrorists could take any

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.753
of these materials which was
laying all over the country,

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.196
1,200 tons of highly
enriched uranium spread

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.726
across 11 time zones."

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.970
But the man told me, he
said, "Today, this very day,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.113
I had a terribly upsetting
and unsettling experience."

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:23.586
And I served him some more tea
and I said, "Tell me about it."

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.486
"Well, today I was at the
Institute of Theoretical

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.193
and Experimental Physics."

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.313
And I said, "That's a
beautiful institute,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.046
it's spread out over 89
acres in the middle of Moscow

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.536
and it's an old nuclear
research institute started

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.206
in the Soviet days.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.873
And what did you find there?"

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:45.940
I asked him.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.206
And he said, "Well, you
know, I took my checklist,

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.540
I made sure the locks
were on the doors,

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.206
spread out over this
institute in small buildings,

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.000
the nuclear researchers
would do their work

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.550
with highly enriched uranium that
was brought to them in metal cans

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:07.190
about the size of a coffee can, the
uranium was inside and it was clad

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.790
in aluminum on the outside.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.916
And there was a lot of uranium.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.753
There was enough to make many, many
bombs spread over this 89 acres."

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.493
And as the man went through
his checklist that day,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.500
he found the locks were working,
the video cameras were working,

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:29.683
the portal monitors were
working, everything,

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.636
all the equipment was working
but he was shocked to find

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.573
out something had gone wrong.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.733
Something had catastrophically
wrong that we had never thought of,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.883
because all over the
institute he found

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:50.330
out because the economic situation
in the country had started

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.130
to fall apart that all the
guards, all the people responsible

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.013
for watching the uranium
for preventing it

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.966
from being stolen were gone.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.820
The guards had walked off their
jobs because they hadn't been paid.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.346
The video monitors were running
and nobody was watching it.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.050
This fellow who was very young,
sent by the energy department

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.176
to check all these things
had been given some cash

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:19.526
by the energy department, his per
diem to pay for his food every day

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.466
and he was walking around
wondering, "How do I do something

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.713
about this, what do I do?"

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.830
He called all the scientists at
the institute, all the secretaries,

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.196
anybody left he could
find into one room.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.040
There were only 32 people he
could find on these 89 acres,

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:44.806
none of them were guards.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:45.246
He reached into his pocket
and he took out all the money

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.226
that the Department of
Energy had given him,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:51.190
3000 dollars in 100-dollar bills and
he put it on the center of the table

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.756
and he said, "Will you please
stay here until I can get help?"

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:04.796
And they did, because they cared
too that the uranium not be stolen.

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.430
And later, the United States
and Russia found the money

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.236
to bring the guards back.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.210
But when this man told me the story
I thought, you know, this is 1998,

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.530
7 years after the collapse
of the Soviet Union

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:21.316
and there are still coffee cans

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.983
of highly enriched uranium
lying unguarded around Moscow.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.703
The cold war had been over
for a long time and I began

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.343
to research how this came about.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.326
Why and how was it so much
stuff was lying around,

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:40.930
and that's what gave rise to this
book and it's the story really

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.810
of how this enormous
amount of dangerous material

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.303
which was generated in
the cold war was dealt

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.026
with after the cold war ended
and it was a scary story and one

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.706
that didn't follow a script.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:58.220
Oftentimes our politicians told
us everything was gonna be okay.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.533
We've gone in there.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.000
We've secured the reactors.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.720
We've secured the weapons
facilities, but it wasn't the case.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:07.696
Now I got lucky in
doing this research

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:13.663
because I found the records
inside the Kremlin of many

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.880
of the decisions that they had made.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.443
And one of the things I
was determined to do was

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.703
to ask the Russians as well as
the Americans what was the story

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.763
like to you in terms of what
was happening on both sides?

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.003
We tend to forget the cold war today
but it was a colossal confrontation

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:39.143
of two sides and much of the history
that was written about the cold war

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.190
after it ended was
written only from one side,

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:44.830
from the American perspective.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.030
It's not uncommon.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.630
Our society is open,
our books are written,

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.230
many of our documents
were available,

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:51.096
but what about on the Soviet side,

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:55.296
the evil empire that
Reagan called it.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.680
What were their decisions
really, really like?

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.933
What were they saying to each
other at the end of the cold war?

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:02.813
&gt;&gt; And one of the advantages
I had in this book was

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.440
to receive the papers from inside
their decision making process,

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.416
from inside their Kremlin to try
and recreate the history in stereo,

00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:18.023
to listen and try to
understand what happened

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.940
from both sides as they lived.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.646
A discovery that I made
was that it didn't look

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.190
like the normal narrative
that we have been told.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.163
It looked different.

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.696
We have read books and heard

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:37.040
that we won the cold war
and they lost, right?

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.220
Simple, we all know Reagan's
strategic defense initiative,

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.166
won the cold war and bankrupted
the Soviet Union, right?

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:46.216
But actually, when you begin to
reconstruct the history as I did,

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:53.056
you realize that it
wasn't like that at all.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.823
Actually the papers and
records and interviews show

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.440
that the Soviets were afraid of
the strategic defense initiative

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:04.386
and they were worried about
Reagan, but that country imploded,

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.406
imploded of its own
dysfunction, of its own failures.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:14.283
And I like to just share with
you two very brief glimpses

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.376
of how this history looks
different in retrospect.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:25.293
The first one is about that
Star Wars plan, missile defense,

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.366
that Reagan himself
announced in 1983.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.553
You all read today headlines
about missile defense.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:34.340
We're all still trying to make

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.773
up our minds whether you can
hit a missile with a missile

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.583
and shoot a bullet with
a bullet out of the sky.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.296
But when Reagan announced this in
1983, the Soviets were very, very,

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.776
fearful and Reagan was
very, very confident.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.223
And in fact, if you read the
literature now about the end

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.020
of the cold war, the books
are very triumphalist.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:58.330
Reagan himself was the triumphalist.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:00.060
He said, "This is what caused
the end of the cold war."

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:03.866
Well, my friends, I
just like to share

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.533
with you a discovery I had made.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.583
I don't wanna take away from Reagan

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.346
and I'll come back
to him in a second.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.946
But the real impact of
Reagan Star Wars was not

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:22.896
that he forced the Soviet Union
to build one and to be like us

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.443
and to go toe to toe with us.

00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:26.766
The reality is that Mikhail
Gorbachev, the new leader

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.506
of the Soviet Union in March of 1985
was pressured and asked repeatedly

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:39.230
by people in his military, by all
those very, very powerful guys

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.120
who built rockets and
space vehicles and tanks

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.966
to build a Soviet Star Wars.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:50.263
If Gorbachev hadn't come along, I'm
sure Brechnev, would have built one.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.090
As I said, the cold war was a
collision between two huge blocks.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.870
But this time, it would
be different.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.223
Even as Reagan was
making his speeches,

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:05.620
including his second inaugural
speech given on this hall in January

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.493
of 1985, even as Reagan was saying
we will make nuclear weapons

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.336
obsolete with our Star Wars.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.136
Gorbachev was wondering
what the hell to do.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.680
What should he do?

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.676
Everybody was telling him
he had to do the same thing

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:24.953
and we made a very, very courageous
decision which is explained

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:28.756
in my book and in these documents.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:35.403
Mikhail Gorbachev decided not to
compete, not to build the Star Wars,

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:39.646
not to continue the cold
war and he decided it early,

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.900
he decided it in 1985 and '86.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:43.403
And this was the first turning
point that led really to the end

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.836
of the cold war and allowed
many of us to see the end

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.820
of that enormous extensive frightful
and draining confrontation.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:14:00.036
So it wasn't only Reagan's plan
to force the Soviets to collapse,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.306
they also made some
courageous decisions.

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:04.803
But, you know, I was a
White House correspondent

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.143
when Reagan was president.

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.476
I even covered his 1980
campaign for president.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.540
I was a good reporter
in terms of taking

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:15.703
down everything the president
said in my notebooks.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:23.230
For years I traveled around behind
Reagan taking notes what he said

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:23.680
trying to understand who is
this man, what did he mean.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.460
And I have to tell you that as I
began to go through the records

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:30.563
in writing this book and reading
President Reagan's own diaries

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.223
which are now published, I
found a shocking discovery.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.473
I found that contrary to many of
the things I believed and understood

00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.926
in following Reagan
that he, like Gorbachev,

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.820
wanted to end the nuclear arms race.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:53.523
I found out that Reagan in his
deepest emotions and beliefs wanted

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.430
to really abolish nuclear
weapons and that he wanted

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:00.410
to do it long before the
rest of us found out,

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:03.363
years before we found out.

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.550
And certainly I as a reporter,
I went back to my files,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:10.843
I looked at all of my own stories
and you wont' find it in my stories

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:11.310
out of the White House in the 1980s.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.910
I didn't know.

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:15.976
None of us knew.

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.240
So this wonderful combination
of Gorbachev's determination

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.713
to change the direction
and Reagan's hope and dream

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:27.353
of abolishing nuclear weapons
led us to the end of the cold war

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.920
which used-- so we almost
got even in 1986 at summit

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.943
at Reykjavik, a dramatic moment.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:36.090
Now my last point is to
tell you that this sounds

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:42.810
like a very optimistic and
promising story and a good outcome

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:47.050
but the documents also revealed
something that was the underside

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.213
of the cold war, a dark side.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:53.910
I found in these records evidence

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:58.223
with how the Soviet Union
had quietly and in violation

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:04.036
of all their treaty obligations
built the largest biological weapons

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.873
program that mankind had ever seen.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.213
And in my book, I document how
scientists, thousands of them

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:16.416
in hidden institutes and
laboratories were ordered

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:21.543
by the Kremlin to create biological
weapons that were unstoppable.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:28.176
They tried to take germs and create
hybrids that would cause illness

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:28.860
and sickness and for which
there'll be no antidotes.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.020
There'll be no vaccines,
there'll be no antibiotics.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:35.703
And this effort preceded for
years and cost billions of dollars

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:42.796
and ultimately the soviet
union built giant factories

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.323
to produce these germs.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:46.813
And I remind you of-- sure
you've read that anthrax

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.080
in a tiny little powder
can be very poisonous.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.693
It only takes a few
tiny little spores.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.383
The Soviet Union built a factory
which upon given the orders

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:06.280
from Moscow could produce 300 pounds
of anthrax a year, enough to wipe

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.520
out every living thing
on this earth.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:16.813
This factory was up and
running in exactly the time

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.350
that Mikhail Gorbachev
became president.

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:20.970
And one of the big mysteries of
the time is what did Mr. Gorbachev,

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:25.073
the great statesman who tried
to stop the nuclear arms race,

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:28.696
what did he do about the
germs in the basement?

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:31.066
What did he do about the biological
weapons that his country had built?

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.740
Well, in the end, he
didn't do anything.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:39.346
He let it continue.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:44.276
And when the Soviet Union ended,
when it collapsed, Americans,

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:45.373
like the friend who had come
to visit me that very first day

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.073
with their checklist went and they
discovered it and the book ends

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.673
with the story of how the Americans
uncovered this diabolical program

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:02.176
and factories to build germ weapons
to attack us in the cold war.

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.713
And it was a very, very frightening
time because we didn't know

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:07.466
if these factories
would be activated.

00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:09.180
We didn't know if they could
really work, huge fermenters,

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:12.813
four storeys tall sitting
there in the desert

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.920
of Kazakhstan waiting to be started.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:21.556
And this entire history
has a lesson for us today.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.460
Because these horrible evil weapons
were created in a confrontation

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:33.356
between two political
blocks and two leaders

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.653
and it persisted for decades.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:37.960
And we have to ask our
selves today why did it stop,

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.273
why did it end, and
why did it persist.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.420
And one of the reasons was
because of the incredible mistrust

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.716
that the United States

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.943
and the Soviet Union could
not see each other clearly.

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:58.610
We didn't understand each other's
intentions, ways of life, ambitions.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:18:59.213
And we have to ask ourselves today,
are we gonna get in another cold war

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.433
with somebody else
because of mistrust?

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.290
The lessons of what
happened between Reagan

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:08.870
and Gorbachev are things
we should think about today

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.456
when our leaders say that
we're gonna stop Iran

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.150
from building nuclear weapons.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.153
We didn't see Gorbachev clearly nor
did Gorbachev see Reagan clearly.

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:20.800
And I ask you today, do we
know what's really happening

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.400
in North Korea?

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:26.250
Do we know what's happening in
Iran, what the leaders are thinking?

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:33.236
Well, the book will offer you
some insight into the dangers

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.220
of not knowing, of the
dark side of the cold war.

00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:39.196
So, I'll be happy to
take your questions.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:40.926
And thanks for coming today.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000


00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.030
[ Applause ]

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:57.416
&gt;&gt; While you were in Russia, what
role did you see church played,

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:03.376
the Orthodox Church and then
all other religious groups?

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:07.670
&gt;&gt; The Orthodox Church in
Russia in the 1990s was weakened

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.483
by the 7 decades of Soviet rule.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:16.363
The Soviet Union did not
completely eliminate the church.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:18.016
It existed even though the
state was officially atheist.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.276
But in the first decade after the
Union collapsed, it was impossible

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.610
for the church to get back on its
feet quickly, so it was a time

00:20:29.650 --> 00:20:32.183
when many, many churches
were renovated

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:34.833
but the church itself didn't play
a big role on people's lives.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.146
It would take many, many
years for that to happen.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:41.226
Sure, I will go back and forth.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:43.660
&gt;&gt; What's your view of Gorbachev's
organization today, Global Green

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:47.730
or is it called the Green Cross
internationally destroying chemical

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:53.203
and other weapons and what's your--

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:57.310
also your thoughts on the
Soviet nuclear waste and mess

00:20:59.420 --> 00:20:59.753
and the recent book that's out on--

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.553
saying Chernobyl actually has
caused close to a million deaths.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:06.953
&gt;&gt; First of all I think any
organization that's dedicated

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.993
to cleaning up the legacy of the
cold war deserves our support.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.203
I ask you all, does anybody here
know how many nuclear warheads

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:17.903
remain in the world today?

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:18.236
Can anybody give me the number?

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.370
What do you think?

00:21:22.170 --> 00:21:23.370
Do you think there's 5000
left from the cold war?

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:25.503
[ Inaudible Remark ]

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:26.303
&gt;&gt; No, 10,000 not nearly enough.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:28.776
There are 23,000 nuclear warheads
today, 95 percent of them are held

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.163
by the United States and Russia.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.510
We have a lot of work to
do to get to global zero

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:38.513
but I think even getting
down to a hundred

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.980
on each side wouldn't be a bad
bargain when we have 23,000 left.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.113
So I think highly of groups that
are working to reduce this legacy

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.806
which we don't need anymore.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.340
The cold war is over.

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.246
And the second question
was about Chernobyl.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.200
The records suggest that it's very,
very hard to understand the impact

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.703
of radiation on human health.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:05.176
Thirty or 40 people actually died
in the accident but a large amount

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.676
of radiation was spewed
across Europe and Scandinavia

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:12.016
and I just don't think anybody knows
how many deaths were really caused

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.270
by it, but Chernobyl
was a wake up call.

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:19.766
It should remind us that if we
have 23,000 nuclear warheads lying

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.760
around, there is always the
possibility of an accident.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:27.753
And I think while they're well
secured and ours are secured,

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:31.460
Chernobyl wasn't supposed
to happen either.

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.433
They were running a
test on the reactor

00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.633
and someone made a
mistake and it blew up.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.336
What will be the next accident?

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:43.270


00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:46.436
&gt;&gt; How did the CIA get
it so wrong for so long,

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.493
the strength of the Soviet economy?

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:55.723
&gt;&gt; You know the CIA's era here in
judging the Soviet Union was not

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.340
so much on misjudging the
strength of their economy,

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:04.690
it was misjudging the impact of
the weakness of their economy

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.360
on their military and
on their defenses.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.146
In other words, we saw the
evidence with our own eyes

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.880
that there were breadlines.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.123
You remember the dysfunctional,
failing nature of socialism.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:22.010
We could see that in
the news reports

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:26.010
that Soviet consumers were hungry
to buy jeans on the street.

00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:30.523
They had never had any
factory that made jeans, right?

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.576
But what we didn't understand
was that corrosive failure

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:36.836
of socialism also was cutting
into the rocket forces,

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:42.210
cutting into the missiles
and it was making them unable

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:47.353
to actually launch anything,
and frankly the Korean airliner

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:51.510
that was shot down in 1983,
that horrible tragedy was shot

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:52.833
down by a mistake because their
radar's didn't even work properly.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:56.333
So the error here and the error
that Reagan made himself was

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.030
that we wanted to see that socialism
was failing and we wanted capitalism

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:03.663
to triumph and we understood
breadlines

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:08.450
but we saw the military
as 10 feet tall.

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.453
And they weren't.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.563
They had suffered the same
malaise, the same dysfunction.

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:14.716
And that was hard to grasp
but it was a time of secrecy,

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.636
a time of spies, a time
of great confrontation.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:20.330
I don't know that we
should fault the CIA per se.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.770
Nobody saw it because they
hid their weakness behind

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:28.423
that mistrust and secrecy.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.276
Which side am I on?

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:33.010
I forgot.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.543
&gt;&gt; How do you view
the New START Treaty

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.210
and how do you think it
compares to START treaty?

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:40.010
&gt;&gt; Well I just finished saying

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.086
that there are 23,000
nuclear warheads left.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:46.933
Here's a new treaty that will
come to 1550 on each side, right,

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.260
so it sounds like a good deal.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.593
That's only 3000 some all together.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:53.236
Except that we're gonna
put a whole lot of them

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.170
in storage and not count them.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.010
This treaty ought to be
ratified, but don't fool yourself.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.730
The job is not finished.

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:01.506
When it's over, there's still gonna
be another 10 or 15,000 in storage.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.610
I'm sorry, but if you just
put another name on it

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.946
and say it's a nuclear
weapon in storage,

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:09.780
you haven't made the world safer.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.246
We have more work to
do after the treaty.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.196
&gt;&gt; You mentioned Iran
toward the end of your talk,

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.256
how do you feel the uranium
that is still floating

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:24.740
around has impacted what's
going on in Iran today

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.350
and how does it affect what's
going on in the Middle East?

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:31.703
&gt;&gt; Well, as a general statement,
we'll all be a lot safer

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:38.703
if no more countries obtain nuclear
weapons and decide to use them

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.933
and build them and test them.

00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.470
Now, how they get the
uranium, the difficult process

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:46.106
of understanding what
their thought process.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.093
Why did they want the bomb,
who were their enemies,

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.626
we need to think about that.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:52.246
We cannot always see Iran
as some kind of a boogeyman

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:56.673
like we did the Soviet Union.

00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:57.273
It requires us to be
more sophisticated

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.690
to understand what the
leadership really wants by this.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.456
But whether North Korea or Iran

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.806
or some place else,
the fewer the better.

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:08.370


00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.943
&gt;&gt; Would you comment on the role

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:15.010
that President Herbert Walker
Bush played during the collapse

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:16.513
of the Soviet Union to
the satellite nations?

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:18.180
&gt;&gt; I described-- I
described in the book

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:23.980
that President George Herbert Walker
Bush whom I covered, you know,

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:25.006
was very close and understood what
Reagan had done in the last years

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.096
of Reagan's presidency, and he
didn't wanna do the same thing.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:32.133
While Reagan was a nuclear
abolitionist, Bush was not.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:35.413
Bush was much more of a
conventional nuclear deterrence guy,

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.493
that had been his upbringing.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.143
So the first thing he did really
in 1989, in that historic year

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.843
of change in 1989 is
he put the brakes on.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.703
He slowed everything down.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:51.903
And I think it was a mistake.

00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:55.503
It was a pause in everything
that was going on in 1989

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.320
when there was great chance for
him to strike a deal with Gorbachev

00:26:59.280 --> 00:26:59.910
to exploit everything
that Reagan had done.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:01.496
But by the end of 1989,
the Berlin wall fell down.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:05.000
It was pretty hard to
ignore the signs of change.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.940
And then Bush got into gear in 1990.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:14.436
And in many ways, I think Bush
himself saw himself as a president

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.456
who represented prudence, a
word that he loved, caution,

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.710
and it was a time of enormous change

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.560
and he was not a person
of enormous change.

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:28.460
He did what he though was
the right thing at that time.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:28.960
&gt;&gt; A couple of things, what do you--

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:30.713
what happened to the
biological weapons

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:33.206
that they had on the Soviet Union.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.273
And also, when you talk
about the lack of knowledge

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:37.010
with what's happening
in Iran and North Korea,

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:42.670
are you suggesting
maybe greater engagement

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.586
or possible military action?

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.930
&gt;&gt; On the biological
weapons of the Soviet Union,

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.340
many of them have been destroyed.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.736
We found the factories,
thanks to the courageous work

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.680
of some Americans who I
described in the book.

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:56.530
We bulldozed some of those
factories, but not all of them.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:01.036
There are three biological weapons
laboratories remaining inside Russia

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.400
today that have never
been opened to the west.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.020
Nobody knows what's going on inside.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.826
Our program was closed down
by Richard Nixon in 1969.

00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:14.390
We obeyed the treaty.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.056
Soviet Union and Russia
also signed the treaty.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.760
It's time for them to come clean.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:21.476
I'm against military
action against Iran.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:24.310
I don't think it will help anything.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.296
We've got two wars going on and
I don't think we need a third.

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:33.323
And in terms of engagement, yes, you
know I always come back to the kind

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.176
of engagement Reagan argued for,
even in the height of the cold war.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:37.983
We talked to the Soviet leaders.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.716
We had an embassy in Moscow.

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.783
We do not have one in Tehran.

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:45.050
Why is it that we can't
have the same engagement?

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:49.183
But Reagan always said,
you know, trust but verify.

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:50.663
Well, if we're cautious, there's
no reason we can't engage further

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:54.050
with Iran.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:55.766
&gt;&gt; We have time for
one more question.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:57.593
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you talked
about materials,

00:28:59.540 --> 00:28:59.620
what about the scientists
and the know-how?

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.540
&gt;&gt; We know very little what
happened to the scientists.

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:08.180
An American program was
started to help the scientists.

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:08.826
It was estimated there were 60,000
scientists with weapons knowledge

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.263
and they're at the core
and we had to help them.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:16.163
We don't know how many,
we reached some of them.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.696
They got small stipends or grants.

00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.233
We tried to help but nobody
knows what really happened

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.653
to all the know-how to this day.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:28.270
Thank you all very much.
