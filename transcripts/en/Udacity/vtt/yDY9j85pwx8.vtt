Hi, and welcome to lesson four. Conference central is

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.510
starting to look like an interesting application. In addition to

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.090
user management that we introduced in lesson two, we

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.980
also added data store in lesson three. Now it's time

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.060
to look at data relationships and how to retrieve

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.760
data and make no mistake about it. There's a lot

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.110
of moving parts with respect to this. So you

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.021
better keep your eye on the ball. [SOUND] In addition

00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:32.159
to data relationships and queries, we will be looking at datastore

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:38.561
consistency rules and transactions in this lesson. Now is probably a good time

00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:42.839
to seriously start to checkout the documentation on the internet as well

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.592
to become a master of building

00:00:44.592 --> 00:00:47.720
scalable applications. Let's get started, shall we?
