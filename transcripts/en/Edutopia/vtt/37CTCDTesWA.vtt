00:00:00.436 --> 00:00:03.866
&gt;&gt;Ann: We're going to do a quick
little number talk, faces forward.

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:06.316
If you could put your fist
at your belly, please.

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:08.416
Everybody's fist at their belly.

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:09.916
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: In every classroom,

00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:13.086
there are a few kids whose
hands will go up every second.

00:00:13.086 --> 00:00:18.006
So this teacher has figured out
a way, by having a subtle signal,

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:20.866
to be able to encourage participation

00:00:20.936 --> 00:00:23.236
from larger numbers of
kids in the class.

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:25.866
&gt;&gt;Ann: Everybody have
fist at their belly?

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:33.226
&gt;&gt;Ann: I don't want kids
raising their hands.

00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:38.076
Some kids think faster than others,
but that doesn't mean that the kids

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:39.736
that aren't as fast don't understand.

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.086
They could be processing slower.

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:44.996
They could be looking at
it in a different way.

00:00:44.996 --> 00:00:47.016
There are multiple reasons.

00:00:47.886 --> 00:00:52.826
With raising of the hands, as soon as
kids see that person who's very fast

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:57.016
at answering a question, the rest of
the kids question say, "That's great.

00:00:57.016 --> 00:00:58.166
I don't need to anymore.

00:00:58.166 --> 00:00:59.376
I don't need to worry about that."

00:00:59.776 --> 00:01:03.286
&gt;&gt;Ann: We're going to do a percentage
talk, if you even have an entry point

00:01:03.286 --> 00:01:06.586
into the problem, something
to contribute to the problem,

00:01:06.996 --> 00:01:09.496
you're going to put your thumb up, okay?

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:13.646
&gt;&gt;Ann: So I started by
putting a problem on the board.

00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:18.576
&gt;&gt;Ann: So about a minute to think and
then as soon as you have some kind

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:21.416
of something to contribute
your thumb is going up.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:23.096
&gt;&gt;Anisa: She'll say fist at the belly.

00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:25.966
Then when you know the
answer or you have a clue how

00:01:25.966 --> 00:01:27.766
to get the answer you put your thumb up.

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.826
&gt;&gt;Ann: I'm looking for those thumbs.

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:30.886
&gt;&gt;Cristo: It changes the mood.

00:01:30.886 --> 00:01:32.986
Her classroom's a good environment.

00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:36.866
I feel like I'm open to
give my opinion in anything.

00:01:43.206 --> 00:01:44.256
&gt;&gt;I see some thumbs up.

00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:49.046
Okay, can somebody help me with
the entry point over on that side?

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:52.766
&gt;&gt;Student: I know that half of
160 is 80, that's 50 percent.

00:01:52.766 --> 00:01:53.546
&gt;&gt;Ann: Ati?

00:01:54.446 --> 00:01:56.696
&gt;&gt;Ati: Oh, 10 percent is 16.

00:01:56.886 --> 00:01:57.966
&gt;&gt;Ann: How do you know that?

00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.686
&gt;&gt;Ann: You need instructional
strategies and routines

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.336
that allow everybody an entry point,

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:05.496
particularly at the beginning
of the class.

00:02:05.726 --> 00:02:10.356
If you have something where the kids
are feeling like, "Oh, this is great,

00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:14.026
I participated today, I contributed
something today," then they go

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:16.816
on to their next task, you
have them a little bit more

00:02:17.076 --> 00:02:18.256
than you would otherwise.

00:02:18.586 --> 00:02:22.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Fifty percent is eighty,
twenty-five percent is forty.

00:02:23.086 --> 00:02:26.196
&gt;&gt;Ann: So what did we do with the
50 percent and the 25 percent?

00:02:26.516 --> 00:02:27.236
&gt;&gt;Student: You add.

00:02:27.306 --> 00:02:27.976
&gt;&gt;Ann: You're adding it, right.

00:02:28.156 --> 00:02:30.366
&gt;&gt;Dr Cantor: By having
this more subtle signal,

00:02:30.586 --> 00:02:34.236
this teacher is encouraging
participation from people

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:38.246
who might be reticent, and
enabling many more children

00:02:38.246 --> 00:02:40.036
to participate in a discussion.

00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:43.486
&gt;&gt;Student: To get 25 percent
you have to divide 50 by 2.
