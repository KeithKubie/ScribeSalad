when you pass a magnet over a wire it

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
when you pass a magnet over a wire it
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.670
when you pass a magnet over a wire it
induces a current in that wire if you

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
induces a current in that wire if you
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.769
induces a current in that wire if you
run alternately if you run a current

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779
run alternately if you run a current
 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779
run alternately if you run a current
through a wire it creates an

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789
through a wire it creates an
 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.500
through a wire it creates an
electromagnetic field so if you have a

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510
electromagnetic field so if you have a
 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.050
electromagnetic field so if you have a
whole bunch of coils and you start

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
whole bunch of coils and you start
 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.970
whole bunch of coils and you start
passing some magnets over them which are

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
passing some magnets over them which are
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.120
passing some magnets over them which are
on this vehicle and you design this all

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130
on this vehicle and you design this all
 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.889
on this vehicle and you design this all
correctly it'll actually start lifting

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
correctly it'll actually start lifting
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.139
correctly it'll actually start lifting
the vehicle off there's a repulsion and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149
the vehicle off there's a repulsion and
 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.049
the vehicle off there's a repulsion and
it's stable so now what happens if you

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
it's stable so now what happens if you
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.670
it's stable so now what happens if you
lose the power to propel the vehicle you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
lose the power to propel the vehicle you
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.760
lose the power to propel the vehicle you
do not lose the mag magnetic levitation

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
do not lose the mag magnetic levitation
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.130
do not lose the mag magnetic levitation
the passive magnetic levitation so it's

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
the passive magnetic levitation so it's
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.880
the passive magnetic levitation so it's
super safe with seven pounds of lithium

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
super safe with seven pounds of lithium
 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.619
super safe with seven pounds of lithium
polymer backup batteries and our

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629
polymer backup batteries and our
 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.869
polymer backup batteries and our
vehicles say we're going 100 miles an

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
vehicles say we're going 100 miles an
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.869
vehicles say we're going 100 miles an
hour and we lose all grid power we will

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879
hour and we lose all grid power we will
 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.450
hour and we lose all grid power we will
we can still go three miles and we

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460
we can still go three miles and we
 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.579
we can still go three miles and we
should have stations every mile apart so

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
should have stations every mile apart so
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.399
should have stations every mile apart so
there's a big safety factor with passive

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
there's a big safety factor with passive
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.240
there's a big safety factor with passive
maglev and again the it's always had to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
maglev and again the it's always had to
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.570
maglev and again the it's always had to
be some kind of maglev because we do not

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
be some kind of maglev because we do not
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640
be some kind of maglev because we do not
want all the maintenance costs

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
want all the maintenance costs
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.170
want all the maintenance costs
associated with gears and a little tires

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180
associated with gears and a little tires
 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.789
associated with gears and a little tires
wearing out and we want the high speed

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799
wearing out and we want the high speed
 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.740
wearing out and we want the high speed
capability

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750
 
 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.210
 
like the transrapid maglev train that

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220
like the transrapid maglev train that
 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.070
like the transrapid maglev train that
goes what I think 300 miles an hour in

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080
goes what I think 300 miles an hour in
 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.390

if they lose power they lose their

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640
if they lose power they lose their
 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.070
if they lose power they lose their
levitation you'd come to a screeching

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080
levitation you'd come to a screeching
 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.350
levitation you'd come to a screeching
halt they have to have all kind of like

just we have a continuous stream of
 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.890
just we have a continuous stream of
vehicles and they have the one big

you'd be on board and going so you'd
 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.820
you'd be on board and going so you'd
probably get there just as quick on

and then all of a sudden they got a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510
and then all of a sudden they got a
 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.270
and then all of a sudden they got a
product that people would buy guess what

product that people would buy guess what
 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.449

that was tobacco and now tobacco is an

evil product and fossil fuels are going

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180
evil product and fossil fuels are going
 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.850
evil product and fossil fuels are going
that same way and that was a second
