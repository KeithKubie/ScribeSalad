00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.520
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Good afternoon everyone and
welcome to The App Clinic.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.610
My name is Reto Meier.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.340
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And today we are going to be
looking at stopwatch and timer apps.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now, just so you know today's
kind of a weird day.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.820
We've got some people out of the office sick,
we've got some, you know, important meetings

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.900
going on.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.640
So we have a new engineer, engineer Joe.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.640
&gt;&gt;Joe: Hey.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Joe is well known for his
grasp of linear algebra and his oddly ethnic

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.840
last name.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.840
[Laughter]

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.840
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So thanks for joining us, Joe.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.530
You can tell that they're important meetings
because we're here.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.760
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.760
Now the truth is we did ask Alex to be our
producer because we thought with the beard

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.760
and all-

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.760
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.329
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But here's what happened,
really odd story.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.170
So Alex is a really, really, you know, flexible
guy.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.170
He does a lot of things.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.520
You ask him to do a Google IO presentation,
sure, you ask him to, you know, build a brewery

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.480
with his bare hands, sure, no problem.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.480
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Right.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Industrial solvents meant
to be inhaled.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.460
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Arc welding.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.460
Yep.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.540
He can do all these things, asked him to engineer,
deer in headlights.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.540
[Laughter]

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.310
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I wondered why he was running
down the street.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Indeed.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.659
So Alex is a man with a comfort zone and we
have found the edge of it.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:17.659
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We've discovered it.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.229
It's taken us a couple of years but we have
found the edge of his comfort zone.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.439
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Good job.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.439
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yay us.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.439
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, let's get on.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:25.630
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Let's get on with it.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.340
So we're gonna take a look at some stopwatch
and timer apps today.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.369
Like always, our goal here is to not necessarily
find the best stopwatch and timer apps but

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.640
to try and look at a few and see if we can
help you guys out that are developing your

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.090
own Android apps to be able to take good apps
and turn them into really great apps.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.460
So, what are we going to have a look at today?

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.619
Big black screen, wow, that's going well.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:49.929
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Hm.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.549
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's going very well.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.859
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Interesting.

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.370
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That is very interesting.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.060
That's a key note not helping me out there.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.259
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right, indeed.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.119
Yeah, we started doing all of our titles in
key note because it's so cool but now-

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.350
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is doing very little to help
us.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: that is sort of hilarious.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.320
I'm not really sure what-
[Music plays]

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.260
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Joe, you should just click back
to.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.980
Clicking things you shouldn't have clicked,
I can hear.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.980
[Laughter]

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There we go.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.650
There we go.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.840
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I feel like this is gonna go
poorly.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.920
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Should have stuck with PowerPoint.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.810
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So these are the patients we're

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.420
gonna try and take a look at today and we'll
see how we go with our overlays but we're

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.630
gonna look at Yoga Timer, we're gonna look
at Timer, Alarm, Stopwatch and Clock, Impetus

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.260
Interval Timer, Hybrid Stopwatch and Timer
and the Ultimate Stopwatch and Timer.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.920
So we can definitely see a consistency in
naming there so that's something.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:57.750
So before we get into it I'm gonna try another
transition and see what happens.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.750
Yeah!

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.730
So what we can see here, straight away, is-

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.890
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh I'm just gonna screw around
with other things, well the fact is the camera

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.540
is not pointed at us correctly.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, wow.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.840
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So what you can see straight

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.530
away when we look at today's patients is these
are the feature graphics.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.660
So we can see straight away that only three
of our patients had feature graphics; Hybrid

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.760
Stopwatch, Ultimate Stopwatch and one of them
doesn't have the name on the feature graphic

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.200
which is in and of itself not a bad thing.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.900
But what I really wanted to highlight here
is when I'm browsing through the market all

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.980
the names are vaguely the same.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.000
So I'm gonna try and pick something which
looks pretty appealing before I get going

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.620
and straight away here, one that really stood
out to me was the Hybrid Stopwatch which just

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.620
looks awesome.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.680
It's got a great feature graphic, it's got
a great icon and the others really didn't

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.830
stand out so much and so I would, sort of,
instantly assume that was the best one just

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.320
based on the way it looks.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.690
So let's, let's get started, I guess, and
have a look at the first of the apps which

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.420
is actually going to be Yoga Timer.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.020
So, this is the page that you see on Google
Play when you go there.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.370
So, as you can see, no feature graphics, so
that's missing.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.760
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let's talk about that for
a second cause I don't think we've really

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.200
talked about that on the App Clinic.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.960
We've talked a lot about how you can make
apps interesting, you might wanna just go

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.980
ahead and remove this overlay.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.200
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: No.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.420
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No?

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.420
[Laughter]

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.420
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Don't do that.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.420
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Don't ask Joe to do things.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.420
Hey look!

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.420
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That we can do.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.420
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Ah.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.420
Okay, rock on.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.420
Nice.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.060
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ah, I see you've put yourself
in frame and now I'm off a little.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yep.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.060
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's nice.

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.060
That's awesome.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.230
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, uh, you know, producer
Alex did-

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.230
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We can be friends.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.230
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.230
Hey, I was way over here.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.410
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I know you were.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.600
I'm not saying that, you know,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.830
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know I was.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.120
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I have-

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.120
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I set it up.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.400
I spent time getting this right.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.400
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.400
Here's the point.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.020
We've talked a lot about how to make a great
app on this show but we haven't necessarily

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.580
covered the merchandising aspect quite as
much and there's a reason for that.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.850
We're not merchandising people but there are
some things that we can share with you about

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.150
app merchandising that will really help you
because there's things that aren't necessarily

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.639
obvious about how you upload your app into
the Google Play store and the most important

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:19.320
thing, the thing that a lot of people get
wrong, is failing to include the giant feature

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.320
graphic.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.750
There's one graphic, I can't remember if it's
just called X Large or maybe it's web or something

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.320
but you'll know it because the dimensions
are giant.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.523
It's 700 by 500 or something.

00:05:29.523 --> 00:05:30.523
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's a big image.

00:05:30.523 --> 00:05:32.860
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: 1024 by, anyway, it's-

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.110
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's big.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.110
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's the one that's really
large and a lot of people leave that out and

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.420
they don't really notice it because the phone
only uses that in one place.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.120
And the only place that image gets used is
if your app is featured, then that image will

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.120
be used.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.120
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That seems important.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.810
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But, the web page for your
app will use that as the main graphic.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.090
You can see that the web page still fits together
fine without a feature graphic, it just doesn't

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.520
look quite as good.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:09.060
But the important thing is we can't feature
your app unless that graphic exists.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.060
So keep that in mind when you're creating
that graphic.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.260
A couple other things to keep in mind are
that the graphic does get scaled down for

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:17.260
different devices.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.360
So on a very small phone, for instance, that
graphic that's, you know, 1,000 pixels wide

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.910
may end up only being an inch across.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.370
So you do need to make sure that your graphic
is not only large but legible at different

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.370
sizes.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:30.370
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.370
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Let's go ahead and move on.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:32.370
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Excellent.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.210
So, we're gonna have a look at Yoga Timer
so that's the first piece of feedback for

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.400
them is that there is no feature graphic.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.140
But let's have a quick look, so we're gonna
do this the same sort of format that we did

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.010
last week, we're gonna have a quick look through
each of the apps and then we're gonna show

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:49.040
you guys what we think it takes to make a
great timer and stopwatch app and then have

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.450
a look at some of these apps in comparison
to each other keeping those prescriptions

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.450
in mind.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:54.450
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.889
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So let's switch to the phone
cam if we can.

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:57.889
Awesome work.

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.400
See, Joe's doing a much better job at this
than we are.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.570
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Actually, that's true.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:11.290
Now, I spent my week drinking in Maui and
doing blow so Reto's gonna review these apps

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:14.949
and I'm gonna sit back and have a Black Butte
Porter from Deschutes Brewery.

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:15.949
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:16.949
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Go ahead.

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:17.949
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Let me know how that goes on.

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:23.389
So Yoga Timer is an app designed specifically
around being able to create timers to do Yoga

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:24.389
workouts.

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:29.110
So you can see straight away we've got a holo
themed layout which is nice.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.930
Please add workout, so we've got a blank screen
but it's telling us what we need to do to

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.930
make something happen.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.930
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We've got an icon which has
a little plus symbol which is kind of the

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.340
Android symbol for click to make something
happen.

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.290
So let's create a quick workout; App Yoga.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.750
This is what we do before and after each show
to loosen up.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.650
Let's see, pre show, pre, well interesting.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:58.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now one thing that applies
to this app but it isn't necessarily a timer

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.340
app is it, it's more broadly applicable, a
lot of times you see this thing where you,

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.280
this sort of behavior where you have to enter
something or create something to get started

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:14.850
with an app and one of my pet peeves is this
sort of behavior where I have to create something

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.949
and it involves typing.

00:08:15.949 --> 00:08:16.949
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yes.

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:20.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And I know that there are
people that are more nimble fingered than

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.169
I am.

00:08:21.169 --> 00:08:24.990
Apparently some CEOs compose their entire
annual report on phones.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.360
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: On phones?

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.360
Wow.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.900
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But for me, especially when
I've just downloaded your app and I'm trying

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:37.419
to decide whether to return it or not, I don't
want to have to sit there typing, maybe pre

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:39.639
fill those fields with something that sort
of makes sense.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:40.639
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:44.480
So it just gives you an idea of what the app
is for, like a sample, an example workout.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.220
Something like that I think would be a good
tip.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.220
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.100
If you're, if you wanna go the extra mile,
make that something that will auto fill if

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.070
you don't type but as soon as you start typing
it'll go away immediately.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh, I like that.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.220
So let's navigate in here.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:00.209
So, again, now there's a second step.

00:09:00.209 --> 00:09:05.480
So we've got App Yoga, now we need to add
a timer for that particular exercise.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.149
Oops.

00:09:07.149 --> 00:09:08.249
Tricky for an angle.

00:09:08.249 --> 00:09:10.801
So they've got an interesting mechanism here
for doing this.

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:14.139
So you can drag things along instead of having
to type which is nice.

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:16.029
I'm not gonna do a 3 hour workout.

00:09:16.029 --> 00:09:17.029
Alright, so.

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:20.029
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Although I am kind of curious
why they don't just use the spinners.

00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:21.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:23.079
It's kind of an odd choice.

00:09:23.079 --> 00:09:25.970
We're actually hoping to be able to speak
to some of the developers from these apps

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:26.970
next week.

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:29.459
So that's a question we might pose to them.

00:09:29.459 --> 00:09:31.850
So yeah, keep that in mind if you guys are
watching.

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.899
So now we have an activity and we have a timer
for it.

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:36.540
We can have multiple activities and multiple
timers.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.930
And if we click here things start to happen.

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.069
Now we have the, you know, standard sort of
countdown timer.

00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:47.839
We can pause, got some kind of nice little
animations in there for pausing and resuming.

00:09:47.839 --> 00:09:52.839
We have it here in the notifications and,
in fact, rich notification so that's nice.

00:09:52.839 --> 00:09:58.680
That's basically all there is to so it's a
fairly simple app for a specific purpose and

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.629
I know that the developer of this, this is
pretty new, I know he was putting this together

00:10:01.629 --> 00:10:05.089
hopefully in time so that we would be able
to review it for the show.

00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:09.180
So, but, you know, straight forward layout,
you got settings behind the settings and the

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.029
overflow in the action bar, does what it needs
to.

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:15.329
The only sort of criticism is exactly as you
suggested.

00:10:15.329 --> 00:10:19.839
It's, you can't get started right away, you
have to do text entry, text entry, time entry

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:20.839
before you can get started.

00:10:20.839 --> 00:10:26.579
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah and we've seen this a
lot in focus groups that we've done with consumers

00:10:26.579 --> 00:10:32.269
is that they were very frequently only giving
out 30 seconds or so before they decide to

00:10:32.269 --> 00:10:37.759
get rid of it and you definitely need to grab
them in the first few seconds.

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:45.920
We get a little jaded about things like tutorials
and stuff like that but I think that if the

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.769
consumer is comparing a couple different apps,
getting them into something interesting immediately

00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:52.769
is paramount.

00:10:52.769 --> 00:10:53.769
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:58.319
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The only other thing that
I'd suggest is that honestly, I found the

00:10:58.319 --> 00:11:03.399
ad really confusing because it occupies the
same mental space as the list items.

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:04.399
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:06.040
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What do you think?

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.240
I was gonna say this should maybe be at the
bottom.

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.240
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I was wondering about that.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.290
The bottom is kind of a more standard place
for it.

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.809
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So that the mental cognition
here it's like action bar and then ad and

00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:16.759
then content, struck me as a little bit odd
as well.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.990
So, yeah, I'd consider shifting that.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.639
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think the ad is more visible
that way.

00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:24.089
I think you're gonna get more clicks that
way but I think a lot of them are gonna be

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:25.089
accidental.

00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:26.500
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You wanna be careful about that
as well.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:27.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.120
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: A lot of the ad platforms have
guidelines against putting your ads anywhere

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.480
where it may accidentally be clicked.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.779
And I'm gonna be, you know, in fairness here
it's a little bit tricky because if you put

00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:39.370
it towards the bottom you could be trying
to hit navigation and accidentally hit the

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:42.749
ad, if you put it at the top you've got the
same problem with the action bar.

00:11:42.749 --> 00:11:48.040
So there's not really an obvious answer but
this, I think, just from a usability perspective,

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:51.259
seems like it's gonna be too easy to hit the
button by mistake.

00:11:51.259 --> 00:11:52.529
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:53.529
It's a great app though.

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:54.529
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:55.529
It's a great app.

00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:58.221
It's nice and clean and we'll get into some
of the specifics about it later but that's

00:11:58.221 --> 00:11:59.580
the functionality, nice and simple.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.509
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, they themed it nicely
which I love that.

00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:03.509
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:07.259
It's a standard action bar but with definitely
a color scheme that's consistent for that.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:08.259
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:12:08.259 --> 00:12:12.249
So, yeah, I think the only other thing that
I would say is I think that this should probably

00:12:12.249 --> 00:12:13.910
be centered or something like that.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.170
What does it do when you go into portrait,
or into landscape, though?

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:17.170
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's a good question.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.220
Well, I think it's a list view, right?

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.220
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It is a list view.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.541
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So a little centered there so
we can add several timers here.

00:12:21.541 --> 00:12:23.470
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, I see.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:24.720
So that's why, yeah.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.720
Gotcha.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:26.720
Okay.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.720
Cool, alright.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.720
Let's move on.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Alright.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.290
So let's have a look.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:35.519
The next app we're gonna have a look at is
Timer, Alarm, Stopwatch and Clock.

00:12:35.519 --> 00:12:41.209
And, as you can see, again, no feature graphic
here either so, again, so this is and app

00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:45.920
where when I first looked at it on Google
Play I wasn't expecting much.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:46.920
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:52.149
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's kind of, it's a very busy
icon which, you know, if I look at it now

00:12:52.149 --> 00:12:55.189
I can figure out what it is but it doesn't
really strike me.

00:12:55.189 --> 00:13:00.449
And there's no feature graphics so I was a
little bit apprehensive to begin with.

00:13:00.449 --> 00:13:06.679
The good news is when I actually opened up
the app, it's actually pretty nice.

00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:11.629
So we've got the holo theming right off the
bat, it does exactly what we asked for before

00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:13.410
in that you can press the button and it starts.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:14.410
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yep.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:16.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So you've got the stopwatch
functionality there, I didn't have to do anything

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.759
other than click it.

00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:20.709
And right away now as a user I go oh, okay.

00:13:20.709 --> 00:13:22.179
Well, this is quite nice-

00:13:22.179 --> 00:13:23.910
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's pretty too.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.550
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, it's nice, right?

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.649
You've got the Roboto fonts, ridiculously
fast moving thousands indicator.

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:30.079
So I'm pretty happy.

00:13:30.079 --> 00:13:34.959
I hit lap and I get my lap time, it fades
in nicely, it's got more theme color.

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:35.959
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni- Lewis: Oh, that is nice.

00:13:35.959 --> 00:13:36.959
Yeah, I like the fade in.

00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:37.959
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's pretty nice, right?

00:13:37.959 --> 00:13:41.410
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I mean there's a few things,
I'm really excited to see what Roman has to

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:45.879
say about this next week because, to me, it
seems like they've done everything right and

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:52.320
yet something is slightly off and I think
what that means is it needs a designer to

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.269
just go in and kind of lay it out and put
finishing touches on it.

00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:58.930
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think this is a recent redesign
from these guys.

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:03.319
I think released just yesterday or, in fact,
early this morning specifically so we could

00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:04.319
check out the new stuff.

00:14:04.319 --> 00:14:06.449
So I think it's a first pass on a new design.

00:14:06.449 --> 00:14:07.449
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:14:07.449 --> 00:14:08.449
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's looking pretty good.

00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:11.949
But, yeah, it feels like they may be little
things that can be done.

00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:19.080
So we're gonna pause the, pause the stopwatch
so we can go to a countdown timer and so I

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:23.199
clicked that, same as I did the stopwatch,
and it tells me that you need to add a counter

00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:24.199
in order to be able to have that counter.

00:14:24.199 --> 00:14:25.199
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now it does that with the
toast.

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:30.009
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I would kind of prefer that
if I do this, rather than tell me that, it

00:14:30.009 --> 00:14:32.059
just does the equivalent of loading up that
button.

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:33.059
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right?

00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:36.860
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Seems like it, I can see why
you have it here as well, that's reasonable.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.489
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, but it really reminds
me of that, do you remember the part in the

00:14:41.489 --> 00:14:48.070
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy when Arthur
and Ford are in the spaceship and somebody

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:53.749
pushes a button and he's like, "What'd that
do?" and the guy says, "Oh, a little light

00:14:53.749 --> 00:14:55.769
popped up that said please do not press this
button again."

00:14:55.769 --> 00:14:58.569
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's what I feel like when

00:14:58.569 --> 00:14:59.569
you do that.

00:14:59.569 --> 00:15:00.569
Its like, "Oh, you interacted with my UI?

00:15:00.569 --> 00:15:01.569
But not the way I expected."

00:15:01.569 --> 00:15:03.269
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's not the way you're supposed
to do it.

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:05.809
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, don't be doing that.

00:15:05.809 --> 00:15:12.040
I think that, I think it's a little more courteous
to just assume what your users wanted.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.110
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly it makes sense.

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.959
You've got the add counter button here and
fair enough, have that too, but let's do both.

00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:17.959
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:15:17.959 --> 00:15:21.010
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So, okay, again, the button
star here is a little bit odd.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:25.200
Again, it's this, it's a very attractive looking
app and then you've got kind of an orphan

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.319
button sitting by itself.

00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:30.079
Sort of floating in the middle so I'd consider
maybe moving that around but I'm gonna leave

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:32.639
that to the design guys to say their opinion.

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:37.609
We've got these standard spinners here which
you can actually see is a pretty intuitive

00:15:37.609 --> 00:15:38.661
way of changing the time.

00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:44.350
So maybe that's a tip for the Yoga guys there
is this actually isn't a bad way of doing

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.350
it.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.929
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No, it's pretty alright.

00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:51.949
It's, I think the way that the yoga guys did
it makes sense but it's just not as intuitive.

00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:53.160
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.519
So we can see here it's added a timer.

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:59.670
Again, I would probably be tempted to automatically,
so now to set the timer I need to click here

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.759
which then assigns it to here and then I click
it again to get started.

00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:06.259
Now, if I'm adding a timer I think it probably
makes sense to-

00:16:06.259 --> 00:16:07.259
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Automatically select it.

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:08.259
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: automatically select that for
you.

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:09.259
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:10.259
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Don't automatically start.

00:16:10.259 --> 00:16:11.259
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, unless the-

00:16:11.259 --> 00:16:12.259
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Just select it.

00:16:12.259 --> 00:16:13.649
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If there's a timer going maybe
you don't wanna do that.

00:16:13.649 --> 00:16:16.329
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sure, sure, if there's already
a timer in action that's a different story.

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:18.019
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What happens if we add multiple
counters?

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.019
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Let's have a look.

00:16:19.019 --> 00:16:22.889
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So the, we've got a new counter

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:25.279
down here, the old one continues.

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:30.579
I assume that if we, yeah, so once you click
a new timer it resets.

00:16:30.579 --> 00:16:33.300
I don't know if it wants a warning there or
not, probably not.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:36.569
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Might wanna do a conformation
because you are losing work.

00:16:36.569 --> 00:16:37.569
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:41.160
So you don't wanna be like, oh but I was just
clicking it to edit it and that's not how

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.160
you edit.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.660
Then that's pretty annoying.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:49.660
You can see here, as well, we have a countdown
timer which is nice and, in fact, I think

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.660
it's even progressing.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.660
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:52.660
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I didn't actually notice this
before.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.660
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That is cool.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.660
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: But that's really slick.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:55.660
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.269
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You can see, probably just here,
the little blue circle representing the amount

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:01.290
of total time remaining as well as the active
countdown.

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:02.290
I really like this.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.199
I think this is it shows two things to me.

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:08.579
One that there is an ongoing foreground service
running so that my timer isn't gonna stop

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:12.740
just because I'm browsing and using up all
my memory and I don't need to go back into

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:14.370
the app to see how much time I've got remaining.

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:15.370
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.689
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Which is fantastic.

00:17:16.689 --> 00:17:22.760
So, again, we click to pause or click again
or we can reset that, we can delete these,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:25.339
they disappear, all of that works really nice.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:29.700
We have alarm functionality which works the
way you would expect it to and a nice little

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.980
tip here as well, they've got a world clock
which is nice.

00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.179
Totally, you know, not something I was expecting
to have as part of a stopwatch and timer app

00:17:37.179 --> 00:17:38.360
but, you know, why not?

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.370
If you're doing stuff with numbers.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:45.419
Overall the theming I think looks great, we've
got, I guess, a full screen button here for

00:17:45.419 --> 00:17:46.510
the world clock that's quite nice.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.510
Don't know what that does, ah.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Ah, change it to daytime mode.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.780
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So we can actually switch modes.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.780
That's interesting.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.780
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I like that.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.809
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So if you prefer the white,
I think this one's a little-

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:59.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It doesn't appear to have
been designed for, yeah.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.990
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:05.590
So, and I note here that I can't actually
change it from here I need to, well I see

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.590
it's dropped down into the-

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:07.990
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, switch theme, yeah.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.860
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's dropped into the overflow
menu.

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.900
That's interesting.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.900
That is interesting.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.570
That's probably a reasonable way of doing
things, having it in the action bar if there's

00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:18.570
room.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.590
I would say, though, that this theme looks
a little less polished than the dark theme.

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.260
I think a lot of people prefer the white theme,
I think you probably wanna tweak your colors

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:28.419
particularly down here on the lap timing a
little bit.

00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:31.160
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It looks like they just haven't
gotten around to that yet.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.160
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.630
And knowing that this is a relatively recent
release I'd say that's fair enough.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:37.789
So this one did a little bit of everything
and it looks pretty nice.

00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:38.789
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's not bad.

00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:39.789
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's not bad at all.

00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:40.789
Let's have a look.

00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:43.950
We're gonna move onto Impetus Interval Timer
next.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.330
So this one does have a feature graphic.

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.130
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But it's a terrible feature
graphic.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:49.130
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's not good.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.029
It has a huge amount of text all over the
place.

00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:55.420
I should point out that our green screen is
what is making the-

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:57.059
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's true.

00:18:57.059 --> 00:18:59.309
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: The middle part there, see?

00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:00.740
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, ohhhh!

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.389
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: There we go.

00:19:02.389 --> 00:19:03.409
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:04.409
Ahhh!

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:05.409
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Nice.

00:19:05.409 --> 00:19:08.290
You know, that would be a much better feature
graphic.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:10.880
No, so, in fact, that part is us at least.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.100
But in any case you can see here that it's
a feature graphic full of text and one of

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:20.760
the big places that this is gonna get used
is when it's shrunk down for featuring and

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.659
none of that's gonna be visible.

00:19:22.659 --> 00:19:26.019
And even still, this is more what you would
expect from the screen shots rather than from

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:27.019
a feature graphic.

00:19:27.019 --> 00:19:30.549
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, in fact, you should
never put screen shots in a feature graphic.

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:35.640
We will never feature something that just
has a screen shot in the feature graphic.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:41.690
And, in fact, and this goes for a lot of things
like I've seen games with screen shots in

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.559
the feature graphic and that's no good.

00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:49.620
What you really have to ask yourself is when
you go into a software store, let's say you're

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.691
going into Best Buy and you're gonna buy some
kind of software, I don't care if it's a game

00:19:53.691 --> 00:19:56.870
or if it's a business suite or whatever, what
do you see on the front of the box ?

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:59.930
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, it's not a screen shot.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:00.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:01.930
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's usually some sort of

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.669
beautiful art, sometimes it's conceptual.

00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:05.159
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Which makes you go, "Oh, this
is professional.

00:20:05.159 --> 00:20:06.740
They paid a designer to do this."

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.870
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now where do you find the
screen shots?

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.620
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Screen shots you find when you're
playing the game.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:16.019
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, that's not the answer
I was looking for but the answer I wanted

00:20:16.019 --> 00:20:17.289
was on the back of the box.

00:20:17.289 --> 00:20:18.289
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Back of the box.

00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:19.289
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:20:19.289 --> 00:20:21.750
But that's okay because I know you only buy
software digitally these days.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Right, box, what is this box
of which you speak?

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:24.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.340
They've completely gotten rid of them in the
rest of the world.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.340
[Laughter]

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Here we're still playing football
with a ball that's not round.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:31.820
So.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:32.820
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Weird.

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:36.669
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The point is that you do wanna
have screen shots but the place that they

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:41.111
go is in the little screen shot column where
everybody expects them to be and you should

00:20:41.111 --> 00:20:43.700
have something beautiful and conceptual on
your feature graphic.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.549
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly and you've got a nice
icon as well.

00:20:45.549 --> 00:20:47.659
That's exactly the idea we're talking about.

00:20:47.659 --> 00:20:51.740
It's conceptual, it's artistic, it looks nice,
gets you an idea of what it is.

00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:56.080
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know what, actually, I
have to mention that since you brought up

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.080
icons.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.350
The one thing, the one thing about Yoga Timer
that really needs to change is it's icon.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.350
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:04.480
Looking at it now I agree.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:14.399
In general, the guidelines for Android icons
are that it should be the outline of the icon.

00:21:14.399 --> 00:21:17.980
It should not be a square or a rounded rectangle
or something like that.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:20.870
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Distinctive shape or distinctive
outline, I think, is the guidelines.

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:21.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.230
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Alright, let's have a look at
Impetus.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:28.700
If I can click it.

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:34.470
So, right away I start this up and this one's
a little confusing.

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.340
It's not obvious to me straight away what's
going on.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.730
There's a lot of text on screen.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.450
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well, apparently to you've
finished.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.450
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Well, indeed.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:41.580
So, let's move on.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:43.820
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's not fair.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:48.130
So that's kind of the biggest challenge here
that you need to figure out what's going on.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.390
So if you click on edit you get an idea that,
oh okay, this seems to be some sort of exercise

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:54.400
timer rather than just a straight up timer.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.580
So that's themed and that's fine but, again,
nothing was obvious about that in the name

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.330
or in the feature graphic, nothing was telling
me, "Hey this is an exercise timer."

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.539
So go back to timer.

00:22:05.539 --> 00:22:08.850
I click on stuff, that's not doing anything.

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:09.850
You can hit "go."

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:10.850
no time set.

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:12.410
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: In a toast again.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.060
Please do not press this button again.

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:16.909
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, so now I've got some presets.

00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:19.570
So I can say, let's do pyramid preset.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:21.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh okay.

00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:22.210
So now we're gonna-

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.330
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Now we're gonna work out.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.620
So we don't exactly know what it is we're
doing.

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.670
I don't know what pyramids are but that's
probably-

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.789
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I thought I knew what pyramids
are but I'm struggling to make it make sense

00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:33.789
with this.

00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:37.520
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So the overall way that it's
displaying things with the progress timer

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:43.259
here is nice, you know, showing us the total
time and the time for each repetition, or

00:22:43.259 --> 00:22:48.769
in this case rest is nice, we've got lots
of notifications.

00:22:48.769 --> 00:22:54.300
Let's see, alright, so we can see that we've
got an Impetus session in progress.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.760
It isn't rich, it doesn't show the ongoing
details but, you know, at least it's going.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.780
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: At least it gets you going.

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.880
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Which is a good start.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880
We can pause-

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Oh, I know what it's doing,
right, it's you do a little rest, you do a

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.840
little more then rest, you do a little more
then rest, yeah.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:12.980
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, so it's, I've heard of
this as a way to build up your endurance training

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.980
for running and stuff.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:14.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I guess so.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.240
I've never done it with time, I've always
done it with reps.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.809
But that's because I have no endurance nor
need for any endurance really.

00:23:21.809 --> 00:23:22.809
[Laughter]

00:23:22.809 --> 00:23:23.809
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Fair enough.

00:23:23.809 --> 00:23:24.809
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Just raw strength.

00:23:24.809 --> 00:23:25.970
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Raw strength, that's what it's
all about.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:26.970
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.450
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So you can see we've got these
alarms and these kind of fall off the edge

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:31.850
of the screen here, you can see-

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:32.850
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's odd.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:34.750
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: that isn't great.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.400
This whole dialogue is a little odd like how
do I dismiss it?

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.080
Is it the back button?

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.080
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is but it's not a standard
dialogue which-

00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.950
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now is that all hooked in
into the, no, in fact, check that out.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:46.269
I'm just pressing the volume keys.

00:23:46.269 --> 00:23:48.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, it's overridden the volume
keys.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.720
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.230
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I guess maybe if we bring this
up.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.230
No.

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.230
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But certainly not in a-

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:54.940
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's just very strange.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.940
Yeah, so.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:59.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm at a loss to explain what
they've done there.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.340
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Something custom's been done
there and it's not something good.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:02.340
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's right.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:05.370
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Let's see, so we can, this is
how we create new presets.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:09.809
So, you know, I was clicking here, we can
use the existing presets, abandon the current

00:24:09.809 --> 00:24:14.049
session so you can't browse for a new set
while you're doing one which I guess makes

00:24:14.049 --> 00:24:18.409
sense cause you're in the middle of an exercise
you really shouldn't be looking at things.

00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:19.409
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:24:19.409 --> 00:24:23.100
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Then you can do all of your
new presets, save preset, again, seems like

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.600
you created a new one you should have already
been able to save it.

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.720
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well that's true.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:32.260
Actually, seeing a save button, in general,
is sort of a bad smell to me in UI design

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.260
now.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:38.649
It used to be important because you were saving
to, you know, floppy discs or something, right?

00:24:38.649 --> 00:24:46.679
For a long time the only reason to have a
save function is so you can give whatever

00:24:46.679 --> 00:24:49.660
it is you're saving a name.

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:56.049
When you don't need a name or if you can give
it a default name, you should just save automatically.

00:24:56.049 --> 00:24:57.350
There's no reason not to.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.519
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Alright.

00:24:58.519 --> 00:25:01.640
So then I guess I have to save.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.889
Yeah, so the workflow around this is kind
of complicated and not entirely obvious.

00:25:06.889 --> 00:25:12.780
I'm gonna leave the guys from Android Design
and Action to sort of go into some of the

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.780
details about the design.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.050
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I don't know if they're going
to talk about this one.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:17.050
It's got-

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:18.480
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think they are.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.860
I think that they like a challenge.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.789
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I don't know.

00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:27.140
Okay, but all I'm saying is I don't wanna
be anywhere near Roman on Monday.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.140
[Laughter]

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.889
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: See this is where Roman is being
very clever.

00:25:29.889 --> 00:25:34.809
He's not in on Tuesday so the other guys,
Adam, Nick, Rich, they're gonna be doing the

00:25:34.809 --> 00:25:41.289
design show with Roman's help in creating
some marks but the rage will be elsewhere

00:25:41.289 --> 00:25:42.289
at home probably drinking.

00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:46.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I'm joking a little bit but
the truth is that this app breaks almost all

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.350
of our UI guidelines.

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:53.830
There's custom buttons that don't quite work,
there's these buttons down here, you can't

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:58.410
quite see them let me just lift that up, it's
difficult to tell on screen but these buttons

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:03.389
have a little border around them which A,
they don't need, B, looks shabby.

00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:04.409
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:26:04.409 --> 00:26:08.460
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We call that the x motif style
of Android design.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.430
We're trying to get away from that.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:12.930
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, so this seems like it's
a fairly useful app.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:18.660
I like that it's a news theme, it's not just
a timer and it's able to build a workout flow

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.759
around timing but I think the workflow around
being able to get things set up and going

00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:27.200
is a little bit contrived, a little bit difficult
to understand and the overall look and feel,

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.340
I think if we compare it to some of the other
apps we've looked at today could do a little

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.340
bit of work.

00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:33.340
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.850
Now, I just wanted to break in for a second
and remind everyone that's watching that producer

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:41.320
Alex is monitoring the live stream, diligently.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.320
Right?

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.700
&gt;&gt; Reto Meier: That's what diligent looks
like.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.590
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So if you have anything you'd
like to ask or some comments you'd like to

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:54.680
make, please go ahead and let us know because
we do this live for two reasons; one, so that

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.610
we have an excuse for all the mistakes that
we're sure to make and two, because we'd like

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:00.840
to have your input.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.840
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Absolutely.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:06.029
Let's move on to the next app which is going
to be the Hybrid Stopwatch and Timer.

00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:07.789
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I wanna buy that right now.

00:27:07.789 --> 00:27:08.789
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This really caught my eye.

00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:09.789
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:27:09.789 --> 00:27:13.559
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I clicked through a dozen or
so timer and stopwatch apps when selecting

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:18.159
them for today's show and I got to this and
I was like, oh I can't way to play with this.

00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:19.159
This looks cool.

00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:20.159
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It looks beautiful.

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:24.710
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's got this great icon, this
massive feature graphic which is just totally

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:28.860
in your face and if you compare this to the
screenshots we took of the other listings,

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:30.009
it's just night and day, right?

00:27:30.009 --> 00:27:31.009
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:33.289
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's like; clearly someone's
put in some effort here.

00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:37.499
And to be honest it looks like it's basically
effort done once.

00:27:37.499 --> 00:27:41.679
Like they put in the effort to create something
which is an awesome looking stopwatch and

00:27:41.679 --> 00:27:43.490
then they've just used that as their theme
throughout.

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:47.730
And I have a hunch that when we open up the
app it's gonna look pretty similar which is

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:51.809
exactly what you want, you know, give people
the idea of what they're gonna get without

00:27:51.809 --> 00:27:55.570
having to get to, you know, screen shot like.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:56.570
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:57.929
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Okay, so let's have a look.

00:27:57.929 --> 00:28:03.600
So, the Hybrid Stopwatch, we open it up and
boom, looks like exactly what we would expect

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.600
to get.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.249
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I believe that's what we call
in the business skeuomorphic.

00:28:06.249 --> 00:28:08.490
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Possibly.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.980
Yeah, yeah.

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:14.020
So, as you can see, it works as you would
expect.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:18.749
We hit start and it starts and we see the
timer on the top going off, we see the little

00:28:18.749 --> 00:28:21.360
dial going around which is nice.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:24.539
Stop stops it, nice the button depresses and
undepresses.

00:28:24.539 --> 00:28:29.999
Now this doesn't use the Android design guidelines
at all but I don't think it's necessarily

00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:30.999
a problem.

00:28:30.999 --> 00:28:33.659
Now I know the guys are gonna look at this
as well and I'm sure they've got some ideas

00:28:33.659 --> 00:28:38.299
to make it a little more holo like while still
maintaining the same, sort of, overall look

00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:40.519
and feel but just generally speaking-

00:28:40.519 --> 00:28:41.769
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, this is great.

00:28:41.769 --> 00:28:43.299
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I'm not bothered that there's,
you know-

00:28:43.299 --> 00:28:46.440
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah and that's one thing
that we should say, too, I think that a lot

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.169
of times on the show we're saying, oh they
don't have an action bar or they've messed

00:28:50.169 --> 00:28:56.389
this up and the truth is we don't want every
app to look the same.

00:28:56.389 --> 00:29:00.350
We want all Android apps to look the way that's
gonna be most effective.

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:01.350
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's right.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.549
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So when we say you're not
following the design guidelines what we usually

00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:09.419
mean is it looks as if you might have been
trying to follow the design guidelines and

00:29:09.419 --> 00:29:10.789
you got it wrong.

00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:12.260
These guys went a completely different way.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.260
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: They really did.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.720
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's intuitive; it's very
beautiful, great.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.809
We have no problem with that.

00:29:18.809 --> 00:29:21.679
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Right, if everything works the
way it would and I really like their attention

00:29:21.679 --> 00:29:22.679
to detail here.

00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:27.280
So when I push stop, if I hit reset, it's
actually gonna move the needle back, right?

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.580
That's nice because that's what a mechanical
device would do.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:30.580
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.610
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You go along, you hit lap and
it leaves a little marker behind for each

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.269
lap timings which is nice.

00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:42.879
Let's see, now it does use the old style menu
button which is a bit of a shame.

00:29:42.879 --> 00:29:43.879
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: What is it?

00:29:43.879 --> 00:29:44.879
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: But it does do stuff so we'll
lift it up here.

00:29:44.879 --> 00:29:45.879
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:29:45.879 --> 00:29:47.200
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So you see it's got the menu.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.659
Given that you have a menu button it would
be kind of nice now to have an action bar

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:53.210
to hold it in that more modern style.

00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:54.210
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.509
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You know, you've got such a
nice looking app it's kind of a shame.

00:29:56.509 --> 00:30:01.010
But if we go through each of these, like,
lap times, it's all, again, same sort of,

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.470
oops you can't see it, same theme style, consistent
which is nice.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:13.269
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I will say that, as we've
said before, the gradient effect can look

00:30:13.269 --> 00:30:18.220
really nice but when it's just applied over
and over again it sort of looks like, wow,

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.480
I guess somebody got a hold of Photoshop this
week.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.460
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, it's a little bit of the
lens flare effect, it kind of looked cool

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.029
when no one else could do it but now everyone
can do it and it doesn’t look quite so cool.

00:30:28.029 --> 00:30:32.240
Send laps, unfortunately this should just
be a share intent rather than e-mail and SD

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.240
card.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:34.240
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.240
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I should just send it however
I want.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.880
If I wanna tell my friends on Twitter how
fast I can run then I should be able to do

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:39.880
so.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:42.889
Now you can switch to timers, kind of the
other key here.

00:30:42.889 --> 00:30:45.120
So they've got kind of a custom standard theme.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.539
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Which is too bad because this
is how Android used to work and it wasn't

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:54.460
very easy to use and now we've gone to the
spinner that you can fling which is a much

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:59.429
better design and it's too bad to see this
sort of thing still popping up.

00:30:59.429 --> 00:31:03.409
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: This is a real risk that you
have if you go, oh I almost like what the

00:31:03.409 --> 00:31:06.730
platform has done there but I wanna create
something which looks a little bit nicer so

00:31:06.730 --> 00:31:11.559
I'm going to modify it slightly but then the
platform changes under you and you get stuck

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:15.309
with a slightly nicer version of a crappy
old way of doing things rather than sort of

00:31:15.309 --> 00:31:17.600
straight away getting the advantage of the
shiny new way.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.799
Just something to keep in mind.

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:24.159
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Can't, you know, I first noticed
this in Windows '95 when I was working with

00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:29.559
Novell and they had a whole set of apps where
they'd rewritten parts of the windowing system

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:33.100
and so, I don't know if you remember Windows
'95 came out and they had the three buttons

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:38.639
on the right and they had the title moved
over to the left side and Novell still had

00:31:38.639 --> 00:31:41.549
all these old windows that looked like Windows
3.1 and it was terrible.

00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:42.549
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's unfortunate.

00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:44.039
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It is unfortunate.

00:31:44.039 --> 00:31:49.549
But you can see how you could; you could move
some of the activity that's going on here

00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:50.730
into an action bar.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.409
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Oh sure and the action bar would
say whether it's timer or stopwatch, you'd

00:31:53.409 --> 00:31:58.629
have like potentially tabs or something to
be able to switch between the two.

00:31:58.629 --> 00:32:03.509
I don't wanna step on the guys from Android
App Design and Action so.

00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:08.909
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But I did wanna point one
thing out about that which is, you know, we've

00:32:08.909 --> 00:32:13.399
called this the button of shame and it's a
little bit, you know, obviously you shouldn't

00:32:13.399 --> 00:32:15.710
be ashamed of having a menu.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:20.249
The main reason to switch to the new technique,
though, is because action bars work in one

00:32:20.249 --> 00:32:26.179
very specific predictable way whereas this
button is now being implemented in many different

00:32:26.179 --> 00:32:27.480
ways by different manufacturers.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.480
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Very true.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.480
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:30.480
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So you can see the timer actually
works nicely.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:34.490
It goes in a reverse direction to the stopwatch
which is intuitive, makes sense; we can see

00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:38.769
the overall time being displayed as well as
each minute.

00:32:38.769 --> 00:32:42.990
We can see we do have the timer set up here
as well; it does display in the notifications,

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:44.350
again, not a rich notification.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:45.350
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Not as cool as that other
one, though.

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:46.350
That was the best.

00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:47.700
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It is updating but only every
minute.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.700
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.700
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It should.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.119
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: YouTube wants to know if it
rotates.

00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:55.519
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Does it rotate?

00:32:55.519 --> 00:32:56.519
No.

00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:57.519
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nope.

00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:58.519
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Sadly it does not.

00:32:58.519 --> 00:32:59.519
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Sorry, YouTube.

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:00.519
[Laughter]

00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:03.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Was that a particular commenter
or just YouTube as an, as an entirety?

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.399
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: Just a particular commenter.

00:33:05.399 --> 00:33:06.419
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay.

00:33:06.419 --> 00:33:07.440
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Alright.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.340
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: Someone on YouTube wrote it.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.610
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Someone on YouTube.

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:11.879
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Who was it?

00:33:11.879 --> 00:33:12.899
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: Um, BRK5.

00:33:12.899 --> 00:33:13.899
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: BRK5.

00:33:13.899 --> 00:33:15.190
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Hey there Brooke 5.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.529
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It does not rotate.

00:33:17.529 --> 00:33:20.710
Okay, so that's, I think that sums this up
pretty nicely.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:26.869
We're gonna do a really quick stop at the
Ultimate Stopwatch and Timer by team member

00:33:26.869 --> 00:33:27.869
Richard Hyndman.

00:33:27.869 --> 00:33:28.869
So we,

00:33:28.869 --> 00:33:29.869
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Isn't it Hindsman?

00:33:29.869 --> 00:33:30.869
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I don't know.

00:33:30.869 --> 00:33:35.350
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I finally said Hyndman and
then I sort of laugh, I snicker a bit.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's why I kind of don't-

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.129
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright, Rich, let's see your
app.

00:33:38.129 --> 00:33:41.809
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We've only known him for like
three years, God forbid we know his name.

00:33:41.809 --> 00:33:43.080
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Sure Reto.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:45.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ian, nice to meet you.

00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:46.290
[Laughter]

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You don't know what you've
uncorked.

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:50.730
[Laughter]

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You've got the teeth to be an
Ian.

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.539
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Wow.

00:33:54.539 --> 00:33:55.990
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Awkward.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.429
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, let's go.

00:33:58.429 --> 00:34:02.049
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Ultimate Stopwatch and Timer
by geekyouup.

00:34:02.049 --> 00:34:03.769
So this is truly skeuomorphic.

00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:09.540
So this looks like a picture of a stopwatch
and if you press it the little stopwatch thing

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:10.540
releases.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.980
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Ah, that is cute.

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:12.980
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's pretty nice, right?

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:17.890
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I have to say, though, I liked
the last one better because when it's actually

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:22.380
a picture it's a little less obvious what's
active and what's not.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.150
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, this is true.

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:25.970
You know, everything kind of works the way
we want.

00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:28.540
You hit save time and it does lap times.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.740
He's using a toast to tell us that which is
a little unfortunate.

00:34:30.740 --> 00:34:33.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Why are you using a toast
Rich?

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:37.110
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Rich, come on man.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:40.531
Each time, so we can start and stop and do
all this sort of stuff which is nice, display

00:34:40.531 --> 00:34:46.780
the lap times, he's got an action bar going,
you can switch to timer mode which actually

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:51.000
changes the color which is kind of interesting.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.370
And yeah, again, works the way you would.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.300
Doesn't use notifications at all, unfortunate.

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:58.690
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, it'd be nice to see
a rich notification there.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:34:59.900
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: A rich notification from Rich.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.900
[Laughter]

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.900
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Alright then.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:02.900
Let's-

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:03.900
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We're too much, too much.

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:04.900
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.060
In the last five minutes let's cover the last
30 minutes of our show.

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.060
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Indeed.

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So we're gonna try, I wonder
what was going on with the transitions at

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:13.650
the beginning.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:14.650
Just enough to try and screw me over.

00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:15.650
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right?

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:16.650
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: and keep me nervous for the
rest of it.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:22.210
So these are things that we think are, really
are required to make a great stopwatch or

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:23.210
timer app.

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:26.230
So it's, don't contradict the design guide
which is a little bit different to what we've

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:30.530
said in the past which is be consistent with
it and here we're thinking, well, we've looked

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:34.840
at these and there's a bunch of different
ways of showing the time so don't feel like

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:39.350
you have to stick to a, sort of, standard
list view action bar sort of paradigm, go

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:43.860
outside the box just don't contradict anything
which we said that you should be doing and,

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.580
you know, make sure that it's intuitive.

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:50.080
Include the functionality for timer and stopwatch
cause I don't want two separate apps if I

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:54.350
have one app which does one really well and
one app which does both almost as well, I'm

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:56.600
gonna install the single app.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.980
Notifications, foreground services we talked
about and keeping it simple, you know, really

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.870
easy to use as you step through.

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:03.870
So we're gonna look at, uh-

00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:07.590
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now I have to say, Reto, you
know I didn't say anything before because

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:12.140
when you put this together I was still in
Vegas coming down from a really bad acid trip,

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:17.300
but the one thing that I noticed on this list
that is missing is widgets.

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.800
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Widgets.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.800
Yeah, that's true.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.800
That's true.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.260
I did not even think to check if they had
widgets.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.600
So let's have a look.

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:30.920
Let's see, Analog clock, Beyondpod, we have
a lot of things installed from previous weeks,

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.900
I'm not seeing any for-

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:36.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: It's sort of seems like a
natural.

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:40.280
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think one of the problems
that you have, I guess you could use it to

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.310
start things cause you just don't wanna have
a widget which is getting updated as a timer

00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.310
app.

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:46.310
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis:Okay.

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.020
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Because that, you know, you
only really wanna be updating your widgets

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.000
every, I think, 20 minutes or something like
that.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I see.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.740
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: But as a quick way to start
it and then have it within your notifications

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.830
would actually be pretty neat.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:57.050
So that's cool.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:59.360
&gt;&gt;Ian NiI-Lewis: That's a good point.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:05.090
So this is one of the reasons you didn't put
widgets on is because updating widgets are

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:07.730
expensive, you don't wanna have that just
going on all the time.

00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:08.730
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.720
But having the ability to just have a set
timer on my home screen or be able to kick

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.350
off the stopwatch as a timer and then it,
you know, automatically starts displaying

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:17.350
things here.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:21.330
See now Ultimate Stopwatch does tell us when
it's complete just not while its ongoing.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:22.330
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:23.330
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Interesting.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.690
&gt;&gt;Ian NiI-Lewis: Yeah, I think what I loved
was that the one that actually counted down

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:31.770
but the one thing that I would have done differently,
but tell me if this is possible, because I'm

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:37.880
not too familiar with the notification code,
would it be possible to actually animate that

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:44.060
a little more because if you've got a long
timer it's just gonna crawl forward, right?

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:48.830
And I noticed that what basically all of the
operating systems we work with have moved

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:54.790
towards is this paradigm where if your progress
bar isn't making much progress at least it'll

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:59.910
be animating, you know, like I think Mac does
a barber pole effect and Windows, kind of,

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:06.550
has a shimmer and I don't know what Linux
does because I am not geeky enough but-

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.420
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Too much time in Vegas, not
enough time in a shell.

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly and you'll notice
I don't have a beard which means I may or

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.880
may not be able to program.

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:14.880
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's true.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.840
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If you can code there's no
reason to shave.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.700
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Here's a thing, though, if

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:28.320
your progress bar is not going fast, having
some animation at least lets the user know

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:32.901
that something is happening and I was wondering,
well, could we put in, you know, like a little

00:38:32.901 --> 00:38:33.901
shimmer or something?

00:38:33.901 --> 00:38:37.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think you probably could,
I mean, as we've got the outer edge going,

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:41.090
having something in the middle just happening
to show that its ongoing I think would be

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:42.090
an interesting effect.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:45.483
I don't know that there is, I don't know what
overhead is associated with updating notifications

00:38:45.483 --> 00:38:46.483
in that frequency.

00:38:46.483 --> 00:38:49.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Now that I think about it,
it can't be that bad because we do that in

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:50.680
the download manager.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's true.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:52.680
We have the little, you know, it's downloading,
it's downloading.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.570
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think it's actually just
an animated image.

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:55.570
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:59.200
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So, you know what I would
do is an animated image and then just overlay

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.060
that arc on top of it.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.360
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That could work.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:04.360
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That'd be interesting.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.360
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Okay, cool.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.360
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So let's have a really quick
look through.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.050
We've only got a couple of minutes, literally,
so we were gonna spend a little bit more time

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:15.000
contrasting and comparing but, again, in terms
of the design guide, I think really the Hybrid

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.730
Stopwatch is kind of one of the most interesting
deviations from the design guide which still

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:25.030
looked good and I do, have been given a preview
as to what the guys will be looking at on

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:29.790
Tuesday during Android Design and Action and
I know that they have and interesting take

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:32.150
on this app so that's definitely something
to tune in for.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:38.590
And the other one that I think is sort of
close to being there but not quite is this,

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:43.670
which is, I think this is a really nice effect,
looks really consistent, nice coloring, nice

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:47.430
theming, I think just needs a little bit of
tweaking to get it really spot on.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.670
So these are kind of the two alternatives.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:50.780
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well now wait a second, Yoga
Timer.

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: There is Yoga Timer, that's
true.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:55.940
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I would say Yoga Timer nailed
it except for the icon.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.550
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Except for the icon, yeah.

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.960
That's the thing about Yoga Timer, it's a
great app, they've done a great job with theming

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.670
it they just aren't presenting it as well
as they should be ahead of time.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.230
So, yeah.

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:12.700
Other things, multifunctional we talked about,
so again this is where the Time Control really

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:14.010
does win hands down.

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:19.420
It does everything that you'd wanna do consistent
with time all in one app so that's kind of

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.420
nice.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:24.900
Rich notifications, we saw a couple of apps
was it, I can't even remember, was it-

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, I think this one had
it.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.060
No?

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:29.060
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Possibly not.

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.060
Maybe it was just something, countdown, yeah.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.600
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: There we go.

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.620
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Countdown but not stopwatch
which kind of makes sense kind of doesn't.

00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.060
I'd like to have it on stopwatch as well.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.690
So this is really nice.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:45.490
And there was another app, as well, which
allowed me to, which had rich notifications.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.640
I can't remember which one it was.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.860
Was it Impetus, perhaps?

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:49.860
No.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.930
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No, it certainly wasn't that
one.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:53.570
Well, in any case.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:54.800
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:56.940
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I think it was Yoga Timer,
actually.

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:57.940
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I think it was, yeah, it probably
was Yoga Timer.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.030
That's right, it was Yoga Timer.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:01.370
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Look at you, it's like you've
forgotten about Yoga Timer.

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:04.600
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's a good app, I just don't
do yoga, that's my problem.

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.900
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.080
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: There we go.

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:09.520
The perfect rich notification.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.970
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah, that's great.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:17.390
Having a notification is there for information
and it's a called action and this combines

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:18.390
that perfectly.

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:22.990
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: If they steal a trick from time
control here and actually include a time,

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:27.400
a countdown within the notification itself,
you've pretty much hit the perfect notification.

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.400
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:29.400
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Time is over.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:30.400
That's, yes.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.080
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's very true.

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:38.500
Again, foreground service or anything like
this, anytime, in order to have a foreground

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:43.310
service which is a service that isn't gonna
get killed by the system at run time when

00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:47.570
there's memory pressure means that you have
to have a notification displayed.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:52.530
So any of these apps which don't have a notification
displayed, this is true for most of them in

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:55.970
stopwatch mode, which means they could theoretically
get killed by the system.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:42:01.370
So that's something I wouldn't really want
to have happen and something to keep in mind.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:02.370
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah.

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.390
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: And keep it simple, I guess
that's the real trick.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:08.510
The ones that I enjoyed the most, and this
is why I guess I keep forgetting about Yoga

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:10.820
Timer, is cause I have to do so much work
before I can use it.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.820
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's true, yeah.

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:14.480
You had to, there was a lot before you could
just jump in.

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.480
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:19.150
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know, they, where if you
contrast that with I think it was Impetus,

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:23.560
for instance, just had some presets that were
there already.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.580
They have a very, very complex system.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.580
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: They do.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: But they have five or six
different things that you could just choose

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:30.650
from to get started.

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:34.500
Time Control was just all, Hybrid Stopwatch
was just right there.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:35.500
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Exactly.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.540
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: where you get what's on the
tin, right?

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.840
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: These apps when you press the
button and boom, you start; you understand

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.470
exactly how it works.

00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:45.150
That's kind of the ultimate, and even something
like Time Control which has quite a lot of

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:47.160
functionality but it's all pretty easy to
find.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.420
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah and then, you know, Rich's
Ultimate Stopwatch, I would say is a close

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:59.040
second behind Hybrid Stopwatch but, for me,
the addition of the sort of photo realism

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:06.610
added elements that didn't seem germane to
the application, I was a little confused by

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:10.140
it, I wasn't sure what to touch and what not
to.

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:13.930
Maybe that's just me but I think it took skeuomorphism
one step too far.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:16.270
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: One step too far.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:19.860
So, sum up, so these are the, these are each
of the prescriptions we've just gone through

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:24.650
and we've talked about each of those apps
and so here they are, summarized for your

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:25.650
pleasure.

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:30.420
We won't go through these in much detail but
can keep track of how many of the green dots

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:35.420
exist and it's really, it's timer, alarm,
stopwatch and clock which does the best here,

00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.170
kind of does everything we ask for.

00:43:37.170 --> 00:43:42.940
It could do a little bit more with the rich
notifications in terms of the stopwatch doesn't

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:45.550
use them but that's kind of nit picking at
this point.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:49.260
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: And everybody should learn
from Yoga Timer about rich notifications.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:50.520
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yes, Yoga Timer is the go to
there.

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.790
That really demonstrated the right way to
do these things.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:57.500
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: If I could just, if I could
just combine Yoga Timer and Time Control that

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:58.500
would be perfect.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.720
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It'd be pretty good.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.880
Yeah, Oh look, Rich, you've got some work
to do, Rich.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:05.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Rich!

00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:06.140
[Laughter]

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:07.880
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So that's pretty much all we've
got.

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880
We're totally out of time.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Right.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.540
Did you put green dots, by the way, on the
things that weren't good?

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:16.840
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: I did cause I'm that stupid.

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:17.840
[Laughter]

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.510
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: So the dots that appear transparent,
that meant good.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:21.510
[Laughter]

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:22.750
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's exactly what they meant.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:24.450
Red meant bad, transparent meant good.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:25.450
[Laughter]

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:26.450
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Exactly.

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:28.960
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Here's a tip for those of you
at home wanting to use chroma keys and green

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.480
screens for your overlays.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.290
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You're also discriminating
against millions of color blind people.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:35.290
[Laughter]

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:36.290
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's true.

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:39.370
Next week it'll be all green backgrounds with
small red text.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:41.380
Good luck with that.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.820
So let's have a reminder of what's coming
up.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.940
So, Android Design in Action is on on Tuesday.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:49.220
It was their first episode last week; they
had a huge audience so that's fantastic.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:55.000
Hopefully you guys will tune in again on Tuesday,
that's 10:30 New York time and what's that,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
3:30 in London?

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.880
And they're gonna be taking a look at these
two apps which is Impetus and Hybrid Stopwatch

00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:06.700
so I think those are the two that they're
definitely gonna check out on Tuesday.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:12.100
We've also asked the developers, all the developers
that we talked about today got in touch with

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.970
us over Google Plus and I think it's something
we talked about it a little bit but I didn't

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:19.890
run this past you ahead of time so hopefully
you're free next Thursday but I thought it

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:24.410
might be fun to spend half an hour after we've
ripped these apps apart and the app design

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:27.990
guys have given them ideas of what they should
be doing instead, to get some feedback for

00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:31.271
them once they've had a chance to digest what
we tell them.

00:45:31.271 --> 00:45:32.770
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Absolutely, that's a wonderful
idea.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:33.980
I'm excited to be a part of it.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:34.980
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Awesome.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.170
So we will, we will see the guys from each
of these developers next Thursday at 11:30,

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:40.250
that's Pacific Time.

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:43.070
You can get all of the schedules and stuff
at-

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:44.680
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Are we gonna run that live
as well?

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:45.920
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Why not?

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.430
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: because who knows what these
developers are, they might say something.

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:49.430
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's true.

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.000
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: They might say something naughty.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: That's the fun thing that none
of them are native English speakers.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:59.660
We've got Austria, Sweden and Spain, I think,
all represented.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:00.660
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Nice.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.780
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Or at least those languages.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:03.780
So it should be fun.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.110
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: The first thing you learn
in English is swear words.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:07.110
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Excellent.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.310
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Any foreign language, that's
the first thing.

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:11.730
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: We're gonna have to have a big
red button just in case.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:12.730
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Sounds good.

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:13.950
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: It's not a family friendly-

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:15.470
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Well we are completely out
of time.

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:16.470
.

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:17.470
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Next week we're gonna look at
photography apps.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:18.470
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Excellent.

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:21.680
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So anything which messes with
a photo, so, things like your Instagrams,

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:25.820
like your Paper Cameras, anything like that,
if you've written an app, if you want us to

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:30.050
look at your favorite version of that and,
you know, let the developers know what they

00:46:30.050 --> 00:46:33.591
could be doing differently or the right way
to inplement those sorts of apps.

00:46:33.591 --> 00:46:36.610
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: You know what; don't just
nominate those hipster apps, okay?

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:41.920
If I have to look at one more 70's style photo
my eyes are gonna bleed.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.470
Let's talk about some really cool apps that
you can do photography with.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.470
&gt;&gt;Alex Lucas: Instagram.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.470
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Shut up hipster!

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:48.980
I throw it on the ground!

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:49.980
Alright.

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.890
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: You know his glasses aren't
prescription?

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:56.060
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: No, of course they're not.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:59.760
And his Fixie actually has gears, they're
just hidden in the hub.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.240
So what we're gonna do, though, is take a
look at photography apps.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:07.700
We're really super excited about it, let's,
hopefully we get some actual photographers

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:08.700
on here.

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.110
I know Dan Pham is quite a photographer.

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:11.110
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: He really is, yeah.

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:14.470
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: We're gonna look at how these
apps can make photography easier and more

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:15.470
fun.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:16.470
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: So that should be good.

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:18.520
So I think that's all that we have for today.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:23.360
We have about three minutes before Dan and,
I think you are filling in today.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.440
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: I believe, yes I am filling
in for the Game's Review which is completely

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.120
at odds with my new haircut and my stylish
hoodie.

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.900
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah, that's kind of grey scale
there.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.790
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Yeah it’s a, well it's a
boss but see there's, the brand is called

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:41.760
Boss but it's by a guy named Hugo Boss.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.400
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Interesting.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.490
Wow, nice.

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:45.580
We have a Boss Hugo.

00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.390
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: That's true, we do.

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:49.150
&gt;&gt;Reto Meier: Yeah nice.

00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:54.850
So we'll be joining Dan, his headwear and
Hugo Boss clad Ian Ni-Lewis in just a few

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:57.830
minutes for the Friday Game Review.

00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:01.010
We'll be back again next week at 1pm looking
at photography apps.

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:04.140
So, until then, thank you for joining us and
see you next week.

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:05.140
&gt;&gt;Ian Ni-Lewis: Bye.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:05.142
