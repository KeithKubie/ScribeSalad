00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.240
This always happens.

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.615
You get a bunch
of cows together,

00:00:02.615 --> 00:00:03.780
and it's moo, moo, moo.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.320
The next thing you know, boom.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.250
They raise the roof.

00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:12.590
Howdy, heifers.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.660
This is D News.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.310
I'm Trace.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.790
Dateline January 27, 2014.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.370
A barn in Rasdorf,
Germany containing 90 cows

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.160
was rocked by an explosion.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.490
And a buildup of methane
gas was the culprit.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.500
The roof was damaged,
and at least one cow

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.200
needed to be treated for burns.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.240
A static charge produced
by a cow massaging machine

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.610
set off the methane explosion,
leading this reporter to ask,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.100
what the heck is a
cow massaging machine?

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.530
And how can methane cause
such a big explosion?

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.290
First, cows produce
a lot of methane.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.580
You've probably heard that it
can be more damaging than CO2.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.200
The planet has 1.5 billion
cows, and they emit methane

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.810
as they digest their food
in their four stomachs.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.780
The bacteria living within cows
help them break down the grass,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.060
but create methane, ammonia
and other gases in the process.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.760
Estimates vary,
but experts believe

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.209
a single cow can produce
approximately 100 to 500 liters

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.110
of methane per day, or
about as much pollution

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.040
as the average car.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.310
You might associate methane
gas with fart smell,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.670
but you'd be wrong.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.740
Methane is odorless, colorless.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.780
It's lighter than air.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.960
And it's flammable.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.410
Industry adds sulfur smell
to help identify gas leaks.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.359
But with cow farts, I mean,
they already kind of-- well,

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:23.150
they kind of smell.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.390
Anyway, with 90 cows
in a barn, their butts

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.880
could produce as much as 45,000
liters of methane in a day.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.000
That gas would then float
to the top of the barn,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.540
especially if the barn didn't
have proper ventilation.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.150
By some estimates,
methane gas is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.944
combustible at concentrations
as little as 5%.

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:40.610
So without knowing
the size of the barn,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.443
I can't really tell you
much more than that.

00:01:42.443 --> 00:01:43.570
But hey, the boom happened.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.070
We know.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.510
Explosions like this happen
more often than you'd think.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.120
Methane is suspected
to have caused

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.600
an explosion earlier this year
at a waste water treatment

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.560
plant, last August in a
Mexico office building,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.020
and inside a New
Zealand mine in 2010.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.492
This is by far,
however, the stinkiest.

00:01:58.492 --> 00:01:59.700
But at least no one was hurt.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.574
Coal miners have to
worry about methane, too.

00:02:01.574 --> 00:02:05.190
Rocks contain 100 to 600
cubic feet of methane

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.080
for every ton of
coal being mined.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.800
Being lighter than air but
trapped in a mine shaft

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.890
means the methane displaces that
air and can cause suffocation.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.440
It's real dangerous, y'all.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.680
But it can also be useful.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.260
Aside from blowing
up German barns,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.920
methane is used as a fuel
to create heat and light

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.370
in homes and
commercial buildings.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.870
And then on a larger
scale, methane

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.810
can be used to
generate electricity.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.270
87% of natural gas is methane.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.360
It's also used to make
industrial chemicals,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.170
and in the garment, automotive,
and plastics industries.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.980
Most farmers have
specialized barns

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.690
that stop methane buildup
by letting it float up

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.280
into the atmosphere
out of the barn.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.070
But more enterprising and
environmentally conscious

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.010
animal farmers capture
methane to sell as energy.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.480
So, though it can be considered
environmentally harmful,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.700
it can blow up a barn,
it's not entirely useless.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.590
It's actually a rather valuable
gas, when used properly.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.050
So are you worried about cow
farts destroying the planet?

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.060
Tell us what you think.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.920
And thanks a lot for
watching D News today.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.270
And, if you're a fan of
animals that can blow stuff up,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.400
Furrocious is a new
show on Animalist

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.950
where the cute and
cuddly can kill you.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.120
Do you know what catnip is?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.181
Catnip is bath salts for cats.

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:12.680
So what you're going
to do is you're

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.750
going to bring this little
inbred, junkie, carnivorous,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.580
bloodthirsty, freeloading,
disease ridden

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.120
beast into our domicile.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.590
And that's why we can't
get a Persian cat.
