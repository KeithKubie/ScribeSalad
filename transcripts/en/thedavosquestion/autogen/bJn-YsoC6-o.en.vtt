feel are particularly important in this

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
feel are particularly important in this
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.870
feel are particularly important in this
changing world first I think we

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
changing world first I think we
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.820
changing world first I think we
recognize that the world is much more

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
recognize that the world is much more
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.269
recognize that the world is much more
interdependent than it used to be so

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
interdependent than it used to be so
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.069
interdependent than it used to be so
while we focused on discussing issues

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079
while we focused on discussing issues
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.979
while we focused on discussing issues
around the crisis particularly with

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
around the crisis particularly with
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.119
around the crisis particularly with
respect to Europe recognize the problem

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
respect to Europe recognize the problem
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.680
respect to Europe recognize the problem
that Europe faces its physical it it

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690
that Europe faces its physical it it
 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.020
that Europe faces its physical it it
also affects the banks but most

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
also affects the banks but most
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.000
also affects the banks but most
importantly there is a growth and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010
importantly there is a growth and
 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.770
importantly there is a growth and
competitiveness issue which has

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780
competitiveness issue which has
 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.080
competitiveness issue which has
dominated sets for the rest of the world

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
dominated sets for the rest of the world
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.990
dominated sets for the rest of the world
so it is important that there is a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
so it is important that there is a
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.049
so it is important that there is a
solution that the Europeans agree on but

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
solution that the Europeans agree on but
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.479
solution that the Europeans agree on but
that there is support from across the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
that there is support from across the
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.710
that there is support from across the
world for what is happening in Europe

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720
world for what is happening in Europe
 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.390
world for what is happening in Europe
such that we can address it as quickly

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400
such that we can address it as quickly
 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.859
such that we can address it as quickly
as possible because the longer it takes

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
as possible because the longer it takes
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.510
as possible because the longer it takes
the more likely will see the problems

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
the more likely will see the problems
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.390
the more likely will see the problems
grew and the challenges of course affect

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
grew and the challenges of course affect
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.940
grew and the challenges of course affect
the more vulnerable groups even much

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
the more vulnerable groups even much
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.730
the more vulnerable groups even much
more so it is important to recognize

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740
more so it is important to recognize
 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.859
more so it is important to recognize
that the world is interdependent to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
that the world is interdependent to
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.190
that the world is interdependent to
recognize that solving the problems that

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
recognize that solving the problems that
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.710
recognize that solving the problems that
we have in any part of the world truly

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
we have in any part of the world truly
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.499
we have in any part of the world truly
impact the other parts of the world and

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509
impact the other parts of the world and
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.380
impact the other parts of the world and
and having a way of making sure that in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
and having a way of making sure that in
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.289
and having a way of making sure that in
a coordinated manner that we address

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299
a coordinated manner that we address
 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.620
a coordinated manner that we address
these challenges as quickly as possible

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
these challenges as quickly as possible
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.210
these challenges as quickly as possible
of course there are many other issues

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220
of course there are many other issues
 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.520
of course there are many other issues
that we took every but I did want to

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530
that we took every but I did want to
 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.030
that we took every but I did want to
focus on this very very important as we

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040
focus on this very very important as we
 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.660
focus on this very very important as we
craft the new model for governance to

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
craft the new model for governance to
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.749
craft the new model for governance to
focus that the world is very

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759
focus that the world is very
 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.960
focus that the world is very
