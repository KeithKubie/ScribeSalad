00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.730
- I described the event,

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.487
and I, the simple inquiry was,

00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:08.540
by chance are there any
photographs from that parade?

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.843
I got a call, we have two photographs.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.660
Wonderful.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660
And frankly, I would
have been perfectly happy

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.870
with either of those photographs.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.423
The doggedness of the archive's people,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.950
the behavior that I am so appreciative of,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.614
is that with no additional
prodding from me,

00:00:29.614 --> 00:00:31.513
continued the search.

00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:41.090
In the very last contact sheet,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.503
in the very last row
in that contact sheet,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.010
caused me to look in astonishment.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.990
And to realize that there
were two photographs.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.403
One of Robert, reaching for my hand.

00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:02.351
And the real treasure, a
photograph of him shaking my hand.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:06.020
- But, and I was kind of hoping that maybe

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.110
you would find yourself, but honestly,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.480
I mean how often does that really happen?

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.140
A random encounter like the
one that Mr. MacDonald had

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.600
with Robert Kennedy, in the
middle of a parade in Boston,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.450
there's very little likelihood

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.260
that we would find something like that.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.900
When you're working with the public,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.960
and you're helping them
with their requests,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.820
especially their personal requests,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.470
the ones that they remember personally,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.810
or their family member was involved,

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.360
or they have a really close
connection with whatever

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.570
they were asking for,
that is the best feeling.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.233
- The photographer clicking
in that nano second,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.250
is truly a one in a million possibility.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.320
It's 50 years later.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.960
I ended up getting the photograph

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.793
that I didn't even know existed.
