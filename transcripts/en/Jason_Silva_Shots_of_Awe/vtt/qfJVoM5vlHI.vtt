00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.160
I think most of us
can attest to the fact

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.700
that consciousness,
that experience,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.650
it requires constant mediation.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.660
We educate ourselves.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.451
We learn about things
that are fascinating.

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:24.770
We create filters for our lives,
information diets, so to speak,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.240
so that we only let in that
which is going to enrich us

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.370
and not stay in some
small filter bubble,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.412
but instead constantly
enlarge our filter bubble,

00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:32.911
and pay attention
to things that are

00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:34.320
going to uplift our imagination.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.890
And so today,
there's a generation

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.330
of cultural luminaries or
digital shamans, ecstatic

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.410
technicians of the sacred,
as Erik Davis says.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.500
And actually, Erik
Davis is one of them.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.180
Erik Davis wrote
Techgnosis, which

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.690
is about the mystical
undertones of technology.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.440
It's a brilliant book with
chapters like The Spiritual

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.800
Cyborg and humanity's
desire to conjure up awe

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.510
by looking at the
Hubble Space Telescope

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.340
as it calls forth
our ever deeper, ever

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.460
possible selves in the heavens.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.519
I also like Steven Johnson,
another digital shaman.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.060
He wrote Where Good
Ideas Come From,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.880
The Natural History
of Innovation.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.500
He talks about
creating spaces where

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.630
ideas can have sex,
creating spaces

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.790
where ideas can intermingle with
one another, mutate, transfuse.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.490
Things can be birthed into
being in these creative spaces,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.715
a brilliant book.

00:01:19.715 --> 00:01:22.090
You have Ray Kurzweil, who
wrote The Singularity Is Near,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.230
When Humans Transcend Biology.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.450
How do we use
emerging technologies

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.670
that are evolving
exponentially to transcend

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.450
all previous limits, and
engineer our own Godhood?

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.716
An amazing read.

00:01:32.716 --> 00:01:34.590
Ernest Becker, who wrote
The Denial of Death,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.440
distills the human condition
to a series of illusions

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.310
that we've programmed
into our consciousness

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.810
in order to make sense and imbue
the universe with some kind

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.270
of meaning so that
we don't go mad.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.410
Brilliant book.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.910
Alan Harrington, who
calls for the divinization

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.540
of the human being, to
literally use technology

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.540
to make ourselves gods.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.090
That inspired,
actually, a short film

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.660
I made called The
Immortalists on the web.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.660
These thinkers, this Ray
Kurzweil, Erik Davis,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.250
Ernest Becker, pop philosopher
Alain de Botton, these people

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.720
are like guides.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.480
They lead the way.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.623
They offer a unique perspective.

00:02:08.623 --> 00:02:10.789
And we need to pay attention
to thinkers like these.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.497
We need to celebrate
thinkers like these.

00:02:12.497 --> 00:02:15.410
Because these guys, these guys
are ideas worth spreading.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.560
These guys are what the
TED Conference celebrates,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.540
that brilliant institution
that pushes forth

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.030
ideas that challenge,
enrich, and enlarge us.
