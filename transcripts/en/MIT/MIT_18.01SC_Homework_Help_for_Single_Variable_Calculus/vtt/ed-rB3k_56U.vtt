00:00:06.757 --> 00:00:07.340
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.924
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:10.590
You've been talking
about differentials.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.970
And one of the things
that you've shown

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.580
is that some of the
stuff that we've

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.350
been doing with
derivatives can also

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.290
be phrased in terms
of differentials.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.450
That for many purposes they
form a just a different language

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.980
to compute the same things.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.650
So in particular one example of
that is linear approximation.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.150
So I have a problem here that's
a linear approximation problem,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.130
but I'd like you to do it using
the method of differentials.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.130
So in particular I'd like you
to approximate the square root

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.140
of 21.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.780
And the way I'd like
you to do that is

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.100
by using a linear
approximation to the function

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.620
f of x equals the square root
of 10x minus x squared based

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.760
at the point 2, x_0 equals 2.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.300
Note that, you know,
why are we using

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.700
this function to approximate
square root of 21?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.540
Well because at 3, the
function value at 3, f of 3,

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.020
is exactly equal to
the square root of 21.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.330
So to approximate
the square root

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.130
21 means approximate
the function value at 3.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.460
And so, you know, this function
has a nice value at x equals 2,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.390
so we can use linear
approximation at 2

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.120
to try and compute
an approximation

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.810
to the function at x equals 3.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.860
So why don't you take a couple
of minutes, work this out,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.610
come back and we can
work it out together.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.020
All right, welcome back.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.707
So we're doing linear
approximation here.

00:01:36.707 --> 00:01:38.290
And we're doing it
with differentials.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.990
So, in general, when we use
the method of differentials

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.590
to compute a linear
approximation, what we have is

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.720
that if y equals f of x, so if
y is given as a function of x,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.640
then we have that-- so if we
want to change x a little bit

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.050
and figure out what
the change in y is,

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.680
we have this formula,
which is that f

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.350
of x plus dx-- so the function
value at a nearby point--

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.220
is approximately
equal to y plus dy.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.130
So this is our formula
for linear approximation

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.420
in terms of differentials.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.740
So in our case we have that
our-- that the point we want

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.360
is x equals 2 and y equals 4.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.660
And so we have, we
know what dx is also,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.580
because we want the
approximation at the point 3.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.530
So we want dx to be equal
to 1 for this approximation.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.760
And so the question is,
what is dy going to be?

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.790
So that's the value
that we're after.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.060
That tells us how much the
function value changes.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.370
So to compute dy, well dy is the
differential of the function.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.070
So this is d of the
square root of 10x

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.840
minus x squared, quantity.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.680
OK, so to compute
this differential now,

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.620
we just use our straight-forward
rules for doing this.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.110
So we take a derivative and then
we have dx's where necessary.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.760
So this is d of square root
of 10x minus x squared.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.430
So the outermost function
is the square root function.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.940
So this is going to be
1/2 times 10x minus x

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.370
squared to the minus 1/2.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.280
So that's 1 over the square
root of 10x minus x squared.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.940
And now I need to
multiply by the derivative

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:44.810
of the inside function,
which is 10 minus 2x dx.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.020
So really it's 10dx minus
2x*dx but I just, you know,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.640
pulled that dx out in front.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.220
So we have a differential
equal to a differential.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.700
OK, and so, but
we want this value

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.840
at this particular
point in question.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.680
So at this particular
point in question

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.690
we have x equals 2
and dx is equal to 1.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.410
So the value of dy that we
want is equal to 1/2 times--

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.650
well this is again, OK, 10 times
2 minus 2 squared, that's 16.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.720
To the minus 1/2, times--
so here x equals 2.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.410
10 minus 4 is 6.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.900
Times dx is just this 1
that we're interested in.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.630
OK so 16 to the minus
1/2, 16 to the 1/2

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.900
is 4, so 16 to the
minus 1/2 is 1/4.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.070
So this is 1/2
times 1/4 times 6.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.630
So that's 6/8, which is 3/4.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.280
So our dy is 3/4.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.010
So that means our
linear approximation

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:01.420
that we're after is just
f of 3, f of x plus dx

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.260
is approximately
equal to our value y

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.030
that we, at our original point,
which was 4, plus the dy.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.222
So plus 3/4.

00:05:12.222 --> 00:05:13.680
So the linear
approximation that we

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.070
get from this method
of differentials

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.930
is exactly the
same approximation

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.940
that we would get if we
did this the other way.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.970
But I think it's
kind of nice to do it

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.570
in this differential form.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.170
Somehow it seems a little more
straightforward sometimes.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:32.280
And OK, and so the answer that
we get out of it is 4 plus 3/4.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.101
All right, so that's that.
