SEREN DAVIES: I'm Seren.

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.930
I'm an accessibility
advocate, nail art lover,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.884
and a huge fan of unicorns,
and this is how I code.

00:00:07.884 --> 00:00:09.560

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.860
I wrote a really
cool Chrome extension

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.400
which assessed websites to
see how dyslexic friendly

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.120
they were.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.390
I developed a really cool
little dropdown box with areas

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.360
they could improve, like
not using icon fonts

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.037
and choosing to
not use bold text.

00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:25.620
It meant a lot to me because I
want to make the world a better

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.120
place.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.770
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.170
When I edit CSS
files, I usually do

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.110
things like change
the border of boxes

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.350
and change the colors
of different elements.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.040
And I don't usually
want that bit.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.380
I usually want one or two
lines that actually do the job.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.900
So when I come to
commit it, I use

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.870
git add -p to make
sure that I'm only

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.697
adding the one or two lines and
none of the other weird funky

00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:50.330
bits.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.090
I'm Seren.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.270
I'm a nail art advocate?

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.120
