00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:11.085
A close encounter with
a man-eating giant,

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:14.834
a sorceress who turns men into pigs,

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:18.345
a long-lost king taking back his throne.

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:21.956
On their own, any of these make
great stories,

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:25.545
but each is just one episode
in the "Odyssey,"

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:32.895
a 12,000-line poem spanning years of
Ancient Greek history, myth, and legend.

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:36.046
How do we make sense 
of such a massive text

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:39.995
that comes from and tells of a world
so far away?

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:44.095
The fact that we can read the "Odyssey"
at all is pretty incredible,

00:00:44.095 --> 00:00:49.435
as it was composed before the Greek
alphabet appeared in the 8th century BCE.

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:52.156
It was made for listeners 
rather than readers,

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:56.277
and was performed by oral poets
called rhapsodes.

00:00:56.277 --> 00:01:00.476
Tradition identifies its author
as a blind man named Homer.

00:01:00.476 --> 00:01:05.017
But no one definitively knows whether
he was real or legendary.

00:01:05.017 --> 00:01:08.866
The earliest mentions of him occur
centuries after his era.

00:01:08.866 --> 00:01:12.456
And the poems attributed to him
seem to have been changed

00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:15.771
and rearranged many times
by multiple authors

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:19.207
before finally being written down
in their current form.

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:22.556
In fact, the word rhapsode means
stitching together,

00:01:22.556 --> 00:01:27.616
as these poets combined existing stories,
jokes, myths, and songs

00:01:27.616 --> 00:01:30.295
into a single narrative.

00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:33.207
To recite these massive epics live,

00:01:33.207 --> 00:01:35.697
rhapsodes employed a steady meter,

00:01:35.697 --> 00:01:37.558
along with mnemonic devices,

00:01:37.558 --> 00:01:42.198
like repetition of memorized passages
or set pieces.

00:01:42.198 --> 00:01:46.057
These included descriptions of scenery
and lists of characters,

00:01:46.057 --> 00:01:49.705
and helped the rhapsode keep
their place in the narrative,

00:01:49.705 --> 00:01:54.157
just as the chorus or bridge of a song
helps us to remember the next verses.

00:01:54.157 --> 00:01:56.868
Because most of the tales were familiar
to the audience,

00:01:56.868 --> 00:02:00.548
it was common to hear the sections
of the poem out of order.

00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:02.858
At some point, the order 
became set in stone

00:02:02.858 --> 00:02:07.288
and the story was locked into place
as the one we read today.

00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:11.508
But since the world has changed
a bit in the last several thousand years,

00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:15.048
it helps to have some background
before jumping in.

00:02:15.048 --> 00:02:20.179
The "Odyssey" itself is a sequel to Homer's
other famous epic, the "Iliad,"

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:22.821
which tells the story of the Trojan War.

00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:27.158
If there's one major theme uniting
both poems, it's this:

00:02:27.158 --> 00:02:32.349
do not, under any circumstances,
incur the wrath of the gods.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.908
The Greek Pantheon is a dangerous mix
of divine power and human insecurity,

00:02:36.908 --> 00:02:40.838
prone to jealousy and grudges
of epic proportions.

00:02:40.838 --> 00:02:45.569
And many of the problems faced by humans
in the poems are caused by their hubris,

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.499
or excessive pride in believing themselves
superior to the gods.

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:52.797
The desire to please the gods was so great

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:55.850
that the Ancient Greeks traditionally
welcomed all strangers

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.068
into their homes with generosity

00:02:58.068 --> 00:03:01.969
for fear that the strangers 
might be gods in disguise.

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:05.200
This ancient code of hospitality
was called xenia.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.320
It involved hosts providing their guests
with safety, food, and comfort,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.910
and the guests returning the favor
with courtesy and gifts if they had them.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.551
Xenia has a significant role 
in the "Odyssey,"

00:03:17.551 --> 00:03:21.681
where Odysseus in his wanderings
is the perpetual guest,

00:03:21.681 --> 00:03:27.330
while in his absence, his clever wife
Penelope plays non-stop host.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.800
The "Odyssey" recounts all 
of Odysseus's years of travel,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.030
but the narrative begins in medias res
in the middle of things.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.922
Ten years after the Trojan War,
we find our hero trapped on an island,

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:46.341
still far from his native Ithaca and
the family he hasn't seen for 20 years.

00:03:46.341 --> 00:03:51.511
Because he's angered the sea god Poseidon
by blinding his son, a cyclops,

00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:56.271
Odysseus's passage home has been
fraught with mishap after mishap.

00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:59.420
With trouble brewing at home
and gods discussing his fate,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.468
Odysseus begins the account
of those missing years to his hosts.

00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:07.031
One of the most fascinating things
about the "Odyssey"

00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:10.551
is the gap between how little we know
about its time period

00:04:10.551 --> 00:04:14.671
and the wealth of detail the text
itself contains.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.422
Historians, linguists, and archeologists

00:04:17.422 --> 00:04:20.433
have spent centuries 
searching for the ruins of Troy

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:24.172
and identifying which islands
Odysseus visited.

00:04:24.172 --> 00:04:28.921
Just like its hero, the 24-book epic
has made its own long journey

00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:31.511
through centuries of myth and history

00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:34.482
to tell us its incredible story today.
