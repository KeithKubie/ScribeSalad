00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.520
Let's start with Dreamworks' very first animated feature

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.140
Antz

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.360
The controversial predecessor to "A Bug's Life".

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.060
"Did Disney think of the idea first?"

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.640
"Did Katzenberg?"

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.960
Blah blah blah blah blah, who cares.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.960
Let's just look at the movie as a whole.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.080
The film stars an ant named "Z"

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.600
played by Woody Allen.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.540
He's, big surprise, a neurotic

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.060
living in a colony of ants where it's very easy to lose your identity.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.500
He has friends here and there

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
but for the most part he finds it hard to fit in.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.520
That is until he accidentally comes across the queen's daughter

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.740
played by Sharon Stone

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.160
Which is weird because, yeah, they're all technically

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.860
her children. But, I guess somehow they singled her out

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.540
as princess because she's being trained to carry

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.780
the children nec- don't know how it works but

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.780
they have a romance and seem to hit it off.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.620
But while uncovering an evil plan from a General ant

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:56.760
played by Gene Hackman

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.660
Z and the princess get whisked away outside of the colony.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.280
And thus the two are on a hair-raising adventure

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.420
against humans, other insects, and even their own kind

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.420
to find what they call paradise.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.040
Known as "Insectopia"

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.080
which is really nothing more than a garbage can.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.740
As a first film this is pretty damn good from an animation company.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.740
The CG now is a touch-dated

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740
but when it came out it was pretty impresive.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.960
I find it interesting that I actually don't have a hard

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.740
time telling the ants apart.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.920
They're not drawn like typical cartoon characters

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.600
with big eyes or big expressions.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.340
But somehow I actually do know which ones are which.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.720
Part of that comes from the incredibly distinct

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.140
voices that they have.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.740
Yeah, this movie really crammed the celebrities in there.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.140
I mean, there's a ton.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.320
But, to its credit, they all sort of fit.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.720
Woody Allen as the neurotic, that's a no-brainer.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.820
Gene Hackman as the bad guy, that works obviously.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.540
Stallone as a soldier obviously fits well.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.360
Jennifer Lopez as one of the tough miners, that works too.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.100
Danny Glover as a supportive comrade.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.100
Dan Aykroyd as a snobby sophisticate.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.440
These actually really do fall together.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.820
That is all except for one...

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.600
what the hell is Christopher Walken doing in this movie?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.140
And I'm not at all about the Christopher Walken hate.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.680
Anything he's in, I'll take it.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.800
But I, ju- why?!

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.280
He has like no role.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.880
He's the assistant to the general and...

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.340
that's it, there's no other character to 'em.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.560
He's not weird, he's not strange,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.120
and his voice sticks out like a sore thumb.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:23.580
"Imagine it."

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820
"Strong colony, Sir."

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.820
"A colony, we can be proud of."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.620
I just remember snickering the whole time

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.080
'cause every time he opened his mouth

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.680
I'd be like "Oh, that's Christopher Walken and he sounds funny.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.300
I wish he was given funny stuff to do."

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.840
But while we're on the subject

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.080
the film is pretty funny.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.160
I mean, okay, not knee-slapping funny.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.040
But it certainly does great in creating these grand environments

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.220
made out of every-day small things.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.520
Their view of the world and the way they actually act

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520
as a colony is pretty entertaining.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.600
Literally at birth they decide whether or not

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.280
they're gonna be a worker or a soldier.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
And of course there's a lot of obvious commentary.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500
In either following the pack or being an individual.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.200
And where you draw the line.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.500
Which is why I think the film really does work better

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.500
for maybe a younger audience.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.120
I remember when I saw this I was a junior in high school.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.400
I was going through my rebellious artist phase

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.600
and this is just the movie I wanted to see.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.680
Not realizing that a bajillion movies more that year

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.620
and the following years were going to come with a very similar message.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.760
That's not a bad message, it's just been kinda

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.760
hammered to death in other films and

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.600
yeah this one kinda hammers it to death too.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.500
But what makes it stand out is the characters,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.240
the environments they create,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.100
and the fact that while it's animated

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.640
it doesn't go totally kid friendly.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.320
I mean, yeah, kids can watch it

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.320
and like I said, I enjoyed it in high school.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.940
Bu the designs aren't as colorful

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.640
or baby-friendly as something like Pixar can be.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.940
Neither is the story or the content for that matter.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.940
and I think that gives it a little bit more of an edge.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.100
Even the bad guy's diabolical plan

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.740
at first I though was kinda cliched.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.400
What he just wants to wipe out the weak, start all over

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.400
and have a "survival-of-the-fittest" type thing?

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.120
But when you really look at the way they set up this colony.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.540
and the way things work.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.340
Yeah, actually you can see how a character like that would be formed.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.900
I even give credit to the fact that the bugs are not all

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.900
the same size like in "A Bug's Life".

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.260
Everything is actually to scale.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.540
The termites are much bigger.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.120
Mantises are much bigger.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.400
Bees are much bigger.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.300
It's like, yeah, bugs aren't all the same size

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.780
and that makes for a much more entertaining

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.060
and threatening world to go through.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.580
So I really like the film.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.200
Does it have flaws? Sure.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.440
Is the message a little passe? A touch.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.980
But I think it still stands out as being a very unique

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.000
tongue-in-cheek adventure.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.480
And audiences at the time seemed to like it too.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.880
But this would turn out to be only the first big hit

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.440
in Dreamworks' lineup.
