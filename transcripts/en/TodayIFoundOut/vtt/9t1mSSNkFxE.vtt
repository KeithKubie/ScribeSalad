00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:20.020
BCE (Before Common Era) and BC (Before Christ)
mean the same thing- previous to year 1 CE

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.050
(Common Era).

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.050
This is the same as the year AD 1 (Anno Domini);
the latter means “in the year of the lord,”

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.730
often translated as “in the year of our
lord.”

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.480
(It was thought when the AD dating system
was created that its year 1 was the year Jesus

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.960
of Nazareth was born.)

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.620
Anno Domini was the first of these to appear.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.211
Prior to the 6th century AD, many Christians
who didn’t use an Anno Mundi (in the year

00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:46.921
of the world) type system relied on Roman
dating, either marking dates from the year

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:53.670
legend had it that Romulus and Remus founded
Rome (753 BC) or by relying on the date system

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:01.969
established under the Roman emperor Diocletian
(244-311), based on the accession of Diocletian.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.320
The_Christian_MartyrsHowever, most Christians
weren’t too fond of Diocletian, since he

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.000
brutally persecuted them in the latter part
of his reign in the late third / early fourth

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
century.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.470
This was supposedly in part a response to
advice Diocletian received at the oracle of

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.180
Apollo at Didyma.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.470
Previous to this, he had purportedly only
advocated banning Christians from such things

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.740
as the military and ruling body in hopes that
would appease the gods.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.070
Afterward, he switched to an escalating policy
of persecution to try to get Christians to

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.909
worship the Roman gods.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.730
This began simply via seizing Christian’s
property, destroying their homes, burning

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.950
all Christian texts, etc.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.159
When this sort of thing was ineffective, they
progressed to arresting and torturing Christians,

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.680
starting with the leaders.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.229
When that didn’t work, Christians began
to be killed in various brutal ways including

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.510
occasionally being torn apart by animals for
the amusement of the masses (Damnatio ad bestias).

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.710
This method of convincing people to worship
the Roman gods ended up being an amazing failure

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.450
and the persecution appears to have only continued
after AD 305 in the Eastern half of the empire

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.610
under Galerius and Maximinus.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.180
Finally, in April of AD 311, by imperial decree,
the Great persecution was put to an end even

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.180
in the East.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:22.080
A few years later, Constantine the Great (reigning
from AD 306 to 337) publicly declared himself

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.489
a Christian and Christianity began to transition
into the dominate religion in the Roman Empire.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.790
In any event, Easter was/is the most important
holy day of the Christian tradition, and it

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.280
was decided at the First Council of Nicaea
(AD 325) that it should occur each year on

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.710
the Sunday following the first full moon after
the spring equinox.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.880
In order to forecast when exactly the holiday
fell each year, Easter tables were created.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.010
In AD 525, the monk Dionysius Exiguus of Scythia
Minor was working on his table to determine

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.080
when Easter fell when he decided to eliminate
reference to Diocletian by listing his table’s

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.090
first year as Anno Domini 532, explicitly
stating this was referring to the year directly

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.950
following the last year of the old Diocletian-based
table, Anno Diocletiani 247.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.010
How Dionysius came up with 525 years since
Jesus was born at the time he was calculating

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.310
his table (532 years from when the table’s
dates began) isn’t clear, but he wasn’t

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.040
far off the range most biblical scholars today
think, with the more modern estimates tending

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.590
to ring in somewhere between 6 to 4 BC for
the actual birth of Christ.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.760
The Anno Domini system, sometimes called the
Dionysian Era or Christian Era, began to catch

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.980
on among the clergy in Italy relatively soon
after and, though not terribly popular, did

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.550
spread somewhat among the clergy in other
parts of Europe.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.569
Most notably, in the 8th century, the English
monk Bede (now known as the Venerable Bede)

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.879
used the dating system in his wildly popular
Ecclesiastical History of the English People

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.239
(AD 731).

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.970
This is often credited with not only popularizing
the calendar reference, but also introducing

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:12.370
the concept of BC, notably setting 1 BC to
be the year prior to AD 1, ignoring any potential

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.370
zero year.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.079
(This is no surprise as Bede, like Dionysius,
didn’t have a numeral zero to work with,

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.079
see: The Story of Zero.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.909
However, they both did at various times reference
the Latin nihil, “nothing”, in certain

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:29.169
places in calculating their tables where the
number zero should have gone had they had

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.169
such a numeral.)

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.839
It should also be noted that Bede didn’t
actually use any such “BC” abbreviation,

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:37.229
but rather in just one instance mentioned
a year based on ante incarnationis dominicae

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.779
tempus (“before the time of the lord’s
incarnation”).

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.550
While there would be rare sporadic mentions
of years “before the time of the lord’s

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.749
incarnation” from here on out, it wouldn’t
be until Werner Rolevinck’s 1474 work Fasciculus

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:52.289
Temporum that it would be used repeatedly
in a work.

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.220
The English, “Before Christ” didn’t
appear until the latter half of the 17th century

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.960
and it wouldn’t be until the 19th century
that it would be abbreviated.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.539
Shortly after the Ecclesiastical History of
the English People, Anno Domini was used officially

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:11.659
under the reign of the Holy Roman Emperor
Charlemagne (AD 742-814) and in the 11th century,

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:15.319
it was adopted for official use by the Roman
Catholic Church.

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.909
CE and BCE are much more recent inventions.

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:24.750
This started in the 17th century, with the
advent of the term Vulgar Era; this wasn’t

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.599
because people considered it to be an age
when everyone was coarse or rude, but because

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.170
“vulgar” more or less meant “ordinary”
or “common”, thus reflecting that the

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.160
era was “of or belonging to the common people”
(from the Latin vulgaris).

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.050
The first documented instance of the Vulgaris
Aerae (Vulgar Era, meaning “Common Era”)

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:44.610
being used interchangeably with Anno Domini
was featured in Latin works by Johannes Kepler

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.379
in 1615, 1616, and 1617.

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:53.189
The English version of phrase later appeared
in 1635 in an English translation of Kepler’s

00:05:53.189 --> 00:05:54.249
1615 work.

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:58.969
(In the mid-seventeenth century the English
“vulgar” took on a new definition of “coarse,”

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.069
but it wouldn’t be until this “coarse/unrefined”
definition would become more common in the

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.879
20th century that referring to the Vulgar
Era would cease.)

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.909
The Latin phrase Aerae Christianae (Christian
Era) and the associated English “Christian

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:17.069
Era” was also used by some in the 17th century,
such as when Robert Sliter employed it in

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:23.240
his A Celestiall Glass or Ephemeris for the
Year of the Christian Era 1 (1652).

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.389
Shortly thereafter, another “CE” came
about with Common Era used interchangeably

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:32.130
with Vulgar Era, first appearing in the 1708
edition of The History of the Works of the

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.259
Learned and again in David Gregory’s The
Elements of Astronomy (1715).

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.289
As for the actual abbreviation, CE (Common
Era) has been claimed to have been used as

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.960
early as 1831, though I couldn’t find specifically
in what work it is supposed to have appeared

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.960
in.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.809
Whatever the case, both it and BCE (Before
the Common Era) definitely appeared in Rabbi

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:57.160
Morris Jacob Raphall’s Post-Biblical History
of the Jews in 1856.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.699
The use of BCE and CE was particularly popular
in the Jewish community where they were keen

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.210
to avoid using any nomenclature explicitly
referring to Christ as “the lord.”

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.560
Today, BCE and CE instead of BC and AD has
become fairly common among other groups for

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:52.019
similar reasons.
