Stephen asks is it good practice to open
a connection to the database and then

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860
a connection to the database and then
 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.170
a connection to the database and then
hold on to it for the lifetime of the

you have it out if you'll never be able

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270
you have it out if you'll never be able

to you will never know when to close the
 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.070
to you will never know when to close the
database because there's not a sort of

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080
database because there's not a sort of
 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.680
database because there's not a sort of
on destroy a precaution so you're going

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690
on destroy a precaution so you're going
 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.210
on destroy a precaution so you're going
to keep holding on see a flick at the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220
to keep holding on see a flick at the
 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.740
to keep holding on see a flick at the
database connection and it's never going

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750
database connection and it's never going
 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.890
database connection and it's never going
to be close to behold resources and your

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900
to be close to behold resources and your
 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.779
to be close to behold resources and your
database if you try and open that data

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789
database if you try and open that data
 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.600
database if you try and open that data
if you're out gets killed the database

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610
if you're out gets killed the database
 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.430
if you're out gets killed the database
won't be closed so that s time you try

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440
won't be closed so that s time you try
 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.510
won't be closed so that s time you try
to open it you're going to exception

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520
to open it you're going to exception
 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.190
to open it you're going to exception
same database isn't closed some time and

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200
same database isn't closed some time and
 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.860
same database isn't closed some time and
so what it is it's a nice easy option to

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870
so what it is it's a nice easy option to
 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.140
so what it is it's a nice easy option to
get around sort of handle of databases I

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150
get around sort of handle of databases I
 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.540
get around sort of handle of databases I
wouldn't recommend it personally what

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550
wouldn't recommend it personally what
 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.089
wouldn't recommend it personally what
would you recommend I don't know the

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099
would you recommend I don't know the
 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.550
would you recommend I don't know the
more the more I'm at sort of five

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560
more the more I'm at sort of five
 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.500
more the more I'm at sort of five
database them the more content providers

there are a lot of boilerplate we have

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720
there are a lot of boilerplate we have
 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.540
there are a lot of boilerplate we have
to write there's a ton of good libraries

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550
to write there's a ton of good libraries
 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.890
to write there's a ton of good libraries
will help you write all that for you

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900
will help you write all that for you
 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:45.450

I think content writers probably the way

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630
I think content writers probably the way
 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.469
I think content writers probably the way
to go here and have that handle your

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:48.479
to go here and have that handle your
 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.870
to go here and have that handle your
database connection yeah I agree yeah

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880
database connection yeah I agree yeah

you get a lot of stuff for free you can

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930
you get a lot of stuff for free you can
 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.870
you get a lot of stuff for free you can
use loaders and whatnot yep and you need

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880
use loaders and whatnot yep and you need
 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.779
use loaders and whatnot yep and you need
to be using this architecture anymore oh

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789
to be using this architecture anymore oh
 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.360

best way to keep hold of them like you
know to get the hold of them than the

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610
know to get the hold of them than the
 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:34.200
know to get the hold of them than the
air taxes tag is a very good way yeah

you need to get them by attack though

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360
you need to get them by attack though
 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.600

yeah the way you've put in is a good way

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:12.790
yeah the way you've put in is a good way
 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.480
yeah the way you've put in is a good way
sort of creating a custom tag based on

sort of creating a custom tag based on
 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.340
sort of creating a custom tag based on
the position is the way I've done in the

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350
the position is the way I've done in the
 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.990
the position is the way I've done in the
past so much like you've done oh my

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000
past so much like you've done oh my
 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.230

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.100
and still active it will just sort bring
it to the front and if not it will

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.110

of active so it's through the bring into

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:38.130
of active so it's through the bring into
 

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:40.790
of active so it's through the bring into
front and so I don't think about how how

think is that you've got activities and
different tasks and so you've got your

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220
different tasks and so you've got your
 

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.310
different tasks and so you've got your
activity stack and that's in a separate

00:20:49.310 --> 00:20:49.320
activity stack and that's in a separate
 

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.680

critical that you don't lose it then

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:48.350
critical that you don't lose it then
 

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.450

probably you don't want to be using

00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:49.460
probably you don't want to be using
 

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.710
probably you don't want to be using
these high-level abstractions like

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720
these high-level abstractions like
 

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.210
these high-level abstractions like
shared preferences and databases you

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:52.220
shared preferences and databases you
 

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.100
shared preferences and databases you
probably want to be working at the file

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:54.110
probably want to be working at the file
 

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.960
probably want to be working at the file
level and then looking at the guarantees

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:55.970
level and then looking at the guarantees
 

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.460
level and then looking at the guarantees
at the different file systems will make

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:57.470
at the different file systems will make
 

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.050

you're super critical information like
 

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.470
you're super critical information like

yeah you probably want to get a little
 

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.300

bit lower level and look at the games

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:07.310
bit lower level and look at the games
 

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.420

you're looking at shared preferences and

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:14.780
you're looking at shared preferences and
 

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:16.630
you're looking at shared preferences and
there's two ways you can either apply or

there's two ways you can either apply or
 

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.980
there's two ways you can either apply or
commit them the two different methods

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:17.990
commit them the two different methods
 

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.600
commit them the two different methods
one is going to be acing so there's

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:19.610
one is going to be acing so there's
 

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:23.500

that I've done isn't it past was you can
 

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.410
that I've done isn't it past was you can
essentially get access to the camera so

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:32.420
essentially get access to the camera so
 

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.880
essentially get access to the camera so
says you take the camera streams to get

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:33.890
says you take the camera streams to get
 

00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:35.170
says you take the camera streams to get
on a surface view and then you can read

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:35.180
on a surface view and then you can read
 

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.970
on a surface view and then you can read
that there's a way to convert it to an

that do this for you because there's one

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:49.160
that do this for you because there's one
 

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.570
that do this for you because there's one
little thing where the header of each

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:52.580
little thing where the header of each
 

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.560
little thing where the header of each
packet there is no sighs so yeah

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:56.570
packet there is no sighs so yeah
 

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:58.300
packet there is no sighs so yeah
basically RTP shoot the way it's done

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:58.310
basically RTP shoot the way it's done
 

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:01.150
basically RTP shoot the way it's done
this it needs to know the the packet

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:01.160
this it needs to know the the packet
 

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.090
this it needs to know the the packet
size and by default that won't get added

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:04.100
size and by default that won't get added
 

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.650
size and by default that won't get added
in so you have to do some typical round

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:05.660
in so you have to do some typical round
 

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.320
in so you have to do some typical round
of it but it makes a lot of sense in

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:08.330
of it but it makes a lot of sense in
 

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.880
of it but it makes a lot of sense in
terms of you're using a standard stream

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:09.890
terms of you're using a standard stream
 

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.100
terms of you're using a standard stream
protocol UDP so it's going to get there

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:12.110
protocol UDP so it's going to get there
 

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:15.340
protocol UDP so it's going to get there
as fast as they can yeah that's the way

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:15.350
as fast as they can yeah that's the way
 

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:19.600
as fast as they can yeah that's the way
I've done it I think you've a human tell

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:19.610
I've done it I think you've a human tell
 

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:22.480
I've done it I think you've a human tell
me about this before about the is at the

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:22.490
me about this before about the is at the
 

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.290
me about this before about the is at the
end data point something okay look Leo

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:26.300
end data point something okay look Leo
 

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.940
end data point something okay look Leo
source projects and you'll see what I

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:27.950
source projects and you'll see what I
 

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:30.070
source projects and you'll see what I
mean about like one of the length of the

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080
mean about like one of the length of the
 

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.630
mean about like one of the length of the
packets not being right that's the only

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640
packets not being right that's the only
 

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:37.110
packets not being right that's the only
caveat okay yeah

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120
 
 

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.960
 
cool why so I think that brings us to

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:40.970
cool why so I think that brings us to

cool why so I think that brings us to
