00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.180
Is 3 comma negative 4 a
solution to the equation

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.047
5x plus 2y is equal to 7?

00:00:07.047 --> 00:00:08.630
So there's two ways
to think about it.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.230
One, you could just
substitute this x and y value

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.780
into this equation to see if
it satisfies-- and then we'll

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.670
do that way first--
and the other way

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.140
is if you had a graph
of this equation,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.330
you could see if this point sits
on that graph, which would also

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.872
mean that it is a
solution to this equation.

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:26.080
So let's do it the first way.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.860
So we have 5x plus 2y is equal
to 7, so let's substitute.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.270
Instead of x, let
us put in 3 for x.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.850
So 5 times 3 plus 2 times
y-- so y is negative 4--

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.262
plus 2 times negative 4
needs to be equal to 7.

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:52.470
I'll put a question mark
here, because we're not sure

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.610
yet if it does.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:05.200
So 5 times 3 is 15, and then 2
times negative 4 is negative 8.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.980
So the left hand side, it
simplifies to 15 minus 8,

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.840
and this needs to be equal to 7.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.960
And of course, 15 minus 8 does
equal 7, so this all works out.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.975
This is a solution, so
we've answered the question.

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.850
But I also want to show
you, this way we just

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.220
did it by substitution.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.050
If we had the graph
of this equation,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.640
we could also do it graphically.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.560
So let's give ourselves
the graph of this equation,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.570
and I'll do that by
setting up a table.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.070
There's multiple
ways to graph this.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.153
You could put it in a
slope-intercept form and all

00:01:34.153 --> 00:01:37.180
of the rest, but I'll just set
up a table of x and y values.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.200
And I'll graph it, and
then given the graph,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.000
I want to see if this
actually sits on it.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.570
And obviously it will,
because we've already

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.486
shown that this works.

00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:49.130
In fact, we could try
the point 3, negative 4,

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.740
and that actually
is on the graph.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.190
We could do it on our table,
but I won't do that just yet.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.420
I'm just going to do this
to give ourselves a graph.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.350
So let's try it when
x is equal to 0.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.560
We have 5 times 0 plus
2 times y is equal to 7.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.280
So when x is equal
to 0, y is going

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.770
to be-- so you're going to
have 0 plus 2y is equal to 7.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.190
y is going to be equal to 3.5.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.430
When x is equal to 1, you
have 5 plus 2y is equal to 7.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.950
If you subtract 5
from both sides,

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.170
you get 2y is equal to 2.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.360
You get y is equal to 1.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.090
So when x is 1, y is 1,
and when x is-- well let's

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.720
try-- well that's actually
enough for us to graph.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.430
We could keep doing more points.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.490
We could even put the
point 3, negative 4 there,

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.920
but let's just try to graph
it in this very rough sense

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.570
right here.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:00.150
So let me draw my x-axis,
and then this right over here

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.380
is my y-axis.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.100
And let me draw
some points here.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.320
So let's say that this
is y is 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.610
This is negative 1, negative
2, negative 3, negative 4.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.180
I could keep going
down in that direction.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.690
This is 1.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.360
Let me do it a little
bit-- 1, 2, 3, 4, and I

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.416
could just keep going on and
on in the positive x direction.

00:03:26.416 --> 00:03:27.540
So let's plot these points.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.950
I have 0, 3.5.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.160
When x is 0, y is 1, 2, 3.5.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.500
When x is 1, y is 1.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.140
And so if we were to draw
this line-- I'll do it

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.610
as a dotted line, just
so that I can make sure

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:44.495
I connect the dots.

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:47.030
I can do a better
job than that though.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.870
So it will look
something like that.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.510
And so if someone
gave you this line,

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.080
you'd say oh, well it's 3,
negative 4 on this line,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.900
and let's assume that
we drew it really nicely

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.060
and this was all to scale.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.530
Let me try one
last attempt at it.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.530
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.730
And If someone asked
is 3, negative 4 on it,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.990
you could visually do
it, but it's always hard

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:21.140
when you actually
don't substitute it,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.579
because you don't know.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.070
Maybe you're a little bit off.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.100
But if you look at
it over here, you

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.710
say when x is equal
to 3, what is y?

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.710
Well, you go down
here, and it looks

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.800
like y is equal to negative 4.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.080
So this is a point
3 comma negative 4.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.980
Obviously, in general,
you don't want

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.240
to just rely off of
inspecting graphs.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.781
Maybe this was 3,
negative 3.9999,

00:04:45.781 --> 00:04:47.780
and you just couldn't
tell looking at the graph.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.530
That's why you always want
to just the substitute

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.840
and make sure that
it really does equal,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.210
that this equality really
does hold true at that point,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.460
not just looking at the graph.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.640
But it's important to
realize that the graph really

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.170
is another representation
to all of the solutions

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.310
of this equation.
