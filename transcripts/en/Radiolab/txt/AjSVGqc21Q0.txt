Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio lab from [inaudible], w. N y. S. C. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, the podcast, and today on the podcast, something from our producer, Sean Cole. You've been out doing something. I've been doing many things, but I mean in particular with regard to this podcast, you have a story for us. I do. Don't tell us about this other thing. Nope. What's his story? So this is a story about a woman. You've probably seen her. Really? You've seen her face. Oh, you may have even dated her. We'll put your mouth on her to explain. So you know when you got to bring somebody back to life. One, two, three. Hold on, let me come take a class. Yep. And they make you practice on this dummy CPR. The dummy has this face that you suck on. Well, you don't suck on it. You blow into us.

Speaker 1:          00:55          When I met you don't know a lot about CPR. Yeah, right. Well, what's the story with the dog? Shoot was so, so that lady, we're nine 30 before she was a dummy. That face belonged to an actual woman's face, CPR dummies faces and actual an actual lady that was transfixing and inspiring to millions of people and used to basically hang out with Napoleon and Mozart. True. Yes. I first heard this story from this guy, Jeremy Grange. I'm a producer with BBC radio in the UK. He made it a documentary about all of this, well a while back, but basically we story starts. Our story starts in Norway. In the early 1950s there was this toy maker named Osman, the layer doll, and last month lay Adele was making plastic toys, brightly colored toys, and their story also involves his two year old son. Ta-Da. I'm the Torah LADOT. He's all grown up. Now what? Obviously I don't recall the details myself, but it's being told to me that one day he and his father, Osmond victim are at their summer home, which is on the ocean and somehow tore toddles is way out of sight and the next thing anyone knows,

Speaker 2:          02:05          the OSI was found floating face down and the C and a I was just kept floating by some air trapped in a rain coat.

Speaker 1:          02:20          He's on top of a raincoat on the water. So I think the, I think the raincoat is on top of him, but basically it's keeping him a lot. So there's a bubble of air under. Yeah. And then Osman, his dad sees him.

Speaker 2:          02:29          I don't know how long I have been in the water, but when I was pulled out by my father, I was life, uh, less.

Speaker 1:          02:37          And not only does Asman not know mouth to mouth resuscitation, this was in 1954. There is no mouth to mouth resuscitation. I mean, no, people didn't know about it. It hadn't really been developed yet. And so his dad, they was shaking me on doing whatever he could. Gradually I responded and as fate would have it, not long after that, Osmond, I mean freshly saved, a son from drowning is contacted by the man who is developing mouth to mouth resuscitation. An Austrian doctor called Peter Safer, a good name for a guy trying to keep people safer. We'd worked out all the basics of CPR with the mouth to mouth and the compressing the chest and everything like that. But he realized he needed a way for people to practice this. And my father was asked whether he possibly could help making some kind of training device. And pretty quickly, Osman thought, well, we need the dummy and the mannequins. Somewhere along the line, Aspen had to decide what the face of this dummy was gonna look like.

Speaker 3:          03:37          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Should it be a woman? Should it be a man? I think you felt that people would be more, um, intimidated or shy or if it was a man's face. So he decided to go with a woman's face and attractive woman's face because at that time you were asking lay people to blow into the quote unquote dead person. You know, you don't want to blow into somebody who's gaping with a horror face. She should, she should look comfortably dead. And then the, uh, came across this, uh, um, girl in my grandparents' home asthma and is there in the house and he looks up at the wall and sees this face of a woman. It's a mask. And my father was taken back by the beauty of this face and he says, that's the face. That's the face. I'll use this as a mass as what kind of mask was this?

Speaker 1:          04:31          It was a death mask. What's the death mask? All right, I'm going to get, I'm going to go back even further here. So stay with me for a minute. Back in the 19th century, commonly people after they were dead, they'd have masks made of their faces. Here's one of Abraham Lincoln. There's a death deathmatch. Really? Yeah, cause you want, you want to preserve their countenance. So right after the person dies, pretty much you take a bunch of clay and you stick it on their face and you make a mold, fill the mold with plaster and then you've got a plaster masking. You can reproduce it and reproduce it. It was especially common in Paris.

Speaker 4:          05:06          Hey Radiolab. It is a sunny, cold Paris October morning and weeks, months makers, workshops that existed around Paris 120 years ago. There's only one left nor about to visit. Cool. Lorenzi is, which is a, which is it like a mass making shops. So coming up to the gate, we asked our friends, Kristin Clark, and tomorrow's Red Dorevitch to drop by there for us. I've still got this incredible workshop and you go up some rickety narrow wooden stairs and you get to the top and there's just level pranks of faces or rows and rows of people that look like they're sleeping. Death mosques of who is the one at the top there? Everybody Know Napoleon and bullion here where the rope spear Hovis. He was in the French mucked sauce and Beethoven. It's the mask of shopper. The composer looking at you from the wall and from the ceiling. All of their eyes are closed face after face after face. And there are famous historical figures, but also among them is this girl.

Speaker 5:          06:14          Oh,

Speaker 1:          06:15          she is not a poet. She's not a conqueror's. Not Anybody.

Speaker 5:          06:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:18          which has gotta be somebody. I mean who, who? Well, the story that emerged after she died in, this is possibly fancy, possibly, you know, maybe fact, but the sources are lost to us. So we were not sure exactly what happened, but she was young in her early to mid twenties who, you know, came from the countryside, not from Paris, you know, she was a sort of poor, uneducated woman, but she came to Paris, meets a man and there was a love affair, which then turns sour

Speaker 4:          06:51          the stories that may be she was pregnant and abandoned or maybe she was just abandoned. She goes to a bridge that's stretching across the same, might be the one by the loo

Speaker 2:          07:03          steps to the edge and she threw herself into the river

Speaker 4:          07:14          and he drowned and then the body was recovered. She was taken to the morgue, which wasn't that far away. And in those days police would be displayed behind glass and hopefully their relatives or their friends would come along and say, yes, that's my father or my sister or my daughter. And they would reclaim the bodies

Speaker 1:          07:37          since they were displayed. We're also like strangers coming around for a kind of like weird Museumy, um, thrill that. Absolutely, yes it was. That's probably what it was with her. She was a particularly beautiful co-ops and everybody rushed down to see her. And eventually the, the guy who ran the morgue took a plaster cast of her face because she was so beautiful. He was just struck by her, just like layer it all, just like everybody. What'd she look like? Yeah, I wouldn't say sort of plump face around it face. She's lovely, but not in a come hither way. She's more like sort of weirdly saintly looking like she's serene, innocent, serene, innocent, but also sort of knowing and she has a little smile. If you look at the master, there's just this little smile playing on the lips and it's just enough to kind of make you think, well, why is she smiling and who is she? And the problem was if wasn't identified, oh, so they didn't know. No. And so ultimately people started calling her by this name, the [inaudible]. Um, can you, well, so you know, like the word Ingenue, which means innocent lady like, or the character of the ingenue, the movies. This is

Speaker 4:          08:55          long canoe, which means unknown. And can you tell us the unknown woman, uh, of the scene? And then gradually the, uh, plastic cost worked its way into the mask makers workshops and now it's onto the streets of Paris.

Speaker 1:          09:12          And it wasn't long before this woman became a sensation and everyone started writing about her, the face of the young drunk woman real cause beautiful because it's mild smiled so deceptively as though it view a Niacin in the woman who had drawn a self here years ago and who is so beautiful that's Nabokov, touchingly frail young shoulders who wrote this entire poem sort of demanding, you know, who made you jump? Who was he? You know, who was the guy that'd be [inaudible] tell me your mysterious seducer. Was He some neighbors? Curly locked nephew of the loud tie and gold capped too. In any case, this mask is a huge deal in all thousands. Countless people have it hanging on their wall the same way you would hang Napoleon on your wall because he's Napoleon, but they don't know who she is. And that's sort of the point. They're like, who is she? And everybody's captivated, including

Speaker 4:          10:05          our toy maker, a small layer doe. He felt that the [inaudible] canoe, the attractiveness and the story would be the right model to use for the first CPR mannequin in history. Who has a name crystal CN resusci n could you describe what we have in front of us here? What we see is the very first, uh, production muddled. I'll recess the album from 1968. She's had to check. The face has changed slightly because if you want to do CPR, you have to have an open mouth. So regrettably, the slight smile is now imparted, but you've still got the high forehead and the closed eyes. And I'm every went through the [inaudible] CPR mannequin that's produced. 300 million people have been trained on this thing since it was first introduced in 1968. And every single dummy has the face of the encore, new still stiller. And um, hopefully she's looking quite attractive. Four six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Craziest part about it is that this face of this wound woman nine 30, becomes the face that people blow into to learn how to save drowned people. It's like, it's like over and over and over again.

Speaker 4:          11:41          Thousands and thousands of people are trying to bring this woman back to life. That's kind of beautiful. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          11:55          issue. Maybe like it's like it'd be fact. You've just given her isn't really a given about her. Actually

Speaker 1:          12:00          no about this, this woman. Well, so I mean, Jeremy went into his research sort of asking the same question, what do we really know? What we really know what's true?

Speaker 6:          12:08          I, uh, I have a horrible suspicion. The truth, you know, is that she didn't die. Yeah. I mean, having shown the mask to Pascal's your account, who's a member of the BRCA and fluvial

Speaker 1:          12:21          this is the river police whose job it is to pull dead bodies out of the sane rescue people from the sane. And Pascal is in charge. So

Speaker 2:          12:30          whoa, you know, hundreds of have drowned bodies. Uh, he can look at a face and he can know whether that's somebody who's drowned. And he said it's surprising when I saw the picture to, to, to see that so peaceful face just because, uh, everyone we found in the water is never are so peaceful and not to put too fine a point on it, but when somebody drowned, they start decomposing quite quickly. They are swollen most of the times or the features that you have seen in life don't really last very long. It's not so nice looking once somebody who's been in the water. Do you think she's attractive? Yeah. Yes, of course. Yeah. Yeah. Just, she looks very regretful.

Speaker 1:          13:22          So if she didn't die then who was she then? She may have been a model that somebody just thought was pretty, wanted to take a plaster cast for her face. I facing Munis really at that point it's, it's anybody's guess. We don't know this, this is our end of knowing her and knowing what's frustrating, but maybe it's better that way. I mean, if you don't like the, the reason why she was so captivating is because people don't know and they can just feel this gap with their own stories that can just sort of sit there and muse a better. In fact, uh, Jeremy, uh, told me this story about this museum that he went to in Liverpool. It was the historic house of a photographer there

Speaker 6:          13:56          [inaudible] in the kind of waiting room, the walls, the mask of the ankle knew actually on the wall there. So you know, slightly disingenuously I asked the Guide, Oh, what's that? Very disingenuine. Well then you knew everything about it. At that point I thought, I thought I'd see, and it was amazing. She told me this story about twins, two, two girls from Liverpool, and this is the important bit from where we were from the city where we weren't, not from no from anywhere.

Speaker 1:          14:31          The story was almost exactly the same except this time one of the twin girls left Liverpool in her late teens or early twenties, made her way to Paris, fell in love, got knocked up. The guy left, she despaired and then [inaudible] off the bridge and drowned and the mosque of this beautiful corpse was taken. But this, this version keeps going after that, 50 years later, the surviving twin who never knew what happened to her sister, takes a trip to Paris

Speaker 6:          14:58          walking through the streets of Paris and sees this face on the wall and yeah, this time, instead of it being her own faith, it's the face of her twin sister who's there. And, and so her twin who, who died long before her is kind of kept forever young. Well, she's had to hage and so she's from Liverpool now as far as you know,

Speaker 1:          15:21          as far as the Liverpudlians are concerned. Yeah. And I wonder if she's also from Cornwall as far as, as far as the corn plants are concerned and from, you know,

Speaker 6:          15:29          like maybe she's, um, a Moscow bite as far as the people in Moscow,

Speaker 1:          15:33          she says Cillian as far as the Sicilians are concerned,

Speaker 4:          15:36          maybe she's a Laotian as far as the Laotians has been some kind of Buenos already in Australia. Hello cal cutten. As far as the [inaudible], as far as the bay routines are concerned, just with [inaudible] school, Dean Denver as [inaudible] deletion [inaudible] in Dallas. Pretty sure Sanko. And before we go, thank you to Jeremy Grange and to our readers, Pike Melon Off Ski Marine Gudo and Jeff Spurgeon, and special thanks to be some Morehouse and Michelle kind of.
