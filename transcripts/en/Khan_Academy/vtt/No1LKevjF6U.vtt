00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.644
- [Voiceover] So we have a
graph here of the function

00:00:02.644 --> 00:00:05.869
f of x, and I'm telling
you right now that f of x

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:08.031
is going to be an exponential function.

00:00:08.031 --> 00:00:09.852
It looks like one, but
it's even nicer when

00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:11.522
someone tells you that.

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:16.016
And our goal in this video is
to figure out at what x value,

00:00:16.295 --> 00:00:21.017
so when does f of x?

00:00:22.468 --> 00:00:24.385
At what x value is f of x

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:27.416
going to be equal to negative 1/25.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.026
And you might be tempted to
just eyeball it over here,

00:00:30.026 --> 00:00:34.294
but when f of x is
negative 1/25, that's like

00:00:34.622 --> 00:00:36.411
right below the x-axis.

00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:41.315
If I try to eyeball it, it
would be very difficult.

00:00:41.669 --> 00:00:44.245
It's very difficult to
tell what value that is.

00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:46.573
It might be at three, it might be at four.

00:00:46.938 --> 00:00:48.632
I am not sure.

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:53.633
Well, I don't want to just
eyeball it, just guess it.

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:55.872
Instead, I'm gonna
actually find an expression

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:57.755
that defines f of x because

00:00:57.755 --> 00:00:59.351
they've given us some information here.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:02.864
And then I can just solve
for x, so let's do that.

00:01:03.388 --> 00:01:05.753
Well, since we know that f of
x is an exponential function,

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:07.194
we know it's going to take the form

00:01:07.194 --> 00:01:11.047
f of x is equal to our initial value a

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:16.529
times our common ratio r to the xth power.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:19.359
Well, the initial value
is straightforward enough.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.849
That's going to be the value
that the function takes on

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.919
when x is equal to zero.

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:25.734
And you can even see it
here, if x is equal to zero,

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:27.574
the r to the x would just be one.

00:01:27.574 --> 00:01:30.357
And so f of zero will just be equal to a.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.790
And so what is f of zero?

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:35.631
Well, when x is equal to zero,

00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:37.654
which essentially we're saying,

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:40.712
where does it intersect the y-axis?

00:01:40.712 --> 00:01:44.433
We see f of zero is negative 25.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.391
So a is going to be negative 25.

00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:53.265
When x is zero, the r
to the x is just one.

00:01:53.507 --> 00:01:55.880
So f of zero is going to be negative 25.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.805
We see that right over there.

00:01:57.922 --> 00:02:00.110
Now to figure out the common ratio,

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.579
there's a couple of ways
you could think about it.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.756
The common ratio is the ratio between

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:09.110
two successive values
that are separated by one.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.397
What do I mean by that?

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:13.086
Well, you could view
it as the ratio between

00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:16.317
f of one and f of zero.

00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:18.145
That's going to be the common ratio.

00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:20.670
Or the ratio between f of two

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.387
and f of one.

00:02:22.387 --> 00:02:24.393
That is going to be the common ratio.

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:29.247
Well, lucky for us, we know
f of zero is negative 25.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:34.496
And we know that f of one,
when x is equal to one,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.241
y, or f of x, or f of one
is equal to negative five.

00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:41.990
And so just like that
we're able to figure out

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.294
that our common ratio r is
negative five over negative 25,

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:49.810
which is the same thing as 1/5.

00:02:49.977 --> 00:02:51.597
Divide a negative by a
negative, you get a positive.

00:02:51.597 --> 00:02:54.495
So you get a five over 25, which is 1/5.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.012
We can write an expression
that defines f of x.

00:03:01.232 --> 00:03:03.560
f of x is going to be equal to

00:03:04.043 --> 00:03:07.227
negative 25 times

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.135
1/5 to the x power.

00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:15.323
And so let's go back to our question.

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:19.543
When is this going to be
equal to negative 1/25?

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.789
So when is this equal to negative 1/25?

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:23.712
Well, let's just set
them equal to each other.

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:25.908
There's a siren outside.

00:03:25.908 --> 00:03:27.336
I don't know if you hear it.

00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:30.363
I'll power through.

00:03:31.643 --> 00:03:34.790
So let's see at what x
value does this expression

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.325
equal negative 1/25?

00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:40.637
Let's see, we can multiply.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.032
Well, actually, we want to solve for x.

00:03:43.032 --> 00:03:47.501
So let's see, let's divide
both sides by negative 25.

00:03:47.957 --> 00:03:51.679
And so we are going to get 1/5

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:53.879
to the xth power

00:03:54.002 --> 00:03:57.632
is equal to, if we divide
both sides by negative 25,

00:03:57.632 --> 00:03:59.530
this negative 25 is gonna go away.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.332
And on the right-hand
side, we're going to have,

00:04:01.332 --> 00:04:02.902
divide a negative by a negative
is going to be positive.

00:04:02.902 --> 00:04:05.399
It's going to be 1/625.

00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:12.783
And 1/5 to the xth power.

00:04:12.783 --> 00:04:15.851
This is the same thing
as one to the xth power

00:04:16.898 --> 00:04:21.068
over five to the xth power is equal to

00:04:22.938 --> 00:04:25.407
1/625.

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:31.278
Well, one to the xth power

00:04:34.428 --> 00:04:36.116
is just going to be equal to one.

00:04:37.273 --> 00:04:38.856
It doesn't matter that we have this

00:04:38.856 --> 00:04:40.669
to the xth power over here.

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:43.783
I thought I was erasing
that with a black color.

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:45.988
There you go, that's a black
color right over there.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.141
So we can see that five to the xth power

00:04:48.141 --> 00:04:50.355
needs to be equal to 625.

00:04:51.535 --> 00:04:53.062
So let me write that over here.

00:04:53.562 --> 00:04:55.289
Whoops, didn't change my color.

00:04:55.408 --> 00:04:58.836
Five to the xth power needs to be equal to

00:04:59.238 --> 00:05:03.156
625.

00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:05.599
Now the best way I could
think of doing this

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.685
is let's just think
about our powers of five.

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.665
So five to the first power is five.

00:05:10.903 --> 00:05:13.401
Five squared is 25.

00:05:13.803 --> 00:05:17.359
Five to the third is 125.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.575
Five to the fourth, we'll
multiply that by five,

00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:23.038
you're going to get 625.

00:05:23.555 --> 00:05:26.135
So x is going to be 4

00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:30.509
cause five to the fourth power is 625.

00:05:30.584 --> 00:05:33.802
So we can now say that f of four

00:05:36.964 --> 00:05:38.974
is equal to

00:05:40.471 --> 00:05:42.996
negative 1/25.

00:05:46.132 --> 00:05:47.978
And once again, you can verify that.

00:05:48.138 --> 00:05:50.224
You can verify that right over here.

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:56.057
1/5 to the fourth power is gonna be 1/625.

00:05:57.193 --> 00:06:02.017
Negative 25 over positive 625
is going to be negative 1/25.

00:06:02.574 --> 00:06:05.412
So hopefully that clears
things up a little bit.
