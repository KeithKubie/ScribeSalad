00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.840
If you were to fly in a straight line, faster
than the speed of light, directly toward the

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.560
edge of the universe… you'd eventually end
up back where you started, because there IS

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.560
no edge.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:15.030
Take 5 seconds and think about that.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.830
Howdy people who want to have their mind blown.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.439
Trace here for DNews.

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:19.699
This one was super fun to research.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.070
A study came out recently in Physical Review
Letters, stating that cosmology was safe;

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.490
the universe was, indeed, isotropic.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.210
I know you're relieved.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.800
When the ancient Greeks looked up at the sky,
they realized the universe could be one of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.890
two things, infinite -- stretching forever
in every direction, or finite -- with an edge.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.640
When Newton described the law of gravity,
he thought about this too, and figured it

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.110
must be infinite, because otherwise all the
gravity out there would have collapsed the

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.350
universe by now.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.949
Then, Einstein assumed the universe was static
-- creating a cosmological constant to make

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.140
his math work.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.730
But then, Edwin Hubble came along…

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.239
In 1925, Edwin Hubble was looking at galaxies.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.280
He was a lawyer by training, but loved cosmology
and astronomy.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.650
He got time on a telescope in California,
and began measuring the doppler shift of the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.660
light coming from galaxies.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.500
Doppler shift is why an ambulance or train
sounds different coming at you than after

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.710
it passes.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.480
That frequency shift is measurable, and he
found every galaxy we could see was flying

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.730
away from us.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.450
He realized space is expanding!

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.600
He published his findings in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences in 1929,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.390
and holy crap.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.310
Einstein called his cosmological constant
his "greatest blunder."

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.530
Mathematician Georges Lemaître solved Einstein's
equations in this expanding universe, and once

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.430
we realized it was expanding, we could assume
it started somewhere and thus, the Big Bang

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.970
was conceived!

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.700
This was (and is) huge, and only getting bigger.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.700
Expansion pun!

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.960
Okay, so, if all that's true, and our universe
is expanding and isotropic what does that even mean?

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.680
Think of our universe as baking raisin bread.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.460
If each of the raisins is a galaxy, as the
bread bakes, the dough rises, and the raisin-galaxies

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.210
expand away from each other along with the
rise, in all directions at once!

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.780
If this happens irregularly, the universe
is anisotropic -- like the grain of a tree,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.940
it's "stronger" or tends to have layers, or
striations where it might expand faster or

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.940
slower.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.150
Isotropic universes, like ours, they don't have
those.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.110
They're consistent, smooth, homogenous, and
symmetrical… ours is all that.

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.690
According to Astronomer Phil Plait, it's expanding
at "74.2 kilometers, per second per megaparsec"

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.740
(plus or minus 3.6 kilometers) -- it's now called
the Hubble Constant.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.700
"A galaxy 10 megaparsecs away," Plait wrote
for Discover Magazine, "would be moving away

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.210
from us at 742 km/sec" Basically, every million
years, galaxies are point-zero-zero-seven

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.470
percent farther away from each other.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.470
Trust me.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.470
That's really really fast.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.280
And, thanks to dark energy, it's getting faster.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.380
But that's a whole other story.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.080
I'm sure you're thinking, okay cool, our isotropic,
infinite universe is expanding.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080
Fantastic.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.500
Expanding into… what?

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.960
That's the complicated part.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.390
The universe, by definition is all existing
matter, and space as a whole.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.900
If the universe is infinite and homogenous,
then it's not expanding into anything, it's

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.689
just… expanding.

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:15.710
Think of it this way...

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.580
You're an ant, standing on a balloon of incredible
size. It's so big it seems flat from your perspective.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.810
As the balloon continues to inflate, it's
expanding in every direction.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.510
No matter which direction you look, the balloon
is getting larger!

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.830
No matter how fast or far you run, you'll
eventually end up back where you started.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.211
Like a video game from the 1970s. You go off the
screen, and you just come back on the other

00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:36.211
side.

00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:39.960
This is how astronomers look at the universe,
but it's not a 2-dimensional surface of a

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.520
balloon, it's a three-dimensional region,
expanding in a 4-dimensional universe in every

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.540
direction at once.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.420
No matter where you go, you'll eventually
end up still in the universe, and back where

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.420
you started.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.730
This is also why there's no center of the
universe.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.140
Where would the "center" of the balloon's
surface be?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.180
Knowing the universe is expanding, and how
fast, and that it's isotropic, keeps cosmology,

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.970
Einstein and hundreds of other scientists'
theories safe, for now.

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.610
But as we learn more, and measure deeper and
deeper into the universe, who knows what we're gonna

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.610
see.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.330
If you want to know more crazy complicated
science, how about the butterfly effect?

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.680
It's not what you think it is.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.620

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.000
