00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.700
Choose all the
relationships that

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.210
are described by the following
equation-- y is equal to 7/8 x.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.350
All right, let's look
at these relationships.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.780
Relationship A-- a
bouquet of 8 daisies

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.239
cost $7 at Flora's Flowers.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:19.150
A bouquet of 12
daisies costs $11.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.870
The equation describes
the relationship

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.800
between the number of
daisies, x, and their price

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.000
at Flora's Flowers, y.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.080
So let's look at scenario A.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.390
So our x is the
number of daisies,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.580
and our y is their price.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.980
So when we get 8 daisies,
they say it costs us $7.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.470
When we get 12 daisies, they
tell us that it cost $11.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.150
So let's see whether this
relationship right over here

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.270
is the same as this
relationship right over here.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.700
So if I were to take-- so let
me write this right over here.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.760
So here, it says y needs
to be equal to 7/8 x.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.090
So let's figure out
what's 7/8 x is equal to.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.092
So if I take 7/8 times 8--
well, that's going to be 7.

00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:10.050
Let me write this down.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.540
7 over 8 times 8 is equal to 7.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.550
So this checks.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.840
7/8 x is the same as the
price that they gave us.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.280
So so far, these two
seem consistently,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.680
at least based on
this first data point.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.060
Now let's look at 7/8 of 12.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.840
Let's see, if we divide
12 and 8 each by 4,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.600
this is going to be the same
thing as 7 times 3 over 2,

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.320
which is the same thing as 21
over 2, which is equal to 10.5.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.740
So if y were equal to 7/8 x,
12 daisies would cost $10.50.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.220
But we just learned that
12 daisies cost $11.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.710
So these two things aren't
equal to each other.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.040
So this is not the
same relationship.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.320
In this scenario, y
does not equals 7/8x,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.130
so we can rule this one out.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.540
Let's look at relationship
B. There's a 12.5% discount

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.620
for every item at Crazy Joe's.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.880
The equation describes
a relationship

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.820
between a given item's
price before the discount

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.840
and after the discount.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.290
So here, they're
giving us a percentage.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.140
And this equation
right over here

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.450
it's written as a fraction.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.545
So let me at least convert
this into a fraction,

00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:34.670
and see what kind of a
fractional discount this is.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.420
And maybe I can
construct an equation,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.270
and see if that equation is
the same as this one here.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:53.410
So 12.5% is the same
thing as 12.5 over 100.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.430
And if we multiply the
numerator and denominator by 10,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.620
that's the same thing
as 125 over 1,000.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.450
Now let's see if we can
simplify this a little bit.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.641
If we divide the
numerator-- well,

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:13.890
actually, it looks like
they're both divisible by 125.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.640
We divide the numerator
by 125, we get 1.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.420
We divide the denominator
by 125, we get 8.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.580
8 times 125 is 800 plus
200, which is 1,000.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.730
So this is the
same thing as 1/8.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.210
So really, there is a 1/8
discount for every item

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.890
at Crazy Joe's.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.610
The equation describes
a relationship

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.930
between a given item's
price before the discount

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.599
and the price
after the discount.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.890
So let's just think about that.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.360
The price after
the discount, based

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.030
on the information
they gave here,

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.600
is going to be
equal to the price

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.230
before the discount
minus the discount.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.780
So minus 1/8 of
the original price.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.750
Well, what's x minus 1/8 x?

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.810
Or another way of thinking
about, what's 1x minus 1/8 x?

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.800
Well, that's just
going to be 7/8 x?

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.860
So this relationship
is the exact same

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.160
as this one over here.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.370
The price after the discount
is 7/8 of the original price.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.640
So we can feel good
about this one.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.030
These two are the same.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.149
Let's look at scenario C. And
I will do scenario C in orange.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.670
A ticket to the paint
ball arena cost $7,

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.430
and comes with 8 paint balls.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.106
Every extra paint ball costs $1.

00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:26.730
The equation describes
the relationship

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.494
between the number of paint
balls x and their price y.

00:04:29.494 --> 00:04:30.410
So let's look at this.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.600
We'll do something similar
to what we did up here.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.580
So we'll have x, which is
the number of paint balls.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.340
And then we have y,
which is their price.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.070
And then we will
think about what 7/8

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.720
x would have been equal to.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.940
And let's see if y
is equal to 7/8 x.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.059
So when we get 8
paint balls-- so

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:50.350
x is the number of paint balls.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.270
So when we get 8 paint
balls, the price is 7.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.410
And if we take 7/8 x-- so
7/8 times 8 is indeed 7.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.220
So in this scenario,
for this data point,

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.567
it is true that y
is equal to 7 x.

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:06.400
Now let's get a couple
of other data points.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.941
And we might have
to construct these.

00:05:07.941 --> 00:05:09.940
So every extra
paint ball costs $1.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.477
So if we have one
extra paint ball--

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.060
so we have 9 paint
balls-- we're going

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.268
to have to pay 1 more dollar.

00:05:14.268 --> 00:05:16.200
We're going to have to pay $8.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.920
And so, what's 7/8 x here?

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.901
So 7/8 times 9?

00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:21.525
Well, we don't even
have to compute it.

00:05:21.525 --> 00:05:24.770
This is going to be something
that's going to be like 63/8.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.080
64/8 would be 8.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.650
So this is a little
bit less than 8.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.870
But the important point is
that 8 is not equal to 63/8.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.310
y does not equal 7/8 x in
this scenario right over here.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.670
So this equation does not
describe all of these data

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.930
points, so we can rule that out

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.890
Finally, they say the
equation corresponds

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.900
to the graph following graph.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.820
So let's see if y equals 7
x corresponds to this graph

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.430
right over here.

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.426
So what we're really
saying is that for any x,

00:05:58.426 --> 00:06:00.550
y is going to be 7/8 of that?

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.140
And the easiest one is to
see when x is equal to 8.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.810
When x is equal to
7/8, x would be 7.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.200
When x is 0, 7/8 of 0 will be 0.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.254
And so, linear relationship--
if we have a line,

00:06:14.254 --> 00:06:15.670
and if it goes
through the origin,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.360
it is a proportional
relationship--

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.090
that the ratio between
the x and the y-axis

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.340
is always going to be the same,
or between the y and the x

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.070
values is also always
going to be the same.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.150
And we know that that
ratio is the correct one.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.400
The ratio of y to x
throughout this line is 7/8.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.370
Here, it literally is--
our numbers are 7/8.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.310
Well, we can even
take other points.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:44.080
The ratio of 3 and 1/2 to 4 is
still the same thing as 7/8.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.950
So this relationship,
relationship

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.620
D-- the relationship
described by the graph--

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.170
does coincide with the
relationships described

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.020
by this equation.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.532
So I would go with B and D.
