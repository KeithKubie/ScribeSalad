00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.040
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. I apologize up front. My left eardrum

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.050
has exploded. I have no idea how loud I'm talking. My feedback loop is broken.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.090
Anyway the purpose of this video is to inform you what I did in

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.100
Australia for two and a half weeks. It was awesome, I did all kinds of crazy stuff but there's

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.160
really no linearity to it and I figure the best way is just blergh.. show you

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.180
everything. So, here's the deal. We're just gonna go on the trip as it went down,

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.220
you're gonna know what to expect coming up on Smarter Every Day and at the end I hope you're excited and happy

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.250
because you saw a wombat, me rubbing on a kangaroo and me diving.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.250
That's the kind of stuff that's about to happen. Anyway, let's go. Australia.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.260
[music]

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.290
This is Chris Cassella. He runs a Facebook page in Australia called Science Alert.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.310
He came to Alabama to visit me back in the winter. I didn't really know why he was visiting, but

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.330
we had a good time. Turns out, I think he was just checking me out to see if I was the real deal

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.360
and a good fit, because Chris was planning a huge event for National Science Week

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.390
in Australia. That's how I got to go on this trip. Science Alert flew me to

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.430
Australia for National Science Week, and my wife, pretty big deal. So first

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.440
things first. On the way to Australia I stopped off and hung out with a buddy named Mark Rober

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.470
in VidCon. Now Mark let me crash at his house and we went and we did this crazy experiment

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.510
back behind the Jet Propulsion Lab at NASA. There's this old river bed that runs

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.530
behind it, so Mark had just kind of like snuck in there and setup this huge experiment

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.560
involving fire and mirrors and motors and all kinds of crazy stuff. [pop] [cheer] [laugh]

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.600
Yeah you've got my hat. Anyway, at VidCon it was pretty awesome. The first thing

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.660
we did is I did a panel with Gavin from the Slow Mo Guys. It was called the art and science of slow motion video.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.710
Hey Gavin, my name's Destin. You wanna come play in Alabama?

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.760
- Yeah but you've got a million subs.
- Shut up. [Audience laughs]

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.780
So he comes over and he's like what are we gonna do, and we're like alright,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.810
we got a propane tank. We literally took it off my grill. We had a propane tank.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.830
And my dad's pond had just drained out for some reason. We don't know why.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.880
We're gonna throw the propane tank in the bottom of the pond and we're gonna go get

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.930
guns and we're just gonna like shoot the propane tank.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.940
That's the beautiful thing about Gavin's channel, is it is completely unapolagetic.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.950
It's like we don't know what the crap's gonna happen but we're just gonna do it.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.970
Whereas on Smarter Every Day I'm like OK now we'll talk about the velocity of the banana as it was sliced.. [crowd laughs]

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.040
We shoot it, and it just goes. pshhhh!

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.080
- Yeah it was just a big white cloud just flew out of it

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.110
and fogged the entire pond. There was no explosion whatsoever.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.170
- And so the pond is full of propane, and it's

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.180
not going anywhere, it's heavier than air, it's just sitting there and we're like we need fire in that now.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.230
[audience laughs]
And so one of us said

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.240
dragon's breath, dragon's breath! So we run over

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.300
we get the 12 gauge and we're like loading the dragons breath and like who's shooting? Dan's like I'm shooting!

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.310
[unintelligible] GO!.... shot... nothing.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.350
[laugh]
We just kind of looked at each other and we're like...

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.380
That was gonna be a three million view video.
[laughs]

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.390
- It just puffed away. But watching Dan so violently attack a cloud

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.430
was pretty interesting.
- Now Dan from the Slow Mo Guys

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.460
was not there because he's fighting a war right now. Remember that people are still doing that.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.570
So another cool thing I did is I just setup a slow motion camera edit booth and I just let people come up and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.580
play at what I call the slow motion touch table. They had a lot of fun and there were a lot of really

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.640
creative people, but I really kind of tricked people into hurting themselves so that I could get

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.680
it on slow mo and they did it like all day long. It was really fun.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.710
[slap]
(Crowd) Ooh ow!

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.720
- Awesome. Looks great!

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.750
[auditorium crowd noise]

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.280
 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.800
[snap] Oh!

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.810
 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.820
 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.900
 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.040
 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.080
[laughter]

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:12.980
 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.130
[slap]

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.140
 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.190
So after that I did a really cool EDU panel with Derek from Veritasium, Emily

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.260
from Brain Scoop and the great John Green from Crash Course and the cool thing about that is

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.270
half way through our panel this little girl named Presley stands up, she's home schooled,

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.330
and she decides to give a monologue about how she feels about educational video

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.360
on YouTube.
- I am a

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.380
home schooled child and I started

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.400
learning about history and science and such from

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.440
just reading some books that we got from the library but once I

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.460
found all of you guys I just started

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.480
I learned more about history and science and biology and

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.530
a lot of things, so I think it's umm

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.550
really cool that people make history videos

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.610
on YouTube, and you are my favourite teachers.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.630
[applause]
- I like kids

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.690
and I like it when kids learn. So yeah she reduced us all to blubbering idiots and we

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.750
were very happy but at the same time we felt very touched. That was pretty awesome.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.770
So that was a good way to round off my VidCon experience. Anyway after that

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.780
my wife flew into town and we just spent a day chilling out at the Getty Centre,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.830
which is an awesome place you can go and check out amazing architecture, art,

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.900
all kinds of old manuscripts and books and landscape, it's amazing.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.940
Anyway, that's what we decided to do to get ready to go to Australia together for

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.960
our ten year anniversary trip. So we fly across the Pacific Ocean and we go straight into Sydney

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.980
and from Sydney we go to Canberra which is the capital of Australia. I knew things were gonna be

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.020
good cause when I got off the plane I met George and Evan and they actually recognised

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.090
me from Smarter Every Day, so George, Evan, wassup? Construction on Canberra started in

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.140
1913 because Melbourne and Sydney couldn't agree on which city was the coolest and should be the capital

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.150
Kinda lame I know but that's the way how history works some times. Anyway Canberra

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.200
means meeting place in the local language and boom, that's where Chris lives.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.240
So what is that?
- That's parliament house.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.290
- That's the capital of Australia, that spot.
- Yeah right there.

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.300
- So in Canberra we chilled out for a day, got rid of the jet lag and then the next morning we went to the Tidbinbilla

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.330
Nature Reserve with Chris. The whole point was to get slow motion video

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.370
of kangaroos and to let Destin interact with kangaroos. Seriously, I'm gonna put my

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:35.390
hand down here where your pouch is and we're just gonna see how this goes. Don't bite me.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.420
Just don't bite me. Just don't do that. I cannot feel a pouch.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.480
So NASA's based in America right? Have you ever thought about how they communicate

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.520
with Mars when it's on the other side of the world? Well the answer is NASAs

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.530
deep space network located in Canberra. We were there a few minutes ago, now we're

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.580
in Canberra. It's awesome. We went and visited there and I got to learn all kinds of cool stuff.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.600
There'll be a video coming out about that. OK this is where Chris came through as like a serious

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.610
bro. He knew it was my ten year anniversary trip, and he knew my wife was

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.660
going to be like involved in all this science stuff I had to do for the rest of the trip. So he

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.680
rented a car for us and he sent us up to this place called The Heavens located in

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.700
Kangaroo Valley. On the way there we just like get to experience all this crazy wildlife

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.730
We kept seeing these really weird things. What is it?

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.780
(Wife) Goodness.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.800
(Destin) It's stiff as a board. What's it called

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:31.830
the thing we've been seeing dead?
- A wombat. [laugh]

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.870
That is what it is.
- Here wombat, wombat, wombat.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.930
 

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:43.970
Where's he going? We had shrimp on the barbie, which nobody

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.000
says in Australia because they call them prawns. We got to see a place called

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.030
Fitzroy Falls. It's a really high waterfall.

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.070
- Oh you're recording it! [laugh]

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:00.090
- You know I'm gonna do this at some point. Basically I drove up to a random guy's house, I knock

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.120
on the door and I was like hey, I want to meet a real Australian, can we talk for a little while?

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.120
I didn't think I would ever see a gun in Australia. I was wrong.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.160
I'm extremely impressed. All these things have been modified

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.290
After we arrived back in town that was our first panel. This happened

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.320
in Australian National University. I sat next to Phil Plait The Bad Astronomer, Mitchell

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.370
and Greg from ASAP Science, Henry from Minute Physics, Elise Andrews from IFLS,

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:28.410
we had a really good time. After we got done at the panel at ANU we got in Chris's van

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.430
and we drove up to Sydney where we had a meetup with a bunch of random people that came out when we

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.480
tweeted about it. We're in Sydney OK we did a meetup. This is Eric.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.520
Eric's been watching since the chicken head tracking video. Henry,
- Same here.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:44.540
- No you haven't.
- Yeah I have.
- That's a long time man!

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.560
- 1..2..3..
- So the next morning we got up and Tara and I went to church out in Sydney.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.600
We visited a guy named John North who had preached in Alabama before. We wanted to say hey to to him

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:56.620
so we took a taxi out to his church and then afterwards came back for a Sydney Harbour cruise, which was

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.640
a big deal because we went swimming in Sydney Harbour in the middle of winter

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:04.660
which was crazy. So there's this artist called M C Escher and he used to make drawings of

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.670
mathematically impossible awesome architecture that's like inspired by math.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.720
Check this out. I feel like I'm staying in one of his buildings.

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.740
I'm on the 9th floor and it's this infinite

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.810
reality, like you can see there's these walkways all over the place, and

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:24.830
you can see down several floors. It's like this whole building

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:28.860
was designed by M C Escher. You can look up

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.910
and you can see all these crazy board walks. Look at this.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.950
So after we left Sydney we went to Townsville, that's where James Cook University is.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:40.980
It's the place to go for marine biology. After the professors gave us a rundown on all the

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
research they were working on we went and did another panel and all these cool people came out

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.070
and hung out with us. So I need to make a video about touring Australia and put you guys in it.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:53.120
What if I put you at the very end so nobody sees you?

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.160
After the panel we went and hung out at John Chandler's house. He lives in the most

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:01.210
amazing tree house in the middle of the woods in Townsville. It was awesome.

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:05.220
So immediately after we left Townsville everybody else went to Orpheus Island but Tara and I went straight up

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.230
to Cairns to JCU's research lab. In Cairns we met two very

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:13.290
special people. The first one was Richard Fitzpatrick. Is this what I

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.320
think it is? That's an Emmy?
- Yep.
- That's an Emmy?
- That's an Emmy.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.350
- Just sitting on your desk.
- Well it's better than it being in a bar.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.370
[laugh]
- So what did you win it for?

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:29.390
- Umm.. Worst Australian accent in a documentary

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:33.410
[laugh]

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.430
- Just some filming I did for National Geographic a few years ago.
- No big deal.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.460
I also met Dr Jamie Seymour who is a world renowned venom expert. So I'm Destin.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.510
- Jamie.
- Jamie so you're on staff here right?
- Yeah I'm a full time

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.560
staff member at JCU. Been here for 25-odd years.
- OK so you're

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.640
what, you're a professor that teaches what?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.650
- A variety of things but mainly venomous animals, so I'm interested in why animals have venom.

00:10:57.670 --> 00:11:01.680
- OK so you don't know it but me and you just became best friends.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.690
- Excellent! That was easy, I haven't even done anything. [laugh]

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.750
- Are you willing to teach me all about venomous animals?
- Absolutely
- Like you wouldn't happen to know the

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:13.810
most venomous jellyfish in the world by chance would you?
- Yeah of course. You want to see one?

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.840
Right there. The most venomous anumal in the world. Not just the most venomous

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:21.860
jellyfish. - These two guys are the core of what we're gonna learn in

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.880
Smarter Every Day in Australia. We spent time on the reef with them, we spent time in the lab

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.930
with them and we learned all kinds of stuff from these two guys. And they're just fun to hang out with.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.950
Anyway, I guess that's about it. One more note from my wife and I think we'll be done

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.990
here. So I hope you enjoyed the Australia trip. I know I did, and my wife did

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:42.030
and you're very thankful to who for sending you?
- To Science Alert and to Audible.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:46.070
- Audible.com/smarter. They're our sponsor and you get a free audio

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:50.110
book. I'll leave a link in the video description. You actually signed us up for Audible didn't you?
- I did.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:54.150
- Like, before they approached us right?
- Yes, pre...

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:58.220
you doing sponsorships for them.
- Also what book do you recommend?

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.240
- I recommend 5 Love Languages by Gary Chapman which has helped me significantly

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:06.300
over the past ten years.
- Come on. Everybody knows we have a perfect marriage, we never fight.
- Never.

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.320
[laugh]
- What you're say is, because you love me so much

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.380
you want people to download this free audiobook at audible.com

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.390
/smarter, and go learn about love languages. What's my love language?

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.440
- Probably physical touch and words of affirmation.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.500
- What's your love language, cause I know it. It's... acts of service.
- And?

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:30.550
- Acts of service. [laughs] What is it?

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:34.590
- And quality time.
- Quality time. So if you want to help me spend more quality time

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:38.620
with my wife, then please consider going to audible.com/smarter and

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.630
downloading your free audiobook, or click the first link in the video description.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.660
Happy wife, happy life right?
- Absolutely. [laugh]

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.710
- I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one.
- Sometimes people

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:54.740
communicate two different ways when they are..

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:58.770
- We just had a video about how great our marriage is..
- We did.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:02.780
- Are you ready to go to mommy? You gonna go to mommy?

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.850
Bye. Bye.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.900
You guys ready to get rid of daddy?
(Kids) No sir.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.920
- Why not?
- Because I love you.
- I love you too.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.970
So I told the Science Alert guy that I would only come to Australia if I could bring my

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:22.990
wife for my ten year anniversary, and this is where

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:27.040
he put us up, at least one night, so he delivered.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:32.060
 

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.070
