ocw.mit.edu.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.940
We, we are solid
state devices.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.710
This is soft matter.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.210
My eyes are photo detectors.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.260
Band gap of about two
electron volts.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.610
They're just not made
of a compound

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.200
semiconductor inorganic.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.530
And this motion is just
conformational

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860
changes in a polymer.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.850
See it's all chemistry.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.496
The rest is stamp collecting.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.680
So the principles that apply to
inanimate objects apply to

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.700
animate objects.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.820
And the solid-state chemistry
umbrella is very broad.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.990
If I say solid-state chemistry,
people are apt to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.120
think of electronic devices,
transistors, what have you.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.400
But that extends to
the life sciences.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.430
I mean we, as human beings,
are chemical machines.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.450
So this is the classical view.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.740
Electronic structuring informs
bonding but then in 3.091

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.170
bonding informs atomic
arrangement, which tells you

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.560
everything.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.380
The shape of all things, it's
all electronic structure.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.220
There's nothing more.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.730
The difference is that the
focus in the chemistry

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.710
department, their focus
is the molecule.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.930
Whereas in 3.091 I like to
think of the focus being

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.950
aggregates of molecules,
namely solids.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.625
Because engineering systems
are made of solids.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.540
If you're steeped in chemistry
from high school, you've had

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.530
the AP curriculum, again 3.091
might be something that is a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.380
fresh look at chemistry from
a slightly different

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.480
perspective.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.700
What I wanted to play for you as
you're leaving today is an

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.810
old Beatles song, Lucy in
the Sky with Diamonds.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.240
Being able to bring in subject
matter, music, art,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.570
literature, into a chemistry
class and make the connections

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.990
to the world around us, I think
is most important in the

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.660
21st century, when problem
solving even in the technical

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.570
domain is going to require
skills that build bridges to

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.050
the humanities, arts and
social sciences.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.060
And so I like to think of
3.091 not as a chemistry

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.800
class, but rather a
chemistry-centered class.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.570
The majority of students taking
3.091 at MIT may never

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.840
take another chemistry class.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.880
So I ask myself what topics are
critical for someone who

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.490
might major in electrical
engineering?

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.330
Or for someone who might
major in physics?

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.325
Or what's the chemistry that's
critical to an MIT student who

00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:18.840
might major in political
science or economics?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.980
And that informs my
choice of topics.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.640
And it turns out that that
doesn't diminish from the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.300
education of the student who
may choose to major in a

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.370
chemically intensive discipline
such as material

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.110
science, chemical engineering,
or even chemistry itself.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.080
I don't view the presentation
of the subject matter as a

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.760
linear track, where this
is the beginning

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.810
and this is the end.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.110
I view it more along the
lines of a spiral.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.640
And so the first time you
encounter a certain concept

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.090
it's at a rather superficial
introductory level.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.540
And then at some point later
in the semester you spiral

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.750
back and see it again.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.240
And then maybe there's a little
more context and a

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.290
little more intensity.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.980
Maybe there's a little
more mathematics

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.040
associated with it.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.540
And then you'll see it
applied later again.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.570
And through that revisiting--

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.770
repetition by design--

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.760
I think that key concepts
get driven home.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.350
Some people are shocked that
I stand in front of a chalk

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.270
board and I write on it and I
believe that that's still a

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.940
valid means of teaching.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.190
For the first-time learner
I think it's important to

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.970
activate all of the
learning channels.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.260
The act of drawing
and inspiring

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.450
them to draw is important.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.130
And maybe the person at home
ought to put themselves in a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.970
chair in the auditorium and be
taking notes as though they

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.150
are attending the lecture.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.445
Watching those videos,
especially for someone that

00:05:05.445 --> 00:05:08.290
has had a fair bit of high
school chemistry, you're going

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.150
to hear a lot of the same things
but maybe coming at you

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.840
at a slightly elevated level.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.870
But not so elevated that
you won't follow it.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.110
And I think that's good for a
high school student to be

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.320
talked to at a higher level.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.850
I think the videos also have
utility for people that are

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.550
interested in specific topics.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.080
I mean for example, if somebody
needs to know

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.650
something about x-rays, or the
use of x-rays, dropping in to

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:46.250
that three-lecture sequence on
x-rays could be quite useful.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:51.430
I think it's possible to
sample with a goal of

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.690
mastering a particular
concept.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:03.250
So clearly for the learner out
in the World Wide Web, going

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.670
to recitation and interacting
with a recitation instructor

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.840
is not practical.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.120
So in lieu of the recitation
section OCW has created these

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.860
help session videos.

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.930
We actually hired some
recitation instructors from

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.100
the fall of 2009 and asked
them to work through some

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.990
sample problems and what you see
in the help session video

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.780
is essentially what would
have happened in

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.980
a recitation section.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.500
I issue the homework questions
with model solutions at the

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.315
beginning of the unit.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:43.710
So the homework becomes
a study aid.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.270
And I recommend to students
that they try the homework

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:54.470
problems without referring to
the answer key initially.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.870
And to turn to the answer key
when they reach an impediment.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:11.080
What's the message of 3.091
for the man on the street?

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.000
An understanding of those
relationships.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.820
Electronic structure
to bonding.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.480
Bonding to atomic arrangement.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.930
Atomic arrangement
to properties.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.150
Is the key to understanding
the world around us.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:30.100
And in particular it's the
key to fueling invention.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:35.390
And I believe in practice very
much and in the application of

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.730
science in service
for humanity.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:43.230
Why do we worry about designing
a car that's a

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.200
zero-emission vehicle, as
if to do no harm to the

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.110
environment?

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.310
Why don't we go even further and
say, what about a car that

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.540
purifies the air as it
drives down the road?

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.740
So that the air in the wake of
the car is cleaner than the

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.060
air in front of the car?

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.290
And I'm finding that
increasingly that's a message

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.630
that resonates with
the students.

00:08:03.630 --> 00:08:09.340
They want to take the tools
of technical analytically

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.070
centered education and
put them to work to

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.350
solve societal problems.
