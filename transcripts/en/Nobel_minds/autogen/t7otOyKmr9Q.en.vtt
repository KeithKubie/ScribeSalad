the world is quantum mechanical and it
 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.230
the world is quantum mechanical and it
is perfectly consistent which is that is

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240
is perfectly consistent which is that is
 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.080
is perfectly consistent which is that is
the framework we use to describe nature

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090
the framework we use to describe nature
 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.280
the framework we use to describe nature
now to have a description in which

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290
now to have a description in which
 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.920
now to have a description in which
objects that are far apart and do not

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930
objects that are far apart and do not
 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.670
objects that are far apart and do not
communicate with one another are still

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680
communicate with one another are still
 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.070
communicate with one another are still
correlated there's nothing inconsistent

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080
correlated there's nothing inconsistent
 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.410
correlated there's nothing inconsistent
about that which is why it works so well

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420
about that which is why it works so well
 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.580
about that which is why it works so well
it's just hard to get used to
