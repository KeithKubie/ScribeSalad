&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.080
&gt;&gt; Edward Widmer: Hi
everyone, welcome.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.080
I have the same document printed
out twice in different point sizes

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.620
because -- my -- ever since
I started wearing glasses,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.560
my eyesight has just gotten so bad.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.800
Before I forget, I want to say,
especially on a beautiful day

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:44.250
like this, why not go to a dark
establishment, whoever wants to go,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.990
let's have one of our readings
tune in the Kluge Annex just

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.820
down Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.950
It's a great pleasure to
introduce our friend to all of us,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.470
Shaden Tageldin, who is Associate
Professor of Cultural Studies

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.980
and Comparative Literature in the
Department of Cultural Studies

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.560
and Comparative Literature at
the University of Minnesota,

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.660
where she is also the director of
the African Studies Initiative,

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.220
a title VI African Studies
National Resource Center,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.050
funded by the U.S.
Department of Education.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.410
From 2013 to 2015, she was
director of graduate studies

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.290
in that department as well

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.900
as for the Interdepartmental
Graduate in Moving Image Studies.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:39.130 position:56%
She is the recipient of the 2014 to
2014 Motley Exemplary Teaching Award

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.960
from the College of Liberal Arts.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.240
In her teachings, she focuses on
19th and 20th century literature

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.130
in English, Arabic and French.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.760
Her research engages several
fields within a transnational

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.270
and a translingual compass
empire and postcolonial studies,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.650
critical translation
theory, trans-African

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.860
and trans-Asian studies, the
historiography of literary

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.240
and cultural renaissance, the
politics of idealogy of language,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.770
literary form and literary
genre, and literatures

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.230
of migration and diaspora.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.910
She earned a PhD in comparative
literature from UC Berkley in 2004.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.660
Her first book, "Disarming
Words: Empire and the Seductions

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.850
of Translation in Egypt" came out
with University of California Press

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.760
in 2011 and received
honorable mention

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.550
for the 2013 Harry Levine prize

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.790
of the American Comparative
Literature of Association.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.260
He was an old professor
of mine in Harvard

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.160
and her doctoral dissertation
won the ACLA's 2005 Charles

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.840
Bernheimer prize.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.170
She's currently here as a Frederick
Berthark [phonetically spelled]

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.500
residential fellow and
she is writing a new book,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.590
provisionally titled, "Toward
a Transcontinental Theory

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.470
of Modern Comparative
Literature," and that is the title

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.060
of today's talk, so
please welcome Shaden.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.360
Thank you.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.410
&gt;&gt; Shadon Tageldin:
Thank you very much,

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.710
Ted for that kind introduction.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.050
Good afternoon, everyone and
thank you very much for coming

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.740
on this lovely Tuesday afternoon.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.460
It is a great honor
and pleasure to speak

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.910
at the Library of Congress today.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.520 position:56%
I've been fortunate indeed to spend
this academic year in residency here

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.990
at the library's Kluge
Center as an American Council

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.040
of Learned Society's
Burkhardt Fellow.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.600
Few research centers offer an
environment as warm, collegial,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.900
productive, and, yes, provocative
for thinking with others

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.420
in different disciplines,
changes the questions you ask,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.450
the sources you explore
and the answers you find.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.570
I would like to thank Ted Widmer,

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.050
Mary Louriker [phonetically
spelled], Travis Hensley,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.810
Dan Torrelo, Anastasia
Jones, Kaley Mosley Jackson,

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.710
former Kluge staff members, Joanne
Kitchins [phonetically spelled],

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.870
and Denise Robinson, yes, I had
to name everyone as well as each

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.960
and everyone of the Kluge
fellows I have met and engaged

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.560 position:56%
over the past nine months for
making my time here such a pleasure.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.650
Finally, I warmly thank Dr. Fossey
[phonetically spelled] Tethorus

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.060
[phonetically spelled] and
his colleagues in the African

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.930
and Middle Eastern reading,
as well as Eric Frasier

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.640 position:56%
and [inaudible] Ashmen [phonetically
spelled] and Rare Books

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.920
and Special Collections
for their assistance

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.690
in locating research
material, which is ongoing.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.350
I also thank Cheryl Adams
in the main reading room,

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.750
Erica Spencer in the
European Reading Room

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.200 position:56%
and Dr. Tomoka Finne [phonetically
spelled] in the Science Reading Room

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.680
for their assistance at various
points in my research thus far.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.530
The title of my lecture
today, once again,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.860 position:56%
is "Toward a Transcontinental Theory
of Modern Comparative Literature."

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.860
Taking the case of
Arabic English and French

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.970
from the late 18th century
through the early 20th,

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.480
my lecture is today is
part of a book in progress

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.760
that traces the rise of
modern comparative literature

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.670
to a new global regime in
which a language acquired power

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.310
in the world empire in so far
as it held the power to observe

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.410
and to capture the world
exactly in empiricism.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.000
In the shadow of imperialism and in
empiricism, languages like Arabic

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.290
that once had styled themselves
incomparable, larger than life,

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.000 position:56%
now were urged to point
unambiguously to all that they name,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.280
to simulate life, the really
seen and really heard.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.700
This term from artificial
to natural literary language

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.360 position:56%
as newly bound-ward to world, making
incomparable languages comparable,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.260
comparable that is in
their newly shared sense

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.580
that words should be life-like.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.740
In this determination of
life, language was conceived

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.390
in increasingly smaller, we
might say, molecular units.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.420
For the British orientalist,
Sir Williams Jones,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.450
literatures could be made
comparable only by breaking down

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.140
and translating their
literatures or their languages

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.700 position:56%
into lowest common denominators,
plain spoken words, shun of ornament

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.040
or particularizing styles and
sounds softened of all foreignness.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.070
Indeed the word denominator
was not low or common enough,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.280
comparison with demand at
times and even freer radical.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.810
For French orientalist,
like [inaudible]

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.040
and Ernesto Renov [phonetically
spelled],

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.120
the life of a language has its
majority, has its comparability,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.180
hedged on whether or not its
vowels were written seen.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.920
For Egyptian and Syro-Lebanese
intellectuals like Abdul Nadeem

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.870
and Amin Shamil [phonetically
spelled] on whether

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.030
or not its cosmonauts translated
were heard across time and space.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.210
The epistemic conditions
of possibility

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.060
that ground modern comparative
literature then demanded

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.050
that the world's diverse language
be comparable to the letter.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.040
Not only must the graphing,
written signs and phoning sounds

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.020
of those languages be
mutually intelligible,

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.490
but so too the very relation,
the very understanding

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.520
of what the proper
connection between a graphing,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.070
a written to a phoning
sound should be.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.850
Even today, comparative literature
ascribes its disciplinary origins

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.300
to Europe and the United States,
often eliding develops elsewhere

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.600
at the theoretical level.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.360
I ask by revisiting this share,
yet occluded history of language

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.360
and life, can we develop
a transcontinental theory

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.040
of modern comparative literature?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.540
Before his conscription into
the ranks of imperial government

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.040
in Bengal and into imperial
views of the relationships

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:48.830
between the world's
languages and literature,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:52.300
the young British orientalist,
William Jones,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.670
not yet Sir William Jones,

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:59.450
understood that literary comparison
called on its practitioner to see

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.630
with other eyes and to
hear with other ears.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.290
That is not to assume that the
real or the knowable world ended

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.430 position:56%
with the seen and the heard, not to
misapprehend the unknown, unfamiliar

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:16.140
or invisible world as unreal, or
worse as inferior to one's own.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:22.040
Jones opens his [foreign language]
dissertation on oriental literature

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.140
and the title page is up
here, written in French

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:30.030
and published anonymously
in London in 1717

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.320
with a counter-factual
parable, a cautionary what

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:39.590 position:56%
if that marvelously inverts European
imperial perception and I quote,

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.980
"A king of [inaudible]," a present
day [inaudible] "could not imagine

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.770
that there could in the world
another kingdom than his own.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.050
He had in truth heard
word of a race of animals

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.660
that inhibited the oxidants,
but he had never seen them.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:58.360
For it meant nothing that
Louis XIV had sent missionaries

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.210 position:56%
with the singular proposition that
he abolish the cult of his ancestors

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.380
and believe mysteries
despite himself.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:09.160 position:56%
His courtier told him that that race
was nothing but a race of monkeys.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.740
His priest added that it was
not capable of the metamorphosis

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.970
of the great Funchiham
[phonetically spelled]

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.340
and his philosophers
assured him that,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.550
according to very ancient
traditions, each inhabitant

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.100
of this barbaric country
had only one eye

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.690
in the center of the forehead.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:30.240
The king having, as he must,
lent faith to these discourses.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.940
It since had become a
fundamental dogma of the siamese

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.280
that occidentals only had one eye.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.830
We are, with respect to the
orientals, in nearly the situation

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:44.810
that the inhabitants of Siam
are with respect to ours.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.650
If the little that we know of their
visage prevents us from saying

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:52.670
that they have only one eye, we do
worse for we deny taste and soul."

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:58.650
To read literature comparatively,
Jones suggest, across languages

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.420
and cultures, one needs
the consciousness,

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.330
if you will pardon the
pun, a siamese twin.

00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:07.240
The ability to apprehend
one's prejudices, today,

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.320
we might say racism and the limits
of one's knowledge by watching

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.100
or listening to oneself being
watched or overheard by another,

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.930
in this case by seeing the west
represented and hearing play back

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.280
through the eyes, ears
and voice a fictional

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.720
or fictional lies, King of Siam.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.180
Comparativeness is the
critical recognition

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.920
that what you cannot see, cannot
hear and do not know, nonetheless,

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.680
exist apart from you and is
worth knowing on its own terms

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.610 position:56%
and with awareness also of the self.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.150
Notice that I do not
say what you do not see

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:48.830
and do not know and do not hear.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.980
Jones tells us that it does
matter to the king of Siam

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:56.060 position:56%
that he actually has seen
occidentals, the Jesuit missionaries

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:58.900
who have visited his
kingdom if one by seeing,

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.060
one means sense perception.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.320
He has seen these beings
but cannot see them

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.180
or the foreign peoples
they represent

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.390
for the human beings they
are for his mind's eye,

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.350
sight beyond sense perception,
conceives these foreigners

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.360
as nonhuman animals, as
monkeys, and thus so on the basis

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:21.040
of the discourse to which it is
routinely exposed, what courtiers,

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.540
priests and philosophers say.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:28.170 position:56%
Saying trumps seeing,
rationalism, what the mind conceives

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.310
on its own, trumps empiricism.

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:34.860
I speak of this remarkable
passage as the opening

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.680
of Jones' [foreign
language] yet even before

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.620
that opening the book's epigraph
invents the 18th century western

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.810
reader to relocate the very
impulses of exploration

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.410
and comparative knowledge from
Europe to other continents.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:56.700
It is a pronouncement in
Arabic, as you will see

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.360
on the slide, [foreign language].

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.870
Jones translates, "Seek
knowledge be it in China."

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:05.290
Later, Jones identifies
the prophet, Muhammad,

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.650 position:56%
as the author of that pronouncement,
arguing that it proves "that letters

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.990
and fine arts are held on the
greatest esteem by the orientals."

00:12:12.990 --> 00:12:16.290
The statement is a well-known
hatidith [phonetically spelled]

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:21.130
or the saying of the prophet whose
earliest followers in the 6th

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.280
to early 7th century Arabia,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:27.580
China would have marked the
limit of the known world.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.070
If one orient, Siam, sets the
stage for counterfactual parable

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.840
that unmasks the dangers
of Eurocentrism

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.870
and of all intellectual
absolutism, another orient, Islam,

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:43.240
moderns for Jones anecdote
to absolutist thinking,

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.900
the quest for knowledge
beyond one's sight and hearing

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:53.200
and thus the project and the
profit of comparison itself.

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.600
Even though Muhammad here only
speaks of China metaphorically,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.830
writes Jones later in text,
we might hear it literally

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.360
for we are persuaded that
Chinese literature is

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.210
as useful as it is interesting.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:11.400
Still, in invoking the
orient as a possible model

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.290
for comparative knowledge, Jones
consigns Arabic Islamic comparative

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:18.750
to metaphor, to figurative
language, to saying.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.980
Seeing is the province of the
European, who is able to conceive

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.580
of China literally to the letter.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.990
The orient may model an idea but
the occident is poised to put

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.920
that idea to empirical test.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.520 position:56%
I quote from Jones, "Those who do
not know the languages of orientals,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.630
make incompetent judges of their
poetry but here is an experiment,"

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.920
and his term is [foreign language]
"that would obviate that error,

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.400
which one advises you to try,
that one would two odes,"

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:54.610
and here he shifts to another
orient, "one Arabic or Persian,

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.690 position:56%
the other Greek or Latin,
translate these almost word for word

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:01.670
in a language of common
use with no ornament

00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:06.080
or disguise grant what is due
to the diversity of idioms,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.850
places and customs
of both sides equally

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:13.710
and that then one would
pronounce without prejudice

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.150
between the productions
of orientals and the works

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.930
that we admire everyday."

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:24.180
Presaging contemporary U.S.
comparativists like Gayatri Spivaka

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:25.500
and Emily After [phonetically
spelled]

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:28.840
who see language acquisition as
key to a comparative literature

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.940
that shuns the world dominance of
English, Jones argues that those

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:37.430
who do not know oriental languages
cannot judge their literatures.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.250
Yet he proposes a work around
that permits such judgment,

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:45.080
one that depends, in fact, on
translation into a third language,

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.400
a language of common, [foreign
language], known both to writer

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.550
and reader and moreover to the
plainest form of that language,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.650
a linguist and stylistic
lowest common denominator.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.990
To make two literatures comparable,
Jones tells us, the scholar must,

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:04.390
in affect, sheer away all
ornaments, all markers of style,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:08.160
which he associates not only with
excess but also with disguise

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.510
and translate both
literatures nearly word for word

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.480
into the plainest prose one can.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.110
Then one can judge, he
says, then one can compare.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:22.990
This experiment reconverts
comparison into an act

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.270 position:56%
of empirical observation and
Baconian induction or generalization

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.660
from observed particulars even
if they are reduced particulars.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:34.100
For if poems from two
different languages

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.680
and literary traditions can be
translated into a third language

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.230
of common use, their
features, supposedly,

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:46.280
will be more easily discernible
to the naked European eye and ear.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.630
Jones proceeds to illustrate
his method.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.390
To bring an alien orient into
comparison with a familiar west,

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.820
he translates two odes,
one from Persian by Hafez,

00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:00.000
the other from Latin by Horace
and [inaudible] opposes these.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.520
Having done so, he
conceives that the reader

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:04.900
who does not know the
original expressions

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.930
and the literary traditions
of these poems will fail

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:10.710
to grasp the felicity
of their expressions

00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:13.520 position:56%
and the elegance of their illusions.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:17.790
Yet he insists that any such reader
can look at Hafez and Horace,

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:21.220
reduced to plain to French,
and decide ultimately

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:25.320
which of the two odes is the more
poetic, a quality he premises on,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.970
what he calls, charming simplicity.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.610
While he says that it is not up to
him to decide, he drops heavy hints

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:36.300
in favor of the Persian,
but when the comparativist

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:40.040
or translator breaks language
down into, what we might call,

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:44.520
molecular units, hear
words, where does style go.

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:49.140
Jones wants the European reader to
hear the music of oriental poetry,

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.190
yet translation pressed into
the service of comparison,

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.030
what it would seem, reduce
the unique musical phrasing

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:58.980
of the Persian and the Latin
respectively to mere strings

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.790
of common simplified,

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.870
de-contextualized notes
more readily exchangeable.

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:07.930
To demonstrate the aesthetic
value of oriental literatures

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.890
to the European reader, Jones
ultimately must prove the soundness

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.140
in all senses of their
languages, that is the sounds

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:18.340
of those languages are
melodious enough to merit

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.790
and justify the name poetry.

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.860 position:56%
Translating the sense of the Persian

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:28.390
into common French words is
not adequate to that task.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:32.400 position:56%
Thus Jones goes onto
transliterate into Roman characters,

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.440
the Persian ode by Hafez that he
has just translated and placed

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.600
in comparison with the
Latin ode by Horace.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:44.430 position:56%
What is striking here is the apology
that follows this transliteration

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.560
and I quote from Jones, "Although
one should only judge the sweetness

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:51.240
of the language by the ear,
we fear that the majority

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:55.810
of readers were appreciated by the
eye and that they will be put off

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.050
by the frequency of consonants and
of hard letters [foreign language]

00:17:59.050 --> 00:18:04.560 position:56%
that they will there, but the organ,
i.e., the tongue articulates the

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.310
"huz" as easily as it
does any other consonant.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:14.140 position:56%
It is the Tuscan pronunciation of
'ch and of 'c' in the word, 'cavalo,

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.660
which has something
very gentle about it

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:19.360
when it is not too affected."

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:25.200
Thus the Persian "kh," it's
transliterated as "kh,"

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.980
which appears once
in the word, "khulk,"

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:32.320
which in Arabic means temperament,
in the transliterated ode,

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:39.280
is assimilated to the Tuscan "ch"
or hard "c" like the "c" in cavolo,

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:46.590
where it's not a "ch," but it's an
attempt to render the sound "ch."

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.070
From common sense and
sensibility, we enter the province

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.420
of common sound, the
comparison of letters.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.700
Literature, is rooted
here in the letter,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.130
a common denominator more radical
than the word, a written character

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:04.150
or grapheme, who shared spoken
or forcibly shared spoken

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.290
or phoneme the European
reader is invited to hear.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:12.320
With his turn to the speech of
Tuscany, the dialect of Dante,

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.390
to bring the literatures of the
Arabic- Islamic orient to life

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.850
for the European reader, Jones
inaugurates, perhaps in spite

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.630
of himself, a new tendency
in the discourse

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.970
of European literary comparison.

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.310
That tendency would
replace orient with occident

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:28.610
as its fundamental model.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:44.480
In comparative literature 1886, the
first English language monograph

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.360
to explicitly articulate
the nature and the method

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:51.250
of the modern discipline, the
Irish barrister and classist,

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.780
Hutchinson McCauley Pasnet
[phonetically spelled] traced the

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.690
root of comparative literary method
to Dante's De vulgari Eloquentia

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:03.800
on "Eloquence in the Vernacular,"
written between 1302 and 1305,

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.880
which argued that the time had come
for the spoken dialect of Tuscany

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:09.880
to [inaudible] with,
if not suppliant,

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.400
Latin as a language of writing.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.030
And here I show you the particular
edition that happens to be

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:17.850
in the Rare Books Collection
of the Library of Congress.

00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:21.860
There are many such editions, of
course, in libraries elsewhere

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:28.260
but this one was owned by Walt
Whitman and there is a little card

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:32.790
from I think the old card
catalog, or replica thereof,

00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:38.110
which shows that Walt Whitman
listed the half title pages,

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:42.410
listed all of the pages where his
name appeared in Pasnet's study

00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:49.390
of comparative literature, so our
typical egocentrism is at work.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:56.650 position:56%
You will see that volume was part of
an international scientific series,

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:59.930 position:56%
which is interesting in terms of the
placement of comparative literature

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:06.310 position:56%
in the modern 19th century sciences.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:12.800
So I quote now from Pasnet from the
relevant passage, where he speaks

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.770
of Dante's De Vulgari Eloquentia."

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:20.970 position:56%
"When Dante wrote the "Eloquial
Vulgari, this is Pasnet's reference,

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.660
it's usually called either,
"De Vulgari Eloquial,"

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:27.220
or "De Vulgari Eloquentia," he
marked the starting the point

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.480
of our modern comparative
science, the nature of language,

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:34.570
a problem not be lightly overlooked
by the peoples of modern Europe,

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:38.960
inheriting unlike Greek or
Hebrew, a literature written

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:43.580 position:56%
in a tongue whose decomposition had
plainly gone to make up the elements

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.280
of their own living speech.

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.330
The Latin, followed at an
interval by the Greek renaissance,

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.940
laid the foundations of
comparative reflection

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.590
in the mind of modern Europe."

00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:00.290 position:56%
Pasnet rightly identifies the nature
of language a key starting point

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:04.330
of modern comparative literature,
yet not just any language;

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.550
for Pasnet invokes as a key
force that throws language

00:22:07.550 --> 00:22:12.100
and literature open to comparative
reflection as he calls it "The rise

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:16.610
of modern Italian or French,"
once spoken variance of Latin,

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:19.800
the written lingual Franca of
western Europe as languages

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.130
of writing in their own right.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:25.280
Thus a particular register
of language, the vernacular,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.920
grounds the literature
that comes to be defined

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.240
as the proper object
of modern comparison.

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:34.390
To enter the zone of the modern
comparison, as Pasnet defines it,

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:39.200
it seems, a literature must be
living speech, realized in writing.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:43.190
In the language of a comparable
literature, death can only survive

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:45.790
if it is an intrinsic part of life.

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:50.330 position:56%
Death must be transmuted into dying,
decomposition and it must also,

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:55.420 position:56%
in being so transmuted, reconstitute
the living in perpetuity.

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.120
Forms of language that precede

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.770
and exceed living speech
suddenly seem a waste of breath.

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:04.350
It is not that language is
inassimilable to living speech,

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.490
don't breath; they do even
their respirations are

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:09.520
sometimes unvocalized.

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.700
In this regime of the
modern of comparison

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:13.720
of literature, they can't breath.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.740
They're not allowed to breath.

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.880
I turn the page now
one century earlier

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.630
to Vulni's [phonetically spelled]

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.970
"Simplicacion de [inaudible]
oriental," "Simplification

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:30.750
of oriental languages," published
in Paris in 1795, a text that,

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.360
as I have also learned in
the Rare Books collection

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.660
of the library Thomas Jefferson
once owned and Jefferson, in fact,

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:42.150 position:56%
owned many works by the [inaudible]
Vulni who voyaged, in fact, to Egypt

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:46.690
and Sierra in the 1780s
and writes another text

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:50.440
on that series of travel.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.310
In addition to the
rise of the vernacular,

00:23:53.310 --> 00:23:56.820
Pasnet noted the European
discovery of the new world

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.170
as a decisive element
in the emergence

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:03.310
of modern comparative sensibility;
yet in Vulni's estimation,

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:07.130
Europe did not need to voyage
so far away to discover the sort

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.270
of radical difference that
awakens the impulse of comparison.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:12.570
It's familiar.

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:15.330
The Arabic-Islamic
world was, in many ways,

00:24:15.330 --> 00:24:17.580
its most radically foreign.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:22.650 position:56%
A dividing line of contrast has
stubbornly persevered, Vulni writes,

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:25.320
"For many centuries
between the Asiatics,

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.770
above all the Arabs
and European peoples.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:32.990 position:56%
We are separated by only 60 nautical
hours from Algeria and from Tunis,

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:36.510
just 14 days take us to
Egypt, to Syria, to Greece,

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:39.460
18 to Constantinople
and yet one would say

00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:45.170
that these peoples inhabit another
planet that, though contemporaries,

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:48.140
we live separated by
several centuries.

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:49.440
The crude observer,

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.990
Luvir [phonetically spelled] Kharf
[phonetically spelled] is content

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.190
to see as the reason for these
contrasts, the difference

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.510
between religions, [inaudible]
customs, but this difference,

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:01.940 position:56%
itself, has its causes and one finds
that the most powerful, indeed,

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.840
perhaps the only such cause,

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.350
consists of the difference
of languages."

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.220
End of quote.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:12.300 position:56%
While various points in the
Ottoman empire are within short sail

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:16.910
from Europe and all seem on the
surface temporarily proximate,

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.560
[foreign language], contemporaries,
they are to borrow the phrase

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.720
of Johanna Fabian in
"Time and the Other,"

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.490
denied co-evilness with Europe.

00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:28.550
They're not allowed to occupy the
same time, the same chronology.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.700
The most spatially proximate is
the most historically distant,

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:35.580
separated by centuries and the
historical gulf between is measured

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:39.430
and fathomed in through and as
language in the nautical mile

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.850
of a vernacular vision of language.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.310
And I quote again from Vulni, "I
account for little the contrast

00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:49.450
and the movement of Arabic script,
which while we trace our lines

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:52.960 position:56%
from left to right, traces its own
from right to left and begins a book

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.200
where we finish it, but a third
difficulty, the most serious,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:01.760
the most radical, is its
alphabetic system, itself.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.840
It is the incomplete,
indeed, perverted,"

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.420
the word used here is
[foreign language],

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:12.700
which has a strong moral
cast, "indeed perverted manner

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.620
in which Arabic depicts
the spoken word,"

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:20.550
and the phrase is [foreign
language].

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:24.140
In our languages of Europe, every
element of that word, vowel,

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:28.180
consonant, aspiration, all is
painted or depicted with detail,

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.940
precision, scruple and clear
images pass through to the minds.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.820
We even regard a language as
all the more perfect in so far

00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:40.070
as its script more exactly paints
or depicts all of its pronunciation

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:45.800
as that language is
written as it is pronounced.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.710
By contrast, Arabic and its
analogue, [inaudible], Persian,

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.860
Turkish, not only does one
not write as one speaks

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:55.380
but one writes really half
of one's words in the main,

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.620
only consonants are outlined,
which are its principle base

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:03.230 position:56%
and the four long vowels depicted in
the alphabet, the three short vowels

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.690
that played a greatest
role in pronunciation

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:09.850
and that are an integral thereof
are suppressed and implied.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:14.340
One must supply these from
imagination and do so impromptu."

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.360
End of quote.

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.630
What makes Arabic and its
users so radically different

00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:22.000
from the languages of Europe
and their users, Vulni suggests,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.820
is incomplete and even perverted
binding of letter of written sign,

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.770
grapheme, to sound phoning to
image and ultimately also to sense.

00:27:31.770 --> 00:27:35.710 position:56%
Arabic writing, so goes the
charge, does not depict spoken words

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:38.140
or does not paint them with
sufficient faithfulness

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.920
to the sounds they
ostensibly must recall

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.680
or to the images they
ostensibly must conjure forth.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.550
In such a system, enunciation
is not simply a question

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:51.930
of [foreign language],
taking the floor, you know,

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:57.990
launching the spoken word,
it is rather a question

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:02.080
of [foreign language], painting
or depicting the spoken word.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:06.210
And to the extent that the writer
of Arabic writes only half words,

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:10.990
he or she eats them, no longer able
in Vulni's judgment to communicate

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.780
and thereby to enter the sphere
of positive comparability.

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.940
Failing to mark in most
cases the short vowels

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:21.260
that would make its rendering in
script fully identical to sound,

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.700
fully representative and
transparent, calling on its reader

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:28.720
to supply sound from silence, to
fill in the blanks, swirling above

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:32.790
and below the lines of text from
the realtime reservoir of his

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:36.170
or her imagination to
bring voice to mute speech,

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.920
Arabic enters this French regime
of comparison as defective

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.980
and defects from this world.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.640
Vulni's argument inflicts Ernest
Raunak [phonetically spelled]

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.670
reading of written versus
dialectal or spoken Arabic

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:53.860
in his [inaudible] historic general
system compare [foreign language],

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.540
general history of
and comparative system

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.300
of Semitic languages
first published in 1855.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:02.470
Here, as in Vulni, the absence
of presence of the vowel

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.500
in Arabic letters marks
an opposition of the death

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:08.220
of Semitic languages
to the contrasting life

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.470 position:56%
of their endo-European counterparts.

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:17.750
I quote from Raunak, "The
habit of not writing vowels,

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:22.760 position:56%
thereby effacing the subtle nuances,
in which adheres all individuality

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:27.520
of the dialect, reduces Semitic
text to a sort of skeleton,

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.960
excellent for the anatomical study
of language but hardly proper

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.450
to the study of movement
and of life.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:37.170
In a language that is not life

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:40.830
for [inaudible] is not
historical and not comparable.

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:45.120 position:56%
Languages must be compared," he
writes, "to living beings of nature.

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.920
Their life, like that of man and
humanity, is a perpetual becoming."

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:54.170
What emerges as an opposition
of endo-European languages,

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:58.370
which occupy a distinctly Hegelian
state of perpetual becoming

00:29:58.370 --> 00:30:00.420
and are thus living
because historically,

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.820
historically because
living to Semitic languages.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.810
These languages, Arabic
in particular are dead,

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:10.420 position:56%
because in [inaudible] invocation of
terms that the German philosopher,

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.840 position:56%
Hegel, infamous reserved for Africa,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.490
they "no longer have a
history," [foreign language].

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:24.060
Dubbing Arabic, the last
survivor and "soul representative

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:29.400
of Semitism," an interesting
statement in itself, Raunak sees it

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.710 position:56%
as absolutely unique the
incomparable distillation, summation

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.960
and perfection of a family of
languages whose lives have ended,

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.920
"written without the slightest
nuance of dialect," Arabic

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.970
and other Semitic languages
are fixed in what he calls,

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:50.040
"a metallic rigidity that blocks
all developed interior life.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.550
Compared with Endo-European
languages, so essentially vegetal

00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:56.110 position:56%
and living," Raunak, writes, "Arabic

00:30:56.110 --> 00:31:01.060
and its kin are inorganic
and mineral.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.220
Everywhere," he writes, "an
ancient language gives way

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:09.410
to a vernacular [foreign language],
modern dialect corresponding

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:12.280
to a progression of analysis,
clearer more explicit,

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.970
separately that which the ancient
assembled, breaking the mechanisms

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:18.660
of the former language
to grant to each idea

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:22.640
and to each relation its
isolated expression."

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:25.940
"Formal Arabic," Raunak
suggests, " is an exception.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.290
It has not evolved toward the
modern dialect, the vernacular.

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:32.260
Arabic is in a word 'o compose.'

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.910
Failing to decompose, as vegetal
life does, into isolated fragments,

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:40.720
Arabic and its Semitic cousins
supposedly have not followed the

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.450
natural way of language toward
simplification but held fast

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:48.510
for a problematic complexity,
read artificiality."

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.760
And I quote again from Raunak,

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:53.120
"This ancient of decomposition
is entirely missing

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.420
from Semitic languages.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:56.680
No a single letter has been lost.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.300
Guarded by closed and
precise mouths,

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.950
they have very rarely
fallen in jargon.

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:05.780
The three fundamental articulations
of each root have remained a sort

00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:10.000
of bone structure that has
preserved them from all softening.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.700
The Semitic script system
for its part has contributed

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.370
in no small part to this
phenomenon of persistence.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.150
One cannot say that
Semites write in a manner

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.520
as perfect as the Endo-Europeans.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.960
They represent only
the skeleton of words.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.690
They render the idea
rather than the sound.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.650
Latin and Italian, written
after the Semitic manner,

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.760
would hardly differ one from
the other but one cannot deny

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:37.060
that this writing, so
inconvenient to the foreigner,

00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:40.370
has not been excellent for
the conservation of roots.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:44.270
It has maintained the root as a
sort of perfectly pure diamond

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:48.150
across all grammatical accidents."

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:50.810
Both the letter and
usually trilateral root

00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:53.450
of formal Semitic languages
jealously guarded

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:57.040
by the essentially closed
mouths of its speakers

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.540
and by extension equally mute pens

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:04.090
of its writers not only do not
change but also do not sound.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:08.550
As bone structure skeleton,
perfectly pure diamond,

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.380
Arabic and related
languages are mineral

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:14.760 position:56%
in Raunak's most charitable
reading, precious mineral, yet dead,

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.390
nonetheless, in their
immunity to alteration.

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:20.480
Rather than going the
way of Latin to Italian

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.240
and undergoing the decomposition
associated with living speech

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.830
as Pasnet too later would
suggest the language

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:30.810
of comparable literature
must, they have fossilized.

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:34.060
For Vulni and Raunak, Arabic is
[inaudible] wants limitless test

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.520
and the limit of comparison
for the sciences

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.150
of the European long 19th century.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.990
Arabic letter, in every sense
of that term, spell the fate

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.220
of what enters the
sphere of comparison

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.850
and what lies beyond its pail.

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.000
This too is true for
the modern discipline

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.770
of comparative literature.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.680
I return to Pasnet.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:55.680
In so far as Pasnet's roots,
modern comparative literary method,

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.620
as we have seen, in the rise
of the vernaculars in Europe,

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.760
and insist in turn that that
method must be historical,

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.380
the degree to which a
written language coincides

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:08.990
with its spoken form signals its
historicity and comparability.

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:12.470
Small wonder then that he invokes
the Arabic-Islamic literary

00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:16.810
tradition as the avatar of
incomparability and I quote,

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:20.120
"If we are determined to lay down
the dogma that Shakespeare or Dante

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.830
or any other poet wrote above
space and time, above the social

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.170
and physical conditions
under which he lived,

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:30.410
we really exclude historical
propriety by a creed

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:33.690
of literary inspiration, which
has been frequently asserted,

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:37.500
if not believed in, with
theological insurance.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:41.250
We imitate the criticism of the
Arabs and make a literary croon

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.090
out of our Shakespeare or Dante."

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:49.480
The literary croon is Pasnet's
metaphor for the transformation

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.620
of Shakespeare and Dante by the
western critics who canonized them

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:55.890
into incomparable divinities
whose ambit is universal

00:34:55.890 --> 00:34:57.190
and timeless rather

00:34:57.190 --> 00:35:00.210
than historically grounded
in place and time.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:04.560
"Those critic methods," he argues,
and I quote, "it's almost as fatal

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.780
to true historical science as the
Muslim belief that the language

00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:12.530
and ideas of their Bible came
direct from God, himself."

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:17.170
The entanglement of the doctrine
of the inevitability of the Quran

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:19.910
with the incomparability
of its language, Arabic,

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:23.440
is now a kind of shorthand
for a theological impulse

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.500
that must be banished epistemic
sites of comparative literature,

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.700
which must be true to
historical science.

00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.410
Paradoxically, Shakespeare
and Dante are often divinities

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:37.480
of this new historical
scientific literary order.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.920
Marshalls tightened the umbilical
cord between the vernacular

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.800
and the rise of modern properly
comparable European literature.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.370
It is thus in the negative as
that which is deemed incomparable,

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:52.600
uniquely defective in its
other worldly perfection

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.910
by most western scholars
and increasingly

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:59.290
over the imperial course of the
long 19th century in complex ways

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.220
by Arabic speaking intellectuals

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.540
that Arabic enters a
transcontinental theory

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:05.640
of modern comparative literature.

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.400
Together, they would ask, what kind
of language forms a properly modern

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.290
and worldly Arabic literature?

00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:18.190
Writing in 1893, in the
Kirov [phonetically spelled]

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:21.400
of [inaudible], Sir William
Wilcox called on Egyptians

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.880
to shed formal written Arabic
[foreign language] a reportedly

00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:28.090
artificial dead language,
he calls it such,

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:31.640
and to write in the vernacular
colloquial Amia instead.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:36.230
Lack of natural, embedded, living
literary language, he [inaudible],

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:41.170
stymies the originality that
drives scientific invention,

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:42.470
hence [inaudible].

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:47.830
An Anglo-Indian engineer,
Wilcox arrived in Egypt in 1883,

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.140
one year after the
British occupation.

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.530
He redesigned Egypt's irrigation
system and as director general

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:56.450
of reservoirs, designed and
supervised the construction

00:36:56.450 --> 00:37:01.180
of the first Le Swan dam
between 1896 and 1902.

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.850
Wilcox maintained that just

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.810 position:56%
as British engineering had freed the
Egyptian peasant from force labor,

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:08.520
so too would British promotion

00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.460
of Egyptian Arabic unshackle
the Egyptian intellectual

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:13.400
from coercive artifices.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.760
Indeed, his first paper
on the language, itself,

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.140
delivered in formal Arabic.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:25.810
It was delivered before a Egyptian
club and this is a printed text,

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.030
transcript, of the talk,

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:31.860
"Argued that modern Egyptians had
lost the scientific creativity they

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:35.560
had possessed in ancient
time because 'the authors

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:39.180
of their scientific secular books
write language hard as rock,

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:44.040
literally like mountain," and "set
down thoughts and books to die,

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.480
never to return to life as if
they are attuning them in page

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.830
and burying them between
the covers of books."

00:37:50.830 --> 00:37:56.450
Contrast English with the rise of
vernacular English, Wilcox argues,

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.850
came not only the works of
the celebrated English poet,

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:03.720
Shakespeare, but also those of
Sir Francis Bacon, who he writes,

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.860
"pend the lessons to which the
European sciences owe their

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.770
first appearance.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:13.440
In June 1893, in the same journal
[inaudible], Wilcox would attempt

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.850
to bring his point to life,
publishing his translations

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:21.550
of passages, short passages, from
Shakespeare Henry IV and Anthony

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:24.550
and Cleopatra into
colloquial Egyptian Arabic.

00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:27.640
What follows these translations
is an Arabic language discussion

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.930
of hydraulic engineering by an
Egyptian that appears to bear

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.940
out Wilcox correlation
of lived language

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:38.670
to scientific ingenuity were it
not for the inconvenient fact

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:41.080
that that discussion
is forma written Arabic

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.970
as was Wilcox's original call
for the use of the colloquial

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.540
as a language of science.

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:51.220
Paradoxically, the language of
empirical science is often at odds

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.410
with its philosophical premises.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.600
Empiricist discourse
privileges matter over mind.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.090
Indeed, it insists
that direct observation

00:38:59.090 --> 00:39:02.390
of matter should decide
human axioms about nature

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:05.180
and in effect make up our minds.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:08.950
Yet, it couches its findings in
standards languages very often

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:11.150
that occupy an abstract relation,

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:15.440
these of the daily texture
of material reality.

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.310
In using formal Arabic to
[inaudible] empiricism,

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:21.870
Wilcox brings home a bacon he
surely meant to leave behind

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:27.980
for although opposed bacon as an
exemplar of vernacular ingenuity,

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:31.060
Bacon wrote his "Nuevo [foreign
language] "New Organin,"

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.410
1620 in Latin, not English,

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.140
and the same problem,
in fact, afflicts Dalte.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:43.460
He has to write his apology for
Tuscan in Latin in effect in order

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:47.440
to make it reach a wide audience.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.330
Wilcox's essay struck a cord
with epistemic anxieties

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:54.480
of the 19th century Arabic
speaking intellectuals.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:59.770
Writing 1893 in his periodical, "El
[foreign language]," "The Teacher,

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.660
whose pages up to that point
did often did feature articles

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:06.840
in the Egyptian colloquial, the
Egyptian nationalist, Adbul Nadeem,

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.850 position:56%
debunks Wilcox's assumption that
written Arabic is not up to the task

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.730
of modern science or
modernity, itself.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:20.080
How could Wilcox allege that
formal Arabic had stalled Egyptian

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.070
capacities for scientific
invention, he opines,

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:26.970
when renaissance Europe had taken
much of its science from Arabic?

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:31.230 position:56%
Moreover, even modern Egyptians,
who have learned European languages,

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:33.870
and Nadeem writes, "still
use Arabic as a language

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.930
of intellectual production
writing books, newspapers,

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.010
and stories of their own as well

00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:43.150
as translating European
scientific text into Arabic.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.300
Twelve years earlier in 1881 issue

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.970
of his first weekly [foreign
language] which can translate

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:57.380 position:56%
as raillery and reproach and Nadeem
writing in the long wake of the 1798

00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:01.250
to 1801 French occupation
of Egypt and on the eve

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:05.910
of the 1882 British occupation,
perceived the seduction of French

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:08.100
and English in the shadow
of European imperialism.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.960
In an essay titled,
[foreign language],

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:16.770
"The loss of language is a
surrender of the self," he warned

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:20.960
against the abandonment of Arabic,
taking the form of an open letter,

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:26.080 position:56%
the essay's salutation reads,
[foreign language], literally oh you

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:28.850 position:56%
who pronounce the letter dalth
[phonetically spelled], meaning "oh,

00:41:28.850 --> 00:41:30.810
you, who speaks the
language of the dalth,"

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.160
which is a common epithet
for Arabic.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.930
With that direct address
to his reader,

00:41:36.930 --> 00:41:41.040
Nadeem signals the uniqueness of
Arabic, hence its incomparable,

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.700
or at least its non-exchangeability
but invoking the consonant "dalth,"

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:49.930
the hard "d" sound, said to
occur in no other language.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:54.830
The letter opens with a series
of impassioned interrogations.

00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:56.660
"For what do you exchange
your language?

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:58.020
What is comparable to it?

00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:02.070
for whom do you abandon it when
you are its guardian, grantor?

00:42:02.070 --> 00:42:05.070
What have you found so beautiful
in other language and so ugly

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.800
in its analogic features?

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:08.850
I ask you to swear by
God, have you found

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:12.140
in the modern languages what your
ancient language encompasses?

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.750
When you express something
with a word

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:16.720
from a language besides your own
and then wish to elaborate on it

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:20.040 position:56%
with another expression, do you find
even one synonym for it as you find

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.340
in your language a cluster of
synonyms for any given word?

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.700
Are you the one ignorant of
the power of your language?"

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.030
What Europeans like Raunov regarded

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.740
as a feature alongside its
unwritten short vowels,

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:36.270
that makes Arabic incomparably
defective, namely the abundance

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.900 position:56%
of words that express the same idea,

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.280
is what makes Arabic
for Nadeem rich.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.790
That would then Arabic
lie infinite possibilities

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:47.390
for exchange is precisely
and paradoxically

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:51.550
for him what should inhibit, if not
prohibit, its speakers and writers

00:42:51.550 --> 00:42:54.510
from exchanging Arabic
for other languages.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:56.000
And Nadeem recognizes, however,

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.190
why his Arabic language
readership has come

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.350 position:56%
to compare its language with others.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.970
He understands that his
readership judges the currency,

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:07.240 position:56%
the modernity of a written language
by its proximity to living to speech

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:10.590
and thus is tempted to
exchange a dead, ancient Arabic

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:13.090
for live modern languages.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.820
Yet the threat of the foreign,
and in the case for Nadeem,

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.520
the foreign is deeply
linked to colonialism--

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:26.890
he was an anticolonial nationalist,
fighting the British occupation

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:30.000
as well as involved in
anti-Turkish agitation.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.610
Yet the threat of the
foreign, and Nadeem counters,

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:36.010
has historically what has
divided written from spoke Arabic

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:39.780
and Arabic secure in its
power need not reject speech.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:42.960
it is the failure of Arabic,
historical and contemporary,

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.070
to ward off the intrusion of
foreign words on its grammar

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:49.880 position:56%
that gradually separated, he argues,
the Arabic of the pen from that

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:55.410
of the tongue, making its pages
defensive, and I quote from Nadeem,

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:58.620
"I do not prohibit you from
other languages besides your own,

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:00.410
rather I wish only to remind you

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:04.480 position:56%
that your language was once spoke
[foreign language] without the study

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.450
of a manuscript, without a book.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:11.490
With the intermixing of the foreign
word, it was somewhat corrupted.

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:12.790
It feared of its loss.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:15.210
It was recorded in
the bowels of pages.

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:19.140
Its power remained in writing until
its foreign words grew so numerous

00:44:19.140 --> 00:44:21.220
that writers opted for these.

00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:24.520
Then foreign words multiplied, such
that it, the original language,

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:27.100
was exchanged for a
conventional language,

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.670
the word is [foreign language],
language born of usage,

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:33.860
that followed no grammatical rule.

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:35.710
The catastrophe has grown.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:37.610
Writers have crowned
the transformation

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:41.490 position:56%
by speaking the colloquial with long
expression, a third which is foreign

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:45.750
to both its original and
its conventional languages."

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:50.560
Notice that Nadeem positions Arabic
in historical cycles of corruption

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:54.290
by an incorporation of the
foreign, here in original Arabic

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.830
in which the spoken and the
written coincide give way,

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:01.430
thanks to the intrusion of foreign
words to a conventional Arabic

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:05.450
that is no longer pure enough to
obey rules but operates instead

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:08.440
as a hybrid language whose
correctness can be determined

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:11.580 position:56%
presumably only by contingent usage.

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:15.400
That Arabic, in turn, has given way
to a loose colloquialized writing

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:18.110
so replete with foreign
words, in his estimation,

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.770
that it transgresses
even convention.

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:25.200
Respecting, we might say,
neither statutory nor common law,

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:29.490
this Arabic has broken
with all pasts.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:32.360
Nadeem's polemic provoked
a powerful rejoinder

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:33.660
from Amin Shamil [phonetically
spelled],

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.990
the Cyril Lebanese publisher of the
journal [foreign language] writes

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:42.180
or law, writing within the
month in Nadeem's newspaper,

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:44.220
so [foreign language], Shamil
challenged the vitality

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:45.860
of formal written Arabic.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.740
For Shamil, that Arabic
increasingly lacked a market,

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.090
even among its native speakers.

00:45:51.090 --> 00:45:52.510
The conjunction of imperialism

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.650
and global capitalism drives
his suggestion that speakers

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:58.580
of Arabic abandon their language,
at least as a language of writing

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.050
and embrace French or
English as the lengua Franca

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:05.670
of imperial power,
capital, and modernity.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.830
Insisting that "language is
but a material instrument

00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:12.570
in which the exchange of ideas
and meaning is transacted

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.490
between human individuals,"
Shamil premises the life

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:18.850
or death of language on history.

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:23.100 position:56%
Understood neither his continuum nor
a cycle as a Nadeem would have it

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.530
but as rises and falls that are
the upshot of material causes,

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.870
contingencies of power and money.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:35.240
In as much as language is for
Shamil only an instrument [foreign

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.140
language], it "Holds
no precedence as such.

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.640
Its might and the decline the
status are rather the outcome

00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:46.350
of the attributes of its
people, power and weakness."

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:49.030
Language, he writes and "A mirror

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:54.350
in which the self images
of its people shatter."

00:46:54.350 --> 00:47:00.070
Rather than represent the
position and the power of a people

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:03.480
in the world, language
refracted that position

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:04.780
through material filters

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.670
of political power and
scientific progress.

00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:10.560
Rather than a one-to-one
reflection, you have a refraction.

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:15.810
Absent power and progress, the
capacity to compare or compete

00:47:15.810 --> 00:47:19.710
with the modern and to convey the
modern, no beauty or eloquence,

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:21.910
Shamil argues, can save a language.

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:25.060
Languages die, he might say,
naturally with the decline

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.940
of the people who use
them and rightly so.

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:31.170
In this fate, he suggests
Arabic will join [inaudible],

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:35.920
Greek and Latin, languages whose
long canonicity, hence, survival,

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.620
makes them "more closely
resemble the living

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:42.680
and the image of the dead."

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.340
Shamil now assumes in
reverse the empiricist posture

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.840
of the young William Jones.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:50.040
He advises Nadeem and his ilk
to undertake an experiment

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.310
and to observe what they see,
to place Arabic literature

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:57.790 position:56%
in a purely material comparison with
foreign, read European literatures,

00:47:57.790 --> 00:48:02.200
and witness the shattering of,
in every sense, Arabic's currency

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.130
and I quote, "Go to
our lending libraries

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:09.850
and our mercantile centers,"
Shamil writes, "and see how much

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:14.340 position:56%
in Arabic," which he calls [foreign
language] so uses the letter "dalth"

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:18.080
to signify Arabic, "see how
much a book in Arabic rents

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.210
for versus how much a book
in a foreign language,"

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:25.530
which he calls [inaudible]
softy sound, "rents for.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:29.840
Then write a book entirely in
Arabic, spend your whole life on it

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.940
and offer it to your
people and you will see

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:35.890
that there is no market
for your goods."

00:48:35.890 --> 00:48:38.540
Shamil attributes the
decline of Arabic in modernity

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:42.800
to its exceptional-ism to precisely
the sort of incomparability Nadeem

00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.270
in shrines in the letter
"dalth," that hard "d" sound said

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:48.390
to occur in no other language.

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:50.620
To pronounce the letter
"dalth," is to interdict

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:54.120
or to forbid the comparability and
thus the exchangeability of Arabic

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:57.910
and to declare that the no
language can adequately compensate

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:59.210
for another.

00:48:59.210 --> 00:49:02.720
"To enter the world
of commodity exchange

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:05.360
of the profitable production
and consumption of knowledge,"

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:08.500
Shamil intermits, "Arabs
should go the way of the world,

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.290
the letter [inaudible], the
ubiquitin soft "d" sounds

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:14.390
that Arabic shares
with other languages

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:16.910
and that makes Arabic almost
at the molecular level

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:19.320
of the phoneme comparable.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.180
Oddly recalling Vulni and
Raunak, as well as Jones,

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.340
this vernacular turn again
hinges on the letter.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:29.640
Yet by accenting the consonants,
not the vowel, as the locust,

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.390
both of Arabic incomparability
to date

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:36.310
and its modern potential
to be comparable.

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:39.810
Shamil's literary comparativism
on this point, like in Nadeem's,

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:42.760
which equally accents a
consonants, also reverses

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:46.510
and subverts the terms
of European scholarship.

00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:50.580
In Nadeem's essay of 1893,
correlates Wilcox's call

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:53.390
on Egyptians to write in the
vernacular, this is later essay

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:56.860
of 1893, correlates Wilcox's
call on Egyptians to write

00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:00.140
in the vernacular, which Shamil's
earlier call on Arabic speakers

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.760
to write in foreign languages.

00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:05.300
He sees both as calls to
abandon literary Arabic.

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:08.990
Against Wilcox and
Shamil, Nadeem writes,

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:13.230
"The correct language is the
living, given its use by the wise

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:17.320
of the community," and he is
referring to by "correct language,"

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:22.410
to the formal language,
formal Arabic, "is the living,

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:25.860
given its use by the wise of
the community, elite or common

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:29.260
and the colloquial language
or the vernacular is the dead,

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:32.190
give its disuse for
all but the necessities

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:34.630
that a language, less
animal requires."

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:38.250
It's quite a statement.

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:41.540 position:56%
Speech exiled from grammar, which
is not always tandem out to writing,

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:45.280
but is often fixed and secured
through writing is speech exiled

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.270
from the past, and
the historicity is

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:51.700
for a Nadeem the ultimate
corruption, collapsing the human

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.930
into the nonhuman animal.

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.560
The life he imputes to
correct Arabic rests

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.540
in its continuity with the past.

00:50:58.540 --> 00:51:01.640
Its capacity is culture
barer and barer of belief.

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:05.810
Its capacity to carry time for
all who use it across Christian,

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:08.940
Muslim and Jewish lines
in this particular context

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.650
and to carry belief across
time for Muslim in particular

00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:18.150
since former Arabic is structurally
speaking the language of the Quran.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:22.330
The dialectal is dead because it
is presentence more easily divorced

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:26.130
from the long historical continuity
of Arabic-Islamic tradition

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:30.450
that it changes with the
moment is born out by the fact

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:34.710
that foreign words
compose 1/3 of its lexicon.

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:38.170
Yet a Nadeem makes it clear that
he is not opposed to the influence

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:42.590
of the foreign on Arabic; 19th
century Arabic writers, after all,

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:45.770
have successfully translated
many European language works

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:47.360
into standard.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.660
His point is that formal Arabic
is adequate to the foreign

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.570
and responsible to the self,

00:51:52.570 --> 00:51:56.240
a language into which modernity is
translatable even as it preserves

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:58.770
and reinvigorates,
so called, tradition.

00:51:58.770 --> 00:52:00.240
For Nadeem [inaudible],

00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:03.600 position:56%
Shamil called to abandon the
incomparable language of the "dalth"

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.520
for a more easily language
of the "del" is

00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:11.910
by Arabic terms [foreign language]
in [inaudible] is a distortion

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:14.400
that the level of the letter, which
in Arabic is [foreign language],

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:19.170
they share one roof, of Arabic's
potential to be worldly, be modern

00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:21.270
and at the same time be itself.

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:25.310
"Lift demands artifice, the
formal preservation of writing,

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:29.240
of continuity to brave death."

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:38.240
I shift here toward a conclusion,
moving in a different vein.

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:44.750
In 1899, Saleem [inaudible], a
Cyril Lebanese portrait artist,

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:48.970
resident in Cairo, -- Skip ahead.

00:52:48.970 --> 00:52:53.140
This is one of the portraits
that [inaudible] painted --

00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.820
received a U.S. patent
for new Arabic typefaces

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.560
for typewriters for
printing presses.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.530
In his application,
[inaudible] argued

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:07.800 position:56%
that his invention had reconstructed
and reduced to a mere 58 character,

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:12.740 position:56%
the 638 different characters
required to represent the 29 letters

00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:16.550
of the Arabic alphabet in the
relative positions to other letter,

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:20.210
initial, medial, terminal,
stand-alone.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:24.490
By 1904, typewriters featuring
[inaudible] keyboard were in use

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:27.190
in Cairo [inaudible]
as well as by Turkish

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:30.760
and Persian officials right here in
Washington and [inaudible] traveled

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.720
to the United States
for an extended period

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.360
to promote their mass production.

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.990
In 15 of May of 1904 issue
of the major periodical,

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:40.770
[foreign language],
"The Crescent" published

00:53:40.770 --> 00:53:45.290
in Cairo [inaudible]'s Arabic
typewriter features prominently an

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:48.720
unsigned article detailing his
invention, presumably penned

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:53.860
by the [foreign language],
argues that mechanized writing,

00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:59.520
faster and clear than handwriting
has become in "European nations

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.480
and the rest of the
civilized world."

00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:07.050
There's a strong accent on
"civilization" in his piece.

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:09.960
On 21, August 1904,
"The New York Times,"

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.720
in turn published an
unsigned interview

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:17.150
with [inaudible] trumpeting
his invention thus.

00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:20.080
"An artist inventor
from Mount Lebanon,

00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:21.380
Salim [inaudible] new alphabet

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:25.330
and typewrite will facilitate
study of oriental literature."

00:54:25.330 --> 00:54:27.990
Conjoining the languages
and capitalism,

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.640
the Times praises [inaudible] for
having conquered the complexity

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:34.330
of the Arabic alphabet and
reduced it to the requirements

00:54:34.330 --> 00:54:39.120
of a business office, more to
the point of my lecture today,

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:42.450
it conflates two kinds of Arabic
letters, the Arabic alphabet

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.530
and Arabic literature, and imagines

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:47.080
that the simplified
machine translation

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:50.110
of the Arabic alphabet will
extract oriental literature

00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:53.990 position:56%
from the obscurity to which its
alphabetic complexity supposedly has

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:57.000
doomed it and make it
accessible to the world,

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.170
presumably by permitting
its mass production

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.600 position:56%
and circulation to wider leadership.

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:05.620
I quote from this article, "The
whole world will be enabled

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.490
to know the wonders of
oriental literature,

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:09.480
which has been hitherto impossible,

00:55:09.480 --> 00:55:12.290
except in a very slight
degree to scholars.

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:15.070
Even a foreigner, who has
merely dipped into the subject

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:19.550
of oriental literature, knows of
their wonderfulness and luxuriance.

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:22.510
The difficulty of research
will be rendered far less.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.510
The peculiar bulk and complexity

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:27.730
of the Arabic alphabet have made
the riches of these literature

00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.100
as inaccessible as unmind gems."

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:34.580
Seen through the eyes
of its U.S. observers,

00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.450
[inaudible]'s invention
takes us back

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:39.450
to the 18th century
of Jones and Vulni.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:43.400
Jones struggled to make the wealth
[foreign language] was his term

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.500
of oriental literatures
accessible to European readers

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:50.550
by simplifying Persian
letters, first translating words

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:53.120
into the plainest French,
then transliterating sounds

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:56.570
into Roman script, into
an assimilated script.

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:59.930
Vulni complains that Arabic failed
to paint its words faithfully,

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:03.940 position:56%
that is failed to visually represent
all of its sounds to the letter.

00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:07.860
He, too, sought to simplify
Arabic, Persian and Turkish

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.580
by devising a Roman script

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:12.540
that would articulate
their hidden sounds.

00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.430
By the end of the 19th
century, thanks to the invention

00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:17.880
of [inaudible], a painter, no less,

00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:21.940
modern Arabic print culture would
heed the silent song of simplicity;

00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:25.160
yet, it would do so
in a different key.

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.740
[Inaudible] adapted the structural
logic of the Arabic to that

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:33.370 position:56%
of the languages of imperial Europe,
that is he reconstructed a script,

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:36.430
whose letters articulate
movement, changing shape

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:40.810
with the relative position within a
word to behave as much as possible

00:56:40.810 --> 00:56:44.790
like the isolated letters of
printed English or French.

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:48.410
Yet the Arabic of his new
century caligraph, like the Arabic

00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:51.070
of thinkers is diversion
as Nadeem and Shamil,

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:56.030 position:56%
did not give the consonant, the hard
letter, as the mediating principle

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:57.890
between the past and
future of Arabic

00:56:57.890 --> 00:57:00.830
or between Arabic and
other language.

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:04.180
[Inaudible] Arabic keyboard seem
to resist the obligatory marking

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:09.430
of short vowels, Vulni
and Raunak so desired.

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:14.960
His patent application specifies
no keys for those characters.

00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:19.070
In a new century that reiterates
the simplification of Arabic

00:57:19.070 --> 00:57:23.330
as a condition of its entry
into world literary space,

00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:27.620
Arabic unwritten short vowels,
which continue to rely speech,

00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:32.420 position:56%
vocalized in the mind's ear to sound
their hidden movements mark a large

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:33.900
and enduring difference

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:37.860
from a common ground still
overdetermined by western norm.

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:41.320
In that difference, like other
such differences in the world,

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.230
a revolutionary theory

00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:45.620
of transcontinental
comparative literature,

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:48.910
one that no longer
centers Euro-U.S. paradigms

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:51.740 position:56%
but embraces polycentrism must hear.

00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:54.510
Thank you.

00:57:54.510 --> 00:58:09.070
[ Applause ]

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:13.190
Thank you very much.

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:16.510
Yeah, I [inaudible]
I missed somebody.

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:43.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:44.340
Sure, absolutely.

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:46.140
Right.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:59:00.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:02.010
That's an excellent.

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:06.780
Vulni really struggles with this
question in his "Simpificacion,"

00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:08.710
he asked to [inaudible]
at various points

00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:12.850
that European languages are not
necessarily anymore rational

00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:19.220
in their ways of rendering
sounds in alphabetic form

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:22.620
and while he doesn't always
touch French, his own language,

00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:30.020
which after all has silent
letters and other such oddities,

00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:32.610
if you will, that cannot
be reconciled,

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:38.630
he does point out that there
are numerous failures also

00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:41.640
of transcription in European
languages and so part

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:45.420
of that argument goes into
inform his larger interest

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:49.720
in a purely rational
universal alphabet

00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:54.660
that will somehow eliminate all
uncertainties of pronunciation

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:59.070
across tongues, but oriental
languages are still, nonetheless,

00:59:59.070 --> 01:00:06.030
singled out as being particular
defective for their tendency not

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:11.230
to mark short vowels,
which, after all decide

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:15.030
in many cases not just the
pronunciation of the word,

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:19.300
but also its meaning, you know
the difference between two words

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:30.440
in Arabic with the same consonantal
structure hinges very often

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:35.240
on how the short vowels,
marked or not are read, right?

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:40.090 position:56%
So this becomes a particular problem
for Vulni but it also is a test case

01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:46.100
for a larger attempt to
rationalize script systems.

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:50.200
So, no, you're absolutely
right and Arabic critics

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:54.110
of the impulse towards
vernacular-ization someone

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:58.860 position:56%
like Abdul Nadeem points out, "Well,
English language scientific text,"

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.220
he says are not written
in the same register

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.760
of language as spoken English."

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:08.240
That there are differences
in register in the languages

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:12.970
of text too, and so he tries
to poke holes in what he sees

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:17.620
as the false claims of Wilcox,
for instance, that a language

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:21.270
that approximates that of daily
life is somehow a necessity

01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:24.820
for scientific invention,
ingenuity, the production

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:26.520
of scientific literature.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.640
He recognizes that
argument as tendencious.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.170
Nonetheless, it also worried.

01:01:31.170 --> 01:01:33.240
It worries intellectuals
like Nadeem.

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.760
It worries his contemporaries.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:40.190
They are concerned that
Arabic may lack the currency

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:47.700
to somehow convey the modern
and they are, in various ways,

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:53.970 position:56%
approaching the question of language
reform from that space of anxiety.

01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:56.510
So, yeah.

01:01:56.510 --> 01:02:04.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.340
Yeah, that's a very good question.

01:02:05.340 --> 01:02:07.330
Initially, it seems to have
been manufactured in --

01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:12.130
it may have been manufactured
in the Middle East

01:02:12.130 --> 01:02:18.760
because there were machines said
to be fabricated in handsome white

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:23.010 position:56%
and gold but don't look like the new
century caligraph in circulation,

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:27.400
the [foreign language] of Egypt at
the time [inaudible] II owned one,

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:34.010
the Sultan of the Ottoman
empire, [inaudible] II owned one.

01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:36.030
All the departments of
the Egyptian government,

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:39.590
which at that time was a colonial
government under the British,

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:50.150
kind of a loose colonial structure
under Cromer, owned one and all

01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:52.220
of these departments
were using the system.

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:56.980
Apparently, when he came to the
states, he came under the Egests

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:03.320 position:56%
of his financier, Ismael
[inaudible], who was the grand mason

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:10.240
of the, basically, chapter, the
masonic lodge of Cairo at the time

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.630
and self the descendant of
a Ottoman Turkish notable

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:17.740
and Ismael [inaudible] had
financed [inaudible]'s trip

01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:22.570
and also financed the larger scale
manufacture of these typewriter

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:26.550
and he came to the U.S. to seek
basically a corporate partnership

01:03:26.550 --> 01:03:29.070
to take this invention
to a much larger scale,

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:42.290 position:56%
and so the American Writing Machine
Company new caligraph typewriter was

01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:46.150
very popular in this first
decade of the 20th century

01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:49.890
and Arabic keyboard appears
to have been one such.

01:03:49.890 --> 01:03:53.880
Yeah, it's very interesting.

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:59.820
So, yeah, he was here about 18
months promoting the invention

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:05.510
and connecting with
factories in the U.S.

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:11.420
[ Inaudible ]

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:13.220
Thank you.

01:04:13.220 --> 01:05:15.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:16.340
Yeah, that's a really
wonderful question.

01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:17.640
Thank you.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:21.610
I think you may have been
referring to Shamil from 1881,

01:05:21.610 --> 01:05:24.410
who basically calls for
the abandonment of Arabic

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:30.290 position:56%
on the argument that Arabic now
lacks a market even among its native

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:32.940
speakers, right -- the
Arabic language text,

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:34.830
I should say, lack a market, yeah.

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.130
Absolutely, you're right.

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:37.750
There is a kind of an
attention to audience there.

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:39.560
It's a specific sort of audience.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.260
First of all, it presumes
a literate audience.

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:46.170
It presumes an audience
literate in English and French,

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:48.940
the dominate European languages
that would have been read

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:53.400
in greater Syria at that time or
Egypt at the time, so when somebody

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:57.230
like Shamil says, "We should be
writing in foreign languages,"

01:05:57.230 --> 01:06:00.080
meaning larger, we should be
writing in English and French,

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:06.350
he's speaking about a very
specific, largely, elite, by elite,

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:09.730 position:56%
I'm speaking somewhat loosely, you
have an emerging [foreign language],

01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:13.930
you have an emerging middle class,
but in a certain sense an elite

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:17.700
who had been educating at European
institutions and Europeans schools

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.610 position:56%
and who are reading these languages.

01:06:19.610 --> 01:06:25.800
There are problems right there with
a particular conception of audience

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.510
and [inaudible] too is
thinking about audience.

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:32.790
Some of his articles prior to
Wilcox's [inaudible] were published

01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:34.750
in the Egyptian colloquial.

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:38.390
This is by somebody who's
arguing against the vernacular.

01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:39.690
Why did he do this?

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:43.290
He saw Egyptian colloquial
as effectively a kind of set

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:47.690
of training wheels that would
enable a less literate population,

01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:52.380
no wholly illiterate because it's a
slice of population, in this case,

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:56.420
Egypt, "The Journal"
circulated elsewhere

01:06:56.420 --> 01:07:00.670
in the Arabic-speaking world but it
was deeply Egyptian in some ways.

01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:05.310
A slice of the population who
at least were conversant enough

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:09.140
with the Arabic alphabet
and grammatical system

01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:14.850 position:56%
that they could even read colloquial
Arabic transposed into written form

01:07:14.850 --> 01:07:20.390
and he saw it as a stepping stone
toward learning formal Arabic.

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:22.380
So these question of audience
are there and they're there

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.690
with the Europeans writers too.

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:27.130
I mean Jones is trying to
think about how to make Arabic

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:31.120
and Persian, and Turkish poetry
appeal to a French audience.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:38.310
So you are right that one of the
things I'm trying to do is move

01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:44.030
across scales to move from
this very odd, seemingly odd,

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:48.980
fascination with something as
microcosmic as the grapheme

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:56.290
or the phoneme, this minutest
unit of language as a sphere

01:07:56.290 --> 01:08:01.430 position:56%
in which comparability is
transacted between writers, thinkers

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:07.080
and the readers to ever widening
circles, so things like form

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.470
or [inaudible], or the sensibility

01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:13.290
of literature are also
implicated here.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:20.360 position:56%
Text that I didn't touch on on this
talk that speaks to yet another leap

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:29.880
in this particular discussion, and
yet another leap in this history

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:33.070
of transaction, if you will,
of comparability between Arabic

01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:37.910
and European literature
is one from 1902 to 1904.

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:41.230
Its' first serialized and then
published as a monograph in 1904

01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:43.220
by the Ottoman Palestinian
intellectual, [inaudible],

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:46.450
and it's a history of the
discipline of literature,

01:08:46.450 --> 01:08:50.850
the science of literature
among the French and the Arabs.

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:53.150
[Inaudible] says, well, I'm
writing this history basically

01:08:53.150 --> 01:09:02.810 position:56%
for an audience effectively composed
of the semi-literate products

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:09.430
of schools in the orient, modeled
on a European paradigm, right,

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:15.050
and it seems pejorative in a way
but [inaudible] is extrapolating

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:19.230
from that audience to a theory
and a kind of a new language

01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:23.950
and literature that argues that
tries to resurrect old arguments

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:27.820
from 10 centuries earlier in
the Arabic-Islamic tradition

01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:30.130
and say eloquence resides
in the average word,

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:32.740
in the word that reaches the
widest possible public --

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:37.030
widest possible audience, that
reaches the elites and the commons

01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:40.540 position:56%
or the masses alike, and so
there's an attempt to hit a midpoint

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:44.750
in language and then to hit also a
midpoint in literary sensibility.

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:46.270
So there's, you could say,

01:09:46.270 --> 01:09:49.320
a revolutionary political
project there on the one hand

01:09:49.320 --> 01:09:53.030
but it's also a project that
assimilates Arabic language

01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:57.620
and literature to some of the ideas
that we heard today in that --

01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:02.060
now, I'm just starting
to speculate widely --

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:07.060
in that he is interested a language
-- his notion of clear language

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:11.070
or transparent language is one in
which word and idea correlate very,

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:14.740
very tightly, so one word to
one idea, and here you start

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:19.040
to hear shades of [inaudible], who
apart from his obsession, you know,

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:24.190
with the question of the
vowel is also very concerned

01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:28.760
with the abundance of words with
polysemy of Arabic and argues

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.430
that a more developed
language is more analytical,

01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:35.970
one word corresponds to one idea;
a language like Arabic is synthetic

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:39.040
or complex and that is
a defect for Raunak.

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:42.810
That is a sign that it has not
actually progressed in the way

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:45.330
that other languages have
and so there's something

01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:48.930
of a counter evolutionary paradigm
if we think of biological evolution

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:51.920
as a progression from a simpler
to a more complex organism,

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:57.390
there's an odd reversal of that
evolutional trajectory even

01:10:57.390 --> 01:11:02.500 position:56%
as these theorists are talking about
forms of life, where Arabic has

01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:06.370
to simplify, and so in that
sense, the middle word,

01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:11.680 position:56%
the middle register is revolutionary
and yet also in some ways imperial.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:15.340
So that's the beginning of an
answer to your wonderful question

01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:21.960
about audience and how it
inflicts arguments in these texts.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.260
Thank you.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.300
Thank you very much.

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:27.100
Thank you all again.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:45.840
