so what question that could arise is

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870
so what question that could arise is
 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.540
so what question that could arise is
whether the same results would apply in

whether the same results would apply in
 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.760
whether the same results would apply in
