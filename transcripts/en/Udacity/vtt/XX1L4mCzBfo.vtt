00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So years ago, while I was working at a company that shall not be named,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I was bored out of my mind, and one of the things that people at this company

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
did to pass the time was playing Tetris.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I ended up liking this Tetris game so much

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that I decided to try and write my own version of it,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
write a computer program to play Tetris, and if you haven't seen it before,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Tetris is a Soviet falling blocks puzzle game

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
with a number of different pieces, all of which are made up of 4 smaller blocks.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I decided that I wanted to support not just the normal Tetris pieces,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but because I'm a bit of a math person, the ability to have pieces

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that were 5 long as well.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In order to do that, I ended up making a piece definition language,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a way of writing out what a Tetris piece should look like

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that this Tetris program would then read in.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, I didn't use all of the lexing and parsing techniques

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that you're going to learn in this class,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but I did use the same sort of concepts, and the point I'm trying to get across here

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is that in some sense, learning how to create

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
your own language is like learning how to read.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It really opens up a world of possibilities.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
It's a new tool in your belt that will come up and help you

00:01:10.000 --> 09:59:59.000
when you least expect it.
