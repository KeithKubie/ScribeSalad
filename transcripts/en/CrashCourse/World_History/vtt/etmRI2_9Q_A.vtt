Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we're gonna talk

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.410
about Russia, which means we get to talk about
this guy again! We haven’t talked about

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.220
Russia much so far because one, it’s complicated,
and two, ya actually gavaryu pa ruski a little bit,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.740
because I had some Russian in college, and that makes
it difficult to mispronounce things, which is my thing!

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.500
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! Why’d you take Russian?

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.160
Well, because I had this big crush on a Russian major.
But, anyway, I’m sure I’ll still mispronounce everything.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:31.080
[theme music]

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.440
So, today we’re going to talk about persistent
stereotypes about Russia, and how Russia came

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.680
to take its current shape, a turn of events
we owe largely to the Mongols.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.520
But before we discuss the Mongol conquest
of Russia, let’s discuss exactly what got

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.530
conquered. So before there was a Russian empire,
or even a Russian kingdom, there was the Kievan

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.120
Rus. We know Kiev was a powerful city-state,
but who exactly founded it is a subject of

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.039
debate. Most historians now believe that the
settlers of Kiev were Slavic people who migrated

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.530
from around the Black Sea. But there’s an
older theory that the settlers of Kiev were

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.280
actually, like, Vikings. That theory goes
that Vikings came down to Kiev from rivers

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.430
like the Dnieper and founded a trading outpost
similar to ones they’d founded in Iceland

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.980
and Greenland. Which is an awesome idea and
everything, but Russian, the language that

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.310
developed from what the Rus spoke, sounds
a lot more Slavic than it sounds, you know,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.720
Swedish. To illustrate, here is a Swede fighting
with a Russian over who founded Kiev.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.840
Right, okay, so trade was hugely important
to Kiev. Almost all of their wars ended with

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.560
trade concession treaties, and their law codes
were unusually devoted to the subject of commerce.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.830
The Rus traded raw materials like fur, wax,
and also slaves — We’re not gonna venture

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.620
into the astonishingly intense etymological
debate over whether the word ''Slav'' derives

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.380
from the Latin word for slave because there's
nothing more terrifying and verbose than an

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.730
etymologist flame war. But, yeah, the Rus
traded slaves. They also relied on agriculture

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.450
— and your relationships to the land determined
both your social status and your tax burden.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.150
And if you fell into tax debt, which a lot
of peasants did, then you became bonded to

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.149
the land you farmed for the rest of your life.
I guess that slave-like dynamic is okay as

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.290
a model for social organization, but if you
step on the proletariat for too long, you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.079
might end up with a Communist revolution.

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.989
But I’m getting way ahead of myself. Couple
more things about Kiev: First, the ruler of

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.400
Kiev was called the Grand Prince, and he became
the model for future Russian Kings. Also,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.230
the early grand princes made a fateful decision:
They became Byzantine Christians. According

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.090
to legend, prince Vladimir chose to convert
the Rus to Byzantine Christianity in the 11th

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.739
century. He purportedly chose Christianity
over Islam because of Islam’s prohibition

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.519
on alcohol saying: “Drink is the joy of
the Russian.”

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.659
Anyway, the Kievan Rus eventually fell in
1240 when these guys showed up and replaced

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.920
them. By that time the Rus had been at war
with pastoral nomads for centuries; from the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.790
Khazars to the Pechenegs to the Cumans, and
they were tired. Which made them easy targets.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.959
The period of Mongol “rule” over Russia
is also known as Appanage Russia. An Appanage

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.989
is princedom, and this period basically featured
a bunch of Russian princes vying for control

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.269
over territory, which is not a recipe for
political stability or economic growth, another

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.400
theme that will re-emerge in Russian history.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.439
By the way, I’m describing all of this as
Russia even though if you did that in the

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.959
13th century, people would look at you funny.
They’d be like, “What do you mean, Russia?

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.319
Also, where’d you get those pants? And all
those teeth?” “MMMM…YOU SMELL PRETTY.”

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.580
Right. So, to discuss how important the Mongols
were to Russia, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.579
The Mongols did set up the Khanate of the
Golden Horde in Russia, but it didn’t leave

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.239
much lasting impact on the institutions of
the region, which had already been set up

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.639
by the Kievans. But they did bring about a
population shift — away from the South,

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:36.400
where Kiev was, toward the Northeast. This
was partly to get away from the Mongols and

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.189
their massacring, but that noted, the Mongols
were comparatively light rulers: They were

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.670
happy to live in their yurts and collect tribute
from the ever-bickering Russian princes. And

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.389
all the princes had to do in exchange for
their relative freedom was recognize the Mongol

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.700
khans as their rulers and allow the Mongols
to pick the Grand Prince from among the Russians.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.120
Perhaps most importantly, Mongol rule cut
the Russians off from the Byzantines and further

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.799
isolated them from Europe, leaving Russia
not Byzantine, not European, and not really

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.829
Mongol either, since they hated the Mongols
and generally believed the Mongols were a

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.269
scourge sent from God to punish them for their
sinfulness and everything.

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:18.590
But the Mongols did help propel Moscow to
prominence and in doing so, created the idea

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.070
that this was Russia. And as an aside, they
also did what Napoleon, Hitler, and many others

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.210
couldn’t: The Mongols successfully conquered
Russia in the winter. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.310
So how did the Mongols help catapult Moscow
and its princes to prominence? Well, first,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.150
they named Muscovite princes The Grand Prince
on more than one occasion. More importantly,

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.820
the Muscovite princes won — that is to say
purchased — the right to collect tribute

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.670
on behalf of the Khan from other princes.
That’s a good gig because it’s easy to

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.660
skim a little bit off the top before you send
it down the line to the Mongols. Which is

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.310
precisely what the Muscovites did to enrich
themselves. One prince who was particularly

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.500
good at this was known as Ivan Kalita. Using
my Russian, I can tell you that that translates

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.670
to “Johnny Moneybags.” As my Russian professor
would tell you, I’m a “creative” translator.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.700
All this loot helped Moscow expand their influence
and buy principalities. The Mongols also helped

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.750
them more directly by attacking their enemies.
Plus Moscow was at the headwaters of four

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.850
rivers which made it well-positioned for trade.
And because they were kind of the allies of

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.980
the Mongols, the Mongols rarely attacked them
– which meant that lots of people went to

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.150
Moscow because it was relatively safe. Including
churchy people. In fact, Moscow also became

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.310
the seat of the Eastern Orthodox church in
1325, when the Metropolitan Peter moved there.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.050
So you might think that the Muscovites would
be grateful for all this help from the Mongols,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.970
but you would be wrong. As the Mongols’
position weakened in Russia in the latter

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.600
half of the 14th century, one of Moscow’s
princes Dmitry Donskoy made war on them and

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.990
inflicted the first major defeat of Mongols
in Russia at battle of Kulikovo Field. This

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.970
showed that the Mongols weren’t invincible,
which is always really bad for an imperial

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.280
force. Plus it made Moscow look like the hero
of the Russians. And that helped strengthen

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.490
the idea of a unified Russia, just as you’ll
remember the Persians helped unify the Greeks

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.830
a long time ago. Aiding this growth was stability,
which Moscow owed largely to luck: Muscovite

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.940
princes usually had sons which allowed them
to have successors. In fact, there was only

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.990
one major succession struggle and it was between
two blind guys named Basil. That’s not a

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.850
joke by the way. Oh, it’s time for the Open
Letter?

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.360
An Open Letter to Basil and Basil.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.150
But first, let’s see in the Secret Compartment.
Oh, it’s Grizzlor! Yeah, I guess that is

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.850
kind of how the Russians saw the Mongols.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.400
Dear Basils,
The 15th century Muscovite civil war was insanely

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.200
complicated, but it culminated with you guys
essentially blinding each other. First, Basil

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.860
II, the eventual winner of the civil war,
had Basil the cross-eyed blinded. Because

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.520
being cross-eyed wan’t bad enough. And that
was seen as the end of the political career

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.060
of Basil the Cross-Eyed. But then Basil the
Cross-Eyed’s brother tracked down Basil

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.510
II and he was like “Imma blind you back!”
And of course, everybody thought that would

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.180
end Basil II’s political career, but they
were wrong. It turns out you can rule Russia

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.240
like a Boss even if you’re blind.
Best wishes, John Green

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.980
After Basil the Blind came the real man who
expanded Moscow’s power, Ivan III, later

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.460
known as Ivan the Great. First, he asserted
Russian independence from the Mongols and

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.560
stopped paying tribute to the khan-- after
the khan had named him Grand Prince, of course.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:15.310
Then, Ivan purchased, negotiated for or conquered
multiple appanages, thus expanding Muscovite

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.230
power even more. Ivan later declared himself
sovereign of all Russians and then married

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:23.750
the niece of the last Byzantine emperor, thus
giving him even more legitimacy. And he took

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:29.500
titles autocrat and tsar, which means Caesar.
Basically, Ivan created the first centralized

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.450
Russian state and for doing that he probably
deserves title “the Great.”

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.460
And that would be a good place to stop, except
then we won’t see the type of absolute rule

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.390
that characterized Russia for most of the
rest of its history, even unto Putin. OH GOD.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.900
JUST KIDDING PUTIN! YOU’D NEVER RIG AN ELECTION..
N-NO…PLEASE DON’T PUT ME IN JAIL!

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:49.440
While Ivan III consolidated Muscovite power,
the undeniable brutal streak in Russian governance

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:54.830
comes not from the Mongols, but from Ivan
IV, better known as Ivan the Terrible. Ivan

00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:01.430
IV ruled from 1533 to 1584, taking the throne
at age 16, yet more evidence that adolescents

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.890
should not be trusted with emerging empires.
Ivan the Terrible’s reign represents the

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:09.440
end of princely power and the beginning of
the autocracy that Russia is famous for. But

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.410
in the beginning, he was really an innovative
leader. As a young king, he worked with a

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:16.980
group of advisers called the Chosen Council,
which certainly sounds like a good thing.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.720
He also called the very first meeting of the
zemsky sobor, a grand council of representatives

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.420
similar to the estates general that would
become so important in France two hundred

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.830
years later. And also reformed the army, emphasizing
the new technology of muskets.

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.430
But in the second part of his reign, Ivan
earned his nickname, the Terrible — which

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.019
can mean either bad or just awe-inspiring,
depending on your perspective. Psychological

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:40.669
historians will point out that things started
go terribly wrong with Ivan after the death

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:44.720
of his beloved wife, Anastasia Romanov. Or
they might point to the fact that he enjoyed

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.730
torturing animals when he was a kid.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.040
Regardless, Ivan set out to break the power
of the nobility-- the former princes and landowners

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.490
called the boyars. They were the last link
to princely rule. And after an odd episode

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.389
that saw him briefly “abdicate,” Ivan
returned to Moscow and declared he had the

00:08:58.389 --> 00:09:02.949
right to punish all traitors and evildoers.
To help him in this effort, Ivan created the

00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:08.439
oprichniki, a corps of secret police who rode
around on black horses, wearing all black,

00:09:08.439 --> 00:09:13.839
whose job it was to hunt down and destroy
any enemies of the tsar. See also: Nazgûl

00:09:13.839 --> 00:09:17.639
and Dementors. So this was the first of Russia’s
purges. And over the latter half of Ivan’s

00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:22.689
reign, whole towns were destroyed. It was,
in effect, a civil war, except with no resistance.

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:27.220
One historian called it a civil massacre.
In the end, Ivan IV established absolute control

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.720
of the tsar over all the Russian people, but
he also set the precedent of accomplishing

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.680
this through terror, secret police, and the
suspension of law. And that would echo through

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.860
the ages of Russian history… I mean, until
Vladimir Putin heroically put an end to it.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.680
His little eyes. They’re scary…

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:46.120
So, hence the stereotype of Russian brutality
and barbarism, but here’s the truth; the

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.240
rest of Europe also knew a lot about brutality
and secret police forces. But for centuries,

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.519
Russia was seen by western Europe as both
European and not, an “Other” that was

00:09:55.519 --> 00:10:00.050
to be doubly feared because it was not fully
Other. And when we think of all these historical

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:04.620
stereotypes about Russia, it’s worth remembering
that what you see as barbaric about others

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:10.100
is often what they see as barbaric about you.
