00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.770
Hey guys,  I'm Nate, I'm out here in the desert with Stuart edge, and we've got our paintball gun tanks

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.770
And we're ready to start driving and shooting at each other

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.000
Building these things was super fun

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.790
And it would not have happened if it were not for our sponsor World of Tanks

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.860
Check out the link in the promo code in the description

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.330
Oh

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.380
Building the second of these tanks took me almost

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.019
16 hours to complete and it only went that fast because on the first tank I had figured out how to do everything

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.198
She may assumes that I'm just like a shoot shoot shoot shoot, no I precisely time my shots I could go like days

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.920
That's right good cuz you're never doing behind my take to shoot my tank you're never gonna get a single

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.409
All I see is this

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.550
That's all I got here. Is that love that love line. Hey, let's go

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.309
Coming for you coming up behind you fast better run ride no

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.210
I

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.630
Just realized something we're down here at the same level of these paintball guns

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.559
We are should probably go and I think we might get shot fits pretty. Yeah, let's take the hill

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.180
Oh-ho-oh all right, that's it you're going down you're going down you're going down

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.618
You're gonna hit a rock I'm just gonna roll right over

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.340
Rude

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.530
I'm coming

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.440
Oh

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.470
All right go go go

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.059
Don't go there don't go over there oh

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.219
He's survived coming back coming back you're not going down that easy

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.850
Take day, I'm

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.399
Pretty sure that even with the frame the loaded paintball gun and the foam body on these tanks

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.310
They're still hitting almost 25 miles an hour

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.569
Oh

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.920
I

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.560
Tilled it I shot it. Take it it died. That's what happens with tanks right you shoot him and they just die

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.809
Take it that'll be great even with your car flipping in the other day

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.100
Look at this look you nailed

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.510
My well actually you nailed the GoPro attached to my tank

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.369
Splattered the paintball tank, and then you physically ran into my tank and Phil oh

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.729
I had to sacrifice my tank to get that shot

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.850
But it was well worth it and right here on the hopper on the GoPro all right. That's it

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.999
These things are actually really fun

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.389
These cars are killer having a paintball gun have you ever driven anything that you can drive and shoot before no?

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.249
I think this is a first for me. Yeah. They look realistic. It's fun

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.829
Especially when you're like a little ways away from yours like oh, it's just like a tank just traveling over the little desert scenery

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.859
It's kind of trippy cuz you think you're looking at like a huge tank off in the distance and you're super far away a bit

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:41.380
And then you realize that most tanks probably can't spin out the way that these ones do yeah?

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.348
It's pretty hard to actually hit someone's tank but

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.378
It's really entertaining this project has been a ton of fun. Thank you to Stuart for being the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.349
Co-pilot, I don't know. What do you call the person who drives a tank?

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.180
It's a tank east

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.710
tanker I

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.229
Can't be right anyway
