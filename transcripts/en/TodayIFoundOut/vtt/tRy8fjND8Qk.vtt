00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.880
When Does a Speed Limit Come Into Effect

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.890
On paper, speed limits sound like a pretty
simple idea- legislators and experts agree

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.380
upon a given speed at which it’s deemed
safe to travel through an area and then let

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.990
the public know by clearly signposting it.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.140
But a question we’ve received numerous times
over the years is when exactly does a speed

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.800
limit legally come into effect?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.010
Here now is the answer.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.980
Any signposted speed limit comes into effect
at the exact point the sign resides.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.970
In other words, if you’re driving at 30
MPH through a 30 MPH zone and you’re about

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.920
to enter a zone that allows you to drive at
50MPH, it is technically illegal to begin

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.360
accelerating beyond 30 MPH until you’ve
reached the sign indicating the higher speed

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.360
limit.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.230
Contrary to what people may try to tell you,
by the letter of the law there is no “buffer”

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.159
or grace period near a speed limit sign, which
is why you’ll notice that when the speed

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.300
decreases drastically, you may see a helpful
warning sign telling you this before the actual

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.330
speed limit sign so you’re not having to
suddenly slam on the brakes to get down to

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.859
the posted limit before you reach the sign.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.189
While it is certainly true that a police officer
pulling you over in such a “buffer” scenario

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:20.580
could be lenient and decide to just let you
off with a warning, that’s entirely down

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.920
to their own discretion and it doesn’t change
that legally you’ve broken the law.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.289
This is true in the US, Canada and the UK,
with all of the documentation we consulted

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.350
saying the same basic thing- that a new speed
limit zone begins at the exact point a sign

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.450
is placed.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.450
What does vary between these countries, however,
are the tolerances we allow in cases involving

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.450
speeding.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.179
In the UK, we have something colloquially
known as “the 10% rule” which states that

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.240
you can generally get away with exceeding
the signposted speed limit by about 10%.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.240
Again though, this is entirely down to the
discretion of the police and it’s noted

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.740
that technically “exceeding a speed limit
by any amount whatsoever is an absolute offence”.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.749
However, official guidelines state that an
officer can choose to take no action, or simply

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:11.200
give a stern warning, if a person only exceeds
the speed limit within the bounds of 10% plus

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.820
an additional 2 MPH, after which they are
by the letter of the law required to take

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.730
action regardless of how good a mood the officer
is in, the severity of which depends on a

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.180
combination of their own discretion and how
much the individual was speeding by.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.940
In the US, things are a little more complex
and the tolerances vary from state to state

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.480
with many leaving it entirely up to the discretion
of the officer who pulls you over.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.569
Although most states do have speeds which
they consider to be “reckless”, this too

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.409
varies quite a bit depending on where you
are.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.170
Even in states where official tolerances (on
freeway speeds at least) exist, there is still

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.771
no universal consensus on exactly how much
you can go over the limit, though the Federal

00:02:50.771 --> 00:02:53.010
Highway Administration recommends that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.950
Speed measurements at the selected road segments
shall be used to determine the top 5 percent

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.950
of speeds.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.950
This information will be used to establish
the enforcement threshold.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.819
The enforcement threshold should never be
less than 5 mph above the new posted speed

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:08.819
limit.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.409
This top-down strategy will not overwhelm
the law enforcement officers, the prosecutors,

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:13.430
or the courts.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.610
This strategy promotes public and court acceptance
of enforcement by targeting only the most

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.430
egregious violators.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.319
The overall goal of the enforcement efforts
is motorist compliance, not issuance of citations.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.299
This unofficial buffer in speed is a good
thing because, wherever you’re driving,

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.870
your car’s speedometer likely isn’t perfectly
accurate, even if you’re just driving it

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.390
off the lot brand new with properly inflated
stock tires.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.620
With many cars, particularly in the EU, your
speedometer will actually be indicating you’re

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.379
going faster than you are.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.069
This is because by law in the EU (ECE-R39)
the speedometer can never show speeds less

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.010
than the speed you are really traveling.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.629
To account for tires wearing down, temperature
and pressure variation, varying loads in the

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.840
vehicle and the like, manufacturers tend to
err on the side of indicating you’re going

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.350
faster than you are, but, also by law, must
not fudge the numbers more than an additional

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.870
10% + 4 km/hr.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.990
According to Transport Canada, there are no
such official regulations at the federal level

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.660
in North America, though they aren’t wholly
correct in that the U.S. does have federal

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:23.700
standards concerning commercial vehicles,
not to be off by more than 5 mph at a 50 mph

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.160
reading on the speedometer.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.710
The manufacturers in this case will calibrate
the speedometer to the stock tires with new

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.940
tread and properly inflated.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.920
As the tire changes size for various reasons,
the speedometer will be slightly off, with

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.610
variations generally within the range of plus
or minus 10%, though if you choose to buy

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.070
replacement tires with a different size than
the factory tires, your speedometer may be

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.580
off by even more, making the unofficial speed
buffer given by police particularly useful.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.700
As for the argument about whether or or not
speed limits work in various scenarios and

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.880
how the values are set, that’s a can of
worms we’ll save for another article.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.190
So we’ll instead end by throwing some interesting
counter-intuitive road related factoids at

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.190
you.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.720
For starters, one of the most popular speed
controlling inventions of all, speed bumps,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.200
kills numerous people every year by slowing
emergency vehicles, according to the Chairman

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.200
of the London Ambulance Service, Sigurd Reinton.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.890
This is a notion backed up by a study in Boulder,
Colorado that indicated that for every life

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.350
saved by various traffic slowing measures
like speed bumps, an astounding 85 people

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.702
die because of this slowing effect on emergency
vehicles whether inherently, like in speed

00:05:28.702 --> 00:05:29.702
bumps, or by jamming up traffic.

00:05:29.702 --> 00:05:32.750
In addition to that, according to research
done on the roads of New Zealand, the common

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.700
zebra striped crosswalk, without any additional
signaling, actually increases the chances

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:43.260
of pedestrians getting hit by a car by 28%
over if the person had just jaywalked.

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.260
It is thought this is the case because pedestrians
crossing in crosswalks are much less careful

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.330
than those crossing the road elsewhere, even
to the point that many people observed in

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.800
the study didn’t bother to look if anyone
was coming before entering a crosswalk.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.230
Another study done in the United States on
over a thousand marked and unmarked popular

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.230
crossing areas also showed that marked locations
had a much higher rate of pedestrian accidents

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.600
than unmarked so long as there weren’t any
other signals included with the crosswalk,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.410
such as a stop sign/light or flashing lights.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.680
They also found that including a raised “safety”
median for pedestrians to stand in the middle

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.990
of roads made no difference to the safety
of the pedestrians regardless of the number

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:52.930
of lanes on 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.310
the road.
