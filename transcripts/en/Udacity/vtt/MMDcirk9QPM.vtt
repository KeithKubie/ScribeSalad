00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this next quiz I'd like you to extend your software to print out the optimal policy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That's happened over here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If we look at the grid, there's an obstacle over here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There's a T-shaped obstacle over here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The goal is in the bottom right corner.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Obviously to get the goal, over here you want to go down

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
as indicated by these v's over here--down, down, down, down, down.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Up here you'll want to go either right or down.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Down here, in this little dead end, you want to go left, left, then up, and then right again

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
into this passage over here, up again over here, right, and down, down, down.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The optimal policy is ambiguous.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Sometimes there are multiple optimal actions.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For example, up here you go right or down.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
For other places like the ones over here, it's not ambiguous.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There's only one optimal thing to do, which is going down.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I want you to write code that outputs this policy,

00:00:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which is in many ways very similar to the path output by A-star.
