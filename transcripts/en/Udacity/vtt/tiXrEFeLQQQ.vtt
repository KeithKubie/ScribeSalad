00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.680
Now, say that I wanted to write my data to

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.580
a new CSV file that included my new height plus

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.080
weight column. Again, this is a simple one-line process using

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.240
Pandas. I can simply call the data frame objects to

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.220
CSV method, and provide as an argument the file name

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.120
of the file I wish to write to. In this

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.440
case, baseball data with weight height dot CSV. There are

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.450
a number of optional keyword arguments I could provide here beyond

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.080
the file name. For example, if I wanted to use

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.890
a separator besides a comma, if I wanted to specify

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.870
how to handle missing values, et cetera. You should check

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.110
out the panda's documentation if you'd like to learn more.
