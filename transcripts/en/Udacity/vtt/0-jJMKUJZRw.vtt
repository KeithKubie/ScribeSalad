00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.860
So, to apply policing to Token Buckets,

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.320
what's often done is to use what's called

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.960
a Composite Shaper, which is to combine a

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.890
Token Bucket Shaper with a Leaky Bucket. The

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.960
combination of the Token Bucket Shaper with

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.970
the Leaky Bucket Shaper allows for Good policing,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.960
confirming that the flow's data rate does not

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.500
exceed the average data rate allowed by the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.680
smooth Leaky Bucket is easy. But, the

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.600
implementation is more complex since each flow

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.650
now requires two counters and two timers.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.620
One timer and one counter for each bucket.
