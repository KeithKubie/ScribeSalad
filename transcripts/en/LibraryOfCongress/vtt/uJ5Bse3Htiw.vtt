00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:11.110
Welcome to the National
Book Festival.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.320
How are you guys this morning?

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.620

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.920
All right!

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.990
All day here at the
Library Congress,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.340
Library of Congress
National Book Festival,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.720
we are recognizing and
celebrating the importance

The Library of Congress makes it
seem easy to do this every year.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.800
But the truth is, the
National Book Festival is a

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.100
huge undertaking.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.430

And now onto the main event.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.930
But let me first introduce
who you're all waiting to see.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.490
Brendan Wenzel is an author
and illustrator from New York

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.790
who has a great affection

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.090
for all things furry,
scaly and feathered.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.390
He's traveled the
jungles and savannas

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.690
and other really cool places in
search of fascinating animals,

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.990
and has teamed up
with different groups,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.290
working to preserve wild
places and creatures

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.590
from around the world.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.890
His debut picture book,
They All Saw a Cat,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.190
was a New York Times bestseller,
and was the recipient

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.490
of the 2017 Caldecott Honor.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.790
But today we're going to talk
about his new book, Hello Hello,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.090
which introduces us to
92 different animals,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.390
many of which are
endangered and threatened.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.690
Just so you know,
after his presentation,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.990
he's going to be signing in
line 20 from 10:30 to 11:30.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.790
Please welcome Brendan Wenzel.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.790
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel: Thank you.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.270
Thank you for coming
out so early.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.870
I'm just going to throw
on my [inaudible].

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.820
How's everybody doing?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.210
[ Applause ]

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.050
All right, let's see,
can everybody hear me?

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.350
All right, hello?

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.560
Oh, I know it's early, but
we can do better than that.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.860
Let's try this.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.160
Hello hello.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.660
&gt;&gt; Hello hello.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.350
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel: Hola!

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.650
&gt;&gt; Hola!

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.950
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel: Allo.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.250
&gt;&gt; Allo.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.550
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel: Xin chao.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.850
&gt;&gt; Xin chao.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.150
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel: All right,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.450
anyone want to give
this one a try?

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.040
[ Background noises ]

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.500
That's actually how
elephants say hello.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.240
All right, so who
am I, and why am I

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.120
up here saying hello
to everybody?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.920
Well, I'm saying hello
because hello is one

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.320
of my favorite words.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.610
No matter what language
you're speaking, hello is kind

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.910
of where we begin, right?

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.990
It's the very first
thing we say to someone.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.330
It's our way of connecting
with another person,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.550
right, or another animal.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.040
And so who am I?

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.190
My name is Brendan Wenzel, and I
am an illustrator and an author.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.980
And illustrator means that
I draw pictures for books,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.000
and an author means
that I write the words.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.680
So these are some of the
books that I've created

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.950
over the past few years up here.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.250
[ Applause ]

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.550
My most-- well, thank you.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.540
Wow. My most recent book,
however, is called Hello Hello,

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.180
and it's all about animals
from across the world,

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.320
some of my favorites,
and how they relate

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.660
to one another, how
they connect.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.810
But I'm going to tell you a
little bit about this book.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.490
But before I do, I would
love to tell you a little bit

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.940
about myself and my work
and some of the experiences

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.300
that have shaped my artwork.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.130
So I've always had these
two things that I've loved.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.100
I call them the two As.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.890
These are animals, and
the other one is art.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.380
These have been the
things I've loved

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.720
since I was a really,
really little kid.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.920
Just to prove it to you,
here's a photo of me when I was

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.560
about 10 years old, and I'm
kind of wearing this kind

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.750
of Indiana Jonesish outfit
that I cobbled together

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.480
from my parents' wardrobe.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.910
And I'm at my favorite place in
the entire world at that time,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.730
the Bronx Zoo in New York City.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.240
It's actually still one
of my favorite places.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.060
And I'm staring off
at a lion here.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.100
And but maybe what's more
important is what's surrounding

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.120
me, what's surrounding
this photo,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.010
because these are all the books
that shaped how I saw the world

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.140
when I was a kid, and they
shaped how I saw animals,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.000
my favorite subject.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.970
These books taught me that
animals were fascinating

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.790
and beautiful creatures.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.090
These books taught me

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.650
that animals were
extraordinary creatures.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.310
These books taught me that
animals were funny and kind

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.500
of charming creatures.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.700
These books taught me that
animals were individuals, right,

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.000
animals had their own
character, and each was unique.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.750
And what these books
showed me as a whole is

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.790
that animals had really, really
interesting stories to tell us,

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.470
really important stories,
and that we needed to listen.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.890
So when I first started making
my own stories, they were also--

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.910
whoa, got ahead of myself.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.130
There was another kind of book
that I loved when I was a kid,

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.320
and these were not storybooks,
but they told a kind of story.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.940
These books are called
field guides.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.780
Has anyone heard
this term before?

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.290
Who's heard the term
field guide?

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:56.900
Okay, great, a few of you.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.570
So field guides are one of
my favorite type of books.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.310
Field guides tell the
story of one area.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.430
They tell the story of all the
animals that live in that area.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.360
And when I look at the page of
a field guide, it enabled me

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.420
to see all the creatures
that lived around my house

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.280
in Connecticut, and the
ways that they were similar,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.460
but also all the incredible
ways that they were different,

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.260
all the things that they-- all
the shapes and sizes and forms

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.500
that the animal kingdom
has taken.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.840
And when I was a kid,
what I would love

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.430
to do is spread all my field
guides out on the floor.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.280
And when I would look at all of
these field guides side by side

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.280
and I would see all
these animals,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.820
I would get this feeling of
wonder, because I would think

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.730
about how vast and exciting
the natural world is.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.320
So when I first started
to make books,

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.980
those books were about animals.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.960
My very first book
was about animals.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.500
It was called The Frog.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.550
And I worked on this when
I was in first grade.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.960
The second book that I made
was also about animals.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.340
This book was called
Land of the Little.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.810
And Land of the Little
was about baby animals.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.510
And I didn't know a lot about
baby animals at the time.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.250
And so I did what you do
when you start a book.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.550
I did research.

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.270
And to do my research, I wrote
a letter to my favorite place

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.040
in the entire world, the
Bronx Zoo, and I said,

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.630
"Dear Bronx Zoo, my
name is Brendan Wenzel.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.300
I go to John Lyman School,
I am eight years old.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.200
I am studying baby animals."

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.650
I thought the Bronx Zoo could
give me some helpful information

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.090
for my project.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.570
And the Bronx Zoo
actually wrote me back,

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.140
which was really exciting for
me, and they gave me two really,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.030
really helpful pieces of advice.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.630
They said, if you're
starting a project,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.550
there's two great places to go.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.170
One, your school library,
the library at your school.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.800
And number two, your
local library.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.490
And this is still advice
that I follow today.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.370
And this is what I tell young
authors when they want to start.

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.310
I say, "there's no
better place to start

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.000
than your local library."

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.470
So I kept drawing
animals, and I drew animals

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.590
when I was in middle school.

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.040
I drew animals when I went
to art school, which is one

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.470
of the places you
can go in you want

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.960
to become a professional
illustrator.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.550
I drew space animals
in art school,

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.280
but they were still animals.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.210
And now as an adult, I'm really
lucky, and I get to travel all

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.780
over the place meeting animals,
like this kea, which is a parrot

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.840
from New Zealand, and these
wild geese in Australia,

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.140
and this little orange
squiggle on my arm.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.970
Does anyone have any idea
what that squiggle is?

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.270
Who knows what that squiggle is?

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.570
What is that squiggle?

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.870
&gt;&gt; A snake?

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.170
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel:
It is a snake.

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:30.830
That is a, that is a little
snake called a whipsnake.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.970
And I am making this
face in the photograph

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.270
because my good friend, Puma,
has just snuck up behind me.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:38.040
Puma is a guide in the jungle.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.530
And he put that snake on my arm
and then told me, "don't worry,

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.720
it's only a little bit
venomous, just a little bit."

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.480
So I'm not too happy
with Puma in this photo.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.300
But I don't just love
looking at animals.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.600
I'm an illustrator.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.660
So what I love to
do is draw animals.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.480
And everywhere I go,
I bring my sketchbook,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:58.040
I bring my sketchbook with me.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.240
Now, does anybody here
keep a sketchbook?

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.790
Does anyone have a sketchbook?

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.950
Okay, a few of you.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:08.490
But I'm going to, I'm going to
make a bold suggestion today

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.990
that everyone here should
try keeping a sketchbook.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.140
And I know, I'm pretty sure what
I'll hear is everyone saying,

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.190
"oh, I don't like to draw, I
don't like the drawings I do."

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.060
And my, my thought is
that it doesn't matter

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.660
if you do the best
drawing you've ever done

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:24.960
in a sketchbook.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.430
So to give you an example,
this is a drawing that I did

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.640
when I was in South Africa,
the country of South Africa.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.740
And if we look at this,
this is a herd of elephants.

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.710
I had woken up early in
the morning and I drove

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.670
out into the savanna,
and this big herd

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:39.610
of elephants crossed
in front of my car.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.540
And you look at this elephant
over here on the left-hand side.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.460
And that looks just as much
kind of like a sack of potatoes

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.910
as it does an elephant, right?

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.210
That's not the best drawing

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:50.960
of a glorious African
elephant you've ever seen.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.540
But the point of
this drawing was not

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.420
to do the best drawing
of elephants.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.850
What I wanted to do was
capture this moment.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.990
And when I look back at
this, at this sketch,

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.740
I can remember everything
about that moment.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:04.520
I remember how the
savanna smelled,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.600
the birds chirping
in the background.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.030
And so a sketchbook can
be this really cool way

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.210
of bringing your ideas and
your memories back with you.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:16.800
It's the same with this cheetah
and this lion and these gibbons

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.240
that I drew in a
country called Thailand.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:22.060
So another cool thing is
if you are an illustrator,

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.880
sometimes one little sketch
you do in your sketchbook goes

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.720
on to become a finished
illustration.

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.780
So this is an animal called
a white-handed gibbon.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.430
And sometimes you do one
illustration like this

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:40.500
and you get so excited
that you do a lot more.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.950
So this is a series of drawings
that I did of animals that live

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.890
in a place called Vietnam
or in southeast Asia,

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.390
way over on the other side of
the world where I actually used

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.320
to live for two years.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.540
And when I did these drawings,
I did them because I wanted

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.550
to learn more about these
animals, because I was

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.960
so excited about them, and I
wanted to share that excitement

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.970
with people around me.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.910
Some of the people I
shared this drawing

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:07.510
with had this really cool job.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.800
And that job is called
wildlife conservationist.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.170
Has anyone heard
this term before?

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:13.520
It's a big term.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.820
Okay, some of you.

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:16.120
So for anybody out there

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.850
who doesn't know what this
means, let me tell you.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:21.420
Okay, so wildlife is just
another word for animals, right?

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.230
Wild animals, animals that
live out in the forest, yeah.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.580
And a conservationist
is someone who wants

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:29.680
to conserve something
or protect it, right?

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.710
So wildlife conservationists,
in my mind,

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:34.390
are kind of like superheroes.

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:36.140
They're like superheroes
for animals.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:37.440
At least that's how I feel.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.170
And I think the animals
would probably feel that way

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:41.990
if they understood
what was happening.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:45.810
So when I showed my drawing
to wildlife conservationists,

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.250
they said, "hey, you seem

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:49.610
like you're really excited
about these animals.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:51.700
We are also really
excited about them.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.670
And a big part of our job is

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:56.710
to get other people
excited about animals."

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.050
So they said, "why
don't we team up and try

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.210
to make some work together to
get other people enthusiastic

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.070
about all these cool
creatures that we love?"

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:07.190
And so I've been really
lucky, and I've gotten to work

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.260
with real-life wildlife
conservationists

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.250
on all kinds of projects.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.330
On stickers, in books,
on T-shirts, on posters.

00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:19.980
But one of my favorite
things I've done is this map

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.990
of a country called Cambodia.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.030
Now, the country of
Cambodia is right next

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.030
to where I used to
live in Vietnam.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:30.020
And the folks that I made
this map with, and I wanted

00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:33.830
to show people all these
beautiful green parks

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.330
that you can find throughout
the country of Cambodia,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:37.800
because what we wanted
is for people

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.710
to be excited about
these places.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.610
Because when you're
excited about something,

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.300
you want to protect it, right?

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.670
Another cool thing about this
map was that I worked on it

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:51.210
with a group called The
Wildlife Conservation Society.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:55.120
Now, The Wildlife Conservation
Society has another project

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.710
that they work on.

00:11:56.710 --> 00:12:00.850
And that is the Bronx
Zoo in New York City.

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:03.240
So a few years ago, I
actually got to team

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:07.290
up with the Bronx Zoo and
help redesign their brand new

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:08.720
children's zoo.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.020
So this is the sketch that
they originally sent me

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.050
of what they wanted to create.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:17.410
And then in 2015, I got to walk
through the front entranceway--

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.530
this is the zoo on opening day--

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:25.960
of the Bronx Zoo surrounded by
my images, and to know that my,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.990
my loves and my interest in art
and animals had come together

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.570
and helped me contribute to
this place that I've loved

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.160
since I was a little kid.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:38.120
It was just one of the
coolest experiences of my life.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.360
Another great thing about this
project was that the designers,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.670
Jen, Sara and Kimeo
[phonetic], wanted the viewer,

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:46.900
wanted the person
coming to the zoo to feel

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.920
like they were walking
into a picture book.

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.410
They wanted you to feel like
you were in a storybook.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.590
Because they wanted you to
connect with these animals

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.360
in a way that you wouldn't if
you were just watching them walk

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.660
through their enclosure,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.900
which in itself is a
pretty cool experience.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:03.280
But this was a great question
for me to think about,

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.900
because I think for someone
like myself who loves animals

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.250
and who loves art, this
question is at the heart

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.110
of what I want to
do with my work.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:14.930
How can I take my feelings
about animals, my excitement

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.760
and my enthusiasm, and
share it with all of you?

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.430
How can I get you
excited about animals?

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.010
And this is why I feel
so lucky that I get

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.970
to make picture books.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.930
My first book, They
All Saw a Cat,

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.950
was all about how animals see.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:32.070
It's all about how animals
see this one thing, this cat,

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:36.920
this little brown cat with a red
collar, and how all these things

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:42.540
like location and
emotion and physiology,

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.400
how our actual bodies
work, how our eyes work,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.230
can all change how we see
the same subject matter.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.600
So a few, like a few years
ago, I started walking

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.180
around my studio, and I knew I
wanted to write another book,

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.200
and I knew I wanted to share
my excitement for animals.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.370
And so I thought about, I
thought about being a kid,

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:04.470
and I thought, what got
me really interested

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:06.910
in animals when I was a kid?

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.610
And I thought about spreading
all my field guides out.

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.240
And that feeling of
wonder I would get

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.000
when I would look
at field guides.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.300
And so I started drawing
in my sketchbook, right,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.030
because that's what I do.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.600
But I didn't want to draw
all animals from one area.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.120
I wanted to draw all
my favorite animals.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.470
So I started with a zebra,
a black and white zebra.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.550
And then I drew a
black and white eel.

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:29.680
And then I draw a
black and white fish.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.260
And then I said, "okay, I don't
want to draw any more animals

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:33.950
with black and white stripes."

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.390
So I drew a fish
with the same shape.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.050
So I had a black and white
fish and a yellow fish,

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.830
but they had that same shape.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:42.850
And I started thinking
about all the other ways

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.490
that animals could
connect, and the sequence

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:50.070
of animals got longer
and longer,

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.710
and then it got really long,
and then it just spread out all

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:55.690
over the page and branched out.

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:57.920
And I eventually wrote
at the top of the page,

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.610
animal relationship
super sequence.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.630
This was every animal
that I could think of

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.160
and how they related
to one another.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.080
But I thought, if I
make this into a book,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.730
I'm going to be working
on this book

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:10.310
for the next thousand years.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.090
And it would probably take
a hundred years to read it.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.450
So I narrowed my
sequence down to this,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.060
and I had this super
line of animals.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:20.910
But they were all
these different animals

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:22.210
that they all related.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:23.510
So let's try this.

00:15:23.510 --> 00:15:26.250
So here we have this, this
little line from my sketchbook.

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:27.940
We've got a leopard
and we've got a fish.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:29.650
What do they have in common?

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:30.950
&gt;&gt; Spots!

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.250
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel:
Exactly, spots.

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.550
We've got this frog
and this duck.

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.850
What do they have in common?

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.150
They both have?

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:37.450
&gt;&gt; Webbed feet!

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:38.750
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel:
Webbed feet, exactly.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.050
And then we've got that
duck and a platypus.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.810
What do a duck and a
platypus have in common?

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.110
&gt;&gt; A bill!

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.410
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel:
A bill, exactly.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.220
So I was really excited
by this idea.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.630
But the one thing I
didn't have is something

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.140
to tie this whole book together.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.040
What was one thing that was
happening on every page?

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.090
And then I thought about my
favorite word, hello, right?

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.180
Because hello is what
we say when we want

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:00.480
to connect with someone.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.740
It's that first moment
of connection.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.900
And this became the
book Hello Hello.

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.650
And so Hello Hello is
all about connections.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.770
It's all about how animals
relate to one another

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.350
and how they relate to us.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.460
I'm not going to read Hello
Hello with you here today

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:19.650
because I want to tell you
about a secret mission I had

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:21.860
with this book that not a
lot of people know about.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.360
But I'm going to
tell you about it.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.020
So if you flip through
Hello Hello, you'll start

00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.930
by seeing a lot of animals
you recognize, right?

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.920
We've got a black bear,
a panda bear, a zebra.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.920
Most people know these animals.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.450
But if you keep moving
throughout the book,

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.290
you start to see animals that
might not be quite as familiar.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.940
You've got a tiger and a cheetah
are probably pretty familiar.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.360
But then we've got
a whale shark.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.610
And then on this page, we've
got a monkey called a proboscis

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.580
monkey, and an animal
called a Senegal galago

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:53.900
with these big ears.

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.050
We've got an aardvark.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:57.350
And what I wanted to do

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:00.770
with Hello Hello is introduce
my readers to some animals

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.570
that I think are really cool,

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:04.490
but that I don't think
get enough attention.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.570
I wanted to shine a
spotlight on them.

00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:10.580
I'm not through writing the
whole book, but I did want

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.540
to show you the last page.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.430
This is the closest
thing I could get

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.090
to my animal relationship
super sequence.

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.190
It's one of the final
pages in this book.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.540
And what I hope the reader
feels when they look at it is

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.690
that same sense of wonder that
I would feel when I would look

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.840
at field guides as a kid.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.020
I wanted them to think
about all the different ways

00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.650
that animals connect, and how
beautiful and biodiverse life

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.210
on our planet is, how many
different shapes and sizes

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.150
and colors it's taken.

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.970
There were a few more pages that
I thought were really important

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:42.680
to include in this book.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.780
And that was a way
that people can figure

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.380
out what these animals are.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:50.170
Because ultimately, ultimately,
my goal for this book is for you

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.710
to close it and want to learn
more about all the animals

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:55.170
that I wrote about here.

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.300
And so what I wanted to do
is let you have a tool to go

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:00.910
to the library, pick up
a book and learn more.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.470
Because these are all
really, really cool animals.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:04.770
And just to prove that,

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.990
I'm going to tell you a
little bit more about one

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.600
of my absolute favorites.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:10.470
This is the animal
from the cover,

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.710
and it's called a
Sunda pangolin.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:14.700
It's kind of peeking
out at you here.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.620
So a Sunda pangolin is
covered in these hard scales,

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.150
but they're actually
not a reptile.

00:18:19.150 --> 00:18:21.530
They're a mammal
just like you and I.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.610
Sunda pangolins are about
the size of a house cat,

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:27.040
and they live all the way on
the other side of the world

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.140
in southeast Asia
where I used to live.

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:32.710
So Sunda pangolins are
fascinating animals

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.190
for tons of reasons.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.190
They have this cool
prehensile tail,

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:38.380
which they can use
to climb up in trees.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:39.920
It's kind of like
some species of monkey

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:42.020
that can actually grab branches.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.990
Sunda pangolins, they have these
two big strong powerful claws,

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:47.750
and they dig down in the dirt
looking for their favorite food.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.700
Who has a guess as what a
pangolin's favorite food is?

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.990
What do you think?

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:54.290
&gt;&gt; Bugs?

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:55.590
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel: Bugs.

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:56.890
It is bugs.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:58.190
It's a very specific
kind of bug.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:59.490
What do we think right here?

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:00.790
&gt;&gt; Ants.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.090
&gt;&gt; Brendan Wenzel: Exactly!

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:03.390
They love ants.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.690
They love ants and termites.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:05.990
And when Sunda pangolins
find ants and termites,

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.110
they use this long sticky tongue
to just slurp them right up just

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.670
like you slurp up
cake and pizza.

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.970
There is some bad news, though.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.730
I have a little bit of bad news.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:18.210
Sunda pangolins are actually
hunted for their scales.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.200
And this means that they are one
of the most endangered animals

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.480
on planet Earth right now,
which is really, really sad.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.800
They're critically endangered,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.770
which is the most
endangered an animal can be.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:30.790
But there's also good news.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.970
And that good news
is these two folks.

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:35.920
This is T and M, my
friends from Thailand,

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.490
they're real-life
wildlife conservationists,

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.140
and they're doing
important work,

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.360
protecting pangolin habitat,
doing field monitoring,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.340
trying to figure out how
many pangolins are actually

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.640
in the wild.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.760
And maybe some of the most
important work they're doing is

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:53.660
educating people, sharing
their excitement for pangolin.

00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:56.040
So I was actually
able to go this year

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.850
and help them teach people
about pangolin through my art

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.190
in Thailand, which was a
really fun experience for me.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.520
So why do we, why do we want
to protect pangolin, right,

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:10.090
this one species of animal on
the other side of the world,

00:20:10.090 --> 00:20:11.390
this one little animal?

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.430
I mean, they're fascinating
and they're beautiful,

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:15.050
and I think that
should be enough.

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.870
But in case you're not sold
on that, think about this.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.610
When you protect one pangolin,

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.300
if you protect just one
individual pangolin,

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.300
you have to protect
its home, right?

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:26.770
You've got to protect
the place that it lives.

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:29.540
And if you protect the place
that it lives, its habitat,

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.710
you don't only protect
that pangolin,

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:35.380
but you protect all the animals
that share that ecosystem.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:39.180
So this is why protecting
species is so important.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:43.300
Wildlife conservationists
actually have a name

00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.830
for these really familiar
animals that they use

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.650
to represent one place.

00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:50.090
And these are called
ambassador species,

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:53.030
animals that represent a whole
bunch of different species.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.680
An ambassador is someone who
goes to represent a bunch

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.930
of individuals, right?

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:03.560
So, in Hello Hello, I
included over 90 animals.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.360
There are over 90
animals in this book.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.680
And my secret hope was that
maybe I could introduce people

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.560
to some new potential
ambassador species,

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.220
animals that might help
protect entire places.

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:21.210
And that 90 animals, when
I was working on this book,

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.510
felt like a whole lot.

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.850
This book took me
two years to make.

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.550
But in the scheme of things,

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.890
those animals are just
a drop in the bucket.

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:38.070
We share our planet with 5,416
species of mammal, 6,514 species

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:45.810
of amphibian, 8,734 species of
reptile, 9,990 species of bird,

00:21:45.810 --> 00:21:49.270
31,153 species of fish.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:51.220
And that's only including
the vertebrae,

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:54.130
the animal with backbones
that are most similar to us.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.590
If I include the invertebrates,

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.330
that's over a million
more animals.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:02.540
So if you think about that,
if you're only focusing

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.320
on those animals that
are most similar to us,

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:10.100
that's 60,000 stories that
are waiting to be told, right,

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.060
waiting to be shared,
waiting to be learned.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.820
And this is where-- I've only
got a couple minutes left here--

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:18.910
but I want to ask each and
every one of you for help.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.350
Because on average, I make
about one book every year.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.760
That's as many books
as I can make.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.640
Sometimes two if I'm lucky.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.110
So what I'm asking all of
you is to give me a hand.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:31.610
So however you tell
stories, whether it's

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:35.840
through drawing pictures
or writing or making songs

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.960
or theater or dance,
please tell the world

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.460
about your favorite animals.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.170
Tell them why you
think they're exciting,

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.490
why you think they make
things more fascinating,

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:48.400
more charming, more beautiful.

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.310
And the great news is if
you want to learn more

00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:52.960
about animals, it's
not that tough.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.340
You don't have to go all the way
to the other side of the world.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.060
You can just follow the advice
the Wildlife Conservation

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.600
Society and the Bronx Zoo
gave me many, many years ago.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.660
Go down to your local library,
pick up a book on crocodiles,

00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:10.080
on aardvarks, on nematodes,
and just say hello.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.380
I'm Brendan Wenzel.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:12.680
That's my time.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.980
Thank you very much.

00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:15.320
