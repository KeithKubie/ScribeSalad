00:00:00.338 --> 00:00:03.145
- [Voiceover] Part B, using correct units,

00:00:03.145 --> 00:00:06.186
explain the meaning of
the definite integral,

00:00:06.186 --> 00:00:07.603
so it's definite integral from zero

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:09.518
from T equals zero to T equals 40

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:12.609
of the absolute value of V of T DT

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.664
in the context of the problem.

00:00:14.664 --> 00:00:17.149
Approximate the value of that integral

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:21.108
using a right Riemann sum
with the four subintervals

00:00:21.108 --> 00:00:23.348
indicated in the table.

00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:25.264
All right so let's first
tackle the first part.

00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:28.225
So what's the meaning of
this definite integral?

00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:32.648
So the velocity, velocity is
a vector, it has direction,

00:00:32.648 --> 00:00:34.923
and you can see when you look up here

00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:37.049
that sometimes the velocity is positive

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:39.405
and sometimes it is negative,

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:42.365
and a reasonable interpretation of that

00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:44.722
is well this is when she's
walking in one direction

00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:47.810
and then that's where
whatever direction we assume

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.831
is the positive direction
and this is when she's

00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:51.386
walking the other way,

00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:54.730
and so she has a positive velocity here

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.088
and then she has a negative velocity.

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:58.352
She has some speed in the other direction

00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:01.603
and then she has a
positive velocity again.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.704
So if you were to take the
absolute value of this,

00:01:03.704 --> 00:01:06.607
if you just cared about the
magnitude of the velocity,

00:01:06.607 --> 00:01:08.081
well we're talking about,

00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.323
we're talking about speed,

00:01:10.323 --> 00:01:11.402
but we're not just talking about

00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:13.271
the absolute value of velocity,

00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:16.208
we're integrating the
absolute value of velocity

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.426
over time from time equals zero

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:20.167
to time equals 40.

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:21.885
So if you integrate speed,

00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:23.441
if you're saying okay for every

00:01:23.441 --> 00:01:27.029
for every little amount of time DT

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:28.991
she has some speed,

00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:31.684
well that's going to give you
the distance that she travels.

00:01:31.684 --> 00:01:33.971
So the distance remember,
is the difference

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:35.806
between distance and displacement

00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:38.824
is displacement you can
think of as the net distance

00:01:38.824 --> 00:01:41.483
it takes if you go back
and forth a bunch of times

00:01:41.483 --> 00:01:43.062
it's going to add up to the distance,

00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:45.465
but they're going to net out
with respect to each other

00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:46.591
in displacement.

00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:49.389
So this right over is going
to give us the total distance,

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:54.389
not displacement, that she
travels over those 40 minutes.

00:01:54.893 --> 00:01:57.168
If there was no absolute value sign here

00:01:57.168 --> 00:01:59.548
then we'd be talking
about the displacement

00:01:59.548 --> 00:02:01.522
and so let me write that.

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:03.867
So this integral from zero to 40

00:02:03.867 --> 00:02:07.350
absolute value V of T DT

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.350
is the total distance

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.963
distance she travels

00:02:16.963 --> 00:02:18.328
she travels

00:02:19.483 --> 00:02:21.062
over the 40 minutes

00:02:21.062 --> 00:02:25.649
over the 40, over the 40 minutes,

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:29.144
remember our unit of
time here is in minutes.

00:02:29.144 --> 00:02:30.466
All right.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:34.007
So using correct units and so this is

00:02:34.007 --> 00:02:35.528
and so the units,

00:02:35.528 --> 00:02:37.143
let me write it this way.

00:02:37.143 --> 00:02:38.663
Is a total distance she travels

00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:40.021
over the 40 minutes.

00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:42.841
The units are meters.

00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.710
The units are meters,

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.810
are meters.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.949
All right,

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.329
now this says approximate
the value of that integral

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.044
using a right Riemann sum

00:02:55.044 --> 00:02:57.865
with the four subintervals
indicated in the table.

00:02:57.865 --> 00:03:01.011
So what do they mean
by a right Riemann sum?

00:03:01.011 --> 00:03:03.431
Well actually, let me
just, let me just draw,

00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.236
let me draw the absolute
value of the V of T

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:08.291
and I already took the
trouble of the last part

00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:09.963
of drawing the axis and
you wouldn't actually

00:03:09.963 --> 00:03:10.926
have to do this on the test,

00:03:10.926 --> 00:03:12.703
but I'm doing this to just help you

00:03:12.703 --> 00:03:15.466
understand what we're actually going to do

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:17.927
when we talk about a right Riemann sum.

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:21.909
So if we, so in orange I have V of T,

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.397
but if I want to do the
absolute value of V of T,

00:03:24.397 --> 00:03:25.720
I'll do that in magenta,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.125
so the absolute value of that is that,

00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:28.588
absolute value of that is that,

00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:30.028
absolute value of that is that,

00:03:30.028 --> 00:03:35.028
absolute value of negative 220
is going to be positive 220.

00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:37.319
So we saw here when time,

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.266
when T is equal to 24
V of T is negative 220,

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:42.938
she's running in the opposite direction

00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:44.598
or jogging on the other direction,

00:03:44.598 --> 00:03:46.885
but we're going to take
the absolute value of that.

00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:51.657
So when T is equal to 24,

00:03:51.657 --> 00:03:56.354
her speed, we could
say, is going to be 220,

00:03:56.354 --> 00:03:58.375
we're going to take the
absolute value of it.

00:03:58.375 --> 00:04:01.186
So it's going to be right around,

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:02.730
right around there

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.763
and then the absolute value of this

00:04:03.763 --> 00:04:05.563
is going to be that point again

00:04:05.563 --> 00:04:08.442
and so we don't know the
actual velocity function.

00:04:08.442 --> 00:04:10.126
The actual velocity
function, I don't know,

00:04:10.126 --> 00:04:11.867
it might look something like,

00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:15.803
it might look something like, like this.

00:04:15.803 --> 00:04:18.392
It goes like that, maybe it dips down.

00:04:18.392 --> 00:04:20.133
I should say the speed function.

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:22.409
We don't know the actual speed function.

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:26.333
So this is the absolute value of V of T,

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:28.969
which is the speed function you could say.

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:33.427
Speed, speed function,

00:04:33.427 --> 00:04:35.505
and so if we wanted to
actually integrate it,

00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:36.945
so if we wanted to integrate it,

00:04:36.945 --> 00:04:38.265
well we don't know how to do it

00:04:38.265 --> 00:04:39.426
if we don't know,

00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:40.762
we don't know how to do it exactly

00:04:40.762 --> 00:04:42.770
without knowing the exact function,

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.926
but we can approximate what
the integral is going to be

00:04:46.926 --> 00:04:48.726
with a right Riemann sum

00:04:48.726 --> 00:04:51.269
and a Riemann sum is just
breaking up this area

00:04:51.269 --> 00:04:54.067
into rectangles and then
finding the total area

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:55.448
of those rectangles.

00:04:55.448 --> 00:04:57.329
And then there's a couple
of ways you could do it,

00:04:57.329 --> 00:04:59.187
you could use, you could use

00:04:59.187 --> 00:05:02.368
for each rectangle you
could use the left boundary

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:04.249
as the height or you could
use the right boundary

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:05.061
as the height

00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:08.881
and so they tell us to
use a right Riemann sum.

00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:10.286
A right Riemann sum,

00:05:10.286 --> 00:05:12.329
so for each of the rectangles,

00:05:12.329 --> 00:05:13.641
for each of the intervals
we're going to use

00:05:13.641 --> 00:05:16.404
the value of our function
on the right side

00:05:16.404 --> 00:05:18.749
to approximate the area.

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:19.983
So let's do that.

00:05:19.983 --> 00:05:23.060
So let me divide this into four rectangles

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.080
and they give us the four intervals.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.503
So one interval goes
from zero to T equals 12,

00:05:29.503 --> 00:05:30.943
we see that there.

00:05:30.943 --> 00:05:32.157
The other integral goes from 12 to 20,

00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:34.270
the next integral goes from 20 to 24,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.615
the next integral goes from 24 to 40,

00:05:36.615 --> 00:05:38.217
and if the whole notation of a Riemann sum

00:05:38.217 --> 00:05:39.471
is completely foreign to you,

00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:41.677
I encourage you to watch
the videos on Khan Academy

00:05:41.677 --> 00:05:43.513
on Riemann sums.

00:05:43.513 --> 00:05:45.777
And so here we are.

00:05:45.777 --> 00:05:48.435
So the first interval's from zero to 12

00:05:48.435 --> 00:05:50.538
and so we want to use
the value of our function

00:05:50.538 --> 00:05:53.892
on the right side to define
the height of the rectangle.

00:05:53.892 --> 00:05:55.553
So let me define.

00:05:55.553 --> 00:05:57.455
So that rectangle is going to look,

00:05:57.455 --> 00:06:01.356
is going to look like this,

00:06:01.356 --> 00:06:03.597
so that's a rectangle right over there.

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:07.231
Then the next interval goes from 12 to 20.

00:06:07.231 --> 00:06:10.509
The next rectangle goes from 12 to 20,

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:11.775
we see that there.

00:06:11.775 --> 00:06:13.354
From 12 to 20.

00:06:13.354 --> 00:06:15.595
So let's use a value of our function at 20

00:06:15.595 --> 00:06:17.928
to define the height of this rectangle.

00:06:17.928 --> 00:06:20.031
So just like that.

00:06:21.198 --> 00:06:23.763
Look like, let me do it,

00:06:23.763 --> 00:06:24.843
I'll just hand draw that.

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:27.780
It would look like that

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.276
and then the next rectangle goes from

00:06:30.276 --> 00:06:32.737
T equals 20 to T equals 24

00:06:32.737 --> 00:06:35.025
and we want to use the right hand side

00:06:35.025 --> 00:06:37.440
to define the height of that rectangle.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:38.775
You can see it's a little irregular

00:06:38.775 --> 00:06:39.680
and that's okay,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.945
they all don't have to
have the same width.

00:06:41.945 --> 00:06:45.677
So the height is something like this,

00:06:45.677 --> 00:06:50.677
and then the last interval
is T equals 24 to T equals 40

00:06:51.145 --> 00:06:54.768
and so we use the right
side as the height.

00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:55.986
So the interval,

00:06:55.986 --> 00:06:57.472
so this was the last interval we did,

00:06:57.472 --> 00:06:59.991
the next interval is going to be that

00:06:59.991 --> 00:07:02.487
and then the height we
use the right hand side

00:07:02.487 --> 00:07:05.727
to define the height that's
why it's a right Riemann sum

00:07:05.727 --> 00:07:09.546
and so our approximation of the integral

00:07:09.546 --> 00:07:12.321
of the absolute value of V
of T is going to be the area

00:07:12.321 --> 00:07:15.165
of these rectangles over here,

00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:17.996
and so we could write,

00:07:17.996 --> 00:07:22.931
we could write the
integral from zero to 40

00:07:22.931 --> 00:07:27.737
of the absolute value of V of T DT

00:07:27.737 --> 00:07:30.419
is approximately,

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:32.834
well it's going to be
this first change in time

00:07:32.834 --> 00:07:35.692
times this height, so
this first change in time

00:07:35.692 --> 00:07:38.571
this is a change in time of 12 times,

00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:42.101
so it's going to be 12 times,

00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:43.099
what's the height?

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:47.132
Well V of 12 we knew was 200,

00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:49.558
V of 12 is 200.

00:07:49.558 --> 00:07:51.876
So it's going to be 12 times,

00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:56.555
12 times 200 plus,

00:07:56.555 --> 00:07:57.995
okay the height here

00:07:57.995 --> 00:08:00.131
or the next interval goes from 12 to 20,

00:08:00.131 --> 00:08:02.209
so it's going to be eight times

00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:03.881
and then the height here

00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:07.248
is going to be what is V of 20,

00:08:07.248 --> 00:08:11.904
I think that was V of 20 was 240.

00:08:11.904 --> 00:08:16.501
V of 20 was 240,

00:08:16.501 --> 00:08:19.845
and then the next interval
goes from 20 to 24

00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:22.922
so that only has a change in time of four

00:08:22.922 --> 00:08:25.627
and then what is the height at 24?

00:08:25.627 --> 00:08:27.891
The height at 24,

00:08:27.891 --> 00:08:29.864
and remember we took the
absolute value of V of T

00:08:29.864 --> 00:08:31.989
so it's 220.

00:08:31.989 --> 00:08:35.867
So four times 220

00:08:35.867 --> 00:08:37.586
and then our last rectangle,

00:08:37.586 --> 00:08:41.068
our change in time we go from 24 to 40,

00:08:41.068 --> 00:08:43.181
so our change in time is 16

00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:44.601
times the height at 40.

00:08:44.601 --> 00:08:45.263
What was that?

00:08:45.263 --> 00:08:46.683
That was 150 I think.

00:08:46.683 --> 00:08:49.040
Yup, that was a 150.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.501
So times 150.

00:08:51.501 --> 00:08:53.776
150,

00:08:53.776 --> 00:08:55.843
and so, just to make
clear what I just did,

00:08:55.843 --> 00:08:58.095
I'm just adding up the sums of the areas

00:08:58.095 --> 00:08:59.338
of these rectangles.

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:02.902
The area of this
rectangle is 12 times 200,

00:09:02.902 --> 00:09:04.794
area of this rectangle's eight times 240,

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.116
the area of this
rectangle's four times 220,

00:09:07.116 --> 00:09:10.054
area of this rectangle's 16 times 150,

00:09:10.054 --> 00:09:12.017
and then let's see if
we could calculate that,

00:09:12.017 --> 00:09:13.735
we're not allowed to use
our calculator for this part

00:09:13.735 --> 00:09:15.116
so we're going to do it by hand.

00:09:15.116 --> 00:09:18.123
12 times 200 is going to be 2400,

00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:22.302
plus eight times 240,

00:09:22.302 --> 00:09:24.543
that's going to be 1600,

00:09:24.543 --> 00:09:29.543
1600 plus 3200 that is 1920.

00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:30.499
Did I do that right?

00:09:30.499 --> 00:09:32.693
Eight times 40 is 3200,

00:09:32.693 --> 00:09:36.095
or sorry eight times 40 is 320

00:09:36.095 --> 00:09:37.999
plus 1600, yup that's right.

00:09:37.999 --> 00:09:42.004
Plus, this is going to be 880

00:09:42.004 --> 00:09:45.465
plus, let's see 15 times 15

00:09:45.465 --> 00:09:48.715
is going to be, would be 2250

00:09:48.715 --> 00:09:50.793
that would be 15 times 150,

00:09:50.793 --> 00:09:53.138
and so we're going to have another 150

00:09:53.138 --> 00:09:55.623
and so this is going to be 2400.

00:09:55.623 --> 00:10:00.623
2400, whoops, it's 2400.

00:10:01.393 --> 00:10:02.775
Then we want to add all these together,

00:10:02.775 --> 00:10:04.075
let me just do it the way that,

00:10:04.075 --> 00:10:05.619
the easiest way.

00:10:05.619 --> 00:10:10.619
2400, plus 1920, plus 880, plus,

00:10:12.573 --> 00:10:15.244
plus 2400 again,

00:10:15.244 --> 00:10:20.062
plus 2400 again will give us,

00:10:20.062 --> 00:10:23.719
will give us, we get a zero, we get a 10,

00:10:23.719 --> 00:10:27.005
so let's see we have nine plus nine

00:10:27.005 --> 00:10:32.005
is 18, plus eight is 26
and then we have seven.

00:10:34.005 --> 00:10:36.548
So we get 7,600,

00:10:36.548 --> 00:10:41.548
so is equal to 7,600

00:10:42.005 --> 00:10:45.987
and just to be clear,
this would be in meters.

00:10:45.987 --> 00:10:49.226
In, in meters.

00:10:49.226 --> 00:10:50.701
In meters.

00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:51.838
Now you might be saying wait, wait, wait

00:10:51.838 --> 00:10:53.638
didn't we just find an area,

00:10:53.638 --> 00:10:55.960
wouldn't areas be in meters squared?

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.768
But remember, we're finding
the area under the velocity,

00:10:59.768 --> 00:11:01.800
under the velocity graph,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.146
and so if you look at our units,

00:11:03.146 --> 00:11:04.749
say for this rectangle right here

00:11:04.749 --> 00:11:08.499
you're multiplying 12 minutes,

00:11:08.499 --> 00:11:13.003
you're multiplying 12 minutes times 200,

00:11:13.003 --> 00:11:15.488
times 200 meters per minute,

00:11:15.488 --> 00:11:19.087
times 200 meters per minute.

00:11:19.087 --> 00:11:20.364
So when you multiply them out,

00:11:20.364 --> 00:11:21.885
the minutes the cancel with the minutes

00:11:21.885 --> 00:11:25.542
and you're left with 2400 meters.

00:11:25.542 --> 00:11:26.819
So even though it's area,

00:11:26.819 --> 00:11:28.468
if you look at the units,

00:11:28.468 --> 00:11:32.073
it's going to be in
meters not meters squared.
