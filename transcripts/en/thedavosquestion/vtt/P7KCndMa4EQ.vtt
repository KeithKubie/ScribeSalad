00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:08.620
MALE &gt;&gt; Should we have a code of ethics similar
to the ones we find for doctors and lawyers,

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.400
for CEOs? Of course we should! CEOs should
be held accountable just like doctors and

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.200
lawyers. For doctors we have the Hippocratic
oath stemming from Hippocrates in ancient

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.390
Greece. For lawyers we have the bar exam.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.720
MALE 2 &gt;&gt; The Hippocratic oath tells doctors:
First, do no harm. It seems that modern corporate

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.890
executives don't follow 'First, do no harm.'

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.510
FEMALE &gt;&gt; CEOs should not have an ethical
code. This answer may seem odd. It looks like

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.230
the perfect solution since a lot of the current
economic mayhem has been caused by unethical

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.010
actions. But the code is not the answer simply
because we already have one. It's called the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.010
law.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.899
MALE 3 [BACKGROUND CLASSICAL MUSIC] &gt;&gt; It's
probably going to be really hard making a

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.899
code like that since every business is different
and you can't really make everybody follow

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:55.999
the same thing.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.570
MALE 4 &gt;&gt; A common characteristic shared by
doctors and lawyers [TURNS COFFEE MUG PROPS.]

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.080
is that of serving others in society. This
is not directly true for CEOs. [BRINGS ANOTHER

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.410
MUG INTO VIEW.] Their goal is to make money.
So, yes, we do need a code of ethics for CEOs,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.360
but not one like there is for doctors and
lawyers.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.970
MALE 5 [BACKGROUND MUSIC] &gt;&gt; Company executives
should provide the leadership and the example

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.080
for the company. The ethics can be summed
up in one word: integrity.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.980
MALE 6 &gt;&gt; The main issue here is a corporation
is a nonliving entity that has one sole purpose,

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.280
and that's to create money for the owners
and its shareholders.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.160
MALE 7 [OUTSIDE WITH DOGS] &gt;&gt; Maybe what-ah-you
all in Davos can be talking about and discussing

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.910
is probably a little bit better governance,
a little bit better oversight and, dare I

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.560
say, a little bit more regulation. It seems
to me at least on this part of the world that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.400
we have [DOGS RUN FROM RIGHT TO LEFT.] deregulated
ourselves into a great big hole and it's gonna

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.810
be a little while before we get out of it.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.740
MALE 8 &gt;&gt; This oath of business should actually
come from the world economic forum. That again,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.430
I think, is something that-ah-the world economic
forum can convene a group of experts...and

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.380
by world economic forum 2010-ah-for there
to be a press release and executive report

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.349
that would be issued to the public that this
is the oath of business that we have come

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.870
up with and that could be the legacy of the
world economic forum.
