00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.330
On the subject of sizing,
there are some CSS units

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.350
that you may not have heard of, but
which are now really widely supported.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.540
How about if you want an image
to responsively cover the whole

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.210
height of the viewport?

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.890
Now, you can always do that by setting
the height of the image to 100%.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.880
But that only works if
the height of the HTML and

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.156
the body elements are also set to 100%.

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:28.340
A simple way is to use the VH unit,
which stands for viewport height.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.044
One VH unit corresponds to
1% of the viewport height,

00:00:33.044 --> 00:00:37.400
and so 100 VH means 100% height.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.250
You can do the same with VW for
viewport width.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.203
Here you can see we've set
the width of the image to be 100vw,

00:00:46.203 --> 00:00:48.792
100% of the viewport width.

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:52.460
And you can see that it
resizes responsibly.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.640
Another common responsive use case is
when you want an image to resize to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.080
fit the smaller of the height or
the width of the viewport.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.443
The vmin unit, viewport minimum,

00:01:03.443 --> 00:01:08.580
corresponds to 1% of the viewport
width or height, whichever is smaller.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.510
If you set both the width and

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.250
the height to 100vmin,
you'll get the effect you're after.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.330
How about if you want an image
to cover the whole viewport but

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.300
without stretching or squashing?

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.530
For this you can use the vmax unit,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.960
which corresponds to 1% of the viewport
width or height, whichever is greater.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.480
So, if you set both the height and
the width to 100vmax,

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.795
the image responsively resizes
to cover the viewport.
