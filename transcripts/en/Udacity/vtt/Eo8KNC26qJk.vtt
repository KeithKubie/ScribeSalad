00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.620
One of the most aggravating things about input on

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.980
the mobile web platform is the security prompts. One of

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.330
the early challenges of the sensors of the mobile

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.770
web platform was the security sandbox that's inherent in the

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.060
web. Most of the sensors do require permission, but

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.550
you can frequently limit how many times the user is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.490
prompted by using https instead of http. Usually this

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.300
means they'll only get prompted once and the system will

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.420
remember it after that.
